Previously on ER...
Alex, what happened?
No, you can't break and steal things, Alex.
You know that.
Are you sending me to live
with Grandma and Grandpa?
That's who I used to be, it's not who I am anymore.
No, it's okay. It's no big deal.
I won't be a part of this.
Have Crenshaw get me a surgeon who actually wants to operate.
Leaving so soon?
Did your drunk ass hit that kid?
PRATT: Look, you talk about raising K.J. to be honest, right?
My dad's going away, isn't he?
A secret engagement will be fun.
When is the last time you actually went to mass?
That doesn't matter.
It's-it's a tradition.
Not mine.
Churches are beautiful.
A little bit creepy.
(chuckles): I don't hear you making any suggestions.
Well, the only thing I know for sure
is that I don't want it
to even remotely resemble my first wedding.
Okay.
Where was your first wedding?
In his parents' backyard.
You?
A church.
Uh, did you wear tule or taffeta?
(chuckles)
What do you know about tule or taffeta?
You going soft on me?
I read about them online.
Look, tell you what.
Why don't you plan the wedding,
and I'll plan the real important stuff,
like the honeymoon, hmm?
Okay. Yeah?
She needs debridement and IV antibiotics.
Admit to surgery, we'll do it in the OR.
Ma'am, we're gonna admit you
so we can fix these bedsores, okay?
May I present the esteemed Dr. Neela Rasgotra.
Neela, I want you to
say hi to Mae Lee Park.
She's our new surgical med student.
Hi. Nice to meet you.
Heard a lot about you.
Oh, great. All good, I hope.
More or less.
We left out the part about you being our unwanted ER stepchild.
Hi, I'm Ray Barnett. Pleasure.
Mae Lee published a paper with Dr. Zimmer up at UCSF.
I jumped at the opportunity to snap her up.
Anyhow, well, that pretty much
concludes our official tour.
I so appreciate you taking the time.
Well, it's my pleasure.
We should probably get out of here.
I need you to sign off
on my obstructed CF'r.
PARK: I've never seen a transduodenal choledochostomy.
Yeah, me neither.
Sounds cool.
Didn't know we were getting a new sub-i.
Really?
I'm shocked you weren't notified.
You should bring that up at your next plebe rally--
add it to your list of demands.
Allez-y, Neela, vite, vite.
HOPE: Where do you work?
Connie's Cakes.
(chuckles) Place is like Temptation Island.
Cakes as far as the eye can see.
My hips could not cope with that.
You're telling me, sister.
Well, what's the deal with the wedding cakes?
How come they're so expensive?
Saw one that costs $2,000.
Can you really put a price
on the most special day of your life?
Well, what if it sucks?
That's what the tasting's for.
Okay, Hope, what's your plan?
Observe for a couple hours, if no rebound,
home on Benadryl and a three-day course of pred.
Great. And let's write a scrip
for a couple of extra EpiPens, just in case.
Copy that, 23, we'll be ready.
Need you to sign off on my food allergy. Yep.
I need one on my bum-sicle.
Hey, listen up, we got choppers coming in, two minutes out.
Family crashed in the blizzard.
They were trapped in their car for two days.
Devin Paxon, 40, hip fixed
in flexion, probably dislocated.
Pulse 86, BP 90/60, sats good.
EKG, X-rays of pelvis, right hip, femur,
C-spine and chest.
Charlotte, baby, we're okay.
You just be brave.
Come on, talk to me... Everything's okay!
Charlotte, 10. Scalp lac, dehydrated, hypothermic,
but alert.
BP 85 systolic.
Charlotte, we're gonna get you
warmed up and feeling better, okay?
Let's get a Bair Hugger,
heated saline and warm humidified O-2.
WRIGHT: Hey, Dad's definitely more critical.
Julius Paxon, 45,
hypothermic, bradycardic
in the 40s, BP in the 70s.
No sign of major trauma.
All right, EKG monitor, chem panel,
CK, CBC, Foley and a portable chest.
How you doing, Lockhart?
You miss me? Nope.
Can't say that I did.
I marked your initials on the back of all the tags.
I can keep track of my own clothes, you know?
Not you.
I don't know those other kids.
This is really gonna suck.
If you keep saying that, it will.
Come on, they got a good soccer team,
an indoor pool-- huh?
Hey.
It's only a couple hours away.
I'm gonna visit every weekend.
Yeah, like that should help.
(door slams)
Got more saline.
Good. He's lost his shivering response.
Pupils are sluggish but reactive.
They were out there for two days?!
WRIGHT: Trapped in their car after they veered off
the road, skidded into a ditch.
The road they were traveling on,
supposed to be closed for the winter.
Shawnee National Forest.
Shawnee?! That's far.
You were the closest open to trauma.
How we doing over here, Ray? I was driving when the blizzard hit.
We were lost.
I couldn't see.
Okay, hip definitely looks dislocated. CHARLOTTE: Mom!
Dad! Other than that, just cold and a few abrasions.
Pulse is 90, BP's 95 over 60. You have to go and find Spencer.
(screams) Sats are good.
Four more of morphine.
CHARLOTTE: Mom! Dad!
Hope, talk to me.
She's just a little dehydrated. Dad, are you okay?
BP holding at 85 systolic.
All right, doesn't look too bad. How do we proceed?
CBC, C-spine, chest X-ray and a rectal temp.
Good. Make that happen.
Hey, your name is Charlotte, right?
I know it seems scary,
but we're gonna fix you up, okay.
Your mom and your dad, too.
What about Spencer?
Who's Spencer?
Her 14-year-old brother. He's still out there.
What, is he on another chopper?
No, he went to look for help sometime last night.
That's how we found them.
Kid must have set fires close to the location.
We followed the smoke to the family, no sign of the boy.
Please, you have to go and get Spencer.
Sats are dropping, only 83.
Okay, please tell Mr. Morales there are things
that he can buy that won't get stuck up there.
You know, with, like, a wide base or a string attached.
My Spanish definitely ain't that good.
Uh, se√±or, huh?
Esta una salida.
Huh?
No entrada.
No, okay.
Just get me a translator, please.
Hey, Morris, you still use that travel agent?
Angie. Yeah, yeah. She's the best.
You gonna go somewhere?
Oh, I just need to get away from the cold.
I'll get you her number.
Hey, Sam, my ankle guy's still waiting
for his posterior splint.
Do I look like a magician?
It'll be done when it's done, Archie.
You'll be the first to know.
Tread lightly, my friend.
She's been barking since she got here.
I can hear you, Frank.
What, do you want some, too?
Sam. Hey, hey.
Everything okay?
Yeah. I'm fine.
I, uh...
I'm gonna send Alex away...
to a school for at-risk teens.
You know, for emotional problems and stuff.
Might be good.
He's dealt with a lot.
Yeah.
I just can't help but feel like I'm giving up on him.
We both know that's not true.
Yeah.
ZADRO: Little help here.
Mario Dunston, 42.
Single GSW to the left chest.
How are you doing, sir?
Hurts really bad when I breathe.
TAGGART: Pulse ox 92 on five liters.
Tachy at 120, BP 100 palp, had four of MS.
MARIO: How's the other dude?
Got another guy right behind us.
Okay, call X-ray for a portable,
and set me up for a chest tube.
Morris, Trauma Two.
Hey, Dawn.
Donnie Moore, 17, GSW, entrance to the right temple, no exit.
Tubed him for agonal resps.
Donnie? Donnie?
Purposeful hand movement.
Okay, hold CT and an OR.
This guy may have a chance.
Thanks for lending us your truck, Tony.
Yeah. We'll see you later tonight.
I shouldn't be too late.
What are you doing?
Let your grandmother sit in front.
It's fine. Makes me feel like I'm being chauffeured.
GATES: All right.
Be good. Don't steal any paintings.
Don't kill any patients.
I'm allowed one a day.
One.
Okay, curved Kelly.
Hemocue is 14.2.
Need to ask you a few questions, Mario.
I'm a little preoccupied, man.
What kind of beef you got with your Two-Niner buddy?
What you sweating me for?
I ain't do nothing but get shot.
Y'all need to get out there and arrest somebody.
You got anybody in mind?
How should I know?
Y'all the cops.
All right, guys, come on, let us work.
He's not going anywhere.
Thanks.
That was for me, not you.
32 French on a vascular clamp.
How many times you been shot?
This makes eight.
O silk on a driver.
Only 200 cc's out.
Okay, looks like you didn't bag a main vein.
You're one lucky guy.
Yeah, I'm what they call black Irish.
LOCKHART: He's having a lot of ectopy.
QRS is wide.
What's his temp? Down 84.
What's happening?
He's vasodilating, which means the colder blood
from his extremities is lowering his core temp.
Charlotte, honey?
I'm okay, Mom.
That's my good girl.
Don't worry,
they're gonna find your brother.
We're all gonna be okay.
(grunting): I can't get this hip back in place.
PRATT: All right, let me try.
Wait, hold on. Hold on, hold on.
(grunts) All right, I got it.
He's in V-fib. All right, start CPR.
Charge to 200.
Okay.
Charging.
Clear.
No change.
What are they doing?
Your mom's asleep, so they could fix her hip.
And right now, they're trying to help your dad's heart.
LOCKHART: Clear.
Still V-fib.
Charge to 300.
Dad?!
PRATT: All right, Hope,
let's move her out into the hallway.
Come on, Charlotte. We got to let them work.
No, I want to stay.
Dad!
Clear.
No change. One milligram epi.
BARNETT: He can't stay in V-fib for much longer.
Clear.
O'BANNON: Mario Dunston.
Street name's Monster.
Got out of Stateville a few weeks ago.
He's a real O.G., huh?
Did 20 years.
Gang-related shooting, he left a kid paralyzed.
Well, if he remains stable, you guys can talk to him soon.
How's he doing?
Still 250 cc's out.
You collapsed a lung, minor bleeding.
Should take about three days to heal.
The cops need to ask you some questions.
What for? KOVAC: Faster with the compressions, Gates.
DAWN: Wanna switch out? I ain't got any answers.
You just did 20 years.
You cooperate, maybe they'll be lenient.
Lenient?
What they need to be lenient for?
I didn't do nothing. Well, then tell them who did it.
I ain't see who did it.
Oh, you were just an innocent bystander?
GATES: Call neurosurge again. Yeah, okay, Monster.
Suit yourself.
Name's Mario.
DAWN: Epi's in-- atro's ready! Or Mr. Dunston.
Whichever you prefer.
Morris!
What's up?
You need anything?
Nah, I'm straight.
Is he gonna be all right?
I don't know.
MORRIS: Sam!
Could you give us a hand in here, please?
Junior?
Junior!
MORRIS: Hey!
Junior! Hey, lay down!
You're going to pull your chest tube out!
Sam, call security! What the hell are you doing, man?!
Come on! Get security now!
You don't need no security. That's my son!
Junior! Junior!
That's my son.
Junior!
Is he all right?
They found him unconscious at the bottom of some stairs,
not far from where they found you.
Is he all right?
We won't know for sure until he's had a CT.
He took a pretty hard blow to the head.
And you still have absolutely no idea what happened?
GATES: Damn it! V-fib again.
Anything I can do?
KOVAC: Charge to 360. GATES: Come on, Donnie.
Charged.
Blew a pupil. Clear!
Clear. Another amp of epi.
Dr. Gates, why is this patient in brain stem failure?
Multiple hematomas push the uncus across the free edge of the tentorium,
compressing the brain stem,
knocking out his vegetative functions. Charge!
This guy's a goner.
Clear!
Okay, another round. Charge at 360.
Clear!
Okay, that's it.
Clear the room and have Social Work try to contact the family.
Gates, call it.
Time of death, 11:12 a.m.
HOPE: How does it feel?
Throbby. That will go away.
Can I get you anything?
Hot chocolate? Or some Jell-O?
Is my dad gonna die?
You know, there's some great doctors
working very hard right now to make sure that doesn't happen.
You just need to try and think positive thoughts.
You are a tough little girl.
I can tell.
BARNETT: Film looks good, Mrs. Paxon. Your hip is back in place.
Thanks, it feels much better.
Hi, baby. You okay?
She's good.
Mrs. Paxon, we're going to need your consent
for a procedure on your husband.
What? What kind of procedure?
There's a problem with his heart.
Oh, my God.
Charlie, baby, Mommy will be right back.
PRATT: Mrs. Paxon, your husband's heart has stopped from being too cold.
We need to perform what's called a thoracotomy.
What is that?
It's a procedure where we cut open his chest
and then we're going to pour warm water
directly onto his heart.
That sounds dangerous.
Is there another way?
PRATT: It's not a standard procedure,
but it's the fastest way to get his temperature up.
That's why we need consent.
I don't know. I-I...
Maybe we could wait until he wakes up and then we can ask.
Right now, the risk of dying from hypothermia
could probably be greater than the risk of this procedure.
I, I, I can't do this.
Mrs. Paxon...
...we cannot do this without your permission.
What would your husband want?
Is he a fighter?
Yes. Yes, he is.
Then sign the consent.
Hey. Hey there.
I haven't seen you. Yeah, I've been buried.
Yeah, me too. I'm knackered.
Lunch later?
Kovac has me on scut patrol and this board is chock-full.
Maybe after your shift?
Yeah, I'll drive you home. Okay.
Hey, Neela, they need you in Trauma One.
I'm on my way. I'll see you later.
Hey, uh, Angie's number.
I gave her the heads up, she's expecting your call. Thanks, Archie.
Said she has some great family resort hook-ups.
Fun for the gremlin, swimming with dolphins, water slides.
We might not be bringing Gremlin.
Oh, a little kick start
to the old post-partum love life.
I feel you, big guy. All right.
Hey, Frank, I'm going to get my caffeine on
if anybody's looking.
HOPE: Hey, is uh...
Dr. Kovac going on vacation?
Yeah-- little romantic getaway, I guess.
They're getting married, I just know it.
Abby was asking a patient about wedding cakes this morning,
and that little getaway smacks of honeymoon.
Oh, have you met Abby Lockhart?
Not exactly the marrying kind.
We're female-- we're all the marrying kind.
I can smell a wedding a mile away, Archie.
It's like a sixth sense.
Still in v-fib. No pulse. Rib spreader.
All right. Hold ventilation for a minute.
Okay, now...
as the lung deflates, try to feel for the heart.
Okay, I feel it. No effusion.
PRATT: All right, good-- now you can start internal compressions.
MALIK: Got the first 10 liters.
Hey, Pratt.
Hey, Charlotte, how'd you get in here?
The door.
We ready for the saline?
Yeah, go ahead.
Uh, pour in the first liter and get suction ready.
Come on, turn around.
You shouldn't see this.
BARNETT: Okay, the first liter is going in.
What are they doing to my dad?
Pouring warm water on his heart
to help him fight off the cold.
This is all my mom's fault.
You were in an accident, Charlie.
It's nobody's fault.
She was driving and they were fighting.
Well, families fight.
It doesn't mean that...
It's because she cheated.
That's why they're getting a divorce.
Oh, thank goodness.
Sorry-- I came back out and she was gone.
Come on, sweetie, your mom's asking for you.
I want to stay with my dad.
All right. Tell her mom she'll be fine.
It's okay.
I'm here. Where do you need me?
Start internal compressions. Sterile sixes to Neela.
What are you expecting a call?
Spencer.
I keep texting him,
but he hasn't written back yet.
BARNETT: Charge!
Ladies and gentlemen, we have a rhythm and a pulse.
DUBENKO: Is this the father of the family that got rescued?
PRATT: Yeah, tried for 48 hours after an MVA.
Hypothermic to 84 degrees, v-fib arrest,
refractory to shocks.
Why is his chest open?
Bypass wasn't available, so we did a thoracotomy
for a rapid re-warming.
Was that really necessary?
Well, we've got a rhythm back.
DUBENKO: Okay, we'll close him up.
Suction fluids from the chest.
Cover the incisions, so we can take him to the OR.
Don't you want me to scrub in?
No, it won't be necessary.
This is a good teaching case for Mae Lee.
Stay down and finish your consult.
What's going on?
Oh, he wanted to talk to his son,
so I was giving him a few minutes.
Dr. Morris, the police want to know
if they can talk to the boy.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's fine.
Hey, hey, man, what you doing? We ain't finished yet.
Police need to talk to your son. What for?
They found him at the scene.
They think he might be involved.
Hey, don't say nothin', Junior.
Everything's gonna be all right.
Damn, man! Stop calling me that, man!
MORRIS: We still gotta wait for the CT
but, so far, it looks like just a mild concussion.
My guess is he's fine.
So, did he tell you what happened today?
Fell down some stairs.
He fell. That's it.
That's it.
SCANALONI: You're only making this
harder on yourself, you know.
O'BANNON: Give it up, Junior. Come on.
JUNIOR: I told you I don't know nothing!
O'BANNON: 88th Street Bishop on Two-Niner turf--
what were you doing over there, man?
We know you had beef with Donnie.
Hey, where they taking him? JUNIOR: I don't know nothin'.
Up to that CT I told you about.
SCANALONI: Got one of Donnie's homeboys saying
you two had words this morning. JUNIOR: So?
O'BANNON: Heard you guys got pretty hot, got into it.
Why don't they just leave him alone?
Hey, hey, lay down, okay?
Come on, you don't want to pull that chest tube out-- trust me.
Hey, yo, cop! Hey!
I'm in here!
O'BANNON: What do you want?
Y'all want a statement?
Oh, now you're ready to talk.
Yeah, I shot that punk.
Nine milli.
Would've capped his ass again too,
but he got me before I could.
You shot him.
Yeah, that's right.
What, I stutter?
So why don't y'all go on ahead and ask me
your little questions for your little report.
What you wanna know?
We're treating the Paxon family, so have search and rescue
contact us at County if there's any information.
Dr. Lockhart-- L-O-C-K-H-A-R-T.
Didn't find Spencer yet, huh?
Hey, guys, I made a latte run.
I remembered how much you like extra cinnamon, Abby.
I'm gonna put them in the Break Room.
Thank you, Hope. Pratt, you got a minute?
Yeah. Come on, walk with me.
Hey, Pratt, I gotta sign out.
I have a family emergency. Wait-- what?
It's really important-- I'll be back in the morning.
You know, there's always something with that guy.
Hey, so check this out: I got this OG with a GSW.
Just confessed to shooting some kid from a rival gang.
But it doesn't add up. I don't think he did it.
Okay, first he says he had nothing to do with it.
Then he confesses.
I mean, if he did it, why would he confess?
And if he didn't do it, why would he confess?
How would I know? Did you ask him?
Well, I thought maybe you could talk to him.
Did you ask Kovac? Why would I do that?
Uh, let me think. Uh... chief of the ER,
great with people, years of experience.
Yeah, but, you know, this is kind of more in your wheelhouse.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
And exactly what wheelhouse is that?
You want me to talk to this dude because I'm black. Well, yeah.
I mean, you are black, aren't you? That's wrong, Morris.
What?! We do this all the time.
If I had a pregnant girl, I might get Abby.
Big Croatian-- Kovac.
I didn't come to you with my autistic Irish kid.
You could've. You should've.
Hey, what is the big deal?
You know that I love the black man.
You don't want to get into this with me.
Look, I got a black guy from the inner city
confessing to a crime that I don't think he committed.
Okay, last time I checked,
you were a black guy from the inner city.
Forgive me if I thought you could relate on a level I can't.
So you think that just because we both grew up black
and poor, we somehow magically relate.
Well, there's nothing magical about it.
Black isn't just one thing, Morris.
We don't all share some sort of collective consciousness.
I know you may think we all look alike, but we're not.
Thanks for making a coffee run.
Yeah, no problem.
There's sugar there, too.
Oh! Where is my darn stethoscope?
It's the third one I've lost.
I knew it! What?
You're getting married. Am not.
Well, why are you looking at the wedding mags?
Because they're-- they're there.
And why were you asking
all the wedding cake questions earlier?
I was... I was curious.
Okay. Fine.
Look me in the eye and tell me you're not getting married.
No. Why not?
'Cause that's stupid. I...
I am not getting married.
You looked away!
I knew it, I knew it, I knew it!
Oh, God... (gasps)
This one would look so pretty on you.
Okay, listen, Hope, Luka asked if we could just
keep this quiet. It's in your eyes.
You have the glow. I can't wait for the glow.
I can't wait to try on wedding dresses... Hope!
If you tell anyone, I'll kill you.
(giggles)
Do you hear me?
Kill you.
As in dead.
Got it?
What's up, bruh?
Mr. Dunston, I'm Dr. Pratt.
I'm gonna go get his next dose of Ancef.
All right.
Looks like your bleeding has slowed down.
Your lung should heal in a few days with the chest tube.
Yeah, that's what the other dude told me.
Y'all changing shifts?
No, no.
Not exactly.
Just thought maybe you'd want to talk to somebody.
What, you like a shrink?
No.
I'm not a shrink.
But for some reason, Dr. Morris thinks
you didn't commit the crime you confessed to.
Oh!
So this like a black thing.
Hey, excuse me, nurse.
I'm sorry, you might want to step out.
We about to have black man talk. Ain't that right, Doc?
Hey, man, I'm trying to help you.
Hey, go ahead, break it down.
Why don't you tell me what kind of help you think
I need, Doc.
You know what? Forget it.
That's right, we ain't got nothing to talk about.
You don't know me, fool.
No, I don't know you, I know I work on
a parade of dudes just like you every day.
Where you from, Dr. Pratt? Huh?
You one of them North Shore brothers?
Nah. I'm from right here.
55th and Michigan.
So you think 'cause you got your little doctor degree,
you got out the ghetto, you can come back and judge me?
Nobody's judging you.
The mistakes you made are all yours.
That's right. And 20 years I spent paying.
I did my time, brother.
Strip searches, nasty-ass food,
piss when they tell you, take a dump when they tell you.
It's like you didn't even exist.
Everything--
your family, your friends,
your whole life just disappears.
And you still didn't learn a damn thing.
Hey, man, look here, I learned.
Yeah, but you're still banging, right?
I ain't say that.
But, yeah.
(chuckles)
Yeah, I used to bang.
Back in the day, boy, couldn't tell me nothing.
But then my son came.
I gave all that up, man,
years ago.
Now I'm just...
I just get through the day...
trying to raise my boy right...
make up for lost time, you know.
Then how come
your boy is concussed, the other kid is dead,
and you're sitting here with a bullet in your chest?
Mario?
Hey, Mario!
Hey!
When was his last morphine?
Four migs, about an hour ago.
(groans)
All right, we got muffled heart sounds.
Pressure's down, 80/60.
All right, give me the sonosite.
Is there more blood in the thoraseal?
No. Not a drop.
(groans)
All right, squeeze in a liter of saline.
Mario! Mario!
Keith.
Hey, Ton', how you been?
I'm all right. Where is he?
He's over there. You know I wouldn't
have called you unless it was bad.
He started up with one of my customers.
He almost got himself killed.
GATES: How much does he owe?
KEITH: Tony, your pop, he's on a bender, you know.
Most of the time, it's just the weekends, but...
GATES: Yeah, yeah, yeah, I got it.
Mike.
What the hell are you doing here?
Shouldn't you be off
playing doctor with somebody's wife somewhere?
All right, that's enough. Let's go.
Get your hands off me!
That's enough, you're done!
Let's go!
Little Tony.
(laughing)
Can't drain with a catheter.
We'll never get it all out.
This the tamponade?
He's a perfect candidate for a subxiphoid pericardial window.
She's right.
Prep from nipples to umbilicus.
Pressure's only 80 after two units.
All right, he needs to be decompressed now.
Masks and sterile gloves for me and Mae Lee,
30 cc's of one percent lido.
You ever seen
a subxiphoid pericardiostomy?
I've read about them.
Dr. Dubenko, I can...
It's a little crowded in here, Neela-- could you run down
and tell the Paxon family
dad's chest closure went really well.
They can see him in Recovery.
Two of versed. Take the edge off.
MARIO (groggily): What are y'all doing to me?
Uh, we need to
drain some blood caught in the sac around your heart
keeping it from beating normally.
The CT on the Dunston boy
was clear-- no fractures, no bleeding.
PRATT: Okay. MARIO: Is that Junior?
Yeah, he's gonna be fine.
H... Hey.
Take a look at him, make sure.
TAGGART: Versed's going in.
Here you go, Morris.
Hey, man, when y'all gonna let me out of here?
Oh, my bad.
You got someplace to be?
Man, don't worry where I got to be.
Just do your little chart, and let me up out of here.
What, you got a job to go to?
You going to school or something?
(sighs)
Look, you got a mild concussion.
Gonna get out of here today.
It's too bad I can't say the same thing about your pops.
Man, he ain't my pops.
Only time I ever seen that fool was on visiting day.
Yeah, well, looks like you're gonna be visiting him again.
What, you didn't know?
Yeah, man, he's going back in for shooting that Two-Niner.
Hey, Dawn, what was his name again?
Like, Donnie, right?
DAWN: Mm-hmm, Donnie Moore. Right.
Let me tell you something, Junior,
your pops, he ain't no joke.
He told five-oh everything.
Man, he must really want all the credit for this.
Come on, man, you don't have to front for me.
I mean, tell the truth, it's got to be kind of cool, right?
To have a pops like that with that kind of rep.
I mean, look at him,
the man's been shot eight times and he's still here.
Yeah, that's one bad dude right there, Junior.
Look, man, don't call me that, man!
Look, he ain't even do nothing!
I shot that fool!
(chuckles): Yeah, right.
It was me! (chuckles): Yeah, okay.
All right.
Look, yo, five-oh!
Yo, get your ass in here, man!
Look, he ain't do nothing!
He ain't got nothing to do with this.
I shot that fool.
Then this mother...
He tried to stop me, so I shot his ass, too.
And I threw my nine down the garbage chute.
Y'all look, y'all find it, all right?
Look, man, you ain't my father, man!
Look, stay out my life, all right?!
You ain't my father! You a bitch!
The hell you think you're doing?!
Get off me, man! You a bitch, man!
Come on, let's go. No! Get off me!
Get your hands behind your back!
Put him down, put him down.
(Junior grunting)
Grab you a hot chocolate, then go up and see your dad?
You sure you don't want anything?
Oh, no, thanks. I'm fine.
Okay. Why is she so sleepy?
Oh, no, it's just the medicine, sweetie. She's okay.
Pulse 48, BP 75 systolic.
Spencer! He's unresponsive.
HOPE: Oh, my gosh, how did you find him?!
Damndest thing-- they triangulated his cell phone
from text messages someone was sending him.
Spencer, it's okay. It's gonna be okay.
HOPE: I'll go get Dr. Kovac.
LOCKHART: CBC, chem panel,
EKG, CK, warm saline, a Bair Hugger and a portable chest.
Honey, stay out there while we work, okay?
Hi.
Hi.
Hey, I got to go wake up the mom.
Oh, yeah, Dr. Pratt gave her five of versed.
You might want to try Flumazenil. You got it.
Are they gonna cut open Spencer like they did my dad?
No, only if they have to.
I hope they don't have to.
MORRIS: Only 400 cc's
of mediastinal output.
BP is 124/82.
Everything's back to normal.
How about his crit?
Holding steady at 40.
This guy's as tough as nails.
Hey, about earlier...
Ah, no, no, no. Don't sweat it.
I just want you to know you can come to me for help anytime.
Likewise.
All right.
Oh. (chuckles)
All right.
Hey.
Yeah, uh...
not supposed to hang on that long, Morris.
Oh, okay, yeah.
Or that tight.
Oh, yeah. Sorry. (both chuckle)
Peace out, man.
All right.
So it looks like you're good.
No more bleeding in your chest, nothing around your heart.
Those tubes, they stay in a few days.
Could I get something to drink?
Uh, yeah. Water okay?
Just wanted to apologize about
how things went down today.
Don't even trip.
I should be thanking you.
Saved my life, man.
I meant your son.
I mean, you bust your ass trying to protect the ones you love,
try to keep them from making mistakes...
Yeah, and they make them anyway.
Kept telling him to forget it.
Shot that Donnie kid over nothing.
'Cause he looked at him the wrong way.
Kids, man.
Guess you try to hold on to them as long as you can.
Then one day,
got to let go.
And maybe someday they'll come back.
Yeah, maybe.
Hey, good luck to you, man.
Thanks, Doc.
Hopefully, I never see your ass again.
(chuckles)
Hey. They found Spencer Paxon.
Get out of here. How is he?
Not great.
Well, do they need some help in there?
Uh, Kovac and Abby are in there.
You have a good night.
All right.
Asshole slumlord.
You got one week, Mike-- one.
Should've been paying me to live in that dump.
Then you're on your own.
You can stay in my room.
Listen, Ton', I want you to know,
I really appreciate it, Ton'.
I mean, I really do.
You won't even know I'm there.
Hello.
You're home early.
Yeah.
Everyone, this is Mike.
Mike, everyone.
It's a pleasure.
These are the Rileys,
Meg's parents.
Oh.
I'm sorry about your girl.
It's a damn shame.
Oh.
Where's the head?
Over there.
Who is that guy?
That was, uh, my father.
He wasn't feeling so well, so I thought I'd help him out.
Is he okay? Yeah, he's fine.
So,
how many paintings did you steal?
Just one. A lovely Degas.
Yeah, it's a poster.
We're gonna get it framed for my bedroom.
That sounds terrific.
Tony, a minute?
Sure.
Everything okay?
She behave herself?
Yeah, you bet.
Had a great day.
She seems to be handling it well.
Well, she has good days and bad days.
You know, she's a fighter like Meg.
We don't want to disrupt her school year,
we know she's been through a lot.
But we should start
working out the details for the move.
She'll adjust quickly, she's young.
Yeah, well, family's best.
Oh, yeah.
We have six acres,
Yeah. the horses and the good schools.
And we'll want you to visit--
you know, birthdays, Thanksgiving,
you're always welcome.
Oh, thank you. Wisconsin's a great place.
It is.
Hey, Grandpa?
Yeah?
What's up with that secret ingredient?
It's secret now-- remember, don't look.
RASGOTRA: You guys seen Tony?
Uh, he left early.
Gates leave me a message, Frank?
Lemme check.
No.
BARNETT: I'm out of here.
Uh, you leaving?
Yeah.
Hey!
I have info.
About Abby and Luka.
Excuse us, nosy Nellie.
Can you keep a secret?
(whispering): It's confirmed.
The wedding is on.
No way. Wow.
I guess this means I owe you dinner.
Have you ever known Abby to be violent?
Your rescue kid is crashing.
Kovac wants you back in Trauma.
Please, can I go in there?
No, it's not a good idea, sweetie.
Go back and wait with your mom.
She'll be waking up soon.
I won't freak out. I promise. Okay, fine, just wait right there.
What happened?
Runs of V tach. Need you for CPR.
Temp's 86.
Bypass should be available by now.
Let's get the perfusionist down here now!
I'm not cracking his chest.
Excuse me. Mm-hmm.
Hi, I'm, uh, Samantha Taggart.
This is my son, Alex.
Ms. Taggart, we've been expecting you.
Nice to meet you, Alex.
I'm Mrs. Dawson.
Need you to fill this paperwork out.
Okay. Okay.
Ho, yo, Greg, what's up, man? Hey.
How you been?
I'm good. I'm doing good.
All right.
How about you?
How you think?
Yeah.
Stupid-ass question.
It's good to see you, dawg.
Been a long time. Yeah.
Too long. Mmm.
But seriously, I mean...
How you holding up?
(sighs)
It's hard, man.
Waitin' on trial over a year now.
Food sucks.
Mostly, just miss KJ, you know.
Miss seeing him growing up.
Worry about him...
all the time, man.
Then I think about that kid I hit when I was drunk.
His folks.
What I made them go through.
I don't want this for KJ.
I don't want him to end up like me.
And ain't nothing I can do about it in here.
Hey, D, um...
...man, I'm sorry I never wrote you back, man.
So you got my letters.
Yeah, I got them.
Should've visited.
On the real, man, I didn't know what to say.
I just know I hate seeing you in here.
And believe me,
I tried to do everything I could to keep you out of here.
But... Yeah, yo, Greg,
don't even worry about that, man.
All that's on me.
If it hadn't been for you,
I'd probably still be out there drinkin'.
It's all good, baby.
We straight.
You know I'll always be your friend, man.
Thanks for coming.
For real.
Okay, Spencer, can you squeeze my hand?
Come on, Spencer, try to squeeze my hand.
There you go. Good job.
Core temp is 94.
Nice work.
ICU ready for him? Yep.
Is he gonna lose the frostbitten toes?
Three of them don't look salvageable.
Small price to pay.
I'm going to call Pratt.
He worked on the family, I'll tell him the kid's okay.
Hey, do you want to say hi? Can he hear me?
Yeah... yeah, yeah, yeah.
Spence, it's me, Charlie.
You saved us.
You saved us all.
Okay, let's go.
Move back, sweetie.
(sighs)
(phone ringing)
Hello?
Oh, hey, Abby.
Really?
Oh, wow, that's, that's, that's great.
No. No.
No, I appreciate the call.
Thanks for calling.
No, no, no, no, I'm fine.
Really, that's really great news.
I'm just... just tired.
Yeah, it's been a long day.
All right then.
All right.
Good night.
(sighs)
BARNETT: You remember that?
RASGOTRA (laughing): How could I forget?
Okay, yeah, that was, that was a fun night.
That was a fun night.
Oh, God, it seems like a million years ago.
Well, we need to do that again sometime.
Minus the whiskey.
I can't bounce back like I used to. Ooh.
Yeah, tell me about it.
Well, thanks for the ride.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Mm, I'm off.
Okay, then...
I'll see you when I see you.
Neela...
We'll just show you to the room then.
Okay, buddy.
Behave yourself, okay?
I'll see you in a couple of weeks.
Mom, I don't want to stay here.
Come on, it's going to be okay.
Mom, please.
I'll be better. I promise.
Okay. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Hey.
You gotta be brave, okay, baby?
I love you.
Mom, I'm sorry, okay?
Mom, please!
Mom, I'll be better, okay?
Mom, I'm sorry!
I'm sorry. Please.
