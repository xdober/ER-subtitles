Previously on E.R.:
Will you go out with me? Yes!
I'm all yours.
I have two and a half months left to go.
This baby is not coming until then!
Sharp pain, gush of blood. We're going to the OR.
Come on, little guy, give me a cry.
Pulse is less than 60. Let's bag him.
Intubation tray. We can keep waiting for you to clot,
or we can start thinking about a hysterectomy.
Is Dad gonna hurt us?
Now we got to stay together.
The three of us.
I'd rather we were all dead.
(gunshot)
Mom!
(panting)
TAGGART: I'm losing it. I don't...
I can't even drive.
You're the only person I could think of to call.
I don't know.
I'm, uh... somewhere...
close to Waukegan.
There's a Phillip's Diner and, um, a gas station.
Yeah.
Okay, thanks.
Hurry up, okay?
RAAB: All preemies have the same five problems--
infection, hypotension, hypoglycemia,
tachypnea, cyanosis.
Your guy has four out of five.
White count's up.
He's on dopa and dobutamine,
and we're needing higher pressures to ventilate.
KOVAC: How high?
PIPs at 32.
You're pummeling his lungs. He's going to get BPD.
Abby, Luka, listen to me.
It's hard enough being a parent in here.
You're going to have to trust me to do what's best for your son.
Abby?
Any questions?
No. I've been here before.
Do you want me to wheel you back to your room?
You shouldn't stay out of bed that long.
You know, I've given that watch and wait speech
about a hundred times, and never realized
what a load of crap it is.
Well, it's just the reality.
(sighs)
And I can't shut my brain off.
I keep thinking why is the dopa
at 17 and not 20,
and did they check the tube position and...
I can't see his eyes.
I need to know what color they are.
They're blue.
Uh, Neela asked me...
She wants to come and visit.
I don't want any visitors.
I don't want to see anybody.
MAGGIE: Abby! Abby!
Abby! Oh, thank God.
Oh, I came as soon as I heard.
You're not running.
They're going to send me to jail.
For what, killing a scumbag?
He's better off dead.
I was in the car.
I could have driven away.
I went back to kill him.
That's the last time you're ever going to say that.
You hear me?
There's only two people who know it here...
You and me.
You fill out a rape report.
You tell the cops you shot him in self-defense.
You think that'll work?
That's what happened.
Do you understand?
It's what happened.
WEAVER: Serial crits
and foot pulses Q 30 minutes.
Hey, any word on Sam?
The police are still looking for her.
You want the walls eggshell or white?
Do I look like Martha Stewart or the Chief of Staff?
I got real work to do.
What's with her?
I guess she has to pay for the repairs
out of her Christmas bonus.
Oh, Ray. Mm-hmm?
Is this your writing?
Yeah, linebacker from Northwestern,
looks like a rotator cuff.
Come on, man, no MRIs if you've got
a freakin' metal plate in your leg.
The techs going to go over that.
You're lucky I caught this, or it would have been a mess.
I better enjoy myself the next few weeks,
because you're going to be a pain in the ass Attending.
Hey.
Hey. What time is it?
It's time to go home.
You've been here all night.
I should go and check on Abby.
No, you should go and get some rest.
Gallant's parents will probably want to see you today.
No, I'm not going over there.
Neela, go home.
MAN: Dopa's at 17,
mean's hanging around 25,
two out of six systolic ejection murmur on exam.
Translate into English, please?
Hold on, wait, hold, wait. There's a murmur?
Get the echo, let's take a look.
I don't understand any of this.
It's okay, I'll explain it to you later.
Your daughter was a star student when she was here.
Really. She never gives herself any credit.
Well, the good ones never do.
MAGGIE: Is that the heart?
Oh, my gosh, look at that.
It's just beating away, isn't it?
I didn't tell her to come. It's okay.
MAGGIE: Isn't that amazing Are you sure?
how you can see that? I'm sure. She's on her meds.
Neela.
Hi.
I know you can't eat in here,
but maybe you can take a break in the hall?
How's he doing? We don't know.
What about you? I'm okay. MAGGIE: Is this all?
You can see all of the different ventricles
and things of the heart right here?
That is just astonishing.
Who's that? My mother. Look at it go!
We never had things like this... Mom!
Yeah?
Um, you want to meet my friend?
Hi.
Maggie Wyzenski.
Neela Rasgotra. I've heard a lot about you.
Mostly right to left, T-R jet's 3.4.
What are T-R jets?
It's blood flowing the wrong way through the heart.
Couldn't it just be
the pulmonary pressures haven't dropped yet?
Probably elevated from the RDS.
Wait a minute. Wait. Wait, wait, wait.
You're saying there's something wrong with the baby's heart?
We don't know.
Well, what do you mean?
You-you-you're going to fix it.
Well, we can't just fix it.
He's premature. He's going to be here for weeks.
Oh.
All right, then... we'll just wait.
It's all right.
We'll just wait.
James Clivus, 39, fell 20 feet scaling Tribune Tower.
Apparently he gets better reception up there.
Cell phones are just a cover.
What's with the tinfoil?
Well, it amplifies frequency bands
allocated to the U.S. government.
I see.
The Pentagon says it's for communication
with satellites, but that's a lie.
Vitals?
Distal deformity of the right LE.
Hey, Mayday, heard about yesterday.
Glad to see you're okay.
Yeah.
GATES: What's with her?
What?
Her husband was killed in Iraq.
Are you kidding me?
You think we'd joke about that?
We've ceded control to the search engines!
I got to go!
Calm down! Hey, hey! I've got to go!
Hey, you've got to let us check you out!
Don't think I don't know what you mean by that!
Hey, there's Sam.
You got this?
Yeah, I got it.
Hey, honey, are you all right?
Oh, my gosh. Yeah.
Oh, my God.
How did you, how did you get here?
A friend dropped me off.
I need a rape exam.
MAGGIE: So what do you call that thing again?
It's a PICC line.
It allows us to give nutrition
and medicines without sticking the baby.
It's kinking or something.
Oh, oh, wait, maybe you should let Dr. Raab do that.
Uh, will you step back, please?
You're just making it harder for him.
It's okay, you're doing fine.
You don't want students working on your son.
He's a resident, not a student.
What's that?
PVCs. It's the tip of the catheter tickling the heart.
I'm sorry, I'm really sorry,
but you pulled back the line, right?
Of course he did, Abby.
Pulled back the line.
Uh, all right, 2:37...
PVCs...
What's the deal with the notes?
Well, I'm writing everything down
so I can look it up later on.
Last night I was reading about smoking and prematurity.
Do you think... I quit two years ago.
Well, I know you did, but, Abby, you work so hard...
and stress can definitely be a factor...
Are you blaming this on me?
No, of course I'm not blaming you.
I'm not blaming anyone.
I just... my grandson is on a... on a...
Ventilator.
Ventilator, and-and-and I need to understand...
Maggie, she fell.
People were shooting and she fell, okay?
RAAB: Look.
You can ask yourselves why
all day long, but in the end,
the answer doesn't matter.
Miss Lockhart?
Yeah?
Uh, we're about to start a lactation seminar
in the pump room.
Uh, if it's not a good time...
No, sounds great.
I'll go with you. I'll go with you.
Great. Okay.
Here we go.
Great.
Hey, Joe.
(speaking Croatian)
These go between the boob and the tube, know what I mean?
Mm-hmm, it's pretty self-explanatory.
You seem hesitant.
She is.
Breast milk is best for babies.
Oh, she knows that, she's a doctor.
I think I just need a little privacy.
Okay, I'll get you a screen.
She seems nice.
Yeah.
Um... you, too.
What?
I need you to...
Oh, Abby, I've been through all of this before.
I don't think so. Yes.
No, have you had a C-section,
a hysterectomy and a premature baby?
No, I-I haven't but...
I didn't think so.
Abby, look, I can...
Look, I just... I'll meet you outside.
I think that you...
I would like to meet you outside.
All right. Fine.
Fine, I'll meet you outside. Thanks.
They have a boy or a girl?
A boy.
He's in the NICU.
What about Jerry?
He was shot to the chest, but he's pulling through.
Okay, you'll feel a little pressure
while I get the cultures.
Haleh, send off HIV and hepatitis titers.
No problem.
Sam, can I get you some water?
Um, I'm okay, thanks, Haleh.
You know, I knew that he stole TVs
and video equipment, but I just...
I never thought he'd be capable
of anything like this.
It's not your fault.
Yeah, it feels like it.
Well, it's not.
Do you know where Steve and the others are?
Did they catch them?
They're dead.
All of them?
All of them.
Not a good place to take a nap
out here, buddy-- you could drown.
(mumbling)
Track marks everywhere.
No way we're getting a line in.
I'll throw in an EJ. Yeah, right.
Hey, I just spent a month in the ICU, I could do it in my sleep.
Looks like you got a bad batch of heroin there,
knocked you on your ass.
I hate when that happens, don't you?
That's not funny, man.
Say, "Ah."
What the hell is that?
Narcan.
Sublingual?
Are we authorized for that?
What? I can't hear you.
That's not in our scope, man. Shh!
I've got the base on the line. Ho!
County General on alpha one, go ahead.
Teenage male, probably overdose. Just gave Narcan.
Electrocuted juggler, self-inflicted toe amputation,
kerosene ingestion... What-what is this?
People will do anything to stay out of the rain.
We've got three near-drownings from a flooded homeless shelter
and this board hasn't changed in over an hour.
Perfusion sucks, no access. I was thinking an EJ.
No, no, no, Gates, you cannot put in an EJ.
Why not?
Because it's out of your scope of practice, that's why.
Okay, okay, we're ten minutes out.
Yeah, fine, I'll see you then.
What was that?
Unresponsive overdose ten minutes out
with one cocky-ass paramedic.
ER said okay on the EJ.
They did? Yeah.
Hey, they know me there, they trust me.
Unlike my partner.
Look, if you're lying,
I promise you, I'll sell you out.
How's my boy?
He's hanging in there.
I've been reading to him all morning
and I swear to you he recognizes my voice.
The vent wean isn't working,
they had to crank the O2 up to 70.
Take that coat off, Dr. Kovac.
We don't need the nasty
ER bugs in the NICU.
I'm sorry.
Have you two made a decision
about the fludrozalone trial yet?
Yeah. No.
MAGGIE: Flu...
Fludro... flu... What is it?
Fludrozalone. It's a new drug
they're studying for use in persistent hypotension.
Baby Joe is over 1,500 grams.
He's a perfect fit... Perfect fit...
...for your trial-- we know, we know.
We're still...
We're still making a decision.
Spontaneous intestinal perfs, bleeding,
neurodevelopmental delays...
Theoretical risk, Abby.
I don't want to subject our child
to an experimental protocol when we haven't
exhausted all of the standard...
Because he still doesn't have an adequate blood pressure.
Yes, but why just dopamine?
Why not dobutamine and-and an epi infusion?
Don't micromanage. Don't you... I won't.
Don't. Okay.
Okay, why don't I just leave the consent form,
just in case you change your mind?
Excuse me.
She's just trying to give him the best possible chance.
From the second we walked in here
she's been pushing this trial.
Come on, Abby, that's ridiculous.
Is it? Why do you always
have to assume the worst about people?
It's not about me being negative.
It's... I-I'm...
You need to pay attention and wake up.
This is our baby.
Hey.
Luka! Abby.
Can you believe him?
I think... I think he's right.
You don't really know
the first thing about it, so...
Abby, maybe this new drug would turn everything around.
I know it's tough, but I think we have to consider it.
Now sometimes you just have to use your instincts about these things.
Shut up. Shut up!
Please, please, just shut up.
You know, I-I didn't ask you to come here.
I didn't ask you to be involved.
Maybe you should just leave.
Okay.
PRATT: Hey, Dori,
can you find out when the lab runs pertussis assays?
Every day but Tuesday and Sunday.
Whew, what did you do, mug a pimp?
Yeah, your dad says hi.
How are you all surviving without me?
Just fine, hard as it is to believe.
I got six hospitals to add Maxanoxx to their formulary
and now they're sending me to Vegas for the weekend.
Vegas, sweet.
Hey, put a bet down for me.
Hey, Pratt, can you get a consent
for the lid-lac sedation? Sure.
Not until you sign the discharge for Gonorrhea Grandma.
(chuckling): Right.
Need any help?
It's just the usual mess, nothing I can't handle.
Okay, I don't just mean today.
I, uh, I want my job back.
What happened to Vegas?
Vegas?
Do I look like Vegas?
Kinda.
I hate Vegas.
Where's Weaver?
She's been ignoring my calls.
She's busy with some admin crap.
19-year-old male
found down in an alley, probable overdose.
What do we got?
Pulse 84, systolic 86
after a liter into the EJ.
EJ? I told you not to do that.
You're dead.
Aw, come on, it's flowing great.
You ought to thank me. No, I ought to report you!
Dr. Kovac was running the floor when Clemente had his meltdown.
Yes, he was.
And he was here the day that Clemente and his girlfriend
came in with multiple gunshot wounds?
Um, I believe so, I'd have to check the schedule.
Yeah, he was.
And he was there the day that he signed off
on the diabetic whose family is now bringing
a multi-million dollar lawsuit against us.
Donald, where you going with this?
I've drawn up a press release
announcing Dr. Kovac's dismissal.
You're firing him?
There was negligent management here.
Shouldn't we give him a chance to defend himself?
It is too late for that, Kerry.
I'd like everyone to look this over before I send it out.
This sounds right.
Mm-hmm, works for me.
Look, I am the one who hired Dr. Clemente.
But you didn't keep him here.
You even said that you wanted Dr. Kovac to get rid of him,
but he ignored you.
That's not how it happened.
Oh, Dr. Weaver.
Not now.
Uh, rehire me, please. I'm efficient, I'm personable,
I'm a walking encyclopedia.
I said not now.
I'm not trying to toot my own horn, okay?
But had Jerry wound up in the hands of Barnett or Lockhart,
he'd be rapping with Tupac right now.
Morris, I can't help you.
I know I look good in this suit, I know I do.
But I am not an ass- kissing company man.
I'm an ass-kissing ER man and I want my scrubs back!
I said that I can't help you!
Dr. Weaver, please, please, no, no, listen to me.
Oh, my God, listen to me.
Get off the floor, you idiot.
You're embarrassing yourself.
I don't care! I'm desperate! Please!
Stop it!
I can't rehire you
because I am no longer Chief of Staff.
Third of Narcan, still no response.
This isn't an overdose.
I'm going to need a little cricoid here.
I got it.
I wasn't talking to you, Gates.
All right, got it, I'm in. Bag him.
Run of ten, systolic's only 78.
100 of lido, half amp of epi
and 50 of mannitol.
PRATT: Mannitol? He doesn't have a head bleed.
Pratt, we don't know what this is.
Until then, keep your mind open.
Add a gram of ceftriaxone.
You're throwing the kitchen sink at the guy.
V tach, no pulse.
Aww, damn, starting compressions.
The strip looks weird.
Why?
It just doesn't look right, look.
Uh, ST depressions and U waves. He's hypokalemic.
Sam, add 40 of KCL.
All right, charged to 200.
Come on. Clear.
TAGGART: Still V tach.
KOVAC: Resuming.
What about periodic paralysis?
What? TAGGART: Potassium's in.
Yeah, I got it wrong on the boards,
I had to go back and look it up.
It's a total zebra, Gates.
300. Clear. It says something about
being common in Asians.
Treat with beta-blockers, not KCL.
Metoprolol.
May I?
Well, we've got nothing to lose.
All right.
50 migs going in.
The condition could have stopped his breathing.
Okay. Holding compressions.
Back in sinus.
Wow. Periodic paralysis?
Really pulled that one out of your ass.
Sometimes you have to try everything.
Even the kitchen sink, huh?
Pratt, call the ICU.
Stay with him until he gets upstairs.
Yeah.
Dr. Kovac, I need to talk to you!
Not now, Morris.
No, no, it's an emergency.
I mean, not like an emergency-emergency,
but it's-it's important.
Find me later.
I want... I need... I need my job back!
Later!
They didn't have sugar, so I brought the fake stuff.
They don't allow coffee in here.
No one's looking.
(sighs)
You know, um...
when Eric was about three months old,
he got this really terrible strain of pneumonia
and ended up in the ICU.
Do you remember that at all?
You were so little.
His kidneys were shutting down,
and the doctors said he wasn't going to make it.
(sighs): Your father and I fought
because he wanted us all to say good-bye to him.
He even dressed you up
and brought you down to the hospital.
Don't you remember any of that?
Well, I wouldn't stand for it.
I didn't care what the doctors said.
It didn't matter what the doctors said.
I wouldn't give up, I couldn't.
Well, I'm not like you.
I think we've proven that.
Yes, you are. Yes, you are.
Abby, you are like me.
You are like me.
You have to find the strength
to get Joe through this so you can take him home with you.
I don't know if I can.
Oh, Abby, you've spent your whole life
getting strong enough to do this.
KOVAC: Abby? Yeah.
Hey, I...
I... I know the fludrozalone trial scares you,
and trust me, it scares me, too.
But... No, stay.
Sometimes a long shot, you know,
that weird kitchen sink thing,
sometimes, sometimes it really works.
What if something goes wrong?
What if it goes right?
Can't take it back.
I know that.
Okay, let's do it.
I hope you're right.
Day of life: 15.
Day seven of fludrozalone protocol.
Baby's off pressors, weight's up 37 grams.
Excellent.
DC the antibiotics, decrease labs to QOD,
and Baby Joe
is now officially a feeder and a grower.
We'll take that as a compliment.
He's so alert.
Eyes wide open. Yeah.
Wonder what he's thinking.
"Get a life, Mom."
Oh, gee, thanks.
You haven't been out of here
for more than a few hours over the past two weeks.
The two of you, go. Go away for awhile.
I don't know.
I'm here.
That's obnoxious.
Well, the nurses keep yakking.
Well, you could just ask them to stop talking.
Oh, just go. Go on.
Let's take a walk. It'll do us good.
You're leaving her here?
She'll be okay.
Has anyone got any tape?
How far was the gun from him?
About ten inches or so.
It's in the detective's report.
That's funny, because there was no gunshot residue
on Mr. Curtis' body.
In fact, the autopsy shows
that you would've had to have been at least five feet away.
Well, maybe I was further. It's hard to say.
Big difference
between ten inches and five feet, Ms. Taggart.
Mr. Evers, can I call you Byron?
You're a very sharp guy.
You got a bright future ahead of you.
You think your boss is gonna want you chasing your tail now
over a guy who just shot up a hospital
and raped this woman here?
Maybe we should call my boss and ask him.
You think?
'Cause I talked to him just this morning.
In fact, we confirmed our dinner for 7:15.
We go to Gibson's every second Thursday
for the rib eye.
This guy was murdered.
My job is to prosecute the law... We're not talking about
the law here, we're talking about time and money
and how you're wasting both
on a creep who deserved what he got.
Now I'm going to give you this opportunity
to drop this right now on your own, okay?
Or you want me to handle it over a steak and a martini?
Have you looked at the mail?
Nothing too urgent.
You should maybe check the electric bill
'cause the water was cold this morning.
How's it going?
Hey.
It's a little bit better today.
Just get off?
Yeah, I'm exhausted.
I'm going to go and grab some dinner at Ike's
and then go home and crash.
Hang in there.
LOCKHART: You, too.
How's she doing at work?
Seems to be fine.
She still in your place?
Yeah.
She hasn't found anything.
And, you know what, I'm never there.
I should just give it up.
Well, you don't have to make any decisions right now.
I know, but we're a family.
We can't just keep having slumber parties.
Have you thought about what I asked?
I have...
uh... and I haven't.
It's okay.
I'll convince you later.
You know, we have a great life together.
I don't need a ring or a white dress
to prove that I love you.
I'll take love.
We can save marriage for later.
Luka...
I hope she's okay.
Who, Neela?
The NICU nurse.
Your mother was driving her crazy.
(monitor beeping)
Excuse me, something's beeping.
Not anymore.
Well, you didn't even look at him.
Sat wasn't picking up.
It happens all the time.
(monitor beeping)
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Something's wrong.
Dr. Raab needs to take a look.
Ms. Wyzenski, the team's in radiology.
They'll come by when they're done.
Well, that could take hours.
If you overreact to every little blip
and bleep in this place, you'll make yourself crazy.
Page Doctor Raab. What?
Why isn't anyone listening to me? Page Dr. Raab.
Page Dr. Raab. Page Dr. Raab. I'm not supposed to.
His belly's too big, his breathing's too fast.
Maggie, you really need to...
Don't you dare tell me to calm down.
I don't care what Dr. Raab is doing,
she needs to get down here and take care of
my grandson now!
Thank God you're here.
They're putting the tube back in.
He's bradying down to 70s.
Miller 1-3-0.
Mean BP only 24. What happened?
I knew something was wrong, but no one would listen.
Okay. What happened? Bolus 20cc's
and .2 of epi
ready to go. He was blue, Abby.
Okay. Luka?
Free air in the abdomen. He perfed?
Good thing your mom was watching him like a hawk.
Is this because of the fludrozalone?
I made them pull her out of radiology.
There's no way of knowing that.
This can be fixed in surgery.
Yeah, well, spontaneous intestinal perf
is one of the risks.
It's one of the things that happens to preemies.
Check his breath sounds.
It can be many possible explanations, like...
just... it doesn't matter.
It matters to me.
Dr. Anspaugh's waiting
for us in the O.R.
Okay, he's all yours.
What did they... what's happening?
Where are you taking him?
We'll remove any damaged tissue
and attempt a primary anastamosis.
No residents. We don't want any residents
cutting on this baby.
Okay, um, can you call the chaplain
and have him meet us in the O.R. Abby, you don't have to do that.
You said you wanted the baby baptized.
You said it was important to your family. Abby...
Call the chaplain.
One, two, three, and salt.
She's a pro. One more.
Oh...! See?
That's what I'm talking about.
Oh! That's what I'm talking about.
All right.
Whoa.
I've got to go. No...
We'll walk you out.
Oh, it's okay.
Come on.
Whoa. Careful.
I think we need to get you a cab.
Make sure you get home okay.
No, you know, why don't you, uh,
go and play some pool or something?
(laughing) Pool? Why would we play pool?
You want fries or onion rings?
Vegetables. I'm doing South Beach.
You had a milk shake an hour ago.
You're not driving, are you?
No, I'm not.
Well, where you going? We'll good take care of you.
Come on, guys.
All right, boys, back to the frat house, I got this.
Dude, you got a problem?
No, she's a friend of mine.
I'm just gonna take her home. Right, Doc?
Yes. Thank you.
He's gonna take me home.
Thanks a lot.
Little bitch.
What did you say?
Tony, easy, man!
Tony!
Easy, man, easy!
All right. Okay, okay, okay!
He gets the message.
I got it, I got it.
All right, we're gonna leave. And, uh...
you fellas are gonna go home
and sleep it off
or whatever you want to call it.
Dissect free the vessels to the diseased ileum.
CHAPLAIN: We thank you, God, for the wonder of new life,
and for the mystery of human love. Isolated.
Mixter clamp.
(alarm beeping)
Systolic's only 22, I'm bolusing again.
We thank you, God, for the support and skill
that surrounds and sustains life.
Mobilize the hepatic flexure.
CHAPLAIN: We are thankful
that we are known to you by name...
Careful, I don't want him third spacing all over the place.
We praise you, Father, Son and the Holy Spirit.
Blessed be God forever.
(speaks Croatian)
ANSPAUGH: .2 of epi,
400 of calcium, 10cc's of tham, now.
Really, you didn't have to do this.
I know.
Are you a boxer?
You know, you should go to bed.
You can sleep when you're dead.
Ooh, that rhymes.
(laughs)
Beer?
No, thanks.
Neela, the last thing you need right now is another drink.
You know...
you've got a mean left hook.
I like that in a man.
Do you like Sergio Mendes?
I don't really know.
I used to think he was really corny,
but his album is really cool.
(music plays)
Neela, you are gonna have such a headache in the morning.
Ow! Ow!
All right. Listen, I have to go, okay?
Zadro's still in the rig.
Oh, he can come up, too.
No, no, no, you're going to lay down
and I'm going to leave, okay?
No, please don't go. I have to go.
I'm sorry.
I don't want to be alone.
Is there anyone you can call?
I don't have anyone.
ALBRIGHT: Check his sat.
Terminal ileum looks dusky.
I can't do this.
I can't pretend everything's gonna be okay.
Preemies don't make it out of the O.R.
All the bad things you've seen, let it go.
I can't believe I let myself get talked into this.
Stop it.
I spent a month in the NICU, I know how this ends.
Abby.
You have a lot of great qualities,
but optimism is not one of them.
(chuckles)
Whose fault is that?
Yeah.
All right.
I did not create a good environment
for a child to grow up believing things would work out.
But you're not a child any longer.
You're the mother now.
And that baby down there
needs you to believe he's going to be okay.
ANESTHESIOLOGIST: Repeat ABG's 6.98, all metabolic.
Bradying down to the 60s.
ALBRIGHT: Another round of epi.
ANESTHESIOLOGIST: Guys, he's gray.
ANSPAUGH: .2 of epi, 400 of calcium, 10cc's of tham, now!
I'm trying, I'm really, really trying.
I'm trying.
I know.
I know.
Hey!
Cath lab is waiting on your roller-blader.
You need to finish the chart.
Where are you going?
Going to get beer for the party.
It looks like Weaver only ordered lemonade.
For graduation?
Yeah, she's no fun since she's been demoted.
Oh, I thought Kovac was gonna take the flack
for everything that happened.
I guess it all came down on Weaver.
Mm, lucky us.
Hey, um, have you talked to Abby?
I think they want privacy for a while.
I get that.
Tell her we miss her, okay?
Okay.
The paint has streaks.
Streaks? I don't see any streaks.
If you stand over here in the light,
you can see it has streaks.
Neela, what's it look like to you?
I see streaks.
Hey, Mayday.
How are you? Great.
Look, I'm really embarrassed...
Oh, don't be. I'm just glad
it was me who took you home.
All right, Jones, this is for you.
McCrary, this is for you. Williams...
Intern orientation.
I wouldn't wish it on anyone. Yeah.
What are you doing here?
PRATT: Yo, Gates.
Want me to take this or put this in the lost and found for you?
Oh, I don't do the whites. I'm into natural fibers.
(chuckles)
You know, Gates, you've always bugged me,
but you're in my ER now, so put on the damn coat.
You're a new intern? Mm-hmm.
Did my last paramedic shift yesterday.
You're kidding me.
All right, guys, get your photos taken
for your new ID badges right that way.
I look forward to working under you, Dr. Rasgotra.
Anyone hear from Jerry?
He's supposed to be discharged today.
Just spoke to him.
He's getting a massage from a home care nurse.
Your big daddy called, wants you to meet him outside.
Really?
Courtesy of Maxanoxx.
Oh, come on, buck up, Morris.
Just be glad you don't have to spend the summer
teaching pelvics to the new interns.
Nah, you're lucky, Pratt.
Yeah, right.
I clean vomit from my shirt while you fly first-class.
Corporate jet, actually.
Sounds corny, but I never appreciated how great it is
to have a job that really matters.
That suit matters, Morris.
You know, that day with Jerry was so terrible,
but also kinda the best moment of my life.
You know? Look at me now.
So silly.
Ah, well, you know, you're... you're doing a service.
I mean, you're educating the medical community for, uh...
Oh, it's a load of crap, Greg.
We all know it, okay?
I sold out to the man.
Well, I guess you never spoke to Kovac.
No, he didn't return my calls.
Well, he is pretty preoccupied these days.
I guess I could always try doing this somewhere else.
At least I figured out what's important,
and I want to practice medicine again.
I'm gonna go do
my thing for the Critical Care Department.
I'll see you around.
All right, man.
That waffle iron thief left AMA.
Hey, you know where Kovac is?
No.
What are you doing here?
Well, the DA determined it was justifiable homicide.
This is over.
I can't believe it.
Every day I keep thinking
they're gonna come and arrest me.
Well, you stop worrying about that.
Just focus on Alex.
You talk to him about it?
Uh... he knows his dad has gone,
but I need to talk to him more about it.
You're a good mom.
I just wanted to tell you that in person.
Anything else you need...
MORRIS: The key here
is the glucuronyl side group,
which gives Maxanoxx higher specificity
for the alpha one receptor.
Why-why invest in a course of Maxanoxx
when we have cheaper drugs
for pulmonary edema that are entirely effective?
Well, you'll see here that a subgroup of patients
had .4 fewer ICU days...
But there was no difference in the overall outcome.
Do you know what one day in the ICU costs taxpayers?
I mean, this hospital? Society?
Morris. May I speak to you out here now?
Not a good time, Dr. Pratt.
Uh, you'll save money in the long run. Trust me.
It's an emergency.
Excuse me a moment.
What? What is it?
Can't you-can't you see I'm working?
Kovac is gonna offer you the job.
Oh... Hey!
(moans)
You know, stick with Lasix.
Maxanoxx is a scam.
You know, it's great Kovac offered Morris
that attending spot.
Well, he's like a stray dog.
He'd just keep coming back.
Hey, you know that blunt chest trauma today? Mm-hmm.
Stuck a needle in the heart
and got half a liter out of the pericardium.
That's not bad for an intern.
Oh, I had a good teacher.
Have you two met?
Oh. Oh, yeah, I've seen you around.
Hey, I'm Tony Gates. Intern.
Ray Barnett. R-3.
Maybe tomorrow you can show me
how to do an open pericardial window.
Oh, I can show you how to do that.
If you'll excuse me...
You know, I hear she had a roommate
who never tried to sleep with her.
Yeah, what a dill weed.
MORRIS: So, can I call you Kerry, now?
I don't think so. Why?
We're colleagues, we're contemporaries.
Hey, no touch, no touch.
(laughing) Luka!
Hey.
Sorry I'm late.
Hey, I didn't think you were gonna make it.
I had to see it for myself, Archie Morris and Greg Pratt.
Attendings, huh?
Is Abby coming?
Uh... she wanted to, but not... not tonight.
How's she holding up?
She's okay.
She's doing okay.
It's almost time.
You call a cab?
Shh.
Yeah. It'll be here any minute.
So, uh...
When are you coming back?
Oh, my God, is that an invitation?
(laughs): I guess it is, yeah.
I mean the, uh...
the signs and the notes were a little crazy,
but, um...
I don't think I could have got through this without you.
Oh, you would have found a way.
You're a fighter.
My God, you've been
fighting with me since the day you were born.
I'd say "Honey, wear the cute little pink dress,"
so you'd wear the jeans.
I'd say, "What a nice little drawing you've done,"
and you'd throw it in the trash.
I told you to be a lawyer
and you became a doctor.
My greatest hope...
would be this little guy
causes you as much agony and pain as you caused me.
(kisses)
Would serve you right.
I gotta go.
Uh, hey. Uh, hey.
You don't have to go today, you know.
You'll be fine.
Mom.
I love you.
(humming)
Oh...
Oh. I like that.
Oh, thank you, brother. Thank you.
Oh, that is so...
(laughing)
