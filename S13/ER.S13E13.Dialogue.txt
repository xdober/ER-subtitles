Previously on E.R.:
Did you work on Edgar Dixon today?
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Um, why? What's up?
First Mission Baptist is dispensing meds
without a pharmacy license.
It's a felony, Pratt. A man died.
Thank you for the hot dog. It's my pleasure.
I'll catch you later, Joe.
So, how long you staying, Gracie?
Just till you throw me out, not a bit longer.
Luka, this is...
Eddie. Eddie.
Nobody called you a whore. My mom did.
Your mom's mistaken.
I'm gonna find budget cuts somewhere else.
There is no way we're losing.
Thanks, but I resign.
This is Dr. Abby Lockhart.
I'm calling from County General,
and can you tell him
I got his lab results
and he needs to come in and discuss them?
Thanks.
Since when do you call E.R. patients from home?
I was worried about this guy.
I want to make sure he gets seen.
Isn't that more of a job for his primary care physician?
He doesn't have one.
Well, no incentive to get one
if you're gonna make house calls.
I phoned his hotel
to make sure he comes in for follow-up.
Hotel?
Yes, he's from out of town.
Who is this guy?
It's Eddie Jackson. You met him.
What?
Nothing.
Well, why are you acting weird?
Hmm, I just... I just think it's a little strange
the amount of personal attention you seem to be giving some guy
you met in a bar.
MEG: You didn't talk to her, did you?
I didn't see her.
I thought you were gonna talk to her last night.
Yeah, but I got home so late and she was excited about how well
she did on her history presentation, so...
Tony...
I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna do it.
You've been saying that for a week.
She needs to hear this from you.
She needs to know that it was your idea,
otherwise, she'll never forgive me.
All right, I'll tell her.
Tonight, I promise.
(sighs)
BARNETT: Oh, man, would you
look at this board?
We got cough, cough and vomiting, itchy feet, diarrhea,
diarrhea and vomiting.
I haven't seen a decent trauma my last three shifts.
People are getting too damned careful these days.
Chopper's bringing in some kind of snowmobile accident.
Called it.
Is this the snowmobile?
Yeah, one of 'em.
Clarke Sutton, 13, lost control and hit a fence.
It was an accident.
I was trying to turn.
Where's Dennis?
McKay's unloading the older brother.
I think this one got the worst of it.
His brother carried him almost a mile to get help.
Can I be in the same room with Dennis?
It hurts to breathe. Okay, try not to talk.
Gates, why don't you go up to the roof,
grab the next one? I'll take this.
No, I got this covered. Nah, I got this one. Nah, I got this one.
Hey, look, this kid needs someone
who knows how to treat him, all right?
And that'd be me.
I'll call you if I need you.
Okay, guys, knock it off Come on.
Okay, who gets this patient?
Me, if you're gonna act like babies
then that's how I'll treat you.
Luka, sats are dropping
Okay, bag him.
Abby, run ahead and intubate.
Way to go.
This was your fault.
Yeah, right. Yeah, I am right.
Don't be an idiot. Ass for brains.
PASTOR: Edgar never liked to talk about his troubles.
In fact, the only thing he ever talked about was football.
But I remember...
one Sunday Edgar looked troubled, and I said to him
"Well, is there anything I could do for you?"
So he said, "No, no, Pastor, you can't help my problem."
I said, "Well, maybe I can't, but I know someone who can.
You know, God always listens."
Oh, amen.
Dr. Pratt.
Pastor, that was a nice service.
Thank you.
Very nice.
Um, Mrs. Dixon,
I just wanted to pass on my condolences once again.
I just, um,
want to let you know if there's anything,
anything I can do,
please don't hesitate to call the hospital.
Thank you, Dr. Pratt.
Thank you.
Greg!
The Medical Board called me.
I bet they did.
They said that they're issuing a letter
for us to cease and desist our drug program.
That's not a surprise.
I told 'em to go to hell.
You did what?
They don't understand what we're doing.
Yeah, but I'm sure they got a pretty clear idea now.
Look, I like what you're doing, but it doesn't work.
People need a continuity of care
and the church clinic isn't open every day.
How many people do you think we've helped
since we started this program?
I'm sorry.
Well, we're not giving up on the program.
Then you're headed for trouble.
My people have nowhere else to turn to.
They're already in trouble.
I'm out.
Sats are drifting into the 70s.
TAGGART: Come on, Clarke, stay with us.
Want me to do that? No.
You sure? Yeah.
If you want to help, you can give me some cricoid.
I got blood here. What do you want?
Uh, CBC, LFTs, chem7...
I'm in. Bag him.
...UA and a blood gas.
You're probably not gonna need that.
Decreased on the left.
Pull back the ET tube.
No, I stopped just past the cords.
Well, it's obviously not, so pull it back.
I'm gonna call the Blood Bank.
Uh, good idea.
Still decreased.
Sterile sixes and a test tube tray.
Hold on. Let's not jump the gun.
He's got a bruise and bad sats.
I'm not jumping the gun.
It's a pneumothorax.
Right, I'll call for a portable chest.
Good, good.
Let's see what we're dealing with here first.
20% of all pneumothoraces are missed on X ray.
You taught me that.
Nice to know you were listening.
We have time to wait for the film
before we start cutting.
What about the sliding lung sign?
Okay, lungs are up. No hemothorax or rib fractures.
What's happening with Clarke?
Why isn't he sitting up?
They put a tube down his throat to help him breathe.
Good bowel sounds.
He got the wind knocked out of him.
I had to carry him to the road.
It's a good thing you did.
Crits 38, pressure's still good,
122/76.
Let me know if anything's sore.
He kept begging me to let him drive.
His father's gonna kill me.
Wait. I thought you two were brothers.
He's my stepbrother.
My dad died when I was little.
My mom remarried in August.
He thinks I'm a screw-up.
This isn't going to help.
Pretty much wrecked his snowmobile. Ow!
All right, left lower quadrant. Call Surgery.
Not so fast.
It's not a contusion. It's an abrasion.
He's guarding.
Do you have to keep doing that? I'm sorry.
He's hemodynamically stable, and his crit's good.
Let's get a CT of his belly, and if it's normal,
then we won't have to waste a surgeon's time.
Well, I'm going to have to disagree with your assessment.
Ah, okay.
Let's run it by Kovacs.
Let's not.
I decide when we present to an attending.
LOCKHART: No lung sliding.
What the hell is lung sliding anyway?
Normally there's lung movement on ultrasound.
If it's not there, then the lung must be partially deflated.
Showoff.
Okay, chest tube tray to Abby.
What? You don't want to do it now?
I wanted to do it 15 minutes ago.
Well, it looks like Abby was right
and Luka confirmed the diagnosis radiographically.
Good work, team.
What the hell do I have to do
to get someone to come down here?
Dr. Gates from the E.R.
That's with an "E" for "emergency."
You called for a consult?
Actually, I dialed the Hot Surgeons chat line.
Which room?
What's the matter?
No, "Hey, how you doing?
You look sexy in that white suit"?
Hey, what's wrong?
You mean besides the fact the last time I saw you
the woman that you live with practically assaulted me
and her daughter called me a whore?
I told you I was sorry.
I don't live with her anymore.
Not for long, anyway.
How's Sarah?
We're working through it.
No blood out. It's not the chest.
Xeroform and the thoroseal.
Could be cardiac contusion.
Get a 12-lead and hold off on the blood
until the troponin's back.
CT's ready.
I'll take him up.
I'll take him. You sure?
Yeah, in case he crashes.
Well, that wasn't awkward.
Further proof workplace romance, bad idea.
Is that so?
Uh, yeah.
Hey, look, the other night
you kinda caught me off guard with that kiss,
and I don't... I have a rule against dating people at work.
You do?
Yeah, it's kind of a new rule.
Uh, yeah.
But a solid rule.
That's cool, really.
This is Dennis' father, Gary.
Gary, this is Dr. Gates
and Dr. Rasgotra.
Where's Clarke?
Oh, upstairs for more X rays.
Is this a social visit?
Tony asked for a consult.
I hope you're happy now.
I'm sorry. We were being really careful.
You obviously weren't being careful
if you put Clarke in the hospital.
I want to see my son.
Where is he?!
Uh, Lily, could you?
I can take you to him, sir.
Thank you.
You better pray he's all right.
Uh, Neela, I'm sorry you had to come down here.
Um, he doesn't need a consult.
Oh, well, I'm here now and I'm almost finished.
Okay, fine, then can you explain to him why
this patient is not a good candidate for surgery?
Actually, I'm suggesting we admit him for observation.
Why? His kidneys look good.
His liver and spleen appear to be normal.
Did I miss something on the CT?
Well, an occult injury
could take time to declare itself.
He's right.
No, he's not.
The surgeon concurs with my assessment.
Hey, don't worry, boss.
I'm not one of those "I told you so" kids.
Can I speak to you outside?
Certainly. Okay.
Not you.
Sammy.
Hi, guys.
Ben, hello.
Hey, Gracie. What's up, Alex?
Hey.
Alex is signing up for the Volunteen program today.
He's real excited about it.
I had to practically drag him here by his ears.
Alex, even if you volunteer for a couple hours a week,
it'll still help on your college applications, okay?
And maybe you'll even like it.
Just keep telling yourself that, Mom.
When I was your age, I had two jobs.
Yeah, doing what, milking the T-Rex?
I worked on the Milfords' farm before school, smartass,
and at night I worked in Addison's Bakery.
If you'd like, I could take Alex to the volunteer center,
show him around a bit. That's great. Thank you, Ben.
Well, actually, I probably know this hospital
better than you do.
That's great. Then you can give me the tour
'cause I still can't find the gift shop. Come on.
He gets cuter every time I see him.
Ben.
I heard you.
You should be going after that one.
It's a little tricky dating someone you work with.
What's tricky about it?
Having sex without getting caught?
Gracie... Look, honey,
I know what your life has been like.
Trust me,
Sammy, I know.
All the women in our family are the same--
very fertile, allergic to chestnuts,
prone to bladder infections...
And we all have that damn gene
that predisposes us
to bad boys.
Chestnuts?
Sammy, life is short.
You deserve to be happy.
You deserve a good man.
If you like this guy, go for it.
Okay, the least you can do
is give me an honest and professional opinion.
I did. No, you didn't.
Well, how would you know? You're not a surgeon.
Neither are you.
Sorry. Sorry, look... We established...
No, you look. I came down, I assessed... You shouldn't have come down...
I made a professional call. If you disagree with my opinion...
...it's personal, just like your visit. ...fine, that's your prerogative.
What you can't do... The reason why you're siding with Gates
is because you're screwing him. ...is accuse me of being...
I can't believe you just said that.
So it's true?
No. And even if it were, it's none of your damn business.
And it certainly has nothing to do with this case.
It does if it's clouding your judgment.
Hey, maybe we should get an attending to weigh in on this.
No. No.
PRATT: Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Somebody want to tell me what the hell's going on here?
Oh, so everything's just all good now, huh?
Well, somebody better have a good explanation. Ray?
Okay. 13-year-old drove a snowmobile into a fence.
Normal CT, stable crit and B.P.
Gates wanted a surgical consult,
I said we didn't need one,
but he decided to call Neela down here anyway.
Better safe than sorry, right?
Wrong.
It wasn't your call to make.
Ray's above you.
Now if you have a problem with your resident
or you disagree with his judgment,
then you call an attending.
I wanted to present to Kovac.
BARNETT: And I didn't.
He was busy with another trauma anyway.
And now they've taken the hospital's last surgical bed.
That kid needs 24-hour observation. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You cannot give up the last surgical bed.
I need to follow serial exams.
Then do it down here. You're already full up.
Then send him home and have him come back
in 12 hours for a re-exam. Exactly.
You know, I'm trying to help
you guys here. No, you give up your last surgical bed
to this kid and we can get stuck boarding
a real surgical train wreck down here for days.
Ray's patient, Ray's call.
Fine. Keep him down here.
Less work for me.
Thank you.
Yeah, you better be right.
Thanks for the vote of confidence, boss.
Luka. Yeah.
You get a chance to speak with Angela Gilliam
about Edgar Dixon? Who?
The guy from the church clinic.
Oh, yeah, she-she said she'd, uh, look into it.
All right, I'm just a little concerned.
Someone called the medical board
and they called the church.
Okay, I'll talk to her again.
All right, thanks.
You looking for something?
A patient. Which one?
PICKMAN: Hockey dad, Jim Singer, 30.
Hockey puck versus face. It was a slap shot.
This is his son, Jimmy, Jr.
God, he spit out his teeth.
Okay, Jimmy, we're gonna fix your dad up
and you get to play X-Box, okay?
Margo, can you take Jimmy?
How you doing, sir?
I can't breathe. Looks like a fractured jaw,
multiple broken teeth.
His pulse ox is down to 88. Okay, he needs an airway.
Pratt, you want a piece of this?
Uh...
sure.
How come they didn't bring Clarke back?
They probably moved him to another bed
to free up the trauma room.
And that can be a good sign, so...
Your stepfather hasn't come by, huh?
No.
Why didn't you tell him you weren't the one who was driving?
What's the point?
I don't know, maybe so that...
he knows you didn't do this.
He'd still find a way to blame me.
At least now he can't get mad at Clarke, too.
You two are close?
Yeah, I guess.
First, it was kind of weird having a little brother.
But he's cool.
His dad's really strict on him.
I'm afraid he thinks that I'm a bad influence.
Sometimes I let him do things his father doesn't.
Like drive the snowmobile?
I'll find out how he's doing, okay?
Thanks.
Forget it, we're never going to see the cords.
All right, let's bag him up and prep the neck
for a seldinger crike.
Hey, Abby, what's the status
on the other snowmobile kid, Clarke Sutton?
CT showed persistent pneumo, Kovac put in a second tube.
But other than that he's good. Try Exam Three.
Okay, thanks.
Dr. Pratt, I'd like you to stop by my office
at 4:00 today if that's possible.
LOCKHART: Cricothyroid is right here.
Yeah. Um... did you talk to Dr. Kovac yet?
Yes, we need to have a quick sit-down
with the hospital lawyers about Edgar Dixon.
Guide wire.
Yeah, I was just at his funeral today.
I spoke to his wife. She's not pressing any charges.
She's not the problem, the board is.
They're not too happy Mr. Dixon was getting
his medications through his church.
Medications that you distributed.
Yeah, but... who got the board involved in this?
I don't know. 4:00.
(sighs)
Abby, here's your introducer. Greg...
Dr. Pratt, we got a hot MI five minutes out.
Uh, Greg...
Yeah, all right, um... chest X-ray,
call for a vent, page Head and Neck,
and, uh, come find me when you're done.
BEN: Do either of these belong to you?
Hey. How'd it go?
Spectacular.
Sarcasm is a poor substitute for wit.
Do you know who said that, young man?
Do I care?
Alex, don't be rude.
Say you're sorry. Just relax, okay?
Hey. Don't tell me to relax.
I think it's time we went home.
Okay, let's go.
March!
Hey.
So, uh, finally get things sorted out with Neela?
There's nothing to sort out, man. You sure?
Because it looks like you got some sorting out to do.
Look, man, if you need my advice,
all you have to do is... No, no, no, no.
No, I don't need your advice.
I don't want your advice. I took your advice, remember?
You know, "Give her some time, Ray."
"Give her some space, Ray."
Yeah, I did that.
In fact, I gave her so much time and so much space,
she started seeing somebody else.
So thank you for the advice, Pratt.
(laughing): What? So that's...
GRACIE: Stop acting like a baby.
Why are you even here?
Nobody invited you.
It's time you started showing a little respect.
And you need to mind your own damn business, bitch.
Don't you ever talk...
Hey! And don't you ever touch me.
You ever raise your hand to me
or your mother or any other woman
I'll break every bone in your sullen little body.
Grandma's got some game.
JARVIK: Ray...
your snowmobile kid's not looking too good.
The one you insisted didn't need surgery.
Hey, I got this.
Thanks.
Hey, look, um...
I'm sorry about Alex.
You know, he's not always like that.
He's had a rough year. You don't need to apologize for him, Sam.
I just don't want you to think that...
That he's what?
That he's a teenager?
Sam, I was a holy terror at his age.
My principal suspended me from school one time for fighting.
So you know what I did?
I slashed all the tires on his Corvette.
That is a little delinquent.
Yeah, I was a real piece of work.
My mom raised me by herself, too, Sam,
so I know it's not easy.
We fought every single day
for probably ten straight years.
And now we talk at least once a week.
And we're best friends.
And in time, I'm sure you and Alex will be, too.
Hey, have you seen Dr. Pratt?
He's out in the ambulance bay waiting on a rig. Thanks.
Hey, Abby, I have a working girl with a mandible dislocation.
I've tried everything.
You know any tricks? No pun intended.
Can this wait ten minutes?
No, I've already paged Kovac and Pratt.
She pre-medicated, they're all tied up.
I've tried everything. It won't budge.
I gave her 100 of fent.
Add some midazolam.
How'd you do this, big yawn?
From what I gather, it was an oral occupational injury
she got while performing a service.
Oh. Okay.
Two milligrams in.
Did you try it from behind?
Oh, you're talking to me?
Relocating the mandible.
Oh. No, that's a new one.
From the back, you've got better leverage
for downward force.
And you can put your weight into it. Makes sense.
You also get a better grip.
Hey, Tony,
got a visitor.
Sarah, what are you doing here?
I went up to your room.
I saw your boxes.
Why didn't you tell me?
Uh...
I was going to.
You lied to me.
Sarah, this really isn't a good time.
Why don't you guys go in the break room?
Go with Sam and I'll be there in a few minutes. You want to leave,
then leave. I don't care anymore.
Sarah. Want me to get her?
Go ahead, I got this.
You okay?
Sarah, wait.
Hey!
Stop and listen to me.
No!
You can't tell me what to do,
you're not my dad.
Yes, but I'm your friend.
Friends don't leave.
(crying)
Damn it, abdomen's rigid with fever.
Crits stable, he's not bleeding.
Could be a bowel perf with peritonitis.
Blood cultures and Zosyn 3.375.
Should I get Gates?
No, no, no. No, I need surgery down here.
I already called them.
Okay, mix up dopamine.
Dennis, Dennis, can you hear me?
I need you to start fighting, okay?
Your brother wants to talk to you.
Page Neela. Tell her I need her down here, now!
Here you go.
(high-pitched voice): "Thank you, Tony."
(normal voice): You're welcome, Sarah.
Hey, come on, you can't be mad at me forever.
Why not?
Because of this...
What are you doing?
My sympathetic doctor face.
You look stupid.
No? All right, you know what,
you're making me bring out the big guns.
When somebody is really sick and it's very fatal
I say to them, "Mr. Smith,
"it's very fatal, you're very sick,
"the tumor's too big
"for your very tiny little head.
"It's fatal. You're not going to live.
Sir, you're going to die!"
Okay, stop. Then I give 'em this face.
Then I go... (sobbing).
Stop. Stop it.
It's not funny.
I'm mad at you.
I know. I'm sorry.
I wanted to tell you.
Why do you have to go?
Because it's the right thing.
Is it because of Neela?
You called her?
She was worried about you.
Come on. Come on.
What's happening?
Free air under the diaphragm.
JARVIK: Systolic's only 90 after two liters.
I'll throw in a subclavian,
then straight to the O.R.
BARNETT: He seemed okay.
Where's his stepfather?
I sent Dawn to find him.
Thanks for coming. It's my job, Ray.
Cordis introducer.
Prime the infuser.
All right.
You have a minute?
Yeah. Why, what's up?
It was me-- I called the medical board about Edgar Dixon.
You?
Why the hell would you do that?
Because I heard he was getting his meds from some doctor at a church.
I thought it was some unlicensed crackpot.
Oh, Abby.
I'm really sorry.
It's all right.
I'm sorry, I thought I was doing the right thing.
You were. We both were.
Sometimes you do the right thing and you still get shafted.
Don't sweat it.
Hey, Greg, these detectives would like to talk to you.
About what?
Your involvement with a patient named Edgar Dixon.
I called Angela. She's on her way down.
All right, thanks. Dr. Pratt,
is there someplace we could go talk in private?
Yeah, sure.
Right this way.
Yo, Abby, I've been looking for you.
That patient you were asking about?
Boom, he left a message. Thanks.
Let me guess, your friend Eddie again.
What, are you jealous?
No, I just don't understand why you're giving this guy so much attention.
He's a 60-year-old man with lung disease.
I'm just trying to help him out.
Hi.
Hi... Kerry...
Uh, we can talk about this later.
Or not.
Everything all right?
Yeah, just a disagreement about a patient.
Hmm. Gotcha.
(sighs)
I still can't believe you're leaving.
Yeah, it feels a little weird.
Scary, but, uh, it's exciting.
I'm actually going to miss this place.
You know... Listen, I just want to...
No, no, no... No, go ahead.
No... You go.
Um...
I just want to say that I think that you've probably
uh, seen me... at my best,
and um... and at my worst.
And even though we didn't always see eye to eye, um...
...you helped me go from a nurse
to a med student...
to a doctor...
...to a mom.
I'm the one who's supposed to be upset here.
I know. Sorry.
You were always there as a nurse and a doctor
and most importantly, you've always been here
as my friend.
(sniffling)
Do you think this happens to the guys
when one of them leaves?
I heard Carter bawled like a baby when he left.
(chuckles)
I'm going to miss you.
Thank you.
And now it's time for us to take care of ourselves.
You can still hang out with Tony.
It won't be the same.
No, but it will still be good.
You can go to Tony's place when I get on your nerves.
Oh, easy, now. I don't want the kid living with me.
I can stay at your place sometimes?
If it's okay with your mom.
I'm going to have a swinging bachelor pad.
I'm going to have a big-screen TV over the Jacuzzi,
trampoline and a shark tank, the works.
Nothing stays the same forever, Sarah.
It's part of growing up.
Besides, you won't care about me
in a few years anyway.
You're going to run off
and marry that horn dog character
and have six kids and eight cats... We broke up.
What? Yeah.
Oh, you know, I really never liked that guy.
It was my fault.
He found out I like Kevin McIntyre.
Jezebel.
Better get going, kiddo.
Let Tony get back to work.
Hey...
Hey.
Baby girl.
His vitals have stabilized. Let's get him up to O.R. Two.
I'll call you when he's out of surgery.
Thanks.
Neela.
Neela, I need to say something.
No, you don't.
You did what you thought was right for the patient.
I respect that, Ray.
No, see... no, that's not it.
Then what is it?
Uh... this is probably wrong, I know.
It's the wrong place, the wrong time, but, uh...
GATES: Why didn't somebody page me?
We handled it.
What happened?
Seems like your patient has a perforated viscus.
Really? Good thing we didn't send him home, huh, Rock Star?
Looks like he needed observation after all.
It's not small bowel perforation, okay, Tony?
This has nothing to do with the seat belt sign.
How do you figure?
Small bowel doesn't seed the peritoneum like this.
It's colonic, maybe diverticular.
Really? Interesting. Tell me more, Doctor.
Where are they taking Dennis?
He's going up to surgery, if you really care.
What the hell's that supposed to mean?
You know, I sent a nurse to find you 30 minutes ago.
I was with my son. Yeah? Well, this one needed you, too.
You know what, actually I'm sorry.
He needed a parent. Maybe I should have called his mother.
Hey, you're out of line.
Neither one of them would even be in here
if Dennis wasn't screwing around.
Dennis wasn't even driving. Clarke was.
That's not true. Yes, it is.
But did you even bother to ask him?
No, you just blamed him from the get-go.
Why didn't he say something? Would you have believed him?
He was trying to protect his little brother.
That's what big brothers do.
Dennis is older. He should have known better.
He's 15.
Do you know that he carried Clarke
almost a mile to the road to get help?
So instead of busting his balls,
maybe you should be thanking him.
He probably saved your son's life.
Hey, you know, I don't think I like your attitude.
Really? I don't think I like the way you treat your kid.
Where do you get off talking to me like this?
Where's your supervisor?
You don't know a damn thing about me or my family.
No, no, no, that's wrong.
'Cause I know that Dennis is a good kid,
and I know that you are an asshole.
Yeah, and if I were you, I'd probably start to treat him a little better.
Because in a couple years he's probably going
to be bigger than you, and he is going to remember
every single time you treated him like crap,
and one day he is going to kick your ass, okay?
You got a valid medical license, Dr. Pratt?
Of course.
What about a pharmacist's license?
My medical license allows me to write prescriptions.
Write, yeah,
but diverting controlled substances
to an unauthorized distributor-- that's a felony.
I wasn't diverting anything, I was treating patients.
At this illegal clinic of yours?
Illegal clinic?
All right, come on, fellas,
let's not get carried away here, okay?
Look, I was helping out at a church
where most of the congregation
doesn't even have health insurance.
Like the man that you killed?
Isn't one of you supposed to be the good cop?
Ray.
Look, Dr. Weaver, I just spent the whole day
with this great kid who saved his little brother's life,
and when his stepfather came in and started to berate
and belittle him in front of everyone, I just...
I don't know, I guess he just reminded me
of someone I used to know.
Yeah, I was just coming to say good-bye.
Oh.
I may have done a great disservice
to the world of rock keeping you here,
but you could be a great doctor, Ray.
I kind of thought I was.
I'm kidding.
Sort of. Um...
Wow, um...
Thank you, Dr. Weaver.
Thank you for everything.
So what do we do now?
Um, hug, kiss?
All right.
So what's next, you guys gonna beat me with a rubber hose?
What the hell is going on?
Dr. Pratt is under arrest.
On what charges?
Violation of the Controlled Substance Act.
Do you believe these jokers?
You had to handcuff him?
It's a felony charge, Doc.
Aw, come on, guys, you can't do this. Back off, Doc.
Unless you want to go with him.
GRACIE: She's playing with the bunnies, I'm looking for my camera...
And then, suddenly, we hear this God-awful scream,
and we see this billy goat has Sammy by the pigtails.
(laughing)
Speak of the devil!
Gracie invited me to dinner.
She did?
Hi, Mr. Owens.
Evening, Sam.
Don't worry. I'm not staying for dinner.
Thanks for the dessert, Gracie.
Anytime, Bennet.
I baked a blueberry pie.
I'm making fish and chips.
Night, Sam.
Hey, you need a hand with anything, Mr. Owens?
No. I'm good, thanks.
I... I was just telling the boys
about how the goat ate your pigtails
at the petting zoo.
Great. Where's Alex?
He's in his room. He's doing his homework.
At least he better be.
Nice shot.
Hey, what are you doing here?
Why didn't you come back to the hospital?
How did you find me?
Guy at your hotel said you might be here.
And, in case you're interested,
your test results show that your lungs aren't expanding properly.
They've become fibrotic.
Guess I'll have to switch to menthols.
You didn't have to come here.
Eight ball, corner pocket.
You're not getting enough oxygen
in your blood. You're going to need
an echocardiogram to check your cardiac function.
Better luck next time, chief.
You need to be referred to a specialist.
No more doctor stuff, huh?
Well, we need to find out what's causing this, Eddie.
No, we don't.
Abby, listen... I don't understand why you got the tests
if you weren't planning on following through.
I don't care about my damn lungs.
I didn't keep coming to see you for health reasons.
Okay. Well, then, talk to me. What's going on, huh?
Uh...
I been taking care of myself my whole life,
usually at the expense of others.
I appreciate your concern,
but I don't deserve it.
You know, I... I shouldn't have come here.
(sighs)
Abby?
Look, just stay away from me. Okay?
Let me explain something.
No, you don't... Don't.
You don't have to. It's just a mistake, all right?
Abby, I know what you're feeling.
No, I don't think you do,
because I don't know what I'm feeling.
And you're right. I didn't need to come here.
And I shouldn't have come here.
Abby, I lied to you.
I didn't want to scare you off.
My name isn't Jackson.
It's Wyczenski. I'm your father.
Yeah. I talked to Maggie a while back.
Probably going on three years. No. No.
Yeah. I got caught up on you and your brother, Eric,
before she started screaming at me. No, no...
This is not happening.
Yeah, it is. She told me you were working at the hospital
here in Chicago. You know, why are you doing this?
I wanted to see for myself.
After 30 years?
Yeah. I wanted to see what sort of a person you grew up to be.
Oh, God! I can't do this. Took me two years
to work up the nerve to come and visit you.
I cannot do this! One of the nurses at
the triage desk, she pointed you out to me,
and I got cold feet. Taxi!
You know, if you hadn't walked into the bar,
I... I probably would have left
without ever speaking to you.
But when I met you, I wanted to know more,
but I didn't have the gut to tell you the truth,
because I thought you'd tell me to go away.
Well, guess what. You were right. Go away!
Go away. Oh, Abby...
Abby, please.
No. Just leave me alone! All right?
You don't get to do this. It's not fair.
Hey, Kerry!
Hey.
Hey. I didn't get a chance to say good-bye to Pratt.
I'm on my way to the police station to bail him out.
That's one of those parts of the job
they never tell you about.
One of the many parts that I'm not going to miss.
Look, hey, I never had a chance to tell you...
Luka, Luka, you know what?
I'm done talking about this. Really. Please? I... I know...
but, hey, you... you hired me.
I still remember my first day.
An oxygen tank
rocketed through the E.R.-- almost killed me.
Well, no one ever said this was the safest place to work.
You... you changed my life by giving me this job.
You may even have saved it.
I don't know where I'd be if I hadn't found this place.
And you taught me a lot.
(whispers): Thank you.
Come here, you big Croat...
You know what? Don't get up...
Don't get caught up in the politics, all right?
A good hospital is about people and medicine.
Thank you.
I'll see you around sometime.
Yeah.
Luka...
Take care of this place for me.
I will.
(sighs)
(chuckles)
It's getting late, so I'd better get going.
But we don't even work tomorrow.
Yeah, but I'm like Gracie.
And I need my beauty sleep.
Well... you could sleep here tonight if you want.
It would save you all that driving.
Yeah, but you have that rule
against workplace fraternization.
It's actually more of a guideline than a rule.
And it applies more to doctors than nurses.
Hmm. That's good to know.
Mm-hmm.
And Alex and Gracie would be okay with this?
Mmm...
Come on.
(indistinct voices)
(music playing)
(sighs)
Here's a two bedroom on Lakeshore with a concierge.
Hey, I always wanted to live in a building with a concierge.
You can't possibly afford a place on Lakeshore.
$3,600 a month.
Like I said...
$1,800 apiece.
What? Are you going to split it with the concierge?
Funny? Make yourself laugh there?
You like that one? Is that a funny one?
(phone rings)
Hold that thought.
Hello. Hello.
SARAH: Tony?
Sarah?
I think mom's really sick. I can't wake her up.
What? Where are you?
In the car.
Where? Where... where's the car?
I don't know where we are, Tony. But you have to do something.
I think she's dying.
Sarah? Sarah? (sobbing)

LOCKHART: Okay. All right.
(baby crying)
All right, one second.
I'll get you out in one second.
(crying) Sorry, honey.
(baby screaming)
Shh! Okay. It's okay.
Here we go. We're home.
Hey, hey. Just one sec, okay? One sec. Here we go.
Come on, Luka. Pick up.
Hey, it's me. Um, uh... I'm home.
I just got Joe from Ellen's.
Listen, can you call me as soon as you get this?
It's kind of... it's kind of urgent.
Thanks.
(baby crying)
Here we go. I know. Sorry. It's okay.
Yeah, I know.
(crying) Shh! Shh! Shh! Shh!
Okay, okay, here we go.
(gasps)
Call your husband.
I... I just did. He's not picking up.
Call him again.
