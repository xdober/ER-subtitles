Previously on ER:
Stop. It's over.
I told Meg it's over.
Maybe for you,
but any idiot could see from the look on her face
that it's not over for her.
Meg, Sarah, this is Neela.
So I called the nursing director
and I signed on for another month.
Hmm, well.
Enough meds for 90% of your people.
You can fill this for a month's supply.
...looking for cans and bottles...
I can't believe it's me up there.
Yeah, well, you better get used to it.
I couldn't have done it without my producer.
Um, I don't know and it's too early to tell
who might have been responsible for the attack.
Obviously, we will do the forensics...
I can't even look at her. You don't think she's a role model?
I mean, not for me, but you've got to admit she's impressive.
Yeah, if Shaquita needs a role model, she should turn on Oprah.
Yeah, but what if Shaquita wants to be Secretary of State?
Well, then she can look up Madeline Albright.
Come on, Henry, we've got to get you dressed.
Here we go, baby. (phone ringing)
Would you mind getting that? Sure.
That's my boy.
Kerry Weaver's residence.
May I ask who's calling?
Yeah.
It's a news director
from Miami.
Hello.
Are you crazy?
What would I do with two iPods and three Xboxes?
Fine, fine, have your fraud department call me.
What happened?
My credit card was declined this morning.
Yeah, it's time to dial back on the escort service.
Yeah, that's what you get for being such a big spender.
Ever since I bought the beemer,
I've been living on a tight budget.
That explains the pants.
Hey, Sam, can you check a sat on my bronchiolytic?
No problem. Thanks.
Do you need any help?
Actually, I need to move some stuff
to my new place, and I hear you have a truck.
I only help people move if they promise to feed me.
We can work that out.
Hey, everybody. Come over here.
Whoa.
This is Sarah.
Hey, Sarah.
Hi. Cool hat.
I like your necklace.
Thank you.
My kid gave it to me.
He's about your age.
Hey.
She's shadowing me today.
You didn't clear that with me.
I talked to Kovac and Weaver about it.
Yeah, but you didn't talk to me.
You must be that guy
that's always riding Uncle Tony.
You know like a bull in heat. Shh.
So, uh, what else
does Uncle Tony say about me?
The rest I'm not allowed to say.
Just make sure she signs a confidentiality form
and if she gets hurt,
she's your responsibility, understood, Uncle Tony?
Aye, aye, Captain.
Kerry, this is huge.
Do you know how hard it is to get your own morning show?
It's not my own show.
I'd just be the health reporter.
Full time, with your own daily segment.
It's flattering, but I am a doctor.
Who just got demoted from a hospital she worked at
for over ten years.
I love medicine.
I've never pictured myself doing anything else.
You'd still be able to do that.
On you own show.
Would you stop saying that?
I'm not leaving Chicago.
I'm not leaving my friends.
And I'm not pulling Henry out of his pre-school.
You can find another pre-school.
Yvonne Davillere, 37, tripped and fell on the sidewalk.
My leg just gave out.
Any LOC? Negative. Good vitals.
I don't know what happened.
I've got to take this.
Forehead contusion and knee abrasion.
We need to clear her neck. Let's roll. This is hers.
Do you know where you are?
I know I'm not home.
Kerry, it's Miami. You've got to consider it.
When does the station want an answer? By tomorrow afternoon.
Well, you better start thinking about it.
I already have. I'm not doing it.
C-spine, access trauma two.
Let's go.
Kerry, we're talking Miami, Miami.
South Beach Miami. C-spine's clear.
Getting naked at the Delano, Miami.
Let's take her off the board.
Is my sketchbook here?
Yeah, it's in the corner.
Ready?
You can't steal my 15 minutes and then punt them away.
Not now, Morris.
Are you an artist?
A painter.
Open your mouth, please.
No intra-oral trauma or dental fractures.
Glucose is 295. Do you have diabetes?
My sugar's always been a little high.
I'm supposed to watch my diet.
Are you on any medications?
Clindamycin... for my foot.
Chronic infection at the base of the second toe
with some surrounding cellulitis.
WEAVER: Does this hurt?
I've been limping for awhile, but I'm fine.
Okay, let's get a foot series and culture the wound.
Kerry, Kerry...
Listen, listen, listen. You could be
the next Judge Judy, Dr. Phil...
No, no, no, Ellen.
Go clear some patients, Morris.
This is the big leagues, Weaver. The majors.
Take your swing.
Looks pretty bad.
Yeah, she hurt her ankle during dance class.
We're waiting on surgical consult.
Surgical consult?
Yeah. Her fiance fell on her.
You okay, honey?
Well, good luck.
Hey. Hey.
You remember Sarah.
Hi, Sarah.
She'll be shadowing me today.
I got your message. You're going to have fun.
Where does your belly hurt?
All over.
Good bowel sounds.
GATES: FAST exam was negative.
She doesn't look like a whore.
Excuse me? Sarah...
Did she just call me a...? A whore.
She called you a whore.
No, nobody called you a whore.
My mom did. Sarah...
Well, your mom's mistaken.
Are you calling my mom a liar? You want to go home?
Let's get a CT scan, shall we?
Hey, did you see my infected G-tube in Three?
I'm about to go and check on him.
That little tosser just called me a whore.
She seems so sweet.
I've never been called a whore.
Did she say dirty whore or filthy whore?
Is there a difference?
Depends on the whore.
Edgar Dixon, vomited blood,
passed out at the hardware store.
Pressure was 80 palp.
Type and cross four and call for 0-neg.
Pulse is 105.
Did you call my wife? Sir, be still.
It's Thursday... she's at the hairdresser.
We called her. She's on her way.
First bag is in.
Hemocue's 12.4.
Okay, forget the 0-neg.
20 of IV famotidine, 10 of reglan.
Another liter of saline wide open.
Sir, have you had any belly pain?
I felt nauseous today.
Ever had an ulcer?
No.
Drink much alcohol?
Not a drop. ABBY: Belly is benign.
Who's your doctor?
I don't really have one.
BEN: Are you on any medication?
Something from the drug store for arthritis.
Ibuprofen? Naproxen?
I don't know.
Some arthritis medicines can cause an ulcer.
Is that serious?
If it keeps bleeding it could be.
HALEH: Hey, Sam. What's up?
You have a guest.
Go ahead.
Says she's family.
Drove all the way from Dallas.
Oh, no.
Thank you, Haleh.
Grandma?
Don't tell me we're out of compazine again.
Pharmacy is coming to restock.
Try tigan.
Good idea.
Listen, I, uh, I just heard about your job offer.
Don't worry, I'm not moving to Miami.
You're not considering it?
No, I like it here.
We may have our occasional gunplay,
but at least we're helping people, right?
I don't need to tell you January is budget month.
Mm-hmm.
They're asking me to, uh...
to make some cuts.
They want me to lose an attending.
Well, maybe you can send Morris to Miami.
Morris' salary won't do it.
I need to cut at least 200 grand.
Well, the only people who make that much are you and...
You're kidding, right?
Kerry, I had to...
I need to cut costs.
You're firing me?
Since you have this opportunity...
This is how you tell me? There's no good way.
It's unbelievable.
Kerry, you've been doing this for a long time,
and I know it's not for me to say,
but lately it seems like-like you've had enough, and...
What?!
Most of the time you're out doing news stories.
I do those stories on my days off.
Excuse me, I need some Unasyn.
I'm sorry, my hands are tied. I'm just trying to...
To do what?
To do the right thing or do the easy thing?
Kerry, I'm not happy about this.
You know what, when they were going to fire you,
I stepped up, I took the fall.
That's the only reason I ended up back in the ER.
And that's the only reason that you're still here.
Blood count's holding at 30,
which means you don't have any ongoing blood loss.
We were in Atlantic City last weekend,
and he started getting ill then.
I knew he should have gone to the doctor.
Honey, you were right, I know.
Could have an ulcer or a tear in a small vessel in the esophagus.
LOCKHART: We're going to have to admit you, and have a specialist
take a look at your stomach just to make sure.
Do you want to come with me and fill out some paperwork?
I'll be right back, honey.
I love you.
I love you, too, baby.
This is the first you've heard of it?
He just told me.
Oh, I can't believe this.
Just let it go, Haleh. Let what go?
Your guy is firing Dr. Weaver.
You know what, Mrs. Dixon,
I'll meet you at that desk over there. Okay.
He's what?
Budget cuts.
I don't care if you have another job offer.
You're the best damn attending
in this place.
What do you mean another job offer? In Miami.
Plain films on Yvonne's foot. Kerry...
Oh, man.
What's going on?
This is bad.
I've got to deal with this, guys.
I know. I'll talk to him.
Um, I looked at your X-ray.
And turns out you have an infection in the bones
of your second and third toes.
Osteomyelitis,
what else is new?
You knew about this?
I cut my foot.
The clindamycin is supposed to clear it all up.
Well, it isn't working,
and based on your increased pain, it's getting worse.
So I give the antibiotics a few more weeks.
WEAVER: Your diabetes has decreased
the blood supply to your toes,
so the antibiotics aren't working.
What are you saying?
Surgery's your only chance for a cure.
Surgery?
Partial amputation.
You want permission to cut off my foot?
Not your whole foot, but two toes.
No.
Look, if you don't do this,
the infection could spread and you could die.
I'll take my chances.
Mrs. Davillere?
I am walking out of here
on both feet.
Hmm?
Get out of my way!
They just kicked you out of the retirement home?
Nobody cares about the elderly.
Did you get in a fight with your boyfriend?
Which one?
It was a horticultural infraction.
A what?
They didn't like my garden.
Why?
What were you planting?
The usual.
Lavender, basil...
Grandma...
Maybe a little cannabis.
You were growing weed?
It's medicinal.
You don't have glaucoma.
Guess why, sweetie.
I can't believe you.
You're 75 years old.
You're lucky they didn't throw you in jail.
Then I could visit your mother.
She gets out next week.
Identity theft.
It's a victimless crime.
No, it's not.
You're right.
Well, she married
this nice electrician.
Sweet Mexican guy. Pablo.
Well, maybe fifth time's the charm.
Look, Sam, I know we have drama, but we're family.
How long you staying, Gracie?
Just till you throw me out. Not a bit longer.
Okay, Mr. Richmond, we'll see you next week
for your suture removal.
You're still here.
Bus is slow.
Oh. Thought maybe you were having second thoughts.
I know this is a difficult decision,
but the surgery doesn't have...
I'm tired of losing things.
I've lost my husband, my house,
the city where I grew up in.
Damn storm took it all.
You're from New Orleans?
Couldn't tell from my bright smile and stunning glow?
Is that how you got injured?
Everybody begged us to leave,
but we thought it would pass over like Ivan
and all the other ones before that.
When it finally hit,
my husband Duane and I went up to the attic
and broke through the roof.
A boat finally got us
and took us to the 610 overpass.
That's when I realized my foot was cut.
Something in the floodwaters must have hit it.
It's surgery, it's scary,
but you don't have to die from this.
Too many tough choices.
I'm afraid to make the wrong decision.
Then let me help you make the right one.
(groans loudly)
Will you trust me?
I guess I ain't got a choice.
You never said it was Weaver.
You have to fight for her.
I did, but sometimes
I have to make tough decisions.
Why didn't you tell me? It's not your concern.
That is, like, your mantra lately.
What's that supposed to mean?
Never mind. Look.
She's one of the best doctors on the floor.
I know that, but she's also
one of the most expensive. Look.
This is the job, and I don't like it any more than you do.
84-year-old with shingles.
Stop it, you freak!
Lenny Rivers, got punched
by a passerby, fell on his tailbone.
Okay.
Analgesics, doughnut pillow, and discharge.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What about X-rays?
I got to file for a disability claim.
You're not supposed to talk.
Okay. Go ahead and order the films.
Haleh, can I get a percocet?
Yeah, but you may need to be patient.
GI lab can take him at 4:00.
Okay. Let's send off a repeat CBC.
Ben, you got the narcotics keys?
Oh. My bad. I meant to leave them on the admin desk.
Pressure's down to 70 systolic!
Open up the saline. Okay, okay.
Put him in Trendelenberg.
Two units of packed cells,
and let's get Pratt in here.
He's going to need a second line.
Yeah. Intubation tray.
Dawn's from New Orleans, too.
What part?
Seventh ward, by the Florida Canal.
I used to work at Charity. What about you?
Ninth. Over near Jackson Barracks.
I was born at Charity.
You need to sign here, too.
You been back?
I'm not ready.
Are you sure I need this?
Oh, yeah. The infection's deep into the bone
of the second and third toe.
Removing them is the only way to prevent spread.
How long have you been a surgeon?
Um... almost 15 years.
Dr. Dubenko's one of our best.
How many surgeries have you done?
10,000.
What about toes? How many toes?
I've done a lot of toes.
He's good.
You been working all night?
I beg your pardon?
You seem a little tired.
No, no, I'm fine.
I actually slept in my own bed last night.
You have nothing to worry about.
Can we have one of those mirrors
so I can watch my operation?
Oh, no, no,. You're going to be fast asleep.
Dr. Weaver said I didn't have to go under.
Oh, really? Is that what Dr. Weaver said?
Just give us a sec.
Why in the world would you tell her
that she could be awake?
Look, she barely agreed to the surgery.
Just... just give her an epidural.
The anesthesia is better with a general.
She's afraid of the dark.
She's a Katrina victim.
My heart goes out to her, but an epidural can drop her BP.
Look, general anesthesia isn't risk-free.
It's more efficient. Okay, cut the crap, Lucien.
You don't want her awake because you don't want to answer
a bunch of questions.
I'll go up with her.
I'll handle her. She won't get in your way.
Okay.
Second unit is in.
Yeah? Well, hang a third.
Sats are up to 90. Call for a vent.
Already did. Somebody better get his wife in here.
Come on. Talk to me, Ray.
Upper GI bleed. Systolic of 60.
Second IV is in. Ready for blood.
All right. Has he had ulcers before?
We couldn't get a good history.
I think I know this guy. Wasn't he in here last week?
No. First time to County.
Wait a minute. How long has he been here?
About an hour and a half.
And he's just getting a second IV?
We thought he was stable.
No GI bleed is stable.
Hematemesis only once, crit was over 30.
The guy needed aggressive therapy.
Why wasn't an attending involved?
Abby and I both agreed...
You're both residents, Ray!
Get Abby in here right now.
Call the blood bank, stay ahead four units, and get FFP.
I'll fire up the rapid infuser.
You should have anticipated this.
How long will the surgery take?
About two hours.
Can you come sign off out marshmallow girl
so she can get out of here?
Lucien, I'll be up in a minute.
I know you will, Kerry.
What's his problem?
Aw. Control freak. You okay?
It's kind of hard seeing folks from back home.
Your whole family come up?
My aunt let eight of us move in.
Eight? Wow.
That must be hard.
Some moved back to make sure
their houses weren't seized.
The rest never want to go back.
There's no way that that's me!
Well, where did you ship two iBooks to?
See? I don't even live there!
Is he still trying to work out his credit problems?
Mine took years.
Come on. Go ahead, Gracie.
It says you're going to live a long time.
My family lives well into their 90s.
Come on, now. Look in there
and tell me something I don't know.
Well, it says you're going to be very wealthy.
That's what I'm talking about.
Hey, Sam, Curtain Three needs bilateral leg ultrasounds
to rule out DVT.
Okay. Come on, Gracie. I'll put you in the break room.
Hey, Gracie?
Am I going to have good luck?
We'll see.
Call me at 8:00.
(laughing): I love that woman.
He's not even your type, Grandma.
You know what they say: Once you go black...
Grandma!
You still living at the same place?
We were living at this house while I was working part-time,
but it wasn't really the best environment for Alex,
so we just moved.
Is he still playing soccer?
Uh-huh. Indoor now.
He's the best left wing on the team.
How are his grades?
A's and B's. He's doing amazing.
Sweetie, that's great. I'm proud of him.
Of both of you.
Thanks, Grandma.
That means a lot to me.
How's my Xbox 360?
What are you talking about?
Your little clepto of a son is now a felon.
He stole my credit card number,
and has been having stuff sent to your house.
Are you kidding me?
Do I look like the last comic standing?
I bet you that necklace you have on is mine, too.
Amp of epi is in.
No, he needs volume, not epi.
Edgar?
What's wrong with him?
What's going on?
Six units in so far.
Getting harder to bag.
I just went to the cafeteria.
They said he was fine.
He's in pulmonary edema
from the transfusions. What's going on?
He was stable when I saw him.
Your husband doesn't have a doctor, ma'am?
Not a regular one.
Is he going to be okay? So, what?
No past history? No meds? No. Renuvium. He's on Renuvium.
Mrs. Dixon called home, her son
read the name off the bottle.
Where the hell would he get Renuvium?
Some church clinic
on the south side. What church?
First Mission Baptist on Calumet.
What? Do they have a doctor there?
I don't know. I wasn't with him.
God. Oh, God...
Units 11 and 12 are running.
All right. Run the platelets through here.
Should we try more volume?
Maybe GI can scope him.
Not without a pulse or BP.
All right. What's our rhythm? Asystole.
Edgar, honey, please! Please be okay!
Get another four units!
Push another epi! He's already had five rounds of meds.
Should we try an intraaortic balloon? Too late for that.
Let's check a hemocue, PT, PTT,
see where we are.
Pratt. Pratt. It's time to stop.
No! Don't you stop!
This is a reversible condition.
LOCKHART: Not anymore.
42 minutes. We're not going to get him back.
Greg, you know she's right, okay?
Nobody's called it yet.
Please! Please keep going.
Please.
Time of death 1648.
No!
Oh, darling!
(crying)
I won't feel anything?
Not with the spinal anesthetic.
Especially since it's me who placed it.
Do you want pulse lavage?
Three liters, with polymyxin, all in one bag, please.
I was in New Orleans once.
I became addicted to beignets.
Cafe Dumonde's my favorite spot.
Where you from?
London. Really?
I spent a year in college there.
Power set up?
Micro-E set with sagittal saw.
They're prepping to get rid of the diseased bone.
Are you still planning to scrub in
on the robotic prostatectomy next door?
I certainly am. As soon as we finish here.
You should check out this new machine, Kerry.
It's unbelievable.
Ensures perfect nerve-sparing technology
all for the low, low price
of $1.5 million.
The budget committee approved that?
Yeah. They finally cut us a break this year.
NURSE: Culture tubes?
DUBENKO: Aerobic and anaerobic, please.
Infusing.
Bovie.
Good. Now...
isolate the neurovascular bundle.
What does that mean?
They're protecting the nerves and arteries.
BP 80 systolic.
(alarm sounding)
What's happening?
One liter saline bolus, and get her head down.
Is this a reaction to the spinal?
Don't think so-- BP dropped after the antibiotic.
Anaphylaxis?
Could be an allergy to penicillin.
Sats are dropping, 88%.
What did we do?
I must have seen 300 or 400 patients at that church.
Didn't remember the guy.
Is this our fault?
Couldn't this have happened
if he got the drug through a regular prescription?
I don't know.
(sighs)
I have to go talk to her.
You're gonna tell her that we're the ones from the church?
I'm not gonna bring you into it.
But I'll let her know I was the one running the clinic.
(sighs) Well...
Yvonne, we're gonna sedate you
and place a tube to help you breathe.
No, I'm not going under.
Etomidate's going in. Honey,
you're not getting enough oxygen. No.
(gasping): When they left me on that bridge,
I woke up in the darkness... Listen,
Yvonne...
(muffled speaking)
Sats only 81.
What are you doing, Kerry?
I'm getting IV epinephrine. She's anaphylaxing.
I can hear the wheezing from here.
Ari can manage an airway.
No. Her hypoxia's worsening. She needs this.
Hard to bag. We only ever give IV epi for a full arrest, Kerry.
Well, then you're about to learn something new. Are you kidding me?
Dr. Weaver, stop.
Pushing two cc's, one to 10,000.
This should buy you some time to do a controlled intubation.
Kerry, with all due respect, this is my O.R.
I don't care about your O.R.
I lost my job to pay for your robot.
I care about this patient.
SHIRLEY: Easier to bag.
Heart rate's coming down.
Sats up to 95. Go for it, Ari.
RASGOTRA: Looks like the epi worked.
You just got very lucky, Dr. Weaver.
None of this looks like healthy tissue.
DUBENKO: You're absolutely right.
It's into the tarsals. So what are we gonna do?
(sighs): She needs a BKA.
No, wait, wait, wait, you're not gonna amputate below the knee.
Lucien, I-I promised her that she wouldn't lose the foot.
The MRI was fine.
The MRI was three weeks old. And apparently, it's progressed.
Prep for BKA. Let's move the drapes.
No, can't you just take the toes and give her six weeks...
She's diabetic with vascular disease, Kerry, okay?
She'd never heal.
Get me the Zimmer saw.
I love Italian food.
When I was in Venice, they had this tight little joint
had the best fettuccini you ever tasted.
Well, there's no gnocchi like my gnocchi.
So, maybe we can go to the movies this Saturday.
There's a really cool space movie.
But it's supposed to be good for adults, too.
I'll see if I'm working. You're not.
I just made the schedule.
Cool. Then it's a date.
Grandma?
Hi, Alex!
Look at you!
So grown up. Hey! Hey, come here,
you little Artful Dodger!
Alex, what the hell is going on?
What? Did you steal from Dr. Morris?
No. Why?
Where'd you get your Xbox from?
Well, um... uh, Mr. Elliott bought it for me.
Did he buy me this necklace, too?
No. I bought you that necklace.
(chuckles) Alex,
you come here. What?
Now, don't give me any attitude, Mr. Man.
If this was 20 years ago, I could knock you back to China
and not have Social Services on me, but it's not.
So I'm gonna ask you
one time and one time only,
did you steal Dr. Morris's credit card?
Yes or no?
Gracie, just...
I, um...
No, don't stammer, don't stutter.
And look me in the eye.
Did you or did you not steal his credit card?
I'm sorry, okay?
GRACIE: No, don't you say sorry to me, you say sorry
to Dr. Morris.
You know better!
I'm sorry, Dr. Morris, for stealing your credit card.
Well, all right.
We'll figure it out.
You can start paying me back in installments.
That's fine.
Alex, why would you do that?
Hey! No, you... you work and I'll get him.
Hey, Nelson Wilcox, 39, vomiting and abdominal pain.
Hypotensive after a liter. Sam! We need you.
TAGGART: Dr. Morris, I don't even know what to say.
MORRIS: What about my necklace?
Vitals? 92/58. Pulse is 97.
I'm Dr. Kovac. Where does it hurt?
(grunting): My stomach. We were getting fitted
for snow board boots, he started feeling queasy.
'Kay, let's get him on a monitor and start a second line.
He's got chronic pancreatitis from gallstones.
He's supposed to have surgery next month.
CBC, Chem 7, LFT's, lipase and calcium.
He's been feeling good,
so we planned this trip to the Rockies.
(weakly): Call my dad.
He turns 40 in February.
We got 15 people coming.
Don't forget a d-stick. Check for hyperglycemia.
He's gonna be all right, isn't he?
Systolic's down to 78.
All right, another liter, wide open.
Hold on-- lungs are wet. He's either in failure
or he's thirdspacing. Yes, well, either way
he's hypotensive-- he needs volume.
You want to try albumin, 25%?
No. That won't work. I've seen Weaver do it.
IV's blown, and his veins are crap.
All right, sterile sixes
and coitus to me-- I'm gonna throw in a subclavian.
H-He ate this huge plate of waffles yesterday.
I mean, I told him not to do it.
Abdomen's tense. All right, I'll get the ultrasound and call
for surgery. Wait, we don't even know what we're dealing with yet.
I think we have a pretty good idea.
Even if it is acute pancreatitis,
first-line management is supportive care, not surgery.
They need to be involved.
(soft grunts)
Got a flash. Sats dropping, 82.
Mr. Wilcox?
Mr. Wilcox?
You told her you were the doctor at the church?
And that I prescribed the Renuvium.
And she's okay with that, or...?
Well, she understands it was a mistake.
and she's trying to digest what's happened.
You've got to talk to Pastor Watkins.
Oh, yeah, we're shutting it down. Yeah.
I can't leave my post. Yeah.
You're gonna have to page Dr. Gates from the desk!
Oh, come on, there's, like, 50 people over there. I don't care...
It's okay, Jim, it's okay. She's with me.
What is he protecting, Fort Knox?
Well, I didn't know you were coming down here.
I was in the neighborhood.
Wanted to see how she was doing.
You having fun, huh?
Yeah, it's been great-- we treated
this mime guy, and a lady who broke her ankle.
Oh, cool, babe.
So this is
where you work, huh? Yeah, this is it.
You want to see the trauma rooms?
They're right back there.
Yeah. Come on.
Is your little girlfriend there?
Meg. Or is she out buying
IKEA furniture? You know what, we're not gonna do this right now.
Oh, no, now is the perfect time.
Mom, let me show you the break room,
No, Sarah... so Tony can get back to work.
Tony has to clear a few things up.
You're drunk. You were gonna walk out
and move in with that little bitch? Meg...
You're a liar. Sarah, he's done nothing
but lie to us-- that's all he ever does is lie.
Mom, don't.
Oh, speak of the bitch...
Don't walk away from me! Meg...
No, you need to hear this. No, I don't think I do.
Mom, stop it!
I did everything for him! All right, Meg.
I straightened him out Meg...
when he was a mess, when he was just a useless vet!
I used my husband's
insurance money to put him through medical school!
You don't get to have him, do you hear me?!
You don't get to take him from us! Meg!
Where's Kovac?
Trauma two.
Increase the peep. I can't-- I'll give him a pneumo.
PVCs. 100 of lido. He's okay, isn't he?
I mean, he's okay! Isn't he? His oxygen is low,
and it's causing his heart to beat in an abnormal rhythm.
Pulse ox 78.
(crying): He's not dying.
Luka, surgery orders some million-dollar toy
Not right now, Kerry. am I'm too expensive?
We need to talk. Uh, V-tach.
No pulse. Starting compressions.
Charging to 200.
What do you got? Acute pancreatitis, hypotensive despite six liters.
What's happening?
What's happening?!
'Kay, clear. Get back, get back.
Will somebody talk to me?!
He's in cardiac arrest,
and you're gonna have to stand back, okay?
Is he bleeding from somewhere?
His crit's stable. Has surgery been here?
They just want to observe in the ICU.
Well, get 'em back in. 18-gauge spinal needle,
connector tubing, and a manometer.
The guy's in arrest-- we don't have time for that.
What are you doing? Checking for abdominal compartment syndrome.
He's got a fatal arrhythmia.
We should focus on the heart. Look,
his BP sucks because the abdominal pressure
is crushing the vena cava.
Can't ventilate, because his belly's
compressing his lungs.
Okay, hold compressions.
42 centimeters.
More than enough to cause end-organ damage.
Okay, resume compressions.
Ten blade.
Ma'am, what's your name?
Marnie.
Your husband's pancreatitis is causing swelling
of all the abdominal organs.
KOVAC: Another 50 of lido.
Pushing it.
He doesn't need cardiac meds.
He needs to be decompressed.
Luka, you know I'm right.
(gasps) Pick-ups, two sets.
Retract superficial layers.
I'm doing CPR.
He won't need it after this.
Back in sinus with a pulse.
Saline and sterile towels.
I've still got a few tricks up my sleeve.
I can't lose you, T.
This ain't just the booze, is it?
You can't walk out on us!
We're your family!
Family?! Meg, what you did out there,
you call that family?! I work here!
You've been avoiding me.
What did you want me to do?
Move on.
You don't love me anymore.
(sighs): Not the way you want me to.
I'll change!
It's not about that. You can't change.
You'd rather be with that little bitch.
Knock it off.
She has nothing to do with this.
She has everything to do with this.
I'm going to tell you one last time, Meg.
I'm sorry, but it is over.
You don't care about Sarah?
Of course I do.
Well, I mean, do you not want to see her anymore?
I never said that Meg.
Because...
that's what's going to happen if you do this.
You would hurt her just to get back at me?
You're a damn liar.
You prick!
Damn little prick! Knock it off!
Listen.
Listen to me, Meg.
There's nothing you could do to keep me away from Sarah,
do you understand that?
Do you understand that?
It's cold out here.
You should come back in.
I hate her.
You don't mean that.
She's crazy.
That's why Tony's leaving.
He loves you.
You know that won't ever change.
Can I ask you a favor?
Sure.
Find somebody else.
Sorry?
He doesn't love you.
He's just having sex with you.
Sarah... That's what he does.
But he always comes back to us.
When we opened you up,
we learned that the infection had spread.
We had to do the amputation.
I should have never trusted you.
With the new prosthetic legs,
you'll have complete mobility.
Every time I make a choice, it's wrong.
This was the right thing to do.
My husband and I were on that bridge
for 27 hours before a helicopter came
and took us to the Superdome.
And when the buses came, there was only one seat.
I didn't want to go, but he insisted.
And I took that seat.
I left him there.
It was about a week later
when I found out he died in that stadium.
It's not your fault.
I know. It's God's.
Why did he do this?
Take it all away?
He didn't take it all.
You're still alive.
You're getting another chance.
For what?
What am I gonna do now?
You're gonna, you're gonna accept this
and you're gonna go on.
Go home, paint.
Find a way to use this gift
to make sure people never forget what happened.
They can't forget.
You won't let them.
Dr. Pratt, arsenic overdose has an ICU bed.
Call Hematology.
He'll need chelation.
Just the man I want to see.
Did you work on a Edgar Dixon today?
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Why, what's up?
He was getting Renuvium illegally.
Yeah, so I heard.
Apparently, First Mission Baptist is dispensing meds
without a pharmacy license.
I'll need his medical records.
Yeah, but the family's not gonna sue.
The records are for the State Medical Board.
There's gonna be an investigation.
Angela, how's it going?
Okay, just following up a record.
I meant you, your daughter. How's Danielle?
She's better, thanks, Luka,
for everything.
Hey, Dr. Kovac, can I talk to you for a minute?
Yeah. In private?
GRACIE: Whoo, this is nice, Sammy.
Thanks.
You remember when we lived in that trailer?
ALEX: You guys lived in a trailer?
It was a mobile home.
That's uppity for "trailer."
Go unlock the door.
Sure.
Where you from, Ben?
I'm from Georgia.
A little town called Richmond Hill.
I had a boyfriend once in Chatham. He dumped me.
I swear it was for his sister.
Grandma has lots of stories about her antics with men.
Oh. I'm not scaring you, am I?
'Cause you are one of the sanest guys
that Sam has ever been with.
We're just friends, Gracie.
That's what Angelina and Brad said.
Hey.
Upstairs, do your homework,
brush your teeth and go to bed, okay?
Tomorrow we talk about the new rules.
Okay. Go.
All right!
Oh! I'm sorry.
You owe me dinner, right?
I'm so sorry. I forgot.
Uh, okay, we finish unloading
and then I will order us a pizza or...
I've got a better idea.
I'm glad we got past the awkward part.
Yeah.
You need a pharmacy license to dispense meds
and your malpractice insurance covers you only in the hospital.
I know. I...
I was trying to give back.
It's a felony, Pratt.
A man died.
What was I thinking?
I don't know.
This, this goes against everything you've learned.
You okay, man?
I don't know what to do.
Were you the only one involved?
Yeah, yeah, it was just me.
Good. That's good.
I'll, uh,
talk to Angela, see what I can do.
Take a minute, okay?
All right, see you guys later.
Dr. Weaver, I need an attending order for Vanco.
Yeah, can you sign off on my retinal detachment?
Mm-hmm.
Okay, thank you.
Kerry, Kerry, we need to talk.
Oh, it's okay. I'm fine.
Hey, I made a mistake.
What I said before,
you know how it is in this job.
I shouldn't give in to the pressure.
Look, I'm gonna, I'm gonna find budget cuts somewhere else.
There is no way we're losing you.
Thanks, but, uh,
I resign.
You what?
I can't...
I've trained residents,
I've saved lives,
I even ran this place.
I loved it.
And I've probably gotten more than I've given,
but now it's time to go.
Dr. Weaver, what are you saying? Kerry?
It's easy here. It's comfortable,
but that doesn't mean it's the right thing to stay.
MORRIS: Are you gonna go to Florida?
Yeah, I mean, after Sandy died, I... I thought I got over it.
I thought I moved on, but I...
I felt stuck, like I'm treading water
and it's taken a few years,
but now I'm finally ready to move forward.
So...
if you're ever in Miami,
turn on channel six and that's where you'll find me.
And if I'm not there
I'll be on the beach with my son.
Kerry, wait.
Kerry, Kerry...
please. Hey.
Luka, we're all right.
We're fine.
