Previously on ER:
You got one week, Mike, one.
I want you to know, I really
appreciate it.
You won't even know I'm there.
There's just a lot of stuff going on.
Gates?
I want to sort it out. I'm trying to sort it out.
I just need a bit of time.
I work on gay patients all the time.
I work with gay doctors.
Greg, you're a lot more like Dad
than you realize. No...
It's not coming out like I mean.
I sure hope someday you prove me wrong.
Are you my dad or not?
There's a simple test we can take.
It's called a paternity test, and, um...
if you want...
we can take it tonight.
I'm in pain. I've been here three hours.
Yeah, I'm sorry, sir, we're very busy.
You haven't done crap for me. I'll try to find a doctor.
You said that an hour ago, bitch.
You know what? I'm doing the best I can,
so why don't you just settle down, okay?
No, you settle down. Ow!
(groans)
Okay, so what went wrong?
She didn't stay calm.
Her tone was threatening.
She needed to keep
her distance.
You okay?
All right, good.
So let's review the key points of managing assaultive behavior.
I made coffee.
Thanks.
That your history project?
No, I'm paying the bills. Huh?
You've been late three months in a row on everything.
Sarah... I don't want them turning off
the electricity, okay? Is that my checkbook?
You take my checkbook? I'm just making them out, you still have to sign.
Sweetie, I know you're trying to help.
Good morning.
Hey.
Nice outfit.
Job interview.
What kind of job?
Executive assistant.
That's a fancy name for answering the phone.
Maybe he can help with the rent.
We have $90 to get us through the week.
Look, if this thing comes through,
I'll be out of your hair in no time.
Yeah, right.
Hey.
All right, shredded wheat or corn flakes?
So how you been?
I've been all right.
Hey, how about those Cubs, huh?
Catch that game last night?
Some win.
No.
All right. Um...
Okay, so you invite me to breakfast
to talk about baseball.
No, it's something else.
I want to fix things.
CLASS: Neck! Knees! Ha! Good, good.
Nuts! Good! Good! Ha!
All right, Lily. (applause)
Now remember, the goal is to diffuse violent behavior.
This training is just a last resort.
Next.
Come on, Sam. Go. Go. (groans)
Whoo-hoo! Kick his ass, Sam!
Go!
You ready?
(chuckles)
CLASS: Nose!
Come on, you can do better than that.
CLASS: Nuts!
Show me some strength.
All right, I just don't want to hurt you.
I've got enough padding on to stop a tank.
Come on. CLASS: Neck!
I'm worried about you, Sam.
Bad guys will rip a little lady like you to shreds.
Oh, really, you think? Yeah, I know.
CLASS: Knee!
(groaning)
Ah!
Look, I've been thinking about it a lot.
I let you down. I know that.
But it doesn't matter what you want to do
or how you want to live, I'm still your brother.
See, when I pushed you away,
I messed up.
But I can do better.
I think we both can.
Look, it's just like when you moved in.
You know, you...
you could've been a little bit more honest.
You could've told me what was really going on with you.
I didn't know how to tell you.
What, are you in some 12-step program or something?
No, man, it's just...
I spent too many years pushing people away.
I don't want to do that anymore.
That mean you're going to be talking to Dad?
Let me work my way up to it.
I'll give you that.
(chuckling)
It's been five days.
So? So, fever without source freaks me out.
It's a virus. Yeah, or it could be a serious infection
that we're missing.
Look, he's playing well.
He's eating. Joe's not sick.
Well, I'm going to check this, just to make sure.
Abby... What?
What? I got a little urine sample this morning, so?
HALEH: Dr. Kovac.
Bad CHF, Trauma Two.
Okay. Uh, class over already?
It ended a little early.
(door closes)
You're being silly.
If this were someone else's baby,
you'd tell them not to worry.
All right, you're right.
He probably just caught my cold.
Hey, Timmy. You're back.
And better than ever.
Um, can you send this for a U.A.?
Uh, which patient?
John Doe.
A'ight, I'll take care of it.
Officer Litchman needs a room.
Curtain Two.
And hold for a chart.
This is a nice move, we were supposed to be off till noon.
TAGGART: Sorry. Whoa.
Dislocated patella. How'd that happen?
He was teaching the Assaultive Behavior Class.
Nurse here got a little carried away.
Kicks like a mule.
You said bring it on.
I wasn't expecting Bruce Lee.
So how long's this gonna take?
Normally, all day. But under the circumstances,
I'll try to get you out in less than an hour.
Yeah, right.
I'll bet you a donut I can.
Man, you sure know how to get a cop excited.
(chuckles)
Crackles to the apex.
40 of Lasix.
Feels like I'm drowning.
Ever have fluid in your lungs?
A heart attack?
High blood pressure...
high cholesterol.
Can someone call my dad?
"Rutley and Son. Heating and Air Conditioning."
Your dad still works?
He lives with me. I...
I moved my office home to look after him.
HALEH: BP's 195/120.
Okay, nitro drip at 40 mikes.
What meds you on?
Nothing?
Nothing for your pressure? Cholesterol?
Ran out.
How long'd you go?
Long time.
Please call my dad.
He's expecting me.
12 lits here.
What about your doctor?
Who's your doctor?
His name's on my insurance card.
I'll see him tomorrow.
You're in congestive heart failure.
You need to be admitted to the ICU.
I'm fine.
It's my dad I'm worried about.
CHAZ: I was really bummed out
about the way we left things, too.
Hey, man, I'm glad you came down to meet me.
You know, if you ever need anything, I'm here for you.
Actually, I could use a favor.
I'm applying for a part-time job, and...
it'd help if you could write a letter or something.
Huh, what kind of work?
An EMT at the fire department.
Really?
Yeah, money's good,
flexible hours.
Perfect for a student.
EMT, huh?
What's wrong with that?
Well, you know, they're not the most open-minded individuals,
if you know what I mean.
Yeah.
I mean, it's definitely
a "don't ask, don't tell" type of situation.
I mean, if you're gonna fit in,
you got to just be one of the boys.
Well, I know how to handle it.
And if it works out, who knows?
Maybe I'll think about med school.
(chuckles): Don't do it, man.
Really? I see what you do.
It's good work.
Really? So you're thinking about
emergency medicine, huh?
Oh, hell, no. Plastic surgery.
If I'm going to put in all that work,
I need to make some coin.
(chuckles)
No, the swabs were sent in three weeks ago.
Anthony Gates, Sarah Riley.
Yes, I can hold.
Hey, trauma coming in?
Crohn's fistula.
Paternity results never came back.
How's Sarah holding up?
She's all right, she just doesn't want to talk about it.
Must be on her mind. She's moving on.
Today she finds my checkbook,
pays all my bills.
Really? Maybe she can become a CPA.
You know, when I was 12 years old, I stood in line all day
and waited for The Return of the Jedi premiere.
That's all I want her to do. Be a Star Wars nerd?
No, be a kid.
No. They didn't come
in the mail. I didn't get them in the mail.
Can you just tell me over the phone?
KOVAC: Gates. Fine.
Send them again.
You okay?
Yeah. We'll catch up later?
ICU said one hour.
We're going to the cath lab.
Is he stable enough?
Well, we'll stay with him.
If they can open up an artery, maybe it'll reverse
his heart failure.
My dad. Oh, yeah.
We called him, he's on his way.
I got 50,000 in mutual funds.
First National.
Okay. See if his B.U.N. and creatinine are back.
Got it.
Hey, Gates. Hmm?
Who do you know at the CFD in the paramedic training program?
Everyone.
Any of them actually like you?
I'm popular everywhere I go. Hey, Sam,
we need to check a post- reduction film before he leaves.
Yeah, we're just going to the roach coach.
She owes me coffee. What?
You owe me a donut.
So let's say I had a friend who wanted to be an EMT.
Very tough, very competitive.
Lot of applicants. It's my brother.
Your brother?
Family? Why didn't you say so?
I'll be his hook.
His what?
Well, in city fire,
you need someone on the inside
to help you move up, you know?
I'll help your brother out, no worries.
From now on, I'm his rabbi.
(sighs)
What makes you think I'm buying you coffee?
It's the least you can do, after you destroyed my knee.
Oh, it's not even broken.
Your kneecap just slipped out of place.
So where'd you learn moves like that?
In high school.
That's a hell of a P.E. class.
Yeah, took a little Muay Thai, some Krav.
Yeah, I had to learn to protect myself.
From the football players who wanted a date to the prom?
(chuckles): No.
From the metal heads
who wanted a quickie behind the Dairy Queen.
(chuckles)
Damn, you know, you're full of surprises.
Sam!
(yelling in foreign language)
(tires screech)
(screams) Move, move, move!
(clattering)
How's your guy?
Good vitals.
What about the driver?
Ask Bardelli.
Any neck pain? No.
Do not move. I'm okay. Ow! God!
I put my knee out again.
Easy, fella. (speaking foreign language)
Is he altered?
Kind of hard to tell.
Let's get him on a board.
Sam, open up a trauma room.
Got it.
That idiot came out of nowhere.
You think he's drunk? I don't know.
PRATT: One, two, three.
Sir, what's your name?
Do you speak English?
(speaking foreign language)
Got to assume he's altered.
Yeah, pupils equal and reactive.
Hey, guys...
(speaking foreign language)
All right, let's start with a trauma panel and a C-spine.
Can you unlock the door?
I'll tape his head down.
Look, just unlock the damn door!
Whoa! What's the matter?
Something's moving in there.
Two more victims.
Oh, man! Looks like we got
an adult male and a little boy, both unconscious.
Excuse me.
How much longer?
Your son's still up in the cath lab.
So it'll be a while?
It's hard to say.
Should I wait right here?
Let's get a cup of coffee, Mr. Rutley.
We can try 1.25 of I.V. enalopril.
Okay.
Is that you, Danny?
Yeah, I'm Dr. Kovac. Hi.
Wayne Rutley. What is all this?
Uh, during the cath, the fluid in his lungs got worse
so we had to put a breathing tube down his throat.
Are you having any pain?
Sir, he can't talk with a tube in.
Are you a relative?
A home health aide.
Is this a heart attack?
It's a cardiomyopathy.
A what? His heart is squeezing very weakly.
He's young.
He's got a good heart.
He's had untreated high blood pressure for a long time.
He's always working.
He never gets to a doctor.
Been short of breath lately?
I just met him today.
Danny calls an agency when he goes out to bid on a job.
He... he thinks I need a baby-sitter.
His eyesight's not so good,
and he has memory problems.
Were they aluminum ducts?
I told you, you need galvanized sheet metal.
Tight wheezing, he's barely moving air.
Trauma One, let's get Gates on this.
Head lac, good vitals. Okay.
Little guy's concussed. GCS 14.
Okay, good. Exam Two, both of them.
Might take a little longer this time.
Yeah, I know. Some of the others look pretty bad.
Hey, next time we go out, I'm driving.
(man speaking foreign language)
Does anybody know what language this is?
Sounds like Farsi, maybe?
Kid needs a line.
Grab a buretrol from Trauma.
(man speaking foreign language)
Hey, take some deep breaths, okay?
Give the medicine a chance to work.
Hey, Bards, Cap Mahoney still with 43's?
Had pancakes with him this morning.
Have him check his e-mail.
You picking up shifts?
No, it's about an EMT applicant.
Cap Mahoney's on the EMT selection committee.
Key player. Oh...
Hey, Pratt, what am I missing?
Uh, tight asthma.
He might be biting plastic soon.
Everyone else is stable.
Dr. Kovac!
V fib, paddles are charged.
What happened?
Clear.
(gasps) HALEH: Normal sinus.
Got a pulse.
Thank God.
Is your son married?
He never met the right girl.
And your wife?
She passed in '82.
You're doing better, Danny.
Open your eyes.
90/65.
Up the dopamine.
Hang in there, pal.
Hang in there.
More cricoid.
Sats are dropping. Pull out.
His cords are way anterior.
He's getting harder to bag.
All right.
Sam...
Kid's starting to open his eyes.
Okay, good. Look, I need an ET view now.
All right, be right there.
Head CT's clear on flower guy.
Oh, good news.
You need a Farsi translator?
Oh, yeah. He's got a head injury,
so he... he might be disoriented.
(speaking Farsi)
(speaking foreign language)
(speaking Farsi)
(speaking foreign language)
He doesn't speak Farsi.
I think that's Armenian. Sorry.
Any Armenian nurses up there?
(speaking Armenian)
Hey, that's him.
(speaking Armenian)
Hey, how do you know this guy?
He saved us.
Where's my brother?
Oh, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
Julio, it's me, Tomas!
You got to move it to the right.
That better? No. He has asthma.
Yeah, we figured that part out.
They're brothers.
So how'd this happen?
We were going
to the drugstore. He couldn't walk.
Then he couldn't talk.
The guy with the flowers threw us in the back
and drove to the hospital.
So Yakov over there is the Good Samaritan.
Aw, damn it! Bag him up!
He dropped his spray, if you need it.
No. Okay, come on, Tomas.
There's a better place to wait.
I want to stay with my brother.
Yeah, but it's okay.
We'll be back in a few minutes, okay?
You want to try fiber optic?
Nope, I want Sam.
I got a guy who's not breathing.
Okay, I can wait.
I'll be there soon.
Got everything.
Pulse ox 89.
All right, sats are good enough to tube, huh?
No, I want a cushion. Let's get him up to 95.
All right, we'll wait.
There's a little tiny camera at the end of this tube.
Uh-huh. You're all set.
All right, slow down, Lily.
He's got a long expiratory phase.
Hey, I can get a copy of last year's EMT exam for your brother.
Good.
We're up to 92.
All right, grab an end tidal detector, will you?
Also, we'll find out who's doing the interview.
You know, find out his hobbies,
his favorite sports team, stuff like that.
Okay.
All right, we're up to 95.
All right, cool.
Is it okay if I do this?
(sighs) I'll give you one shot.
All right.
Need a laryngoscope?
Yeah. No.
No. Just watch the screen.
And pass it through the cords.
Right. I knew that.
All right, come on. Let's go.
All right, taste buds...
tonsils...
epiglottis... and the promised land.
Straight shot through the cords.
All right, bingo. Stopping short of the carina,
and bag him. Nice.
Looks like Kovac could use a hand in there.
Oh, yeah. Doesn't look so good.
All right, uh, thanks for letting me do this.
This was a good thing for me to learn.
HALEH: V fib.
KOVAC: Can you take over compressions?
No problem.
Okay, another amp of epi. Charge to 360.
Good. Shock him.
It worked before.
Clear.
Still in fib.
Mr. Rutley, we're not making much progress here.
What's that supposed to mean?
His heart is too weak.
It's not responding to our medicine.
You, you're not giving up?
No, we're not giving up.
I just need you to understand
that it's not looking good.
You're saying he could die?
It's a possibility, sir.
Oh, he's, he's my son.
(voice breaking): He's my little boy.
Don't leave me, Danny.
(quietly): Call the social worker.
Don't leave me!
Don't leave me!
I'm in pain. I've been here for three hours.
I'm sorry.
You haven't done crap for me.
Oh, don't start that again.
Look where it got me last time.
All the docs are busy. I need an order for I.V. sedation.
Can't you pop it in?
Without painkillers?
I've been shot before. I can handle it.
Uh, I think a doctor should do it.
Come on, Sam, don't be a wimp.
Just pop this baby back in place, so we...
Oh! Oh...
Hey,
hey, tough guy?
Wake up.
Asystole.
GATES: Resuming compressions.
Mr. Rutley, it's been 45 minutes.
Should a cardiologist see him?
They'd do the same thing.
It's too late.
No!
No, no!
We're gonna stop now. I'm sorry.
Danny...
Danny!
Oh, my God!
(sobbing): Oh, my God!
What am I gonna do?!
Sir, there's a social worker here
that can help you.
How could this happen?
How could this happen?! How could this happen?!
(sobbing)
I'll do the coroner's paperwork.
(sobbing)
I'll make sure he's taken care of.
(sobbing continues)
Danny...
Tidal volume 700, AC of ten. Okay.
How's the X-ray look? Good?
Ah, well, he might have a small pneumo.
Call Radiology for a wet read. Okay.
How long's he going to sleep?
Mm, might be a while.
After he wakes up, we can go home?
Well, you know, he's gonna have
to be here for a couple days.
Can I stay with him?
Yeah, but you're gonna have to go home at night.
By myself?
No, we're calling your parents.
No, it's just us.
Ever since Mom died,
Julio's my guardian.
You don't have any aunts or uncles?
Okay, we'll figure it out, and you can
hang out here for now.
All right?
Good. I'm staying with you, J.
I'm gonna stay right here.
Hey, tough guy, wake up.
You need a doctor?
Uh, no, he just vagalled.
I'll check his vitals in a few minutes.
Abby, urine's clean on John Doe.
Oh, great.
No leuks, no nitrates. Thank you.
Hey, Timmy, repeat knee on Litchman.
Okay, wait.
How does a ten-day cruise turn into two months?
(laughs) Gracie will fill you in.
Yeah, she's not talking.
Okay. After we docked in Singapore,
I showed her some of my old haunts.
We climbed the temples of Penang,
we cycled the Quang Ninh coast
and we elephant-trekked through the Ratanakiri.
Elephants? Yeah.
In fact, we got hung up at the Cambodian border, and we'd still be there
if Gracie hadn't tapped into her 401K.
That's too much information.
Hey, Miranda, how's he doing?
102?
Well, did you give him the Tylenol...?
Okay, well, call me after his nap. Bye.
No relatives, no long-term care insurance.
The guy worked all day,
took care of his dad all night,
but didn't plan for this.
Take-home lesson?
Don't assume you're gonna outlive your dad.
Abby, Pratt says you need social work for your asthma kid.
Thanks.
Gates, don't get too busy.
There's a guy out in the lobby looking for you.
(clipboard clatters)
Hey, I thought we could grab lunch.
You have five minutes. How'd the interview go?
Not so great.
Not so great. You didn't get the job, right?
No.
What happened?
Well...
What?!
I don't know anything about Word.
And what the hell's Excel?
So it wasn't a good fit.
Since when do you need a computer to do a day's work, huh?
What about, uh, Chuck Mooney's construction company?
He sold it.
What about, uh, what's his name?
Your friend, Billy Prior's restaurant?
Turned it into a yoga studio.
Something will come up hopefully. No.
You know, actually you can... you can help me out tonight.
I don't want Sarah cooking. Why don't you, uh...
why don't you go to the grocery store,
get some groceries, and, uh, cook dinner tonight?
I can't take your money.
Just do it.
You used to love to cook at the firehouse, right?
You loved cooking. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I could do a chicken pot pie.
Maybe a London broil. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
The boys always liked my London Broil...
Surprise me. Surprise me.
Patients are in the hall, Abby.
Water pipe burst.
Okay.
Um, Rose Nichols?
That's me.
Hello.
I'm Dr. Lockhart.
Let's see... fever and a cough.
For almost a week.
Okay. How you feeling?
I'm a little under the weather.
Yeah, well...
There's a lot of colds going around,
and sometimes it takes a couple of weeks,
but kids usually get over it.
81?
Maybe we're not getting a proper signal.
Let me see.
Uh-oh.
What?
Sounds like pneumonia.
And her oxygen level is really low.
So I think we're going to have to admit you.
Everyone said she was fine,
but I knew it was more than a cold.
Okay, he's cleared for discharge.
(speaking Armenian)
How are the boys?
Oh, they're doing well.
(speaking Armenian)
What?
He's asking you for a date.
Oh, well, we'll repeat the head CT.
I think he's still altered.
(speaking Armenian)
I didn't know you were here.
Yeah, I just got here.
Ah, it's lots of trauma today.
I heard.
The guys from my old band--
they're playing this Saturday night at Exit.
I might be on call.
So we're still waiting?
It's only been a week.
Okay. I'm gonna go clear some of these beds, all right?
Okay. See ya.
Sarah...
Have you seen Tony?
Well, I can look around.
No, I'll wait. Okay.
Or maybe you can help me.
Sure.
It's kind of personal.
Okay, come on.
I need a vaccine.
Which one?
HPV.
To prevent cervical cancer.
Right.
But the school nurse gives it,
and you need your parents' permission
or your grandparents' permission.
They wouldn't understand.
Does Tony know about this?
Not yet.
You gonna tell him?
No.
It's private.
It's okay.
I mean, you can tell him.
If you want to.
Why didn't you go to your pediatrician?
He only takes care of little kids.
Besides, I think I need a new doctor anyway.
Do you know a good GYN?
KOVAC: So you can't place him?
The best I can hope for is a crappy nursing home
that'll except $100 a day from Medicaid.
He's not sick enough for a nursing home.
He needs assisted living.
Neither Medicaid nor Medicare will cover that.
And he can't afford it.
What about the son's assets?
They'll be tied up in probate for a year.
I've tried three board and cares.
They want cash... today.
Greedy bastards.
But we've got a bigger problem.
I'm not sure he's competent
to consent to nursing home placement.
He didn't seem that altered.
His Alzheimer's gets worse as the day goes on.
KOVAC: Sundowning...
We need someone with durable power for his health care decisions.
The son had it.
A lot of good that does us now.
We're scrambling to get an emergency state guardian.
Hey, any luck finding a foster home for Tomas?
Piece of cake compared to this.
Dr. Pratt.
You called for a wet read?
Uh, yes, I did.
A possible pneumo.
Excuse me, please.
I haven't seen you in a few weeks.
I was doing an invasive fellowship in Dallas.
For six months.
Really?
Well, I sent you a few e-mails.
Never got any of them.
Well, you must have changed your address.
I've had the same address for seven years.
So, you think there's some pathology here?
Palpitations like your heart skipping a beat?
More like it races every now and then.
Hey, Ray, can I get you to look at a knee?
Yeah. Excuse me.
(monitor alarms beep) It's happening!
Get the crash cart.
My chest is going to explode!
He's got a pulse. 100 of lido.
Anything surgical?
Uh, stable V tach.
(alarms stop)
Responding to lidocaine.
Ah, that's better.
Well, I guess you won't be needing me, then.
BARNETT: A milligram a minute.
Titrate up. P.R.N. ectopy.
Uh, hey. Hey.
I left a consult on your asthma guy from the crash.
Thanks. RECORDING: Diagnosis-- accute lower G.I. bleed, probable...
Did you know Sarah was here? Huh?
She's asking for the HPV vaccine.
You're kidding me? Does that mean she's...?
No. We didn't get that far.
She wants the whole world to know how grown up she is.
Well, I wouldn't worry about it.
It's just a phase that girls go through.
KOVAC: Gates! Coming.
RASGOTRA: Good luck.
Thanks for your help.
I'll hold.
It's a miracle. We got a guardian assigned
and two nursing homes to choose from.
Great. Thank you. You're welcome.
Think he'll be able to decide
which one he wants to go to?
Well, let's hope so.
Hello, Mr. Rutley.
Hello. Uh...
When am I leaving?
Well, that's what we're here to talk to you about.
What's there to talk about?
We've found a couple of places that can take you tonight.
What kind of places?
Convalescent homes.
Oh... I have a home.
Well, you're going to need help now getting around... meals.
No, I have help, I have meals.
We eat dinner at 7:00.
Somebody ought to call Danny-- tell him we're going to be late.
Wayne...
you know about Danny.
Remember?
Sure. He went out to bid on a job this morning.
He ought to be home by now.
Wayne, you know Danny was in this hospital today.
What? Danny?
Nah, Danny's not sick.
He had a heart problem.
What?
Nobody told me anything about that.
His heart stopped beating.
We worked on him for over an hour.
Where is he?
I...
He's better now?
He died, Wayne.
(gasps)
Danny's dead.
No.
No!
No, I don't believe it.
That's not possible.
Where is he?
I want to see him. Where is he?
He's, uh... he's in the morgue, Mr. Rutley.
What?
Take me there.
Take me there.
(sobbing)
Take me to my son.
Please, please, I want... I want to see him.
I need to see him.
I want to say good-bye.
The CDC recommends starting the HPV vaccine
when you're 11.
All right, we need to talk about this.
Okay, let's talk.
HPV is a sexually trans...
I'm not having sex, okay?
But when I do, I want to be responsible...
Even if I said yes, your grandparents have to sign off on...
Okay. Do you realize how stupid this is, though?
I'm old enough to go and get birth control on my own,
but you won't let me go and get a vaccine
that could save my life.
Sarah, you're 12 years old.
Yeah, I know.
What's the rush?
I'm not rushing.
But I can't help it if I'm
growing up now, can I? (groans)
Need you to fill out transfer papers for Mr. Rutley.
All right, I'll be there in a second.
Can we continue this at home, please?
So I can't get it now?
Not today.
That's so unfair.
(sighs)
All right, we got you five days off work.
Hmm, I have a self-defense seminar tomorrow.
Want to fill in? (chuckles)
(monitor alarm beeps) Oh, crap.
V tach again!
It's the third time. I need Ray.
I'm on lidocaine and amiodarone.
Shouldn't I be in the ICU?
Hey... (alarms stop)
Have you been faking this this whole time?
No, I had an itch. BARNETT: What's going on, Sam?
What are you doing?
Is it his heart?
No, it's his finger.
Ah.
(alarms beeping)
(gasps)
Uh-oh.
V tach again.
Sam...
It's a shockable rhythm.
Shockable?
KENNY: Uh, no. Clear!
No... (yells)
Crazy bitch!
Yeah, you're the crazy one.
Sam, have you lost your mind?
Come on, it's only ten joules.
Really?
Oh!
(gasps)
Yeah, I guess that's not so bad.
It's called a negative Mach band.
Looks like something's there, but it's not.
Doesn't even exist.
Wow.
It's a retinal phenomenon.
The eye is fooled at a light-dark junction.
Always something new to learn.
Glad you're back. Thanks for the help.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
How 'bout, um...
we grab some dinner sometime after work?
Maybe.
Call me.
Danny.
Pick up the phone, son.
If you can hear me, pick up the phone.
Uh, you... Oh. Is this one yours?
Yeah, yeah.
I don't like leaving messages on the machine.
Mr. Rutley, let's get you back to your room.
I need to call my son. He doesn't know I'm here.
Please.
(men yelling in Armenian)
Guys...
Guys... hey, hey, hey, hey!
Hey! Knock it off!
(shouting stops)
I-I'm sorry. I-I'm upset.
My brother-- he totaled my van!
Yes, but aren't you happy that he's okay?
Without van, my business is dead!
All because he drives like madman!
Sir, he saved someone's life. Yeah.
What are you talking about?
He was speeding because he had a sick patient in the back.
(speaking Armenian)
(speaking Armenian)
I-I'm sorry. I didn't understand.
(speaking Armenian)
Hey, Pratt. Yeah.
I need you to sign the discharge.
All right. You got any questions, man?
Yeah, can I go out on crutches? (chuckles)
It's hospital policy. Wheelchair is safer.
Oh, all right, I'll make an exception.
All right.
(gasps) Hey, Joe.
Hey, how you feeling?
I missed you. Hello.
His temp's down, but he didn't want the bottle.
Oh, my God, look how big he's getting.
Yeah.
You need me to stay?
No, thanks. Have a good night.
(Joe fussing) Shh. Shh. I know.
Hey, Sam, is Exam Two open?
Uh, yeah.
Oh, look. This is where Mommy works.
Look. Greg, I need a favor.
Okay.
You're taking me home?
You're going to a nursing home.
No, those places are for old folks.
That's where you're going to live.
No, I told you, I live with my son.
Mr. Rutley...
Hmm?
I, I spoke to your son.
Oh. Is he, is he picking me up?
He wants you at the new place.
He does?
Is he gonna be there?
I'm sure he'll, he'll find a way.
So... so we can have dinner together?
If that's what you want.
Eh, I guess it's okay.
Tell him I won't start eating till he gets there.
Hey, Luka, I'll be right with you.
Well, all right, Officer.
You're on your own.
Thanks, Sam. You've been great.
I think your day might have been
a whole lot better if you never met me.
Not so sure about that.
Hope I see you around.
Yeah.
(mutters)
You need a pen?
Uh...
Oh, oh, see?
"Rutley and Son.
Since 1959."
Well. Thank you.
When we started,
it was just me.
Now Danny's got four guys working for him.
He's a good kid. Hmm...
I'm a lucky guy.
Take care, Mr. Rutley.
Yeah.
Are you okay?
Yeah. Yeah.
Are you, uh... still in touch with your father?
Not since I was three. You?
He's in Croatia. I haven't been there in a long time.
(door opening)
Hey!
What's for dinner?
Spaghetti.
There's more in the pot.
I'll go shopping after dinner, okay?
I don't think so.
We have to eat.
Come on, Sarah, I know what you're doing.
What?! Cooking, shopping, paying the bills.
Somebody has to.
I want you to be a kid.
Please, just enjoy being a kid, okay?
Right. I forgot.
I'm supposed to text my friends all day
and hang out at the mall, right?
What's wrong with that?
I like taking care of the house.
Just let me do it.
When you become older, you'll have plenty of responsibility.
(door opens) Trust me.
(slurred): Hey...
Smells pretty good in here.
What is that, lasagna?
(dishes clattering)
Where are the groceries, Mike?
Oh, shoot.
I knew I forgot something.
Right. Sarah, go do your homework.
I'm not finished yet.
Now!
I gave you a hundred dollars.
I know. For food.
How much you got left?
I don't know. Give me your wallet.
Tony... Give me your wallet!
Six bucks?
Six bucks?!
Well, it was Lou Sanders' birthday,
and so I bought a couple of rounds.
(groans)
No otitis, no pharyngitis, no nothing.
You sure?
Yeah, I'm sure.
This is the healthiest kid
I've seen in a long time.
Really?
Really.
Really.
Okay.
Well, you know, the baby-sitter was in the neighborhood,
and she was worried so I, I thought
I'd get a second opinion.
I see.
Thank you.
(gasps) There's Daddy.
Say hi.
Hey. (speaking Croatian)
What's he doing here?
Um... I don't know. It's a warm night.
I thought we could all take a walk to the pier.
Nice. Let me go grab my coat.
I guess, uh... his urine tested negative?
Pratt doesn't think he needs a CBC?
No.
I know, you think I'm acting crazy.
No, I think you're acting like a mother--
a slightly crazy one.
Did you dispo the Alzheimer's dad?
Yeah.
Poor guy.
It's so sad.
Ah... he's lucky.
What?
He doesn't have to remember losing a son every day. Hey!
(cooing)
(babbling)
(murmuring)
How're you gonna keep a job if
every single little problem sends you right
back to the bar? I don't need
that kinda job. Well, you need something.
I am a damn firefighter.
I rush into burning buildings,
I axe my way through roofs that are collapsing.
I save people's lives, and now some snotty rich kid
is trying to tell me how to make his coffee,
how to answer his phone, send me back to the copy room
because I made a little smudge on his page.
It's not right.
For 35 years, every time I thought
it was gonna be different
I could always count on you to screw up.
I had a bad day.
"I had a bad..." It's always something.
What are you going to do?
I don't know.
Ah. You don't know.
Well...
You, uh... you can't live here.
I'm family.
I'm your father.
Is that what you think?
Oh, screw you, you little bastard.
Screw you!
I worked my ass off for you and for your mother.
I admit, I-I may not be the best at home stuff,
but I supported my family.
I paid for your braces, for your books
and for your mother's fancy clothes
and I never got a moment's thanks from either one of you.
Well, you may not like me,
but you owe me, you ungrateful little prick.
(Mike shouting in distance)
(loud clattering)
(sighs)
Sarah.
(music plays over headphones)
Sarah.
What?!
Take those off.
So we didn't get a chance to finish.
Do you want to, uh, do you want to talk?
Here.
When did this come?
Two weeks ago.
I was kinda hoping that you were my dad.
But maybe there's still a way I can live with you.
We'll see.
We'll see what we can do.
