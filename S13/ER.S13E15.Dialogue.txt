Previously on E.R.:
(crying): You can't let this happen, Tony.
No!
Come on, Mom, you've got to wake up.
What they got you for?
I helped some people get some medications they needed.
PRATT: Thanks for bailing me out.
I'll make sure you get your money right back... Greg.
I told you to shut it down.
Why didn't you do that?
Oh, my God.
I got a little boy and a man with extensive burns!
It started downstairs.
In my apartment.
I want you to put your hand in that vise there.
I want you to feel that.
(screams)
(whistling)
Plenty more where that came from.
There we go.
Here, come on.
Come on, eat.
I've been slaving over a hot griddle all morning for you.
Please, at least try it, okay?
Here you go, there's a fork.
Satisfied?
No, I'm not, and I'm not going to be satisfied until I hear,
"Wow, Tony, I can't believe you made me
your world famous pancakes." Wow, Tony,
I can't believe you made me your world famous pancakes.
All right, here's your lunch.
It's time to go.
Are kids gonna act weird to me today?
No.
I don't want to talk about Mom.
You don't have to.
Are you sending me to live with Grandma and Grandpa?
Why do you ask that?
Isn't that what you were talking about at the funeral?
We were talking about a lot of things at the funeral.
I don't want to live with them.
I want to stay here with you and your crummy pancakes.
Bye. Bye.
X rays show your lungs are improving.
Oh, good.
I need to inhale.
Well, if your oxygen level stays up,
you can go home in a few hours.
Tell Timmy.
He's been worried sick about me.
(chuckles quietly)
So has Alex.
How is he?
He's, uh... he's been acting weird.
You think he did it,
don't you?
I know I blew out those candles.
I don't believe it.
He's a good boy.
You know, he's stealing Dr. Morris' credit card,
he's disrespecting you.
I don't know what to think.
If he did do it,
I'm sure it wasn't on purpose.
Do you think Alex started that fire by accident?
I think you should continue
to take him to that therapist lady.
As far as the police go, they think it was a candle.
Let it go at that.
BARNETT: Well, I'm glad to hear he's doing okay.
Yeah, he just needed a little time for the hand to heal.
Look what we have here: not one but two late doctors.
The Blue Line was stuck.
Some bozo jumped in front of the train.
Where's your main man?
Um, he's gonna take one more day.
Yeah, no problem, I got it covered.
Then cover this.
Some suit came from upstairs
and said to give that to who's ever running the floor.
Damn. Damn.
Where's Pratt?
You suck balls! (groans)
Hold still, ma'am.
Hold still yourself, bitch!
Can we give Benzos IM?
That'll take a half an hour to work. Okay.
All right, I got access.
What do you want? Four Ativan?
(scoffing): Ativan? Haldol? What?
You're ruining my high, you retard!
Pratt, we need to talk.
Yeah, I'm a little busy here, Morris.
Get me midazolam. Okay.
Faster onset, knock her down in less than a minute.
Can we, uh, step outside, Greg?
Yeah, sure, soon as she settles down, Morris.
Settle on this! Watch out!
Pratt, I-I'm, I'm really sorry, but I'm gonna have to...
You're gonna have to wait, Morris.
Please, one minute.
Let go of me! MORRIS: Pratt.
You scum of the earth. Pratt!
What?! (screaming)
The Medical Board suspended your license.
Hey, uh, can we talk?
Yeah, sure, what can I do for you?
I was Pratt's accomplice.
Excuse me?
I, I helped him at the clinic.
What? I know, I know.
It seemed like the right thing to do at the time.
I can't believe this.
Look, I told Pratt that he didn't have to protect me,
but he wants me to stay out of it.
Well, listen to Pratt.
(sighs)
I'm gonna burn in hell, aren't I?
No.
I mean, you might have some explaining to do.
Hey, I'm sorry about this, man.
(sighs)
I thought I could at least work half a shift before the hearing.
Well, it's just a formality.
They'll reinstate you.
GI bleeds from NSAIDs happen to thousands every year.
MARQUEZ: Morris,
Abby's asking for you.
Her guy in One is throwing up.
Be strong, brother.
Fight the power.
TAGGART: A liter wide open?
Yeah, and ten of reglan.
Okay, does it hurt here?
(groans)
No, but if you tug on Willie,
I'll sing Dionne Warwick's greatest hits.
Tempting, but no thanks.
No, really, I...
(groans)
I thought that's why you put the gloves on.
Seriously, I have a latex fetish.
I even tried to give myself a Brazilian
using rubber cement once.
Didn't work, but I got into Hustler
as one of those guys who has the three, uh...
All right, I get it, yeah.
Ever had food poisoning?
I puked once after biting into a Red Hot with stretch marks.
Okay, uh... we have to run some tests
to rule out anything serious like appendicitis,
but after that,
hopefully we can discharge you.
What's up with this guy? Vomiting,
low-grade fever, exam is equivocal.
(laughing): Doc, Doc...
You gotta get me out of here, man.
I got a hot date tonight.
Does, uh, she take air or helium?
(chuckles)
She takes Visa, but that was funny.
Can I use it?
Sure.
Do you want me to image the belly?
No, hydrate him. He may spiff up.
Uh, four of morphine, antiemetics.
We'll get you out of here.
Just sit tight.
Okay, you're about to meet the Grassos.
She's been on dialysis since 2002.
He's got a kidney, but they don't match.
And our exchange pool paired them up with two cousins
who are in exactly the same situation.
Yup. Kidneys for everyone.
Hi.
You guys set?
You bet.
No more dialysis, no more infected shunts.
This is Dr. Rasgotra.
She's going to be assisting on the transplant.
I am? Ah, well,
someone's about to get some A-1 kidney meat.
I'm like a, I'm like a racehorse.
I can drink a six-pack without even peeing.
Honey, gross. Actually,
micturition capacity is related to bladder size
and neural sensitivity, not renal function.
Then, we'll give 'em some bladder, too.
(all laughing)
Okay, I'll see what I can do.
Do you guys have any questions?
Concerns?
No?
Okay, I'll see you in the O.R.
Our goal is to enroll 200 donor-recipient pairs.
By mixing and matching,
we'd find kidneys for almost 50% of them.
Wow. Yeah, I'll introduce you to the Herrero cousins.
They're right down the hail.
So Marina's getting a kidney from one cousin
and Thomas is giving his to the other.
Yep, kind of like a kidney key party.
Key party? Except the donors and the recipients
aren't allowed to meet.
That could get a little messy.
(pager beeps) It's the E.R.
I'll catch up to you.
What's a key party?
Oh, it's a little gimmick
to help swinging couples pick their partners.
Forget it.
Before your time.
Sounds dirty.
(child screaming)
Jessie, come on, hold still.
If he's got lice, you're cutting his hair.
I'm a doctor, not Vidal Sassoon.
Abby, I need you.
Funny boy keeps throwing up.
Okay, Ray, you got this, right?
Hey, n-n-no. Don't leave me here.
Don't... (screaming continues)
Did you give him the reglan? An hour ago.
It should be working by now.
It's probably just gastroenteritis,
and if your labs are okay, we'll get you home.
Ugh... forget home.
I got a gig at 10:15.
The big room at Zanies.
I've been trying to get in there for a couple of years.
You're a comedian?
Aspiring.
You should aspire a little harder.
Ah, a heckler.
Don't make me go K-K-Kramer on yo ass.
Aah!
Yo, blondie, no need to get violent.
Four of zofran. Repeat P.R.N.
Ah... geez.
May I?
(sighs)
Lay down, Simon.
Oh, my gosh.
I got to practice my routine.
I got to change my clothes.
I was going to wear this shirt,
but now I got chow mein all over it.
We're trying to get you better.
Ooh.
How long you been doing stand-up?
Moved out here from Detroit a couple of years ago.
Very courageous. Yeah,
my old boss pushed me into it.
'Cause you were funny at work?
(grunting): No.
'Cause he fired me twice, hated my guts.
My dad also had a lot to do with it.
He hated you, too?
No, he died.
Life took on a whole new perspective.
All right, I'm gonna call the lab,
try and see what's taking so long.
Just relax.
I will try to relax.
I will.
(vomits)
We spent four weeks e-mailing each other.
We finally meet and he sticks me with the bill?
So you chased after him and you fell into a hydrant?
I would have caught him, had I been wearing my flats.
All right, your breath sounds are perfect.
Lay back for me, will you, please?
So what if I told him I look like Cindy Crawford?
He said he looked like Matt Damon. Did he?
More like Matt Damon's fat uncle's ass.
(Gates and Marquez laugh)
Pulse ox 98 on room air.
Tell me if this hurts.
Aah! Yeah. All right...
You have a broken rib.
I'm gonna give you something for the pain
and, uh, we'll take an X ray, okay?
Percocet, CBC,
and 2-view chest.
So you out of here, man?
Yeah, I guess so.
Well, hopefully it'll just be temporary, huh?
(sighing): Yeah, that'll be too bad for you.
Good luck, Dr. Pratt.
Yeah, thanks, Timmy.
Dr. Pratt. Yeah.
You're gonna be okay.
God is on your side.
Yeah, well, let's hope so.
Okay, I could go with you.
I just did the overnight.
I'm almost off. Hope, go home, get some sleep, okay?
PASTOR WATKINS: Dr. Pratt.
What are you doing here?
Uh... I'm going with you to your Medical Board hearing.
No, I'm okay, really, please.
Hope, come pull the PICC line for the guy in Two.
Okay, I got to take this.
What about it, Greg?
The Church's support couldn't hurt.
You're still operating the clinic
that got me into this mess.
Look, I'm just trying to better the community.
Yeah, what are you doing about black male incarceration?
I have a sermon on it next week.
Okay, make sure you tell 'em
how you and your program got me there.
Greg, I just want to help.
My license is suspended.
I'm facing jail time.
I think you've helped enough.
So how'd it go with the counselor?
Uh, wasn't what I expected, but nothing in my life ever is.
What did she say?
She, uh...
wants me to enroll Alex
in an academy for at-risk youth.
Which is a code word for "nut jobs."
My kid's not a nut job.
He's just going through some stuff.
Well, maybe it's some stuff that he can't handle.
I know about those places.
They starve them and beat them.
I can't... send him there.
Well, I could help you check some out,
see if there's any that might be okay.
Thank you.
But I, uh...
need to do it alone.
I'm really sorry that I dragged you
into everything in the first place.
Don't worry about it, Sam.
I...
I really like you.
But I have to focus
on Alex right now.
And I don't have time for any kind of a relationship.
All right.
I get it.
You do?
I do.
Your kid comes first.
So take as much time as you need.
Is there any discomfort here?
No.
Do you have a boyfriend?
Uh, not exactly.
We're still defining it.
Mmm. A girl like you doesn't need the Internet.
I haven't had a Valentine since Jimmy Bachner in sixth grade.
Ouch! Oh.
She's into S&M.
If you want her to stop, say "mayday."
It's the safe word.
(chuckles)
Mayday! Mayday!
There's no right upper quadrant tenderness, liver is fine.
Let's observe her for two hours,
check another CBC and follow serial exams.
Hey. Wait up.
You okay?
Yeah. You?
Yeah, yeah.
Got home from Wisconsin yesterday.
How's Sarah holding up?
It's not gonna be easy.
I can imagine.
Listen, I should've called. Look...
Go. I'm sorry. No, I should've called.
It's just, the funeral was awkward, the relatives...
It's okay. No, Neela...
I'm fine.
I'm sure you've got a lot on your plate.
I mean, you've probably got
two plates and a little saucer.
Yeah, a heart-shaped saucer.
It's Valentine's Day Wednesday.
Let's have a quiet dinner, huh?
Yeah, we'll see.
LOCKHART: Hi, guys.
I-I've got surgery.
Neela...
She all right?
I don't know.
What about you?
Lockhart, your comic's CBC is back,
and it ain't funny.
White blood count 32,000 with 60% blasts.
He has leukemia?
With all the immature white cells,
he's anemic, neutropenic.
Oh, great.
MITCHELL: Did you see the AMJ's article on integrative medicine?
BAXTER: You know the whole world is falling apart
when a study on Reiki
(chuckling): makes it into the Journal.
It's sexy, but the Dan-A wouldn't touch it.
The design is totally flawed.
Um, excuse me.
Hi.
Hey.
Are you Dr. Williams from Evanston?
Uh, no, I'm Dr. Pratt from County.
Take a seat.
RASGOTRA: I've isolated the artery.
DUBENKO: All right, Neela, clip it.
CRENSHAW: You're letting her cut the artery?
She knows what she's doing.
What are the pertinent anatomical relationships?
Anterior to posterior,
it goes renal pelvis,
renal vein, and then artery,
which is clipped. Good.
Come on, any third- year medical student
could have answered that question.
All right, what structures make up the cortex?
The what?
The cortex of the kidney.
It's that bean-shaped thingy
you're cutting into.
RASGOTRA: You mean like the proximal tubules
and the distal tubules?
CRENSHAW: And renal corpuscles.
Medulla...
Loop of Henle and...
Mmm...
SHIRLEY: Your Valentine needs
a surgical consult when you're done.
RASGOTRA: My Valentine?
SHIRLEY: Gates.
Oh, young love is so sweet.
He's not smart enough for you.
You don't even know him.
Come on, Gates is easy math, Neela.
Okay, that's enough. Artery is ligated.
MANISH: Dr. Dubenko, the donor kidney
is prepped and ready to go.
Excellent timing. Have them send it in.
How did Mr. Herrero do?
No complications, minimal blood loss.
They're closing now.
That's great.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, where you going?
Where you going?
Is that where you do the anal probe?
Sam, can you grab the zosyn?
I liked the other room.
No need for an upgrade.
3.375? Yeah.
Uh, Simon... Yeah.
I need to talk to you about something important.
I can feel it, too.
I wasn't gonna say anything, but I do feel the sparks.
(chuckles)
Your blood tests show that you have leukemia.
Thank God.
I thought you were gonna tell me I had cancer.
Leukemia is cancer, of the white blood cells
in the bone marrow.
That's great, that's great.
So just give me some Viagra,
send me home, and we are all good!
This isn't funny.
I know.
Okay, you're gonna need to go on I.V. antibiotics.
I know, I know, I know.
I got leukemia about a year ago.
I had induction chemo and a bone marrow transplant.
And now, a year later, it's back.
Why can't cancer be like herpes?
I got that once, and it never came back.
Herpes doesn't go away.
This is Zanies, Doc.
You jam there, you get invited to,
to Second City, to SNL.
You could get a spot on Letterman.
You know, my dad,
he put hubcaps on Buicks.
Buicks.
Before he died, the last thing he told me was,
"Don't be another auto worker
"wishing you coulda, woulda, shoulda.
Don't be like me, son."
I have to get you started on antibiotics.
Hey, hey, hey.
I go on at 10:15.
10:35, I'm all yours.
There's not gonna be a show tonight. I'm sorry.
If you want to make it to next month,
I have to get a CT, a surgical consult and check on chemo.
Sorry.
Hey, Timmy, can you call GI and order an EGD report for me?
No problem. Thanks.
Hey. Got time for a coffee?
Yeah. Everything good? Actually, yes.
I just had the coolest surgery, and I figured we could talk.
Sure.
Dr. Kovac. Hello.
I thought you weren't coming in today.
I heard you were short attendings, and I got bored.
You okay? You look good.
You good? Yeah.
What are you doing here?
Uh, I talked to Timmy, and he said
you guys could use some help.
Um, Neela, can you look at this?
My patient Simon's CT is back.
Gates, some school principal's on the phone for you.
Appendicitis?
Hello.
She's crying?
No, I understand, I understand.
Let me talk to her, please.
I mean, look at his cecum.
There's wall thickening and distension.
Hey. No, I told you you didn't have to go to school.
Yes, I'll come pick you up.
Hello? Let me talk to your principal.
It's typhlitis. Immuno-compromised hosts Yeah, her mom died.
can get a cecal infection. I can be there in half an hour.
Surgery?
GATES: Sounds like a good idea. Treat with I.V. antibiotics, unless he perforates.
GATES: No, no, thanks for calling. And then would you operate?
Well, normally, given his leukemia, I doubt he'd survive.
GATES: Hey, listen, uh... So...
So?
GATES: Yeah, her mom died.
She's having...
So nothing.
No surgery for him.
Okay, thanks.
Neela, I'm sorry.
Sarah's having trouble at school.
I got to pick her up. Okay.
I'll call you later, okay?
Um... I'm gonna go and grab a coffee.
Do you want anything?
Yeah, I'll tag along.
These people don't have insurance.
They can't afford to see a doctor.
Some can't even buy medicine.
That's not the point.
I thought, with some guidance,
the clinic could be a good thing.
Why not send them to County Hospital?
Have you ever been to County?
Trained there 20 years ago.
Well, nowadays, we're filled with critical patients.
Some people come in for a prescription refill,
they wait up to 12 hours.
So this was about convenience?
This was about helping people.
There are programs for that.
Yeah, you're right.
If you're over 65 or you have dependent kids.
Regular folks with low-paying jobs,
they don't qualify.
This clinic took care of those people
who fell through the cracks.
Four O.R.s, four patients, four kidneys,
all being worked on at the same time.
Went like clockwork.
We were this fine-tuned machine.
I mean, this morning, two people were wasting away,
waiting for a kidney that they thought would never come.
Now, they're upstairs with their donors eating Jell-O,
done with dialysis forever.
It's amazing, right? That's pretty cool.
Yeah, that's what it's all about, you know?
That's why I became a surgeon.
Hey, Ray, you want to give us a hand?
I need to take this, okay?
MORRIS: I thought, what's a healthy 14-year-old
doing with strokes?
I figured there's got to be more to the story.
So I went back to the parents, and, yes, uh, kid's adopted.
And?
Undiagnosed sickle beta thal.
Kid didn't get screened at birth.
Wow. Nice pick up.
MORRIS: Thank you.
Oliver Miles, burned his hands
trying to cremate his dead cat
in the microwave.
I tried the fireplace, but I couldn't get it lit.
Partial thickness to the hands and forearms.
Tachy at 120, BP 130 over 78.
Pulse ox only 91.
Okay, let's start him on five of albuterol by neb.
So I thought a crematorium is just a big oven, right?
Another four of IV morphine.
I don't know what he ate last, but it's like, he just exploded.
KOVAC: Whoa! Oh!
I got it, I got it.
Do you know if-if someone has my cat?
Uh, ABG with carboxy-hemoglobin level,
portable chest and 125 of solumedrol.
RAY: No problem. Trauma Two.
I'll be there in a second.
You okay? I'm fine, Morris.
Your hand's not.
No. This was just an accident.
Go home.
Rest. I promise, we'll be okay.
Ooh-hoo! (laughs)
Hey, Luka, I didn't know you were back.
I'm not.
How are you doing?
Better now.
Take care, Gracie.
Sure you don't want to wait till I get off?
I don't really feel like sending you home by yourself.
I'm not going home, Sammy.
I'm taking a-a little cruise.
This way, you and Alex can bond.
We can bond with you here.
You need time to sort through all this.
Oh, God, Grandma,
the only thing I ever wanted to do was raise a good kid.
(laughs) He got the crazy gene.
Oh, thank God, it skips a generation.
You and I were both spared.
You think?
(laughs)
It's gonna be all right, Sammy.
He's going through a phase.
It's rebellion, and then he'll come back around.
The good ones always do.
Yeah, well, what if he's not a good one?
He's yours, isn't he?
Mmm.
You're going with Timmy?
The Lido deck awaits. (laughing)
Only old people take cruises alone.
Hey, Abby,
which one do you like better?
"Thank you, folks. It was great to be here,"
or just, "That's all folks.
Now go home and beat the kids."?
Simon, you have an infection
in the cecum, where the small
and large intestines join up.
Maybe I'll just say, "Go home and beat the kids,
but don't forget to tip the wait staff."
Yeah, listen, were you...
Did you hear me-- what I said to you earlier?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I feel... I feel better.
I just need you to buff me up.
Well, I can't, because you have no immune system.
You cannot fight this infection.
I don't need my immune system tonight.
I need my funny bone.
I spoke to your oncologist.
You're out of treatment options.
You have a poor prognostic karyotype.
11 Q 23 translocation.
Exactly.
And because the leukemia's recurred twice,
you don't have any options for chemotherapy.
(heavy sigh)
Okay, okay.
Okay, so just... put me in some trial.
Make me a guinea pig.
I've always wanted to run on a big wheel and drink
from a drip bottle.
There isn't any trial,
and it's probably a matter of weeks,
not months.
(panting)
Is there anyone you want me to call?
Yeah.
A cab.
What are you doing?
I'm getting the hell out of here.
Look, you can't. Simon, you can't.
What do I have to lose, huh?
I don't want to walk on the moon,
or bang Barbara Bush.
(breathing heavily)
Look...
I want to get on that stage and make an audience laugh.
You can't go!
I have to go!
Have you ever wanted to do something
that just... scared the hell out of you,
but you knew you had to do it?
Well, this is it for me.
All right.
(panting)
All right.
Maybe a blood transfusion will give you some more energy.
Come on. (grunts)
I just need to be able to...
stand up.
Or sit down.
Maybe I could be a sit-down stand-up.
All right.
I'm gonna have to have you sign out against medical advice.
If I just took anyone's advice,
I'd still be checking taillights in Detroit right now.
And if anybody asks, this was not my idea.
Shh!
HIGGINS: How did you keep track of your patients?
I used five by seven cards for patient information.
And you have a complete H and P on a five by seven card?
Well, we had limited records, just the important information.
Where'd you keep them?
In a box.
A box?
And if your patients had medical care other places,
was there a system for other health professionals
to access this box?
No, but they could have paged me, I guess.
BAXTER: Would you say your record system met the standards
the Medical Board has set?
Come on. We were in a church.
And did you log the drugs you dispensed?
Did you record the lot numbers?
No, not fully.
HIGGINS: Not at all.
Isn't that right?
MITCHELL: Are you aware
that this is a violation
of the Medical Practice Act, Dr. Pratt?
I never claimed that this was a full-service medical center.
I didn't charge any money.
I was just trying to help these people.
And do you think you helped Edgar Dixon
when you prescribed him Renuvium?
GI bleeding is a common side effect of NSAIDs.
The same thing could have happened to him
if he had been prescribed the med anywhere.
But it didn't happen to him anywhere.
He went to you, and it killed him.
Are you aware that diversion of narcotics
is a felony, Dr. Pratt?
I didn't steal any narcotics...
You don't recall providing hydrocodone and ibuprofen
to Ms. Nancy Campbell?
Mrs. Campbell had gallstones.
So you took a narcotic medication sample
logged into the emergency department.
MITCHELL: This is a felony
punishable by imprisonment, Doctor.
Yeah, she was suffering.
I-I wanted to help her.
I volunteer for a free clinic myself,
and we follow the rules.
We keep accurate records,
we dispense medication
with proper safety precautions, and we're there
for our patients, Dr. Pratt.
You remember the part about doing no harm?
Well, that applies to you, too, sir.
Excuse me, I'm sorry.
Sir, we're in the middle of a meeting.
I'm Pastor William Watkins at First Mission Baptist.
I'd like to speak on behalf of Dr. Pratt.
Sorry they haven't taken you back to your room yet.
MARINA: I just got a new kidney.
I'm not gonna sweat the small stuff.
Oh. Hello.
Happy Valentine's Day.
Nothing says "I love you" like a bag of urine.
How'd my donor do?
Well, they're fine,
but because of everybody's privacy,
we're not really allowed to discuss it.
Listen, this person saved my life.
I want to see him--
or her-- just once,
so I have
a face to think of in my prayers.
How's it going?
Okay, so the Democrats took over the House
and the Senate.
How long before the Republicans jack up the rent and evict them?
That's pretty funny.
Oh, why aren't you laughing, then?
I am. No, you're not.
Hemocue's up to 11 after two units.
Antibiotics?
LOCKHART: Zosyn is in, Tobra's infusing.
(loud groan)
I got to go pee-pee.
That's good. Your kidneys are working.
(groans)
Hello! Hello!
Quiet on the set.
Thank you very much.
Doc, I can't pee in bed.
I've been standing up since I was four.
Pressure's been pretty good-- 101/68.
All right, get him a screen.
Try to sit up and dangle your legs.
All right. Let us know if you're feeling dizzy.
I'm good, I'm good.
I got a little flop sweat,
but then, that happens to the best of 'em.
Someone's got to go with you.
Oh. I got a nervous bladder and a neurotic sphincter.
Seriously, it sucks.
I can't pee in public,
and I'm afraid to fart in case I start a fire.
We'll wait on the other side.
It'll be a good test.
Of what?
The Emergency Broadcast System.
Oh, that is good!
Oh, man, this will work.
Pee is funny.
Bedpans-- funny.
Catheter-- not so funny.
Maybe we can downgrade to tele from ICU.
(sighs)
(thudding and screams)
Oh, God. Okay, I got him.
Get him on the bed.
Come on, one, two...
...three. Three.
(groans) Pressure's down-- 60/40.
Great. He's septic.
All right, another two units of packed cells.
Start dopamine at ten mikes.
LOCKHART: Simon, can you hear me? Open your eyes.
Come on, open your eyes! LOCKHART: Can you hear me?
All right. TAGGART: Sats are dropping.
Put him on 100% non-rebreather.
Open an intubation kit.
Come on, buddy! LOCKHART: Come on, there's a spotlight
on the curtains, and they're calling your name, Simon.
Hey, baby girl.
Dopamine at 12 mikes.
Systolic's up to 110.
Good. Run in the fourth unit.
Hey.
Am I on next?
How's it going?
What happened?
You took a little nap.
Okay, little prick.
It's just 'cause it's cold in here.
MORRIS: All right, you got
to keep that on, okay?
You know what? Sats are 100. Hey.
Why don't we try a nasal cannula, five liters?
Abby, how about our deal?
Working on it.
What deal?
I thought we could try to buff him up
so he could perform tonight.
He's septic.
His BP's dropped so low, he needs continuous
I.V. pressors.
What the hell does that mean?
Means you're not going anywhere tonight.
Can we talk outside? Please?
(sighs)
You do realize that you are asking me
to break the most central rule of this entire program?
It's a dumb rule.
Why is this so important to you?
'Cause it's important to her.
Part of him is gonna be part of me for the rest of my life.
Oh, come on, Manish.
Okay, fine, but if Dubenko finds out...
Dr. Rasgotra, what are you doing?
We're just waiting on some labs.
What?
Doesn't even make sense. Come on, man.
Couldn't you do any better than "Waiting on labs"?
I'm not a doctor. Okay.
Can I talk to you for a minute?
Look, we're not supposed to do this....
Yeah.
...but this guy saved her life,
and she wanted to be able to see him in her prayers.
Yeah, n-n...
Dr. Crenshaw-- Dusty-- I mean,
I know it's unethical, but it's nice,
and sometimes, people like to do things
for other people just to be nice.
Neela...
have I mentioned how well you're coming along?
(whispers): Yeah.
Okay, we're good.
Okay. Well, he's right over there.
Which one is he?
He's the one on the left.
Your husband's kidney went into the other guy.
MARINA (whispers): Thank you.
Thank you.
You know, Morris, it's his dream and he's going to die.
Yeah, and he's going to do it here and not on some comedy club floor.
His blood count is okay. He's had antibiotics.
His pressure is dopamine dependent.
Well, what about intermittent pressors?
There isn't one. Epinephrine?
He can't leave here on a drip.
Well, I can give him six epi pens, 0.3 migs each.
He gives himself a shot once every 20 minutes...
Are you out of your mind?
Why not try it? No. No, I'm not doing it, no.
Then I'll find another attending. I'm running the floor.
Then get some balls.
I've got balls.
Well, they're no good unless you use them.
Fine. Fine, you want to play Super Doc?
Great. Turn off the dopamine,
give him epi and show me that his pressure
can stay up for at least 20 minutes. Fine.
Fine.
PASTOR WATKINS: Nobody builds
hospitals or clinics in the inner city,
because they know these people don't have any money.
They're leeches on the system.
So they...
they go out to the 'burbs and put up
medical facilities on every corner like Starbucks,
leaving us with a hospital that's
overrun, understaffed and underpaid.
There are free clinics.
Most think they're for people with drug problems
and sexually transmitted diseases.
We're talking about regular folk, here:
black and brown people who just need prescriptions.
Dr. Pratt knew the system was flawed and tried
to help mend it. I've got a whole
congregation who'll attest to the fact
that taking away this man's license
would just be another demerit on a system
that has already failed them.
The epi pen is spring loaded, so all you have to do is press
it against your thigh, and it fires off a shot. Ah...
sounds like my high school years.
(giggles)
Can I use it during my act?
As long as you pull your pants down.
Aha!
Luckily, that's my big finish.
Or should I say my average size finish.
Whoa! All right, all right.
Pressure's dropped again. How long since his last epi?
Six minutes. Push point two,
start dopamine mix up levophed. Damn it.
This was a dumb idea. Epi has a one-minute half-life.
I have a body part with that same problem.
(chuckles)
That was a good joke.
BP 89 over 64.
You know what the best thing about getting leukemia is?
MORRIS: Hang another liter of saline and a unit of packed cells.
Everybody comes to see you.
The guys from the plant came.
My ex-soccer coach came.
Even Father Dunlevy came.
It took three orderlies to get him out of the pedes ward.
That's a keeper.
You know,
I was gonna kill tonight.
And instead, I'm dying.
MORRIS: Sats are dropping, 92 on five liters.
I would've left your name at the door, but...
something tells me I'm not gonna make it.
Finish your act.
Hey.
Hey. I, uh, brought you some food.
Thank you. That was sweet of you. Come in.
Thank you.
Sorry I couldn't talk earlier.
Oh, it's okay. Forget it. Everything all right?
Yeah, I just, uh, came by to say "hi".
Hi.
Hi. Uh...
Sarah okay?
Ah... we're just sitting down
to watch a movie. Want to join us?
Uh, no.
I'm not gonna stay.
Listen, can I... can I talk to you a second?
Yeah.
I've been wanting to tell you this.
Remember the night when we were out there
with Meg in the car?
And at one point...
...she grabbed me and pulled me down to her
and... and she said,
"Tony, Sarah's yours."
"Sarah is yours."
Is it possible?
It was 13 years ago, you know? We were messed up,
the three of us, high.
Keith would disappear for days and, you know,
Meg and I...
it just happened, uh...
It wasn't a secret.
So you mean she could be your...
And that never occurred to you before?
Well, I mean, I thought about it at first,
but then... years went by
and I... just believed what everyone else believed--
that she was Keith's. SARAH: Tony, I can't pause this forever.
I should go.
Neela, that's who I used to be,
it's not who I am anymore. No, it's okay.
It's no big deal. Go watch your movie.
(door opens and closes)
You know, you didn't have to do this.
Well, you know that whole
black male incarceration bit got to me.
You'll be okay, Greg.
There are laws in this world that we have
to follow,
but then there are God's laws.
He'll have the last word of this,
just you watch. Come on.
Hey. Hey.
What are you doing here? Look, you covered for me,
the least I can do is support you.
All right. Come on, sit down.
Dr. Pratt,
the Board finds
that you have violated the Medical Practice Act
and believes that these transgressions
are adequate justification to suspend your medical license.
However, in light of your attempt to help your community,
we have decided to put you on probation for one year.
Your practice will be monitored.
You will need to perform 100 hours
of community service.
Perhaps finding a way to legalize a certain
church-based clinic would be a good use of your time.
(chuckling)
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
Dr. Pratt!

Hey. How did I do?
You brought the house down.
Thank you...
...for being such a great audience.
(TV playing low)
*

(footsteps)
Hey, you.
Hey. I decided to put our CDs on the iPod.
We don't need all these anymore.
I need to talk. Is everything okay?
Um, you know, when you were on the roof,
I was thinking about what... what I would do
if Joe didn't have a father,
and, um, if we didn't have
each other.
And I realized that if we could get through this,
we could probably get through anything.
What's going on?
I mean, have you ever wanted something
so much, but...
it scared the hell out of you?
See, here's the thing, I just... well, I changed my mind
and I was wondering if you could ask me again.
What?
Ask me again.
Ask me to marry you.
(giggles)
