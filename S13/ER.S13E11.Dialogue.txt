Previously on E.R.
You should come to my Bible group sometime.
I think you'd really like it.
(laughing): Bible group? Okay.
Do you think I'm gonna hang out waiting for you
to find out that he's just jerking you around?
You're making me think about the way I want my life to be.
This is Ben Parker, he's a new R.N.
Let me buy you a drink or take you out to dinner.
Like a date?
When I was a paramedic, we used
to run homeless kids like this.
Please just help Paulie.
I can't. Paulie's very sick.
I know your secret name.
Mayday.
There's a crazy, angry guy following us?
(grunts)
Listen to me, Ames.
Come near my family again, I'll kill you.
It was kind of fun...
till the chemo kid called me "Rudolph's skank."
One of them asked me if you were Sleepy or Sneezy.
(gasps) What?
I'm an elf, I'm not a freakin' dwarf.
(laughing): Oh, my God.
Oh. Nice antlers.
You guys look so cute.
I got to get my camera.
No, that's okay, really.
Well, was it fun at least? Yeah.
Pedes was a war zone.
Heard you lost the pool. Sorry. Yeah, yeah.
I gotta say, that's one hot lookin' dwarf you got with you.
You know what? I'm an elf, damn it.
Whoa. Whoa. Oh, hey.
As we commemorate the birth of Jesus,
I find myself contemplating the vices I have been guilty of.
And also the virtues that I--
that all of us born in sin and striving for sanctity--
should aspire to.
Turning our pride to humility,
our envy to compassion...
Our anger to mercy?
Mm-hmm.
Our laziness to activity.
Our greed to generosity.
Our gluttony to moderation.
And last but not least, our lust
must be turned to...?
Archie?
Um... consummation?
(laughs)
(group members laughing)
Yeah, no, no, seriously.
Um, our lust must be turned to...
purity?
Uh, well, I was looking for "chastity,"
but talk about purity a little.
Well, you know, I've... I've always taken it to mean
purity of spirit as opposed to a literal, corporal purity.
Mm-hmm, go on.
Uh... well, you know, we all live in the modern world, right?
And our virtuousness shouldn't be locked
into some antiquated notion of abstinence.
Should it?
Well, shouldn't it?
So, um, you're saying that you can be sexually active
and, uh, still retain moral purity?
Well, not just me, sister, if you know what I'm saying.
Nice, yeah.
Well, 'cause-- well, no, no
because, 'cause what I'm actually saying is,
at the end of the day, it's just, it's just us in the mirror
and we're the ones who determine our own moral value.
To me, that's what--
that's what Christmas is all about.
So... you're not mad at me anymore?
This is the first time in a week I've seen you smile.
Well, the holiday spirit is just so infectious,
I couldn't help myself,
and, um, I was waiting for you to lighten up.
Really?
I was waiting for you.
(laughing): Don't try to be charming in that ridiculous outfit.
Huh, me, charming?
Mm-hmm.
Back off, Rudolph.
Be nice.
You be nice.
You're not going to get your special present.
Mm, what kind of present?
Mm... a slightly naughty one.
(both giggle) My favorite kind.
(door opens)
Dr. Kovac.
Sorry. You got a minute?
Yeah, sure, sure, yeah.
It's about Curtis Ames.
He's filed an order of protection against you.
A restraining order.
That's ridiculous. Yeah, well,
the judge who issued it doesn't think so.
The guy says you threatened to kill him.
What?
Look, you should have let it go, doc.
Now you look like the crazy one.
Rufus Taylor, 35.
Going 60 on the Dan Ryan, crashed into an embankment.
Icicle shattered the windshield, I couldn't see.
BARNETT: Icicle, huh?
Came out of nowhere.
It was really big.
Anything hurt, man?
My stomach.
All right, Trauma One, let's go.
Gates, what's the RTS on this guy? The what?
RTS-- revised trauma score.
It correlates better than GCS
with traumatic brain injury.
Traumatic brain what?
You'll be fine, sir. What's the matter with you?
My shift was over.
I couldn't leave because you weren't here.
I was five minutes late.
All right, ten minutes. I'm here, now go.
Look, you have remedial command of the basics.
I can't leave you alone. I would love to, believe me,
but it wouldn't be right, all right?
(groans)
(lively party chatter)
Hey, merry Christmas, Neela!
Where have you been?
On the floor. I thought we were rounding.
What?! No.
The surgery Christmas party is the one time of year
we can forget about disease and death
and celebrate goodness and kindness.
I admit I would prefer
black tie, sashimi, and Veuve Clicquot,
but still, it's Christmas
and I love it.
Yeah. Are you all right?
Sorry, it's got to be this punch.
There's nothing even remotely alcoholic in the punch, Dustin.
Right, okay.
Uh... gotta go.
Neela, I want you to meet Manish Mayta.
He's going to be helping us out around here a while.
Hi. Hi.
Uh, can I get everybody's attention
for a second, please?
Everybody.
Listen up for a sec.
(taps on glass) Thanks.
Listen, it's fitting and appropriate at this time
of charity and compassion for me to be able to announce
the opening of Chicago's only Paired Exchange Program.
(cheering, applauding)
And as an additional yuletide treat,
we will be doing our first kidney swap today.
(cheering, applauding)
Why don't we all get back
to work before we crash from the sugar high?
(laughing)
Mm.
Neela, Rob.
You guys know each other, right?
Neela Rasgotra.
I've heard a lot about you.
You have? Well, you're the golden girl
Dubenko created a special residency spot for.
That's memorable.
God, you must really be something.
(laughing): Okay, then.
It's nice to meet you, Rob.
The pleasure is all mine.
Would you excuse me a minute?
(both laughing)
You went to where Ames works?
Well, the police wouldn't do anything.
Then you threatened to kill him
and I'm the one who overreacted?
You think I made all this up?
I think you got carried away, yeah.
I went to his work to make him stop, to scare him off.
Well, mission accomplished.
He's scared-- he can have you arrested
if you get anywhere near him.
Look, I didn't know what else to do, okay?
I did it because I love you and I love Joe
and I wasn't going to let that asshole keep threatening us, okay?
So, it wasn't too geeky, was it?
Geeky? Lord, no.
I mean, God, no. I mean, no.
No, I enjoyed your Bible group.
They were impressed by you.
What you said was really advanced.
Really? You think?
Yeah, I do. Oh... donuts.
Ha, ha.
The perks of authority.
No. No, no, no.
Wh-What does this look like?
Gluttony?
Gluttony. Exactly.
I was just testing you.
(chuckles) Save these for the kids.
Lenore Simpkins, found down on the street
on 18th and Aberdeen.
Pulse ox is 91, looks like frostbite on the fingertips.
It's cold out there.
Hi, Lenore, I'm Dr. Morris.
I would wish you a merry Christmas,
but as an employee of the county,
I am duty-bound to respect the separation of church and state.
Are you kidding?
Is he kidding?
I think so.
Hey.
Hey. You got plans tonight?
Yeah.
Yeah, me, too.
With Ray.
That's cool, right?
(laughing nervously): It's none of my business. Okay.
I just wanted to be sure.
You look annoyed.
Well, your friend from vascular went in
almost ten minutes ago.
Yeah, I could tell you kind of aggravated his problem.
What problem?
Rob's got a little auto-stimulation issue.
You know.
He can't help tickling the Elmo, spanking his monkey.
That's how he got his nickname.
What nickname?
We call him "McCreamy."
Mc-Creamy?
(exhales) Oh, hey, guys.
Sorry about the wait.
It's okay.
God, it was great to finally meet you, Neela.
I hope we get to work together soon.
I gotta go.
How's that, Lenore? Better?
Mm-hmm.
What are you doing for the holidays?
Uh, you mean besides taking my kid
to go see Return of the Evil Zombies?
Well, maybe before you go home,
you could let me buy you that drink?
I... don't know.
I got presents to wrap.
Lenore, were you recently hospitalized?
I was at City of Mercy till last night.
What for?
Chest cold.
Winter's been hard.
How long were you there?
Mm, a few days.
I'm not good with time.
And did they release you?
The lady at the hospital said
the ambulance was gonna take me back.
Back home?
Don't got one.
I make my own way.
Well, then where'd they drop you off?
They left me in a alley near 18th Street.
I haven't slept in that neighborhood in years.
Second unit's infusing now?
I need sterile tens and a cordis.
He needs central access.
This is not a good teaching case. I'll handle this.
I know how to put in a line, Ray.
Mr. Taylor, we need to do an operation
to stop the bleeding in your abdomen.
Is there someone you want to be here with you?
No. You sure this can't wait?
I-I don't really want this, not today.
It's okay, you'll be fine.
No, it's just that my karma's not so good right now.
It's not the best time to go under the knife. Don't worry, sir.
Here at County, we treat the naughty as well as the nice
all year round.
We'll take good care of you.
I promise this is the best thing.
TELLER: Mayday. OR 2, Dubenko should be waiting.
Psst!
Mayday!
Yeah, uh, go on, I'll be right up.
Lizzie's sick.
Teller, we were worried about you.
Lizzie's sick. You need to come.
Was she your friend?
Does she have what Paulie had?
I don't know.
You need to come.
All right, wait there.
Pick up the old chart from records
and get the echo from C.I.C.U.
What about the toilet bowls, Ray?
I haven't scrubbed them down yet.
Tony, come with me a minute?
Thank God you're here to save me.
Whoa, where do you think you're going?
What, do you have a toenail extraction
you want me to take notes on?
Are you too advanced for this stuff?
Look, if we have a problem, man, just spit it out,
'cause I don't speak "bitchy."
Oh, you seem pretty fluent to me.
Get somebody else, my intern's busy.
Ray, stop being an idiot. I need Tony's help.
And you, too. I've had enough.
Why don't you either slap each other silly
or kiss now and get it over with?
She got bad last night. Pains everywhere.
Tell me where she is, and I'll send an ambulance.
No! I'll take you.
Doesn't work like that.
Please.
You helped Paulie.
You heard about Paulie?
I came back a few days after.
The man at the desk said he was at the care unit.
That's good, right?
Come on!
If she's sick, she needs to be in a hospital.
She can't walk and she won't go to a family again.
Teller...
You come-- Mayday and you.
She can't. We can't.
You have to.
Or else I'm scared Lizzie's gonna pass.
All right, I'm out of here.
What? No. You can't go.
I got no Kovac, no Weaver and no Pratt.
I'm flying without a net here.
I'd prefer to be outside of the ER
when it crashes and burns to the ground.
What? Yeah, that's what the Vegas oddsmakers
say will happen the first time
you're the only attending on the floor.
Melia!
What...?
What are you doing here?
Daddy...
Daddy?
BARNETT: Great, another one of Morris's
petri dish kids.
Wait, Morris has kids?
Four, that we know of.
Hope, could you please...?
Right, no, I will take her to the break room,
get her all settled in. Come on.
Read her a story or something.
What?
Hey, Morris, it's important, I need a half hour.
Okay. Come on, it's slow, you can spare...
You just say "okay"? Yeah.
Me, you're trying to leverage,
him, you're just gonna let him go?
You're a resident, he's an intern.
I have a date.
So? My daughter's here, Ray-- my daughter.
You don't see me shirking.
Fine, go. I'm already over you.
Hey, Sam, you have a car?
Uh, I heard snow, I took a train.
The truck's in the shop.
I got to check on a patient for Neela.
Hi, can I talk to your supervisor?
Hey, what about Malik?
Is he around?
No, he's not in today.
This is the second time I've called.
Can you ask her to call me?
Sam Taggart.
Mercy said she walked out on her own, as far as they know.
Some administrator's gonna get into it.
Looks like they already have.
What? Hey! Hey, hey, hey.
Where are you going? She's not ready for transfer.
You the nurse on this one? Yeah.
We're from Mercy, we're gonna take her
off your hands. You're gonna what?
Our supervisor said it was all a misunderstanding.
Are you taking me back outside? No, uh-uh.
You're not taking her anywhere
until somebody explains what's going on.
Come on, a patient ended up in the wrong place.
Let's not blow this out of proportion.
BEN: No, you heard the lady.
Turn it around.
How far is this place?
Just across the bridge.
(car horn honking)
Hey, watch it, jerk off!
I heard you needed a ride.
MELIA: What's the pancreas do?
It makes hormones that help you
process sugar in your blood.
What are hormones?
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Well, they're...
Okay, okay, you'll find out about that soon enough.
I was thinking Dr. Seuss, not Dr. Rosen.
It's okay. I like gross stuff.
Honey, Melia, it's so good to see you.
What are you doing here?
I ran away.
Why, sweetie?
Because of Donald, Mom's new husband.
He won't let me celebrate Christmas.
He says there's no such thing as Santa.
No, he didn't.
He says there's no elves,
no reindeer and Christmas is just made up
so people will spend money.
No, that's crazy.
So I decided I would spend the holiday with my real dad.
That's you.
Crystal meth-- some nasty stuff.
Makes you lie.
Makes you paranoid.
I'm clean now.
Good for you.
It's too late.
My wife, my kids
moved away as far as they could.
I m-m... I messed up so much.
I missed so much when I was high.
(breathing irregularly)
This is where they live.
(paper tearing)
Oliver's 11 now, and Julia is nine.
They've gone so many years
without hearing from me on Christmas...
Mr. Taylor,
I fully expect this surgery to be a success.
I-I know.
But if you're wrong...
promise me you'll send them something.
Won't be necessary.
But okay.
Thank you. Thank you.
BARNETT: We should call this in.
What if this girl's really messed up?
If you make anybody come, we'll just run away someplace else.
It'll be fine.
Stop!
It's here.
(panting)
Hurry!
What the hell are we doing?
GATES: We're helping kids, Ray.
It's down here.
(Gates groans)
Love what you've done with the place.
Follow me.
Ah, that's great.
Big old mouse hole.
Jejunum looks good.
So's the liver.
Lucien, Victoria's on the phone again.
She wants to know
if you'd like her to wear the blue dress or the red dress.
Tell her the blue's nice.
Ileo-cecal junction's clear.
Hot date tonight?
Something like that.
ARI: BP's down,
86 over 40.
Retroperitoneum feels tense.
Bovie to Neela, open it up.
SHIRLEY: Tachy to 120.
DUBENKO: Hang the blood on the infuser.
Whoa. Suction, now.
He's bleeding out. Satinsky.
Packing. Keep it coming.
5-O proline.
On Castro Viejos.
SHIRLEY: P.E.A., lost the pulse.
Starting compressions.
Amp of epi, call for more blood.
RASGOTRA: It's too fast, there's no way to...
Ah, crap, it's here.
Sponge stick times two, let's go!
5-O proline to me.
I've got pressure... above...
and below.
Okay, release pressure.
Repair's holding.
Stop CPR.
Normal sinus.
Good pulse.
Well, strong work, Dr. Rasgotra.
Well, once you've seen one super-celiac aortic tear,
you've seen them all.
TELLER: Don't be scared, it's safe.
BARNETT: Thanks.
I feel much better now. (Lizzie gasping)
GATES: I'm sure you've played gigs
in worse places than this. (Lizzie grunting loudly)
LIZZIE: Oh, God!
Come on!
KIDS: Who's that? Who's with him?
(Lizzie grunting)
(straining)
You said you'd get Mayday!
It's okay. He helped save Paulie.
(Lizzie gasping)
She's diaphoretic.
Please, please, make this go away!
RAY: Yeah, and tachycardic. Hey, Lizzie, Lizzie,
do you know what day it is?
It's Christmas.
That's close enough. She's lucid.
She's pregnant.
Yeah, she's very pregnant.
The baby's crowning.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!
I don't know how this happened!
(straining loudly)
(panting)
All right, Lizzie, next time, give it your all.
Come on, push! I can't!
Yes, you can, attagirl, come on. (screaming)
Attagirl! Come on!
Teller, who's this baby's father?
It doesn't have a father!
Of course it does.
Lizzie will get the men to help us.
Ruby, quiet!
Ray, the shoulder's stuck.
Please get it out! I can't!
Firm downward pressure on the head.
I am! I am!
(straining loudly)
Want to take a shot at it?
Okay. All right.
Here.
GATES: What is she talking about? What men?
The Greek gives us food from the restaurant.
The cripple lets us sleep
in the basement when it's really cold.
Lizzie takes care of them,
and they take care of us.
(Lizzie straining)
Okay.
All right, here we go.
(straining)
Here we go. Here we go.
(straining, baby crying)
Okay, okay, it's a boy.
It's a boy.
(crying)
There you go.
There you go.
Okay. Hold the head.
(panting)
There you go.
He's mine?
Mm-hmm.
So tiny.
What are you doing?
Calling for help.
Teller, get them and run!
Hey, Lizzie, you and your baby
need to be seen by a doctor.
You're a doctor!
Look, we can't do what they need here.
Teller, get them and go.
Hey, it's okay, guys. Teller, go!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Okay, I won't, I won't, I won't.
You guys just need to spend the night the ER, okay?
You, Lizzie and the baby, just the three of you.
Gates, they all need to come. They look jaundiced,
anemic, they got scabies...
The others can stay here.
I won't call foster care or Social Services, all right?
Gates, what are you doing?
Promise? Yeah, I promise.
He lost a lot of blood in there.
Could be a while before we know his neurologic outcome.
I know.
Where are you spending Christmas?
Oh, I spend the holidays with my sister every year.
That's sweet. Older or younger?
Both, actually.
Two years older, but stuck at 17.
Was in a car wreck the night of her prom.
Her boyfriend was drunk.
That's awful.
Could have been worse, though.
She's in an independent living facility in Evanston.
I see her fairly frequently.
In fact, I got to get out of here.
We have a nice dinner tonight.
She likes to dress up.
Your oxygen level's back up.
Am I gonna be able to stay here?
Uh, well, you're getting better.
You don't really need to be hospitalized anymore.
Is there somewhere that you'd like to go?
Not the street, not tonight.
Got any family?
Well, my parents are in Gary, Indiana, where I grew up,
but we haven't talked in a long time.
I don't know if they'd even recognize me.
Hmm.
I'll be back to check on you in a little bit, okay?
Any word from Mercy?
Not yet.
Poor lady's all alone in the world.
At least we can clean her up,
set her up with a new set of clothes for Christmas.
I'll see what I can do.
Hey, Sam, Drunk Santa needs a banana bag
and a few hours to sleep it off.
That's such a shame.
Yeah, sloth, sloth, sloth.
15-year-old, postpartum, needs stitches.
Little newborn baby, needs a warmer and pedes consult.
SAM: Where'd you find them?
We followed a star in the northern sky.
Okay, Trauma Two.
Children's services is on their way. I called up.
You did what?!
It'll be okay, Teller.
You promised! Gates.
What? You swore you wouldn't
force them into the system.
Well, I got them here, didn't I?
You said we could trust you.
Yes. Nice job, Gates.
TAGGART: You from Mercy?
Uh, Nurse Taggart? Hillary Lerner.
Is your policy to dump destitute patients on the street?
Why would we do that?
Because it's bad for your neighborhood.
No, there was a mistake with Miss...
Simpkins. Lenore Simpkins. Mm-hmm. Yes.
That's why I sent my people... Yeah, well,
I'm not gonna release her just so you can have a second chance
to make her disappear down some scummy alley.
I don't know what she told you.
Come with me. As far as I see it,
you behaved very badly, so here's your lump of coal, okay?
You're gonna have your boys take Miss Simpkins
to her parents' place in Gary, Indiana.
Gary? That's over an hour away.
You will pay for the full round-trip service,
and this will never happen again.
Because I ever get wind of another patient
being dumped by your hospital,
I will call the cops and the news so fast
that I'm not sure if you're going to get fired
or arrested first. You got me, lady?
Yeah.
Hey, Lenore. This is Hillary.
She's gonna make sure
you get to see your parents for Christmas.
We, by which I mean to say, Dr. Gates,
promise no foster care.
Well, that would be a mistake.
By law, they need to be placed.
Well, getting them to give up the life they have,
and come in, that takes a light touch, Ray.
Is that what you call lying to them?
I wasn't gonna take a chance on losing them again.
You turned us into every bad adult
these kids were ever screwed by.
Aw, that's so sweet and so naive.
Look, I'll send a van to pick up the other children, huh?
Good. No, no, look,
if you pick them up today they'll be gone tomorrow.
Look, these kids won't just submit,
they need to be convinced
that they'll be safe and protected.
We'll try to keep them together in a group home,
but I can't promise they won't end up in foster care.
But you'll follow up
and make sure they're okay, right?
We always do.
Okay, come on, man. These kids are smart.
They know that that's not how it goes.
A social worker will follow up. It's the best I can do.
No, no, no, no, no. That's not good enough.
Can't believe you got CPS to agree to that.
Well, actually it was Ray's brainstorm.
The trick's getting the kids to accept it.
GATES: Teller, listen.
Child protective services has, uh, arranged
for all of you to live together in a group home.
You said no foster care!
Now, hear us out, Teller.
RASGOTRA: Wait, Teller!
TELLER: No! Teller!
I won't go! You lied!
It's not safe out there, all right?
We survive. No one hurts us.
What Lizzie's doing having sex with men for money and shelter.
That's hurting her.
That's hurting all of you. Don't say that!
If you weren't sleeping in old abandoned buildings,
Paulie would never have gotten sick.
But you fixed him. He's getting better.
No, we didn't. Paulie died.
I'm sorry. I wanted to tell you his...
his infection was too severe,
and we couldn't save him, but...
I want to see him.
I know I lied to you,
but I'm not going to lie to you anymore.
I don't believe you!
It's not working. The way you're living is not working, man.
You're a smart kid...
I know you can see that. Let go of me!
Listen to me. Let go!
You can't go on like this anymore.
RAY: Teller,
Lizzie agreed to go.
It's the only way she can keep her baby.
And the rest of us will just stay with them?
That's right.
And Doctor Gates will come and visit every two weeks
and make sure things are okay, all right?
You need me for anything at anytime,
you call me and I'll be there.
You would do that?
Yeah.
Listen, I need you
to take the social workers to where the others are,
and let the kids know that it's okay and it's safe to come in.
You do that?
I'll wait with you here, Teller, come on.
Thank you.
Well, that went better than expected.
Yeah?
That kid might not survive another round of your games.
Come on, I've been trying to help the kid all day.
Look, Gates, you'll say anything to seal the deal.
I understand that. Hell, I've done that.
But these are messed up kids.
You gotta draw the line somewhere.
And what line is that, Ray?
If you're making promises you have no intention of keeping,
just cut loose, minimize the damage, okay?
This isn't just about the kids, is it?
No. It's not.
Hey, how about you give me
a few hours to wrap some presents, huh?
Okay.
Can we talk?
Sure.
This scares me.
What? Ames?
What it's doing to you.
To us.
It took us so long to get here. All of us.
And the way you're acting,
and how it's taken over our whole lives, it makes me scared
we are going to lose this.
When Jasna and the kids died, I needed to make a change.
And I decided to move here.
Made my brother really angry.
He said... he said that I was a coward,
that I was running away.
And it's only recently
that I've come to know that he was wrong.
I wasn't running away from anything.
I was running to you.
And I'll never let anything take this away.
Did I mention how hot you look in antlers?
I think she's in here, Santa.
Ho, ho, ho!
Has anyone seen a little girl named Melia Simon?
That's her, right there. Oh!
My reindeer needed a little rest,
so I thought I'd come by and say hi.
Oh.
How do you do? I'm Santa Claus.
Hi, Santa.
Can't stay long. Very, very busy.
Got to... got to deliver presents
to the whole western hemisphere tonight.
Nice try, Archie. I know it's you.
Archie?
Who's Archie?
I'm nine years old.
I know there's no Santa, okay?
You know, you're a bright girl, Melia,
but you're wrong about that.
It's a fake beard and a dumb suit.
Don't you know that there's a rule that if millions of kids
believe in the same thing, it becomes real?
That's not a rule. Yeah.
Every time you're generous or thoughtful
or help someone who needs help,
that's a little bit of Santa, too.
What are you talking about?
Come on.
Santa Claus represents one of the last remaining bits
of magic left in this world.
Now, I still believe, so don't spoil it for me, okay?
Come on.
Where are we going? Oh.
Ho, ho, ho!
Wait, it's Santa!
Oh, you were a very, very nice girl this year.
Top of the nice list.
Would it be all right
if I signed your cast?
Thank you.
To Greta:
Keep on being nice.
Love, Santa.
How'd you know my name?
Come on, I'm Santa Claus, huh.
Merry Christmas.
It's the real Santa, isn't it?
MORRIS: Ho, ho, ho.
Yeah. It is.
You lost almost a third of your blood volume.
Give us a few days to buff you up.
Plus, I have a present for you.
These... are for them.
Things were a little touch and go for a while,
so I called them.
How do I explain...?
It's Christmas.
You don't have to. Trust me.
Hey, princess.
Hey, buddy.
Look at you guys.
You're all grown up.
DUBENKO: You getting out of here soon?
Oh, I have a cagillion notes to write.
You look nice.
Thanks.
Off to your sister's, I take it?
Yeah. That's for you.
Merry Christmas, Neela.
I don't normally do this.
Work presents always end up being
something edible and bad for you,
or something impersonal, like organic soap.
And who needs that crap
cluttering up their bathroom, anyway?
Oh, loops. Wow.
Yeah, that's my very first pair.
Bought 'em for myself in med. school.
Thank you. It's a lovely gift.
Listen.
You're an intern and, um, I'm an attending
and there are certain protocols,
certain hierarchies, that preclude me from...
Lucien...
...being direct about this but it's Christmas--
so what the hell, I'm just going to say it:
You are a really good surgeon, Neela.
A few more years and you could be great.
Thank you.
You going to try them on?
Uh, I will.
Beautiful.
You repeat this conversation to anyone,
and I will deny it, you know that.
What conversation?
Lovely.
I'll see you tomorrow. (chuckles): Yeah.
Transplant rounds are at 7:00.
MORRIS: Merry Christmas to you, too.
Thank you.
Good-bye, sweetheart.
Have a good Christmas.
(chuckles): Yo, Kris Kringle.
What's going on, Morris?
Oh, we did okay, Greg.
Just okay?
Either you rocked the house
or you were closed to patients?
No, we just moved people through.
All right, all right. Go ahead, you can gloat now.
Tell me all about what a great manager you are.
"I saved Jerry, I diagnosed D.I.D., yada-yada."
You know what?
I'm gonna go with humility this time.
For real.
Humili-what?
Hey. I learned a lot watching you today.
Yeah, well, I'm full of it, Hope.
I get it, Archie.
I know you don't believe half of what you say,
but you know what?
It... doesn't really matter,
because I saw you today, and what I saw was...
a guy who was trying to be good.
And... I don't know,
that right there is half the battle.
Have a good holiday.
What are you doing?
What?
Now. Are you... going home?
I thought maybe we could, um, (clears throat)
grab a bite, get a drink, see what happens.
(chuckles nervously)
Chastity's always been overrated.
The purity of spirit is what it's all about, right?
(laughs)
Wait, wait. Are you...?
What are you, what are you saying?
(chuckles)
You know what?
(groans)
I don't think so.
What?
I, uh, I...
I hate, I hate that I'm saying this--
it's like some dorky angel has taken control of my mouth--
but... no.
What?
What...? It's Christmas,
and-and people get lonely on Christmas,
and we might do something that we'd both regret,
or could get in the way
of a possibly deeper relationship in the future.
So...
(sighs)
I'm... I'm sorry.
Hey! Hey!
You stole my suit!
Well, what about you?
Me?
Yes, where are you from?
What are you doing here?
What's your damage?
I spent a couple of years in the service.
I managed to spend most of my time in Okinawa,
which is a hell of a lot better than being in Iraq
or Afghanistan. Mm.
And since I've come back, I've been working as a traveler.
Yeah, I did that for a while, but then I got tired of it.
So, wait, you have what?
A week or so left?
It's supposed to be a week,
but this place seems all right.
Seems like pretty great people.
I mean, like, what we did for that lady today--
what you did-- that was something.
Come on, everyone deserves
a little bit of happiness at Christmas time.
So I called the nursing director
and I signed on for another month.
Really?
Really.
Hmm. Well...
Merry Christmas, Ben.
Merry Christmas, Samantha.

Idiot!
Moron!
She... she was right there,
right there for the fondling, and you just let her go.
Why? Why?!
Why'd you have to be such a good Christian?
There's no, there's no God.
There's no Christmas.
There is no frickin' Santa Claus!
(bells jingling in distance)
Ho! Ho! Ho! Merry Christmas!
Holy...
