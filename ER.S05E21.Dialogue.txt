I GUESS A CANDLELIT DINNER WOULD NOT BE AN ENTICING OFFER?
NOT OFFICIALLY UNTIL MAY, BUT BETWEEN YOU AND ME...
HOLD ON. I'M COVERING THE E.R.
ALL RIGHT?
FINE. I'M FINISHED HERE.
PETER'S APPLIED FOR THE TRAUMA FELLOWSHIP?
YEAH. HADN'T YOU HEARD?
WHAT DO YOU THINK HE'LL DO?
HE'LL BE ON THE FIRST PLANE.
OH, MY GOD.
I'M REALLY SORRY.
AH, THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
IT'S PART OF THE GAME.
BEING SWATTED BY A BALL?
IT'S CALLED A HINDRANCE.
IT'S A DO-OVER.
SO I DON'T GET PENALIZED OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT?
NO, I GOT IN THE WAY.
OKAY.
SO WHEN DO YOU GO IN?
NOON. YOU?
IT DEPENDS. I MAY HAVE A MEETING.
ABOUT THE TRAUMA FELLOWSHIP?
MAYBE.
THAT'S NOT VERY NICE.
I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW WHEN, ACTUALLY.
ROMANO, HE KEEPS STALLING.
DON'T WORRY. YOU'RE MORE THAN QUALIFIED.
OOH!
OH, I'M SO SORRY.
WHY DO YOU HAVE TO STAND THERE?
I'VE GOT TO STAND SOMEWHERE.
I DIDN'T MEAN TO HIT YOU, HONESTLY.
HERE, I HAVE AN IDEA-- WHY DON'T YOU SERVE?
OKAY.
YOU CAN'T BE ENJOYING THIS VERY MUCH.
REMEMBER, THE BALL HAS TO BOUNCE.
RIGHT.
BOLLOCKS.
BLOOD PRESSURE'S FINE.
HOW ARE YOU FEELING?
A LOT BETTER.
YEAH, THAT HAPPENS
ONCE YOU REACH YOUR SECOND TRIMESTER.
I DIDN'T GAIN ANY WEIGHT IN THE FIRST TRIMESTER.
I'VE PUT ON TWO POUNDS IN ONE WEEK?
I'LL HAVE ALICE SCHEDULE YOUR MIDTERM ULTRASOUND.
DO YOU WANT TO KNOW YOUR BABY'S SEX?
OH, I HAVEN'T DECIDED YET.
WELL, JUST TELL ME BEFORE WE START
AND WE'LL GET AN ALPHA FETOPROTEIN.
AND DOWN'S SYNDROME.
RIGHT.
YOU THINK I'M AT RISK?
NO. A.F.P. STANDARD.
WE TYPICALLY ONLY DO AMNIO
WHEN YOU'RE OVER 35 UNLESS YOU HAVE
GENETIC DISORDERS IN YOUR FAMILY.
NO.
CYSTIC FIBROSIS? TAY-SACHS?
NO.
WHAT ABOUT FATHER'S SIDE?
I DON'T THINK SO.
WELL, YOU SHOULD CHECK ON THAT
BUT EVERYTHING LOOKS FINE.
VERY HEALTHY PREGNANCY.
( clears throat )
HEY, DOUG. IT'S ME.
UH... I-I KNOW WE SAID WE SHOULDN'T CALL FOR A WHILE
BUT I NEEDED TO TELL YOU SOMETHING.
I FAXED IT
AND, UH...
UM, I REALLY WANT YOU TO READ IT AND...
SIT WITH IT FOR A WHILE
UM...
AND THEN, THEN WE'LL TALK ABOUT IT.
OKAY.
I, UM...
OKAY.
BYE.
* SEMPER FI, DO OR DIE
* DIE FOR MY BROTHER
* I SAID DIE FOR MY BROTHER.
TWO MIGS OF ATIVAN FOR THE DUKE HERE
AND HANG A BANANA BAG.
KERRY, I HEAR YOU HAVE A RULE-OUT TRIPLE A?
YEAH, EXAM FOUR.
OH, LISTEN. SORRY I HAD TO CANCEL THE MEETING.
HEY, DOC. I'M ONE OF A FEW GOOD MEN.
THAT'S GOOD. GET A JOB.
SORRY I HAD TO CANCEL THE MEETING.
I HAD A PERFED APPY THAT WOULDN'T WAIT
BUT I'LL HAVE MY OFFICE RESCHEDULE.
I SPOKE TO ANSPAUGH.
HE'S GOING TO COME BACK FOR IT
AFTER HIS SEMINAR AT 10:00.
UH, IT'S A LITTLE PAST MY BEDTIME.
CAN I TELL YOU SOMETHING?
HE SAID YOU COULD PRESENT YOUR TOP THREE CANDIDATES
AND I'LL PASS THEM ALONG.
( chuckling ): I BET YOU WOULD.
I'M JUST TRYING TO PREVENT ANY FURTHER DELAY.
WELL, HOW CONSCIENTIOUS.
WELL, THANK YOU.
I'LL BE THERE.
I APPRECIATE THAT.
AND KERRY... UM, YOU MIND IF I CALL YOU KERRY?
OH, CERTAINLY, ROBERT.
HERE. HERE, THANK YOU.
I KNOW HOW MUCH THIS LITTLE PROJECT MEANS TO YOU.
WELL, ACTUALLY, I GUESS I DON'T
BUT YOU WOULD BE SMART NOT TO RAID MY SURGICAL STAFF.
IF YOU'RE REFERRING TO PETER BENTON AND ELIZABETH CORDAY
THEY BOTH CAME TO ME.
WELL, YOU CAN SEND THEM RIGHT BACK.
OH, I DIDN'T REALIZE YOU OWNED THEM.
WELL, NOW YOU DO.
HIRE SOME HUMP FROM THE OUTSIDE.
IT'D MAKE LIFE A LOT EASIER.
DON'T TELL ME YOU WANT TO SEE A PICTURE.
NO NEED TO SEE A PICTURE.
GOOD, 'CAUSE THAT WOULD TURN HER OFF.
CHUNY, I DON'T NEED TO BE FIXED UP.
I'M NOT THAT PATHETIC.
WHO'S PATHETIC?
CARTER WON'T MEET MY FRIEND.
YOU MET HER-- THE UROLOGY NURSE, GINA.
OH, YEAH. SHE'S NICE.
WHAT'S THE MATTER, CARTER?
AFRAID SHE'S TOUCHED TOO MANY, YOU KNOW...?
FACIAL AND ABDOMINAL TRAUMA COMING IN.
LITTLE LEAGUE UMPIRE GOT BEAT UP.
ONE TOO MANY BAD CALLS, I GUESS.
I GUESS.
WHAT IS THIS COUNTRY COMING TO? LITTLE LEAGUE?
YOU SHOULD SEE WHAT HAPPENED
TO THE SCOUTMASTER I TREATED LAST MONTH.
COME ON, CARTER, JUST MEET HER.
I DON'T DATE NURSES.
JUST MED STUDENTS, HUH?
NO, I KEEP MY LOVE LIFE
OUT OF THE WORKPLACE, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
SINCE WHEN?
I GOT A WOMAN FREAKING OUT IN TWO.
SOMETHING ALIVE IN HER EAR.
CARTER. JERRY, PAGE SURGERY.
I'LL GO MEET THE UMPIRE OUTSIDE.
HEY, LOOK WHAT THE CAT DRAGGED IN.
WHAT?
YOU DON'T LOOK SO GOOD, HONEY.
NO, I'M JUST TIRED FROM WORKING THE NIGHT SHIFT.
SLEPT DURING THE DAY, DIDN'T YOU?
YEAH, A LITTLE, BUT I'M FINE.
( Macarena playing )
WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?
IT'S COOL; SOUND-ACTIVATED.
I PICKED IT UP AT GROSSMAN'S FLEA MARKET.
WASN'T THE MACARENA IN, LIKE, TWO YEARS AGO?
MORE LIKE THREE.
I DID IT AT MY COLLEGE GRADUATION.
REALLY? WHY DON'T YOU SHOW US?
MY FRIEND KNOWS HOW TO DO THE MACARENA.
* Hey, Macarena...
DID YOU BRUISE?
NO, I DON'T THINK SO.
I'M AFRAID TO CHECK.
WELL, I'M SURE YOU'LL LIVE.
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT RACQUETBALL
WAS A FULL-CONTACT SPORT.
WELL, I GUESS IT'S NOT MY THING.
WELL, IT LOOKED LIKE YOU
WERE HAVING FUN THERE FOR A WHILE.
YEAH, I WAS, BUT IT WAS A BIT TOO BIZARRE
BUMPING INTO PETER LIKE THAT.
HOW SO?
WHY, YOU WEREN'T UNCOMFORTABLE?
NO. SHOULD I HAVE BEEN?
I DON'T THINK THIS IS OUR UMPIRE.
YOU A DOCTOR?
LANCE CARMICHAEL, FBI.
WE'VE GOT A WOMAN THAT'S BEEN SHOT.
GUNSHOT WOUND TO THE UPPER TORSO.
SHE'S HAVING TROUBLE BREATHING.
WHY DIDN'T YOU CALL AN AMBULANCE?
CAN'T TELL YOU THAT.
EXCUSE ME?
WE HAD TO ABORT OUR MEDICAL PROTOCOL. WHAT?
OFFICIALLY, WE'RE NOT HERE.
RESPS ARE LABORED, PULSE 130.
I'LL GET A GURNEY.
MA'AM? MA'AM, CAN YOU TELL ME YOUR NAME?
SORRY, THAT'S CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.
I'M TRYING TO ASSESS HER LEVEL OF CONSCIOUSNESS.
OKAY, AMBER, WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME HOW IT HAPPENED.
THAT'S ALSO CONFIDENTIAL.
LOOK, YOU WANT ME TO HELP HER?
STRICTLY NEED-TO-KNOW INFORMATION.
OKAY. UH... AMBER, CAN YOU TELL ME WHERE YOU GOT HIT?
IT FELT LIKE MY CHEST, BUT IT HURTS ON THE SIDE.
UH-HUH. HOW LONG AGO?
18Â½ MINUTES.
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
DR. GREENE.
SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER?
GOT TO RUN A CHECK.
GET IT OUT.
JUST GET IT OUT!
MA'AM? YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO HOLD STILL.
WHAT IS IT?
WHAT IS IT?
I CAN STILL FEEL IT MOVING AROUND.
I IRRIGATED WITH LIDOCAINE.
IT SHOULD BE DEAD BY NOW.
WHAT? WHAT SHOULD BE DEAD?
WELL...
IT LOOKS LIKE A COCKROACH.
( howling )
MA'AM, I CAN GET IT OUT.
I CAN GET IT OUT.
OH.
I CAN GET IT OUT.
IF YOU'LL JUST HOLD STILL.
I DON'T WANT TO... PUNCTURE YOUR EARDRUM.
I'M SUING THE BASTARD.
WHO IS THAT, MA'AM?
MY LANDLORD.
I COMPLAINED THREE TIMES.
I TAKE A NAP AND WAKE UP WITH ONE IN MY EAR.
I'M GOING TO TAKE HIM FOR EVERYTHING HE HAS.
WELL...
UNTIL THEN...
I'D SLEEP WITH EARPLUGS.
I GOT IT.
( shrieks )
ALL RIGHT.
WE'LL GET THAT CLEANED UP.
YOU JUST... SIT STILL
AND I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
* DO AS I... *
* SEMPER FI! DO OR DIE!
OLIVIA, CAN I GET A 19-GAUGE ANGIOCATH?
SURE.
AND SOME VALIUM.
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT, A HEADACHE?
WE NEED A SECURED AREA, BUT MORE THAN ONE EXIT.
CARTER, IS TRAUMA ONE OPEN?
YEAH, WHAT HAVE YOU GOT?
A GUNSHOT WOUND TO THE CHEST, POSSIBLE PNEUMOTHORAX.
THE METAL MAY HAVE SLOWED THE BULLET.
TALK ABOUT A WONDER BRA, HUH?
THEY CAN HELP. ESSENTIAL PERSONNEL ONLY.
Patient: I'M DYING! FOR YOUR MOTHER!
HEY, DOC!
I'M LOOKING FOR A FEW GOOD MEN HERE!
YOU'RE GOING TO
HAVE TO STAY AWAY FROM THIS PATIENT.
ELIZABETH AND I CAN TAKE IT FROM HERE.
YOU'RE GOING TO NEED NURSES.
( shouting )
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, RELAX, OKAY?
THIS HAPPENS ALL THE TIME. JUST RELAX.
I THINK I UPSET THE APPLE CART.
LET'S GET THIS GUY OUT OF HERE.
SEMPER FI! DO OR DIE!
HEY, PETER, WHAT'S THIS?
BOWEL OBSTRUCTION.
WELL, DON'T WORRY-- ANOTHER COUPLE WEEKS
AND YOU'LL BE OUT OF THE BOWELS
AND INTO THE SEAT OF THE SOUL.
EXCUSE ME?
THE HEART, PETER.
THE CARDIOTHORACIC FELLOWSHIP, AREN'T YOU?
YEAH.
GOOD, 'CAUSE I CAN'T
FIGHT FOR YOU AND THEN HAVE YOU NOT TAKE IT.
MAKING YOUR DECISION UNTIL ANOTHER TWO WEEKS.
WELL, WE'RE NOT, BUT THE POSTURING'S ALREADY STARTED.
BESIDES, I DON'T WANT MY GUY GOING OFF TO WASTE HIS TALENTS
AS SOME GLORIFIED E.R. DOC.
WELL, I WOULDN'T EXACTLY CONSIDER IT A WASTE.
PETER, I KNOW YOU'RE CONFUSED WITH YOUR SON AND ALL
AND WE CAN BE FLEXIBLE
ABOUT THAT, BUT LET'S GET REAL.
YOU'VE WORKED TOO LONG AND TOO HARD TO SETTLE
FOR PATCHING UP GANG-BANGERS AND DRUNK DRIVERS
FOR THE REST OF YOUR CAREER.
WELL, THAT'S ONE WAY OF LOOKING AT IT.
GOOD. SO I NEED TO KNOW.
YOU'RE MY GUY?
LOOK, IF YOU'RE ASKING ME
IF I'M INTERESTED IN CARDIOTHORACIC, YEAH. YEAH.
ALL RIGHT, SAY NO MORE.
PRESSURE'S GOOD, 130/80.
I'M GOING TO MAKE A SMALL INCISION.
WILL THERE BE A SCAR?
WE'LL HIDE THIS ONE UNDER YOUR ARM.
THERE'S OOZING AT THE POINT OF ENTRY.
LET'S APPLY
ANOTHER PRESSURE DRESSING.
PUSH ANOTHER TWO OF VERSED.
EASY ON THE PAINKILLERS.
SHE'S BEEN SHOT.
SHE NEEDS TO STAY CLEARHEADED.
I PROMISE I WON'T LISTEN TO ANYTHING HER LIPS MIGHT UTTER.
I GOT SOME FLUID HERE.
BLOOD? NOTHING IN THE CHEST.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS.
IT LOOKS LIKE SALINE.
YOU HAVE BREAST IMPLANTS?
YOU POPPED MY BOOB?
UH, THE BULLET DID, BUT THE IMPLANT MIGHT HAVE HELPED.
SORRY, THIS AREA IS OFF-LIMITS.
WE NEED MEROCEL SPONGES-- WE'RE OUT.
GET THEM SOMEPLACE ELSE.
MARK, I GOT TO STOP
THIS GUY'S NOSEBLEED.
THAT DOESN'T SOUND SERIOUS.
ARE YOU A DOCTOR? NO.
I'LL CONNECT THE TUBE.
THANKS.
HOLD IT.
AND RELAX.
DID YOU JUST SHOOT THAT?
WHAT?
DID YOU JUST SHOOT THAT X RAY?
YEAH.
I WAS IN THE ROOM.
I SAID "SHOOTING."
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?
WHAT'S HAPPENING?
HE JUST TOOK AN X RAY WHILE I WAS IN THE ROOM.
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?
WE'VE ALL BEEN EXPOSED ONE TIME OR ANOTHER.
I CAN'T! YOU HAVE TO BE MORE CAREFUL.
WHEN CAN WE MOVE HER?
WE'LL GET HER A BED UPSTAIRS.
NO, WE NEED TO MOVE HER TO ANOTHER FACILITY--
ONE WE CAN CONTROL.
I NEED TO MONITOR HER FOR A FEW MORE HOURS
BEFORE WE CAN TRANSPORT HER.
ARE YOU DONE WITH THAT?
AND WE'LL NEED ALL ORIGINAL DOCUMENTATION OF ANY KIND.
THE HOSPITAL KEEPS CHARTS, EVEN ON JANE DOES.
WE CAN'T ALLOW THAT.
LET ME GUESS.
THIS CONVERSATION NEVER HAPPENED?
CRIT'S 44. LOOKS GOOD.
I'LL TAKE THAT.
OKAY, HOW WE GOING TO BILL THIS?
THE BUREAU WILL BE IN TOUCH.
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO CALL MY CHIEF OF STAFF.
MARK, WE NEED THE ROOM. MULTIPLE M.V.A.s COMING IN.
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO.
WAIT. WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
WE GOT A TRAFFIC ACCIDENT COMING IN.
WE'RE MOVING HER TO AN OBSERVATION ROOM.
PUT THEM SOMEPLACE ELSE.
THIS ROOM IS SET UP FOR TRAUMA.
THIS IS A NATIONAL SECURITY MATTER.
I DON'T HAVE TIME TO ARGUE WITH YOU GUYS.
SO WHO IS SHE? I DON'T KNOW.
WHAT SHE LOOK LIKE? A STRIPPER.
I'M GUESSING WITNESS PROTECTION PROGRAM.
THAT'S THE WAY TO KEEP A LOW PROFILE.
COULD BE AN UNDERCOVER AGENT, I SUPPOSE.
SHE DON'T LOOK LIKE THE UNDERCOVER TYPE TO ME.
ISN'T THAT THE POINT?
I'M GUESSING MOBSTER'S GIRLFRIEND.
OR A POLITICIAN'S. MAYBE BOTH.
MEDIVAC COMING IN. BOATING ACCIDENT IN BERWYN.
E.T.A.? FIVE MINUTES.
MARK, CAN YOU TAKE THESE? I GOT A MEDIVAC COMING IN.
YEAH, LET'S GO.
WHAT DO WE GOT?
PETER, YOU'RE WITH ME. COME ON.
HEY, YOU LOOK LIKE YOU'RE FEELING BETTER.
GOT MY SECOND WIND.
SHANNON MITCHELL, 16-YEAR-OLD FEMALE.
FRONT-SEAT PASSENGER EJECTED FROM THE CAR.
COMPLAINS OF BACK PAIN. CAN'T MOVE HER LEGS.
IS HER AIRWAY CLEAR?
YEAH. B.P. IS 130/85, PULSE 90.
MY NAME'S ELIZABETH. WHAT'S YOURS?
SHANNON, I WANT YOU TO PRESS YOUR FOOT
AGAINST MY HAND JUST LIKE YOU'RE STEPPING ON THE GAS.
POSSIBLE SPINAL CORD INJURY. LET'S BE CAREFUL AND GO.
THEY WERE ON THEIR WAY TO THE PROM.
HIT A TELEPHONE POLE AND ROLLED IT.
RESTRAINED DRIVER, SECOND AND THIRD-DEGREE BURNS
PULLED HIS FRIEND OUT AFTER THE GAS TANK EXPLODED.
COMPLAINS OF CHEST PAINS.
WHERE'S TRAVIS? DID HE MAKE IT?
TEN MILLIGRAMS OF MORPHINE, I.V. PUSH. HOW'S HIS BUDDY?
Knight: CARTER?! CARTER.
OH, GOD.
TRAVIS MITCHELL, 18-YEAR-OLD REAR SEAT PASSENGER.
HEAD INJURY LEFT HIM UNCONSCIOUS IN THE BURNING CAR
AND HIS FRIEND PULLED HIM OUT.
75% BODY SURFACE AREA BURNED.
MAINLY FULL THICKNESS.
GAVE A LITER OF SALINE EN ROUTE.
WHAT'S HIS PRESSURE? 94/68, PULSE 130.
DID YOU FIND MELISSA?
HE'S WAKING UP, BUT ASKING THESE REPETITIVE QUESTIONS.
TRAVIS, TRAVIS, MY NAME IS DR. CARTER.
YOU HAVING ANY TROUBLE BREATHING?
YOU SHORT OF BREATH AT ALL?
WHERE'S MELISSA? WHO'S MELISSA?
MY GIRLFRIEND. SHE WAS IN THE BACK SEAT.
I DON'T KNOW, DOC. THERE WERE THREE VICTIMS
AND THEY HADN'T CLEARED THE CAR YET WHEN WE LEFT.
Weaver ( yelling ): I'LL TAKE THE AIRWAY. PETER, YOU RUN IT!
WHAT DO WE GOT?
ANDREA BRODOFF, 34-YEAR-OLD FEMALE.
RAMMED THE BOAT INTO DOCK WITH AN ATTACK OF BAD NAUSEA.
BE CAREFUL. I HAVE AIDS.
PENETRATING ABDOMINAL INJURY.
WHAT'S HER PRESSURE?!
95/60 AFTER 800cc's saline.
WHAT'S THIS?
MA'AM, DOES IT HURT ON THIS SIDE? YES!
BRUCE. HE'S FINE. HE WAS WEARING HIS SEAT BELT.
MOM WOULDN'T TAKE OFF WITHOUT HIM.
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO!
TAKING BRUCE?
I'LL TAKE HIM.
COME ON, BRUCE.
COME ON, SWEETIE.
SOLUMEDROL'S ON BOARD.
Corday: SHANNON, CAN YOU LIFT YOUR LEG?
NO.
HOW ABOUT YOUR KNEE?
OH, MY GOD! WHAT'S HAPPENING?!
BABINSKI IS POSITIVE.
IS THAT BAD?
TRY TO PUSH AGAINST MY HAND
WITH YOUR BIG TOE.
ALL RIGHT, VERY GOOD.
WHERE'S X RAY?
COMING.
SHANNON, I'M GOING TO TEST THE AREA
IT MIGHT BE A LITTLE UNCOMFORTABLE.
I WON'T BE PARALYZED, WILL I?
LET'S NOT WORRY ABOUT THAT.
I NEED YOU TO FOCUS, OKAY? DR. GREENE?
CARTER NEEDS YOU. WHAT IS IT?
BURN VICTIM.
IS THAT MY BROTHER?
WHO?
THE BURN VICTIM. IS THAT TRAVIS?
JUST RELAX, SHANNON.
WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
FOUR UNITS A.B.G. AND CARBOXYHEMOGLOBIN.
I GOT FULL-THICKNESS BURNS, MAYBE 80%.
AT 190 POUNDS, I'M CALCULATING
1,700cc's OF LACTATED RINGERS PER HOUR.
SOUNDS RIGHT.
LYDIA, LET'S GO AHEAD AND DO THAT.
HOW ABOUT VASCULAR EXAM?
GOOD PERIPHERAL PULSES SO FAR.
LUCY, WHAT DO WE DO DURING FLUID RESUSCITATION
TO PREVENT CONSTRICTING EDEMA?
UM, ELEVATE THE LIMBS
AND, UH, DO RANGE-OF-MOTION EXERCISES.
THAT'S RIGHT.
WHY DON'T YOU START ON THE LEFT LEG?
IS THAT MY SISTER OVER THERE?
Greene: YEAH.
WE DON'T KNOW YET. SHE WAS THROWN FROM THE CAR.
SHE GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT?
SHE ASKED THE SAME THING ABOUT YOU.
REALLY MOVE IT, LUCY.
HE CAN'T FEEL IT.
HOW'S THE DEBRIDEMENT COMING?
Malik: IT'S GOING TO TAKE A WHILE.
Lydia: B.P.'s 95/65.
GOOD BOWEL SOUNDS. GIVE ME AN ULTRASOUND.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
LUCY, WHY DON'T YOU COME WITH ME?
GO. I GOT THIS.
FIND THE KID'S PARENTS AND GET THEM OVER HERE.
WHAT SHALL I TELL THEM?
TELL THEM THEIR CHILDREN WERE IN A SERIOUS ACCIDENT.
DON'T GET INTO SPECIFICS. OKAY.
LUCY, BURNS LIKE THAT CAN BE PRETTY BRUTAL.
IT'S OKAY TO BOW OUT YOUR FIRST TIME.
DO YOU THINK HE HAS A CHANCE?
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN ONE THIS BAD SURVIVE? NO.
DOC, WE CAN'T CONTROL THIS ENVIRONMENT.
TRANSPORT'S EN ROUTE.
I NEED YOU TO CLEAR HER.
SHE HAS A CHEST TUBE. SHE NEEDS TO BE OBSERVED.
YOU PROVIDED A VALUABLE SERVICE.
WE APPRECIATE IT.
WE'VE ARRANGED FOR ONGOING CARE.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO TELL YOU.
SHE MAY NEED SURGERY.
I'M NOT GOING TO RELEASE HER UNTIL I KNOW SHE'S STABLE.
THAT'S OUR PROBLEM.
DR. GREENE, YOU GOT A SEC?
HOLD ON. I'LL CHECK HER IN A MINUTE.
I'LL NEED A BLOOD-ALCOHOL LEVEL ON THESE KIDS
ESPECIALLY THIS ONE; HE WAS DRIVING.
HE PULLED HIS FRIEND OUT OF THE FIRE.
HE ALSO RAN THE CAR INTO A TELEPHONE POLE.
IT'S EARLY. THEY'RE ALREADY DRUNK?
THEY WERE HEADING FROM A PRE-PARTY TO THE PROM.
HE SAID SOME PARENTS WERE SERVING BEER.
OH, GEEZ. ALL RIGHT.
UH, HOW'S THE FOURTH ONE?
HAVEN'T FOUND HER YET.
YOU OKAY, CAROL?
YEAH.
SEMPER FI IS DO OR DIE.
I DIE FOR MY BROTHER.
I DIE FOR MY BROTHER.
CENTRAL LINE KIT'S HERE.
I GOT REALLY SICK.
I HIT THE THROTTLE TOO HARD.
LET'S GET SOME O-NEG IN CASE HER PRESSURE DROPS.
WHERE'S BRUCE?
IN THE LOUNGE. WE'RE KEEPING A GOOD EYE ON HIM.
IT LOOKS LIKE BLOOD IN MORRISON'S POUCH.
SHE MIGHT HAVE NICKED HER LIVER.
LET'S GET A GRAM OF CEFOTETAN
AND DRAW A PRE-OP LAB.
IT'S THE MEDICATION.
I CAN'T KEEP ANYTHING DOWN.
( gagging ): THE CMV JUST MAKES IT WORSE.
YOU HAVE CMV?
YEAH.
CALL THE O.R. TELL THEM WE'RE ON OUR WAY.
OH, GOD!
WHAT'S WRONG? WHOA! SHE'S VOMITING!
ROLL HER!
HEY, HEY!
( splattering )
CAROL!
CAROL!
DIE FOR YOUR BROTHER.
DIE FOR YOUR BROTHER.
Romano: HE'S LIMITED TO L-1.
I DON'T SEE ANY OTHER INVOLVEMENT.
HOW ARE WE DOING?
SHE HAS SOME SENSATION ON THE PERIANAL AREA
AND REFLEX CONTRACTION OF THE SPHINCTER.
WITH A COMPRESSION FRACTURE OF THE FIRST LUMBAR VERTEBRAE.
THERE'S A SMALL, BONY FRAGMENT IMPINGING ON HER SPINAL CORD.
DID YOU PUMP HER FULL OF STEROIDS?
1,800 MILLIGRAMS, BOLUS I.V. SOLUMEDROL.
YOU GOING TO TAKE HER UP TO SURGERY?
IF WE CAN DECOMPRESS IT
SHE HAS A CHANCE AT FULL FUNCTION.
LET'S DO IT. HER MOTHER SIGN A CONSENT?
SHE'S NOT HERE, BUT I'LL SIGN THE ORDER.
OKAY, LET'S GO.
THIS GIRL DOESN'T FEEL ANYTHING IN 24 HOURS, SHE AIN'T GONNA.
DR. GREENE, I THINK I'VE GOT THIS SORTED OUT.
THE DRIVER'S DATE IS THE GIRL WITH THE SPINAL CORD INJURY.
HER BROTHER IS THE BURN VICTIM.
THERE'S A FOURTH VICTIM, MELISSA, NO ONE CAN FIND
AND THE PARENTS OF THE DRIVER ARE ON THEIR WAY
AND I SPOKE TO NEIGHBORS
STAYING AT THE BROTHER AND SISTER'S HOUSE
AND APPARENTLY, THEIR PARENTS
ARE STAYING OVERNIGHT IN MILWAUKEE
BUT I HAVE A CALL IN TO THEIR HOTEL.
OKAY, GOOD.
CARTER, HOW ARE WE DOING?
( quietly ): COMPROMISED CIRCULATION.
HIS LEGS ARE CYANOTIC, AND I'M LOSING HIS PULSE.
WE'VE PREPPED FOR AN ESCAROTOMY.
OKAY, GO AHEAD.
TEN BLADE.
WHAT'S HAPPENING?
THE SWELLING IS CONSTRICTING YOUR BLOOD SUPPLY, OKAY?
SO WE NEED TO MAKE AN INCISION IN THE SKIN TO RELEASE IT.
YOU'RE SLICING MY SKIN OPEN?
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO FEEL A THING, OKAY?
LUCY, WHY DON'T YOU GO, UH, TALK HIM THROUGH IT?
ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE SUB-Q FAT.
DID HE START?
SEE? IT DOESN'T HURT.
WILL THEY BE ABLE TO SEW THIS BACK?
WE WOULD DO A SKIN GRAFT.
WAIT. YOU WOULD OR YOU WILL?
WE WILL.
I GOT THE MEDIAL ASPECT.
OKAY, ONE CENTIMETER PROXIMAL AND DISTAL
TO THE CIRCUMFERENTIAL BURN.
DID YOU... DID YOU FIND M-MELISSA?
NOT YET.
WE'RE SUPPOSED...
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE AT THE PROM RIGHT NOW...
D-DANCING.
WAS THERE A THEME AT YOUR PROM?
YEAH. THE '40s.
I WAS GOING TO WEAR A ZOOT SUIT, BUT MELISSA, SHE WANTED A TUX.
OKAY, THAT'S ONE.
HALFWAY THERE.
DR. GREENE.
UH, THE FBI's LOOKING FOR YOU.
THEY'LL HAVE TO WAIT.
DR. GREENE? TODD HOFFMAN, FBI.
DID YOU TREAT A GUNSHOT WOUND TO THE CHEST
IN THE LAST SIX HOURS?
I TOLD YOUR OTHER GUYS SHE'S NOT READY TO TRANSPORT.
WHAT OTHER GUYS?
RIGHT IN HERE.
THEY WERE ANXIOUS TO GET HER OUT OF HERE.
I'LL BET THEY WERE.
THEY FLASHED A BADGE AT ME JUST LIKE YOU DID.
WHY DIDN'T YOU PUT OUT AN A.P.B.?
I NEED ALL THE MEDICAL REPORTS.
WELL, THEY TOOK EVERYTHING, I THINK.
EVERYTHING?
WHO ARE THESE GUYS?
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHERE THEY MIGHT BE HEADING?
UH, NO. THEY WERE ACTING LIKE G-MEN.
HOW'S THAT?
WELL, THEY WERE ASKING A LOT OF QUESTIONS
AND NOT GIVING OUT MUCH INFORMATION.
( monkey playing Macarena )
WE HAVE TO CONFISCATE THE TAPES FROM YOUR SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS.
YEAH? WELL, TALK TO SECURITY.
JERRY, PUT THAT THING AWAY.
I DON'T WANT TO SEE IT OUT HERE AGAIN.
HEY... UH, CAROL... EXCUSE ME.
EXCUSE ME. WE'RE LOOKING FOR MY DAUGHTER.
SHE WAS IN THE CAR ACCIDENT.
NO... BUT SHE WAS IN THE SAME CAR.
MELISSA HAROLD.
YOUR DAUGHTER HASN'T BEEN BROUGHT IN YET.
BUT ANOTHER PARENT TOLD US EVERYONE WAS BROUGHT HERE.
THE POLICE AND THE PARAMEDICS ARE STILL LOOKING FOR MELISSA.
THEY'RE STILL LOOKING FOR HER.
I THINK THAT YOU SHOULD SPEAK WITH A POLICE OFFICER.
REGGIE...
COME OVER HERE.
THESE ARE MELISSA HAROLD'S PARENTS
AND THEY NEED INFORMATION.
OUR DAUGHTER'S MISSING?
I'M AFRAID SO...
BUT SHE DOESN'T APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN TRAPPED IN THE VEHICLE.
DOESN'T APPEAR...
THE CAR CAUGHT FIRE, MA'AM.
HEY... ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
I'M FINE.
I'M SORRY ABOUT BEFORE.
I'M JUST... I'M HAVING A... A BAD DAY TODAY.
YEAH... I'D SAY IT WAS A LITTLE MORE THAN THAT.
I'M REALLY NOT IN THE MOOD RIGHT NOW, KERRY.
ARE YOU PREGNANT?
WHO TOLD YOU?
NOBODY HAD TO TELL ME.
YOU WERE UPSET ABOUT THE X RAY.
YOU DIDN'T WANT TO EXPOSE THE FETUS TO CMV.
IT WAS INSTINCT, YOU KNOW...
I MEAN, I DON'T MIND TAKING ON THE RISKS
OF WORKING IN A HOSPITAL MYSELF, BUT...
IT'S PERFECTLY UNDERSTANDABLE.
HOW FAR ALONG ARE YOU?
ALMOST 15 WEEKS.
GOOD. YOU DIDN'T EXPOSE YOURSELF
DURING THE FIRST TRIMESTER.
FEEL FREE TO OPT OUT OF TREATING
OR DOING ANYTHING THAT DOESN'T MAKE YOU FEEL COMFORTABLE
AND WE'LL JUST DEAL WITH THE REST AS WE GO ALONG, OKAY?
OKAY.
THANKS, KERRY.
SURE.
Romano: EXPOSE THE SPINUS PROCESS AND LAMINA.
Corday: THERE. THERE IT IS.
I CAN SEE THE BONY SPICULE
IMPINGING ON THE SPINAL CORD.
NO WONDER THIS KID COULDN'T MOVE HER LEGS.
LET'S RONGEUR THAT LITTLE TROUBLEMAKER.
SO... HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT WHAT I SAID?
ABOUT NOT WASTING YOUR LIFE ON THIS TRAUMA FELLOWSHIP.
WHAT? AND MISS OUT ON CASES LIKE THIS?
YOU'RE AVOIDING THE QUESTION.
FRANKLY, I DON'T THINK
I'VE GOT A LOT OF OPTIONS AT THE MOMENT, HAVE I?
I'D CONSIDER YOU FOR CARDIOTHORACIC.
I COULD SNEAK IN A LATE APPLICATION.
I THOUGHT THAT BELONGED TO PETER.
WELL, HE DIDN'T HESITATE TO THROW HIS HAT
INTO YOUR RICE BOWL, DID HE?
THIS FRAGMENT'S REALLY EMBEDDED.
( sudden drilling )
CAREFUL.
NOT A LARGE MARGIN OF ERROR HERE.
SHOULDN'T BE OUT OF BED.
HE'S GOING TO DIE, ISN'T HE?
IT'S TOO EARLY TO TELL.
I NEED YOU TO SIT DOWN HERE...
AND I NEED TO TAKE A LOOK AT THOSE DRESSINGS.
SO...
YOUR X RAY SHOWS THAT YOU HAVE A FRACTURED RIB.
OKAY.
( clears throat )
IT'S GOING TO HURT FOR A FEW WEEKS
BUT IT'LL HEAL ON ITS OWN.
IT'S A BRAVE THING YOU DID--
GOING BACK IN THERE FOR YOUR FRIEND.
IT WON'T MATTER, WILL IT?
WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN.
THEY TOOK MY BLOOD.
THEY THINK IT'S 'CAUSE I WAS DRUNK, DON'T THEY?
YOUR BLOOD-ALCOHOL LEVEL WAS .09.
I DIDN'T MEAN FOR THIS TO HAPPEN.
LET ME KNOW IF YOU'RE IN TOO MUCH PAIN.
OH, MY GOD...
OH, MY GOD! JUSTIN!
YOU ALL RIGHT?
IS HE GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT?
IT'S OKAY, MOM. I'M OKAY.
WHAT HAPPENED?
IT WAS THE CD PLAYER.
I WENT TO CHANGE THE CD.
I TOTALED THE CAR.
IT'S 93 ON 15 LITERS OF OXYGEN.
ANY BURNS TO THE AREA?
YEAH. HE HAD SOME SINGED NASAL HAIR.
GOOD CHANCE OF LARYNGEAL EDEMA.
WHAT'S THE WORD ON THE BURN UNIT?
THEY HAD TO CALL IN A REGISTRY NURSE.
SHE SHOULD BE HERE IN ABOUT AN HOUR.
YOU SHOULD TUBE WHILE HE'S STILL GOT AN AIRWAY.
I WAS JUST WAITING FOR THE PARENTS TO GET HERE.
THEY LEFT A HALF AN HOUR AGO.
HOW ABOUT THE SISTER?
MAYBE YOU COULD CALL THE NEIGHBORS--
SEE IF THE PARENTS HAVE A CAR PHONE.
IT'S UP TO YOU, BUT I DON'T WANT TO HEAR YOU HAD TO CRIKE HIM.
UNDERSTOOD. WHAT HAPPENS IF WE DON'T REACH THEM?
I TUBE HIM... AND HE DIES IN THE BURN UNIT
WITHIN THE NEXT WEEK.
THEY CAN STILL SAY GOOD-BYE.
I JUST WANTED TO GIVE HIM
THE CHANCE TO TALK TO THEM.
HOW IS SHE?
GOOD.
THE POLE NICKED HER LIVER.
WE REPAIRED THE DEFECT WITH VERY LITTLE BLOOD LOSS.
GOOD. THANKS.
MM-HMM.
HI.
HI.
I CALLED FAMILY SERVICES AND THEY'RE GOING TO WATCH BRUCE
UNTIL YOU CAN GET SOMEONE TO PICK HIM UP.
HOW'S HE DOING?
HE'S ASLEEP.
THANK YOU.
I'M, UM... I'M SORRY ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED DOWNSTAIRS.
YOU DON'T NEED TO EXPLAIN.
I UNDERSTAND.
IT WASN'T BECAUSE OF THE HIV STATUS.
I WAS AFRAID OF THE CMV.
REALLY, YOU DON'T NEED TO EXPLAIN.
( watch alarm beeping )
IS THAT YOURS?
YEAH.
TIME FOR YOUR MEDICATION?
DO YOU HAVE IT HERE?
THEY'RE AT HOME.
WELL, UM, I CAN GET IT FOR YOU HERE.
NO...
THANK YOU.
UM... MISSING A DOSE COULD MAKE IT HARDER TO TREAT THE HIV.
I'M DONE WITH THEM.
I'M SORRY?
I'M NOT GOING TO TAKE ANY MORE MEDICINE.
IT'S NOT WORTH IT.
I CAN'T FUNCTION.
ANDREA... I KNOW YOU'RE UPSET RIGHT NOW
BUT IF YOU DON'T TAKE
YOUR MEDICATION, THE CHANCES...
I KNOW WHAT IT MEANS.
BRUCE IS EIGHT.
HE NEEDS A MOTHER.
IT IS MORE IMPORTANT THAT HE HAVE A WELL MOTHER FOR NOW
THAN A SICK ONE FOR LONGER.
Romano: GOOD WORK, LIZZIE.
Corday: WHAT DO YOU THINK?
I GIVE HER 50-50.
ROBERT, HAVE YOU GOT A MINUTE?
UH... SURE. YOU GOT HER, LIZZIE?
YEAH.
LOOK, I WANT TO DO THIS NOW.
WHERE ARE YOU ON THIS TRAUMA FELLOWSHIP?
WELL, LIKE I'VE ALREADY TOLD YOU
I DON'T REALLY SEE THE NEED
BUT IF I'M THE MINORITY
I VOTE FOR THE GEORGETOWN GUY.
KERRY? PETER BENTON'S THE STRONGEST CANDIDATE.
MARK?
I DISAGREE.
ELIZABETH CORDAY BROUGHT US THE IDEA.
SHE HAS PASSION AND CERTAINLY THE TALENT.
SHE DOES, BUT I DON'T WANT EITHER OF THEM WASTED ON THIS.
THEY BOTH APPLIED, DIDN'T THEY?
WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE ALL
OF SEPARATE MINDS.
IT'S LATE, AND I WANT TO GO HOME
SO I'M GOING TO MAKE THIS QUICK.
PETER BENTON IT IS.
THANK YOU.
HOW'S HE DOING?
PULSE OX 92.
COULD YOU GET DR. CARTER?
SURE.
TRAVIS, ARE YOU AWAKE?
THE DOCTOR NEEDS TO PUT A TUBE DOWN YOUR THROAT
TO HELP YOU BREATHE NOW.
( breathing heavily )
CAN YOU TALK?
( whispering ): YES.
I HAVE YOUR PARENTS ON THE PHONE
AND THEY'RE IN A CAR ON THEIR WAY HERE.
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT WANT TO TALK TO THEM FIRST.
HOW LONG?
THEY SHOULD BE HERE IN ABOUT 45 MINUTES
BUT WE CAN'T WAIT THAT LONG.
HOW LONG'S THE TUBE GOING TO BE IN?
( whistling breaths )
AT LEAST A FEW DAYS.
( gasping breaths )
ARE YOU READY?
OKAY...
( gasping breaths )
MR. MITCHELL?
OKAY, YOU CAN TALK TO HIM NOW.
OKAY. OKAY, TRAV, IT'S OKAY.
OKAY.
OKAY. THERE YOU GO.
HEY... HEY, DAD...
I KNOW. I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.
DID THE DOCTOR TELL YOU?
IT'S-IT'S PRETTY BAD.
I DON'T THINK I'M GOING TO...
UM... I DON'T THINK I'M GOING TO GET OUT
TO THE LAKE THIS SUMMER.
I DON'T KNOW.
THEY-THEY TOOK HER TO SURGERY.
I HAVEN'T HEARD ANYTHING YET.
( gasping )
THEY... THEY HAVE TO PUT THIS, UH...
THIS TUBE IN ME
SO I'M NOT GOING TO BE ABLE...
...TALK FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS.
OKAY, I'LL-I'LL SEE YOU WHEN YOU GET HERE.
HEY... MOM...
GOT TO... GOT TO HANG IN THERE.
I'M-I'M OKAY.
JUST A LITTLE.
I LOVE... I LOVE YOU, TOO.
( gasping )
PULSE OX 89.
DRAW UP FOUR OF VERSED AND TEN OF NORCURON
AND SET UP AT YANKAUER TIP.
NUMBER EIGHT E.T. TUBE.
OKAY, TRAVIS... YOU'RE GOING TO FEEL A LITTLE SLEEPY.
WHEN YOU WAKE UP, THERE'S GOING TO BE
A VENTILATOR HELPING YOU BREATHE.
HEY.
THAT'S NOT A VERY ENCOURAGING ENTRANCE.
I'M SORRY.
YOU DIDN'T GET THE TRAUMA FELLOWSHIP.
IS IT PETER?
YEAH.
WELL, THAT'S THAT, THEN.
I WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU.
YEAH. SAME HERE.
SO NOW WHAT?
WELL, I GUESS I'M LEFT TO FERRET AROUND
PICKING UP SCRAPS WHEREVER I CAN FIND THEM.
IT DOESN'T MEAN PETER WAS A BETTER CANDIDATE.
OH, I KNOW.
HOW MUCH MORE TIME DO YOU HAVE ON YOUR INTERNSHIP?
THREE WEEKS.
WELL, YOU HAVE YOUR LICENSE.
YOU CAN DO ANYTHING YOU WANT.
EXCEPT THE TRAUMA FELLOWSHIP.
JUST ABOUT ANYTHING.
HOW DID THE VOTING GO?
I THINK YOU KNOW.
YEAH. ROMANO DIDN'T WANT EITHER OF US.
ANSPAUGH WAS KEEN ON BENTON.
DON'T TELL ME YOU WERE.
NO, I WANTED YOU...
BUT I'M NOT REALLY OBJECTIVE.
REALLY?
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU NEED?
WHAT?
A MILKSHAKE. WHEN DO YOU GET OFF?
( laughs ): MIDNIGHT.
OKAY. I'LL FIND YOU.
IS THIS MORE OF YOUR BAD-DAY THERAPY?
IT'S FREE OF CHARGE.
I'M SORRY.
( speaking Spanish )
WHAT ABOUT THE PLACE UP THE STREET?
NO. YOU DON'T WANT TO GO THERE.
EXCUSE ME.
HEY, WHO IS THAT?
WHO?
OVER THERE, TALKING TO CHUNY.
I DON'T KNOW. SHE WORKS IN UROLOGY. REALLY?
CARTER, ARE YOU ON FOR A WHILE?
YEAH, ANOTHER SIX HOURS.
GOT A SOCIAL WORKER COMING
FROM THE HIV CLINIC.
NEEDS TO SEE A PATIENT UPSTAIRS.
SURGICAL WARD? SURE.
RANDI, DID YOU GET THAT?
UH, YEAH. HIV CLINIC TO CARTER.
GOOD NIGHT.
YEAH, SHE'S RIGHT HERE.
CAROL... DOUG.
I'LL, UH, I'LL GET IT IN THE LOUNGE.
HEY, CHUNY.
WHAT?
IS THAT THE SAME FRIEND
THAT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT?
YOU'RE TOO LATE NOW, CARTER.
WHAT, THERE WAS A TIME LIMIT?
I DIDN'T THINK YOU WERE THAT SHALLOW.
NO. I'M JUST RECONSIDERING YOUR PROPOSAL.
YOU SNOOZE, YOU LOSE.
WHAT ARE WE-- IN TENTH GRADE?
I SET HER UP WITH AN ORTHOPEDICS INTERN.
AN INTERN?
TELL YOU WHAT, IF YOU'RE NICE
I'LL TRY TO GET HER TO RECONSIDER.
ADIOS.
LUCY, THE PHARMACY CALLED.
YOUR PRESCRIPTION IS READY.
YOU SICK? NO!
WHAT IS IT THEN?
NOTHING.
WHY YOU ON MEDICATION?
WHY ARE YOU SO NOSY?
WHO PRESCRIBED IT?
IT'S NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.
YEAH, THIS MORNING, YOU WERE EXHAUSTED.
THEN YOU POP SOME PILL AND SUDDENLY YOU WERE FINE.
NOW YOU'RE DRAGGING AGAIN.
I'M NOT ON SPEED
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE ASKING.
SO WHAT IS IT?
RITALIN. OKAY? I'M ON RITALIN.
RITALIN, SINCE WHEN?
FIFTH GRADE.
WHAT? MY DOCTOR TRIED
TO GET ME OFF IT IN HIGH SCHOOL.
MY GRADES DROPPED, SO I WENT BACK ON.
THERE'S NEVER REALLY BEEN A GOOD TIME TO STOP.
NOW. NOW WOULD BE A GOOD TIME TO STOP.
I'M NOT AN ADDICT, CARTER.
LUCY, YOU SHOULDN'T STILL BE TAKING IT.
IT'S A STIMULANT.
I DON'T TAKE IT TO GET HIGH.
I TAKE IT TO FUNCTION.
AND IT'S NEVER REALLY BEEN A PROBLEM
UNTIL I STARTED WORKING SO MANY NIGHTS.
RITALIN IS FOR HYPERACTIVE CHILDREN; YOU'RE 24.
AND MY DOCTOR STILL PRESCRIBES IT
SO I'M NOT DOING ANYTHING WRONG.
YOU GOING TO KEEP TAKING IT FOREVER?
I'LL STOP WHEN THINGS ARE LESS HECTIC.
THINGS ARE NEVER LESS HECTIC.
I'LL THINK ABOUT IT.
BUT THIS REALLY IS MY BUSINESS, CARTER
AND I HOPE YOU'LL RESPECT THAT.
Woman: The signer's head leans to the right
and rests in the upturned palm of the open right hand...
HEY.
HEY.
I SUPPOSE CONGRATULATIONS ARE IN ORDER.
LOOK, ELIZABETH...
YOU DON'T HAVE TO SAY THAT.
PETER, I'M JUST TRYING TO BE GRACIOUS.
THANK YOU.
PETER.
ELIZABETH, WOULD YOU EXCUSE US, PLEASE?
CERTAINLY.
THANK YOU.
YOU DO LACK SOME QUALITIES, PETER
BUT I ALWAYS CONSIDERED YOU A MAN OF YOUR WORD.
I NEVER SAID I'D TAKE IT.
YOU SAID YOU WANTED CARDIOTHORACIC.
NO. I SAID I WAS INTERESTED.
YOU MISSED YOUR CALLING, PETER.
YOU SHOULD'VE BEEN A LAWYER.
I COULDN'T COUNT ON IT.
I TOLD YOU THAT
I WOULD BE PUSHING FOR YOU.
I HAVE BEEN.
THANK YOU, BUT I'M TAKING
THE TRAUMA FELLOWSHIP, OKAY?
FINE. WHATEVER, PETER.
I'M DONE LOOKING OUT FOR YOU.
YOU WANT TO THROW YOUR LIFE DOWN THE TOILET
THAT'S YOUR PREROGATIVE. YEAH, IT IS.
JUST DON'T COME CRYING TO ME
WHEN YOU REALIZE WHAT A MISTAKE YOU'VE MADE.
WERE YOU SERIOUS?
WHAT?
THE OFFER YOU MADE TODAY-- WERE YOU SERIOUS?
DR. GREENE, SOME WEIRD GUY DROPPED THIS OFF FOR YOU.
WHAT IS IT?
DO I READ YOUR MAIL?
"THANKS FOR PATCHING UP AMBER."
WHO'S AMBER?
WELL, SHE'S A STRIPPER.
WHOA. MUST'VE LIKED YOU A LOT.
HOW MUCH IS THERE?
LOOKS LIKE ABOUT TWO GRAND.
WHOO. PARTY.
LOOK, RANDI, GET OUT THE PHONE BOOK.
LOOK UP FBI AND HAVE THEM COME PICK THIS UP.
EXCUSE ME?
UH, I'M GREG MITCHELL.
OUR SON AND DAUGHTER WERE IN AN ACCIDENT.
I SAW BOTH OF THEM HERE IN THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT.
OH. WHERE ARE THEY?
SHANNON UNDERWENT SURGERY.
THERE WAS A BROKEN VERTEBRAE IN HER BACK
THAT WAS IMPINGING ON HER SPINAL CORD.
BUT SHE'S GOING TO BE OKAY?
THERE'S A POSSIBILITY THAT
SHE'LL LOSE FUNCTION BELOW HER WAIST.
OH, GOD.
TRAVIS SUFFERED THIRD-DEGREE BURNS
OVER THE MAJORITY OF HIS BODY.
THIRD DEGREE?
HE'S UP IN THE BURN UNIT.
THEY'RE DOING EVERYTHING THEY CAN
TO MAKE HIM AS COMFORTABLE AS POSSIBLE.
BUT I HAVE TO TELL YOU
THAT WITH BURNS OF THIS MAGNITUDE
THE SURVIVAL RATE IS VERY LOW.
IS HE GOING TO DIE?
HE HAS A 20% CHANCE OF SURVIVAL.
OH! OH, GOD.
OH, GOD. NO!
NO!
( monkey playing Macarena )
( song stops playing )
( Mrs. Mitchell sobbing )
YOU'RE UP.
WHERE AM I?
THE O.R. RECOVERY ROOM.
WE OPERATED ON YOUR BACK.
YOU WERE IN A CAR ACCIDENT.
DO YOU REMEMBER?
OH...
I THOUGHT IT WAS A DREAM.
CAN I DO A QUICK TEST?
I WANT YOU TO TELL ME
WHEN YOU FEEL SOMETHING, ALL RIGHT?
SHANNON?
ARE YOU WITH ME?
YEAH.
THERE.
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
IT'S NO BETTER.
IT'S NO WORSE.
YOUR BIG TOE'S DOING, SHALL WE?
I WANT YOU TO WIGGLE IT
JUST LIKE YOU DID BEFORE, ALL RIGHT?
AGAIN.
IS IT MOVING?
LET'S JUST WAIT AND SEE.
THE SWELLING HAS TO COME DOWN FIRST.
LILY, I TOOK MR. AND MRS. MITCHELL
UP TO THE BURN UNIT.
COULD YOU GO UP AND SHOW ONE OF THEM
TO SURGICAL RECOVERY?
SURE. THANKS.
UM, MARK, I WOULDN'T GO IN THERE.
WE'RE GIVING CAROL SOME SPACE.
DOUG CALLED.
CAROL?
GO AWAY, MARK.
DID YOU TELL HIM?
HE'S NOT COMING.
DID YOU ASK HIM NOT TO COME?
YEAH.
I WAS VERY STRONG...
AND CLEAR.
SO HE'S RESPECTING YOUR WISHES?
( laughs )
THAT WOULD BE A FIRST TIME, WOULDN'T IT?
( sniffs )
YOU WANTED HIM TO COME.
NO.
I'VE HAD... HUNDREDS OF CONVERSATIONS WITH HIM
IN MY HEAD, YOU KNOW?
WHAT I WOULD SAY, WHAT I WOULD...
DO IF HE SHOWED UP...
I WOULDN'T LET HIM CHARM HIS WAY BACK IN.
NOT NOW.
NOT BECAUSE OF THE BABY.
I WOULD NEVER FEEL SECURE
KNOWING THAT THAT'S WHY HE CAME BACK.
MAYBE HE FEELS THE SAME WAY.
I STILL EXPECTED HIM TO COME.
I'VE GOT TO GO HOME.
HMM... YOU KNOW WHAT YOU NEED?
WHAT?
WHAT?
YOU NEED A MILKSHAKE.
ELIZABETH AND I ARE GOING TO GO
GET A MILKSHAKE.
WHY DON'T YOU COME?
NO. I'M TIRED AND I'M GOING TO GO HOME.
JUST ONE...
ONE LITTLE MILKSHAKE, OKAY?
LOOK, NO, IT WASN'T, IT WASN'T A DATE.
UM, WE WERE JUST GOING TO DROWN OUR SORROWS IN ICE CREAM.
COME ON.
I DON'T WANT TO BE A THIRD WHEEL, MARK.
HOW MANY TIMES HAVE I BEEN A THIRD WHEEL?
THAT'S TRUE.
YOU DO OWE ME.
THAT'S THE SPIRIT.
ARE YOU PAYING?
'CAUSE I'M EATING FOR TWO, YOU KNOW.
