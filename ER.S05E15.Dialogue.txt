MOM! DAD! OW!
MOM! DAD!
MOM! DAD!
( girl crying )
MOM! DAD!
MOM! DAD!
WORST KIDS ARE UP FRONT.
THEY WERE COMING HOME FROM A SKI TRIP.
THREE OF THEM WERE TRAPPED UNDER THE PLOW.
TEN-YEAR-OLD FEMALE WITH CLOSED HEAD TRAUMA.
BLOWN PUPIL, ALTERED MENTAL STATUS.
LEFT LEG'S PINNED. PRESSURE'S 110 PALP.
BREATHING'S LABORED. RATE'S 32.
ALL RIGHT, TUBE AND HYPERVENTILATE HER.
NOTIFY COUNTY THAT WE HAVE A POSSIBLE INTRACRANIAL BLEED.
HAVE NEUROSURGERY AND C.T. STANDING BY.
WHAT DO YOU GOT?
PATIENT NUMBER FIVE: BROKEN LEFT FEMUR, FOOT'S PULSELESS.
YEAH. MOTTLED LEG.
POOR CAP REFILL.
CAN WE MOVE HER?
NO. SEAT HAS US WEDGED.
HOW DO I GET TO THE REST OF HER?
UP AND AROUND, DOC.
ALL RIGHT.
THANK YOU.
Boy: MOM! DAD!
I WANT MY MOM!
MOM!! DAD!!
MOM! DAD!
MOM, HELP!
MOM! DAD!
HELP! HELP!
IS THIS THE BROKEN FEMUR FROM THE OTHER SIDE?
SCRAPES AND BRUISES.
PRESSURE'S 100, RESPS 16.
GAVE HER EIGHT OF MORPHINE.
ANY BLEEDING UNDER THERE?
NOT THAT I COULD SEE. HER NAME'S J.J.
HI, J.J.
MY NAME'S MARK. HOW YOU FEELING?
I'M SCARED. I KNOW YOU ARE.
JUST HANG IN THERE.
LISTEN, YOUR LEG IS BROKEN
BUT I NEED YOU TO BE BRAVE FOR ME.
CAN YOU BE BRAVE?
OKAY.
OKAY, GOOD.
SPLINT THAT FRACTURE AS BEST YOU CAN
AND THROW ANOTHER BLANKET ON HER.
HOW LONG HAS SHE BEEN TRAPPED?
ABOUT 30 MINUTES. HOW MUCH TIME HAVE WE GOT?
HOW MUCH TIME FOR WHAT, GUYS?
TILL SHE LOSES HER LEG.
SIX HOURS. ANY OF THE OTHERS TRAPPED?
OH, YEAH. WE GOT A BOY JAMMED BETWEEN THE SEATS
TRAPPED UNDERNEATH THE GIRL HERE.
WE CAN HEAR HIM BUT WE CAN'T GET TO HIM.
TAKE IT EASY, DENNIS!
GOT A KID IN THE BACK, DOC. B.P.'s 50 PALP.
HE'S NOT MOVING HIS LEGS.
KEEP AN EYE ON HER VITALS.
LET ME KNOW IF ANYTHING CHANGES.
COULD BE LUMBOSACRAL PLEXUS INJURY WITH PARALYSIS.
YOU BEEN READING THE ROSEN'S AGAIN?
TAKING THE M-CATs IN A COUPLE OF WEEKS.
THEY POPPED THE BACK.
Greene: WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?
Zadro: CRANE.
THAT OUGHT TO DO IT.
DR. ANSPAUGH...
MAY I SPEAK WITH YOU FOR A MOMENT, PLEASE?
I HAVE TO FINISH MY ROUNDS.
YOU KNOW THAT DR. ROMANO HAS CLOSED THE E.R. CLINIC?
YOU LEFT US LITTLE CHOICE.
YOU CAN'T DO IT.
LISTEN, I AM IN A HURRY.
IF YOU WANT TO DISCUSS THIS FURTHER, CALL MY OFFICE.
SET UP AN APPOINTMENT.
DOCTOR, PLEASE...
I HAVE WORKED HERE FOR TEN YEARS
AND THIS E.R. CLINIC HAS MADE A REAL DIFFERENCE--
PREVENTING PEOPLE FROM GETTING SICK
HELPING THEM MAKE BETTER CHOICES.
I NO LONGER TRUST YOUR JUDGMENT.
SO HUNDREDS OF PATIENTS HAVE TO BE PUNISHED
BECAUSE OF MY MISTAKE?
IF THIS HOSPITAL IS REQUIRED TO PAY
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN DAMAGES
MORE THAN A FEW HUNDRED CLINIC PATIENTS
ARE GOING TO FIND THEMSELVES WITHOUT TREATMENT.
THEN I'LL QUIT.
I'LL QUIT.
I'LL HAND OVER THE CLINIC TO SOMEONE ELSE.
SOMEONE YOU DO TRUST.
BUT DON'T CLOSE IT, PLEASE.
NOT BECAUSE OF ME.
( groaning )
JEANIE?
I'VE BEEN IN AN ACCIDENT.
I'VE GOT A WOMAN BADLY HURT.
I NEED HELP, PLEASE!
WHAT'S GOING ON?
SCHOOL BUS GOT HIT BY A SNOW PLOW.
OH, MAN, I WAS HOPING FOR AN EASIER NIGHT.
HOW MANY?

DR. DOYLE IS WAITING FOR FILMS IN CURTAIN THREE
THE LAB IS LATE WITH BLOOD WORK FOR WEAVER IN EXAM FOUR
THERE'S SEVEN WAITING IN CHAIRS AND I AM OUT OF HERE.
POLICE ARE STILL IN TRAUMA.
I TOLD THEM TO BE OUT IN FIVE MINUTES.
JERRY, WHERE THE HELL YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING?
I'M OFF AT 7:30.
YOU'RE OFF WHEN I SAY YOU'RE OFF.
IS THAT NURSES, TOO?
YOU BETCHA. DAMN.
CARTER AND LUCY?
IN EXAM SIX.
CARTER AND LUCY WHAT IN EXAM SIX?
RURAL MINNESOTA, NORTH DAKOTA...
IN THE MIDDLE OF WINTER?
YEAH, WELL, YOU KNOW, IT PAYS $4,000 A WEEK.
IT SOUNDS MISERABLE.
IT SOUNDS LIKE TUITION AND A TUTOR FOR REESE TO ME.
DO WE KNOW WHAT'S COMING IN FIRST?
BLUNT CHEST TRAUMA, TRAUMATIC AMPUTATION
AND A KID WITH A POSSIBLE SPINAL CORD INJURY.
ALL AT ONCE?
LOVELY.
I'VE GONE THROUGH THE FILES.
MEDICINE WILL TAKE THE DIABETICS.
SAID THEY COULD USE THEM ON THEIR TEACHING SERVICE.
O.B.'s AGREED TO LOOK AFTER THE PRENATALS
ONCE THEY HIT THE THIRD TRIMESTER.
THE REST ARE ON THEIR OWN.
ANSPAUGH ISN'T CLOSING THE CLINIC.
WHAT?
HE DECIDED TO KEEP IT OPEN.
WELL, THAT'S GREAT NEWS.
WHAT DID YOU HAVE TO DO, SELL YOUR FIRSTBORN?
NO, I HAD TO QUIT.
YOU'RE JOKING.
I GET TO KEEP
MY E.R. JOB, BUT I'M OUT OF MANAGEMENT.
SO WHO'S GOING TO RUN THE CLINIC?
YOU ARE.
MM-MM. NO, NO, NO WAY.
I DON'T WANT THAT KIND OF RESPONSIBILITY.
TOUGH.
LOOK... PAPERWORK, THE FUNDRAISING
THE ENDLESS CRAP FROM ADMIT?
I'VE DONE IT. NO THANKS.
WOULD YOU RATHER SHUT DOWN THE CLINIC?
CAROL, I'M BAD AT IT.
I YELL AT THE WRONG PEOPLE, I PISS EVERYBODY OFF.
I'LL HELP YOU OUT.
IT'S EITHER THAT OR ALL THESE PEOPLE
HAVE NOWHERE ELSE TO GO.
YOUR CHOICE.
OH, CHUNY. HI.
HI.
YOU GOT A MINUTE?
SURE. WHAT'S UP?
UM...
EARLIER, WITH LUCY AND I...
I'M SURE THAT YOU HAVE YOUR SUSPICIONS
ABOUT WHAT WE WERE DOING IN THERE
BUT ACTUALLY, WE WERE JUST, UM...
KNOCKING BOOTS?
WHAT?
DOING THE OLD NASTY?
HEY, THE MORE THE MERRIER, I SAY.
ACTUALLY, WE WEREN'T DOING ANYTHING.
MM-HMM.
SHE'S A MED STUDENT, YOU KNOW?
I'M A... I'M A RESIDENT.
THAT STUFF HAPPENS ALL THE TIME.
LUCY'S LIKE... A LITTLE SISTER OR SOMETHING... TO ME.
AH, YOU DO THAT WITH YOUR LITTLE SISTER?
NOTHING HAPPENED. WE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.
DO YOU HEAR WHAT I'M TELLING YOU?
BESIDES, I ALREADY HAVE A GIRLFRIEND.
AH, THAT INSURANCE LADY?
SHE'S A FINANCIAL ADVISOR.
MMM.
ROXANNE AND I HAVE A LOT IN COMMON.
Oligario: UNITS ARE PULLING UP!
SHE'S TOO PUSHY, YOU KNOW?
ALWAYS TRYING TO SELL YOU SOMETHING.
I'D STICK WITH LUCY.

TRAUMATIC AMPUTATION BELOW THE LEFT WRIST.

NINE-YEAR-OLD BOY WHO WAS SITTING BACKWARDS
SLAMMED INTO THE EDGE OF THE METAL SEAT.
HE'S NOT MOVING HIS LEGS.
RESPS 16, B.P.'s DOWN TO 70/40.
COULD BE A LUMBAR FRACTURE.
WHAT ABOUT SPINAL SHOCK WITH THAT LOW B.P.?
INTERNAL BLEEDING MORE LIKELY.
LET'S ROUND UP AN ULTRASOUND.
11-YEAR-OLD FEMALE, BLUNT CHEST TRAUMA
DECREASED BREATH SOUNDS ON THE LEFT.
B.P.'s 80/40.

OKAY, THE AMPUTATION IS DISTAL
TO THE RADIUS AND THE ULNA.
I'LL CLAMP THAT BLEEDER.
HOW YOU DOING?
PEACHY.
CAN YOU SAVE IT?
IF THEY FIND THE HAND
MAYBE WE'VE GOT A CHANCE.
Marquez: PULSE OX DOWN TO 88.
YOU DOING OKAY?
SHE DROPPED HER SATS

WHERE'S THAT PORTABLE X-RAY?
Hathaway: CORDAY'S GOT IT.

AND LUCY, PALPATE
THE FIFTH INTERCOSTAL SPACE.
LIKE THIS?
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.
NOW, INCISE WITH A SCALPEL.
SPREAD WITH A KELLY, INSERT YOUR FINGER.
GOD, WHAT IS THAT?
WHAT?
THAT'S INTESTINE.
Knight: DID I MAKE THE INCISION LOW?
Carter: NO, THE DIAPHRAGM'S RUPTURED.
THE FORCE OF THE IMPACT
MUST HAVE PUSHED EVERYTHING UP.
LET'S CALL THE O.R. RIGHT NOW.
( girl screaming )
NO FREE FLUID IN THE BELLY.
Hathaway: EVERYONE'S ALL RIGHT.
CARTER'S GOT A RUPTURED DIAPHRAGM.
CORDAY CALLED VASCULAR.
Jerry: THERE'S TWO MORE AMBULANCES COMING IN.
BOTH PATIENTS ARE STABLE
WITH MULTIPLE LACERATIONS
AND POSSIBLE EXTREMITY FRACTURES.

PUPILS ARE... EQUAL AND REACTIVE.
WE NEED TO TRANSPORT HER.
HANG IN THERE, JEANIE, HANG IN THERE.
Man: THAT'S TOO UNSTABLE.
IF I START LIFTING
THE WEIGHT MAY SHIFT FORWARD
CRUSH EVERYTHING UNDERNEATH THAT BLADE.
HOW ABOUT ATTACHING IT TO THE FRONT?
I COULD TAKE THAT WHOLE CHASSIS WITH ME.
WE JUST NEED THE WEIGHT OFF
SO WE CAN PULL THE KIDS OUT.
I'VE GOT RAILROAD TIES ON THE TRUCK.
MAYBE WE CAN PUT SOME UNDER THE CHASSIS
TAKE SOME OF THE WEIGHT OFF THE BLADE
PUT IT BACK ONTO THE TRUCK.
WELL, LET'S DO IT.
BOYS, WE NEED SOME MUSCLE.
Morales: DOC!
I FOUND THE HAND.
ONE OF THE FINGERS IS PRETTY SMASHED UP
BUT OTHERWISE IT'S OKAY.
JUST PACK IT IN SALINE GAUZE WITH ICE
AND GET IT TO COUNTY.
HOW'S SHE DOING?
SHE'S CALMER, BUT STILL IN PAIN, DOC.
J.J., WE'RE GOING TO GET YOU OUT.
IT HURTS.
HOW MUCH MORPHINE
HAS SHE HAD?
20 MIGS. RESPIRATORY RATE'S DOWN
BUT SHE'S STILL MOANING.
GIVE HER ANOTHER FIVE.
THE TRAPPED BOY STOPPED TALKING.

COUPLE OF MINUTES AGO.
HEY, DENNIS, DENNIS, CAN YOU HEAR ME?

CAN YOU GET HIM OUT?
WE NEED A BACKBOARD.
Captain: YOU'LL NEVER BE ABLE TO MOVE AROUND.
WE'LL CUT IN FROM THE OUTSIDE.
DOC, WE NEED YOU!
I GOT HIM. GO, GO!
Audia: THE LEG'S A MESS.
HE'S STILL LOSING A LOT OF BLOOD.
PUMP UP A B.P. CUFF PROXIMAL TO THE FRACTURE
AND CLAMP IT OFF WITH A HEMOSTAT.
THAT OUGHT TO HOLD HER TILL SHE GETS TO THE E.R.
HAVE ORTHO AND VASCULAR STANDING BY
READY TO DO AN ANGIOGRAM.
TELL THEM WE DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME.
ARE YOU COMING WITH ME?
I'LL MEET YOU THERE, OKAY, J.J.?

WHAT KIND OF TESTS?
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO WAIT OUTSIDE.
WE'LL FIND YOU AS...
BUT HE'S GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT?
CAN YOU HELP THIS GENTLEMAN, PLEASE?
COME ON, LET THE DOCTORS DO THEIR WORK, SIR.
HE'S SHOCKY.
COULD BE A SPLEEN INJURY.
HE'LL NEED AN ULTRASOUND OR A D.P.L.
HOW ARE THE REST?
AMPUTATION'S ALREADY UP IN THE O.R.
HAS THE HAND MADE IT?
YUP. ONE, TWO, THREE.
ANSPAUGH TOOK THE FRACTURED KIDNEY UPSTAIRS.

HOW ABOUT THE GIRL WITH THE PULSELESS FOOT?
CORDAY'S PREPPING HER FOR AN ANGIOGRAM.
CONNIE, CAN YOU SEE IF C.T. CAN TAKE ANOTHER ONE?
NO SEAT BELTS ON THE BUS?
NOPE.

BUT WE SEND OUR CHILDREN OFF LIKE LAMBS TO THE SLAUGHTER.
YOU'RE A MESS. WHY DON'T YOU GET CLEANED UP?

B.P. 70 PALP, PULSE 40.
HIS NAME, ANTHONY MARTINO, WAS WRITTEN INSIDE HIS JACKET.
HE'S THROWING P.V.C.s
MUST HAVE IRRITATED HIS HEART.
PREP FOR A WARM PERITONEAL LAVAGE.
HOW'S SHE DOING?
ANGIOGRAM SHOWED A PARTIAL TEAR IN THE POPLITEAL.
I REDUCED HER FRACTURE, GOT BACK A WEAK PULSE.
THERE'S GOOD COLLATERAL CIRCULATION.
WE'VE BOUGHT VASCULAR A LITTLE TIME.
HI.
I SEE YOU STILL HAVE YOUR FIREMAN'S HAT.
IS MY MOM HERE?
I'M NOT SURE, BUT I'LL GO FIND OUT.
WHAT'S YOUR LAST NAME?

PARAMEDICS COMING IN HOT.
KID CRUMPED IN THE RIG.
OKAY, CLEAR A TRAUMA ROOM NOW.
I'M GOING TO CHECK ON CARTER'S HYPOTHERMIC KID.
DR. GREENE? WHAT?
KUBBY EKABO. YOU TALKED TO MY HUSBAND, MOBALAGE.
I'M SORRY, IT'S A LITTLE HECTIC NOW.
WE WENT TO SEE THE DOCTOR
AND MOBALAGE HAS BEEN SCHEDULED TO HAVE THE SURGERY...
CAN YOU SEE IF THERE'S SOMEONE HERE FOR A J.J. MITCHELL?
HEY, CAROL, DO YOU GOT A MINUTE?
YEAH, WHAT'S UP?
YES, I'M SORRY. WHAT?
THE SURGERY. I THINK IT MIGHT BE A MISTAKE.
WHY?
DOES HE NEED IT?
IF HE WANTS TO GET BETTER.
DOES HE NEED TO GET BETTER?
OH, GOD.
MS. EKABO, IT'S NORMAL FOR YOU
TO HAVE ANXIETY BEFORE A SURGERY.
THERE'S ALWAYS SOME RISK, BUT IN YOUR HUSBAND'S CASE
IT'S MINIMAL. HE SHOULD REGAIN
FULL FUNCTION.
HEY, WE NEED A HAND!
WHICH ONE IS IT?
PATIENT NUMBER 13.
BROKEN RIBS, MINOR HEAD INJURIES.
I THOUGHT SHE WAS STABLE.
SHE CRASHED EN ROUTE.
SINUS ON THE SCOPE, NO VITALS.
TUBED HER, BUT I COULDN'T FIND A LINE.
OKAY, HOW LONG?
EIGHT MINUTES.
LET'S GO.
HERE WE GO.
PUPILS MID-RANGE AND SLUGGISH.
JERRY, WHERE ARE WE?
PEDES CLINIC. BEST I CAN DO.

I CAN'T TALK RIGHT NOW.
WAIT IN CHAIRS. I'LL BE THERE
AS SOON AS I CAN.
NO PULSE WITHOUT C.P.R.
LAST EPI? THREE MINUTES.
ANOTHER AMP DOWN THE E.T. TUBE.
WHAT HAPPENED TO CAROL?
DOUG AND JEANIE CRASHED HEAD-ON INTO AN OVERPASS.
DOUG'S ALL RIGHT, JEANIE'S HURT.
UNIT 29's PULLING IN WITH THEM RIGHT NOW.
MARK, WE'RE HERE.
VITALS ARE STABLE
CONTUSIONS OF FACE, FOREHEAD AND ABDOMEN.
PRECAUTIONS, EVERYONE.
B.P. IS 130/94...
SHE CAME TO A FEW MINUTES AGO.
DO YOU KNOW WHAT DAY IT IS?
THURSDAY.
SHE LOST CONSCIOUSNESS.
TRACHEA MIDLINE, NO APPARENT CHEST INJURIES.
SHE WASN'T WEARING A SEAT BELT.
DOUG, LET ME LOOK AT YOUR HEAD.
WE NEED A C.T. AND A TRAUMA PANEL.
DOUG, WE GOT IT. BACK OFF.
GUARDING, TENDERNESS
IN THE RIGHT UPPER QUADRANT. GET A C.T.
EVERYBODY GET BACK TO WORK! GET OUT OF THERE, DOUG.
DR. ROSS, STEP BACK!
SHE COULD HAVE A LIVER INJURY.
WE'LL CATCH IT IF SHE DOES.
CARTER'S HYPOTHERMIC TEN-YEAR-OLD'S IN TROUBLE.
OKAY, PETER, YOU GOT HER?
YEAH.
LOOK, I'LL TAKE CARTER, YOU STAY HERE WITH JEANIE.
NO, I WILL TAKE CARTER.
YOU ARE OFF THIS STATION!
YOU ARE NOT WORKING IN THIS HOSPITAL!
NOT TONIGHT! NOW, SIT DOWN
AND LET CAROL LOOK AT YOUR HEAD!
ALL RIGHT, NO PERITONEAL SIGNS.
LET'S GET THE TRAUMA PANEL.
COME ON.
GET A C.T. ON THE HEAD, AND A BELLY.
GET THE O-NEG!
WE'RE ACTIVELY RE-WARMING WITH FOLEY, N.G. AND E.T.
BUT HE'S STILL HYPOTHERMIC AT 84 DEGREES.
WHAT DO YOU SUGGEST?
CARDIAC BYPASS.
HEART RATE'S DOWN TO 30, B.P. 60 PALP.
HE'S SOAKED.
OH. OH, GOD. CONDUCTIVE LOSS.
LET'S GET THESE WET CLOTHES OFF OF HIM.
YOU'RE HEADED IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.
NO BYPASS, JUST KEEP WARMING.
NOTIFY THE O.R. THEY'VE GOT ANOTHER EX-LAP PENDING.
WHAT IF HE GOES INTO V-FIB?
HE WON'T MAKE IT TO THE O.R.
MARK, I COULDN'T FIND ANYBODY FOR A J.J. MITCHELL.
YOU WANT ME TO SEE IF WE HAVE A PHONE NUMBER, CALL?
YEAH, COULD YOU?
HOW ARE DOUG AND JEANIE?
OKAY. JEANIE'S GOT A CONCUSSION.
HEY, JERRY, WHY IS EVERYONE IN THE HALL?
ALL THE BEDS ARE FULL, AND THE MINORS ARE SHOWING UP.
WE GOT A BROKEN JAW WITH A TONGUE LACERATION COMING IN.
YEAH, WELL, WHY DON'T YOU CALL UP TO MEDICINE
SEE IF THEY HAVE ANY SPARE RESIDENTS.
O.R.s ARE STILL BACKED UP.
I'LL START CALLING AROUND
TO TRANSPORT J.J. TO ANOTHER HOSPITAL.
NOT A SURGICAL CASE, I TRUST?
GIRL WITH AN OPEN FRACTURE.
IT'S BEEN FOUR HOURS.
WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME.
WHERE'S MY RUPTURED SPLEEN?
TRAUMA ONE.
SOUNDS LIKE A GREAT TEACHING CASE.
IF THEY DON'T GET TO HER SOON, SHE'S GOING TO LOSE HER LEG.
WE GOT AT LEAST TWO HOURS.
CALL MERCY ANYWAY. DAMN RIGHT.
YOU'RE GOING TO NEED SUTURES.
SORRY.
FOR EVERYTHING.
I'M GOING TO GO TO ANSPAUGH.
I'M GOING TO THROW MYSELF ON MY SWORD
SEE IF HE'LL OPEN THE CLINIC AGAIN.
ANSPAUGH'S GOING TO KEEP THE CLINIC OPEN.
HE CHANGED HIS MIND?
I THREW MYSELF ON MY SWORD.
LYNETTE EVANS IS GOING TO TAKE OVER THE CLINIC.
I'M BACK TO MY BLUE-COLLAR ROOTS
PUNCHING THE CLOCK IN THE E.R.
( sighs )
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.
THERE ISN'T ANYTHING TO SAY.
IT'S DONE.
JUST HAVE TO ACCEPT IT AND MOVE ON.
I'M GOING TO RESIGN...
TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED.
I'M DESTROYING MY RELATIONSHIP WITH YOU.
I'VE PROBABLY LOST MY BEST FRIEND.
I'VE CERTAINLY DAMAGED BOTH OF YOUR CAREERS.
I HATE WEAVER.
I HATE ROMANO.
IT'S TIME TO GO.
WHERE?
I LIKED SEATTLE
WHEN I WAS IN MED SCHOOL.
I DIDN'T SEE MUCH OF IT
BUT I LIKED IT. SEATTLE?
THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST.
TAKE THAT JOB OFFER IN PORTLAND.
IT'S PRETTY UP THERE.
IT'S CLEAR.
YOU'D LIKE IT.
COME WITH ME.
CAROL, WE GOT ANOTHER RIG COMING IN.
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.
I LOVE YOU.
I GREW UP HERE.
MY FAMILY'S HERE, MY FRIENDS, MY JOB.
YOU JUST GOT DEMOTED.
YEAH, WELL, YOU HAD SOMETHING
TO DO WITH THAT, DIDN'T YOU?
HEY...
COME WITH ME.
I GOT TO GET BACK TO WORK.
WE'LL TALK ABOUT IT LATER, OKAY?
( door shutting )
DISLOCATED RIGHT INDEX FINGER
AND EAR LACERATION.
MY HOOP EARRING GOT STUCK ON MY COAT.
HOW MANY MORE YOU HAVE COMING IN?
ELISE IS THE LAST.
MARK, MAGGIE NEEDS YOU IN TWO.
ALL RIGHT, FIND A SPOT FOR HER.
OH, MAN.
UH, MRS. EKABO...
CAROL, DO YOU
HAVE A SECOND?
NOT REALLY. NO.
CAN YOU TALK TO MRS. EKABO?
THIS IS MOBALAGE'S WIFE, THE CUSTODIAN.
HE'S GOING TO HAVE SURGERY TOMORROW
FOR ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION. SHE'S A LITTLE ANXIOUS.
OKAY. SURE.
MRS. EKABO, I... I'M SORRY.
NURSE HATHAWAY'S GOING TO BE ABLE
TO ANSWER ANY OF YOUR QUESTIONS, OKAY?
I'LL BE RIGHT WITH YOU.
JEANIE'S HEAD C.T. IS NORMAL
NO SIGN OF A BLEED.
HER ABDOMINAL C.T.
SHOWS A SMALL AMOUNT OF FLUID AROUND THE LIVER.
YEAH. THAT COULD BE BLOOD.
NO. NO. NO. NO. LIVER'S INTACT, NO LACERATION.
PAIN ON PALPATION?
MM-HMM.
THOSE HER LABS?
YEAH.
C.B.C.'s NORMAL.
L.F.T. IS ELEVATED, ESPECIALLY A.L.T.
P.T. IS HIGH.
FROM A TRAUMA?
BILIRUBIN'S ABNORMAL, ALBUMIN IS LOW.
SO...
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
I THINK THESE RESULTS DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO
WITH THE ACCIDENT.
YEAH. NEITHER DO I.
SO WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?
DRAW UP A HEPATITIS PANEL
AND, UH, GIVE HER SOME VITAMIN K
ADMIT HER TO MEDICINE FOR A LIVER BIOPSY.
OH, MRS. EKABO.
I'M SORRY FOR MAKING YOU WAIT.
DO YOU WANT A SODA?
UM, DR. GREENE SAID THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE SOME QUESTIONS
ABOUT YOUR HUSBAND'S SURGERY.
DO YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO MOBALAGE?
HE WAS TORTURED IN NIGERIA, RIGHT?
UM...
DR. GREENE SAID THAT AFTER TOMORROW
HE WILL BE ABLE TO...
HAVE RELATIONS AGAIN?
YES. IF IT'S SUCCESSFUL.
I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN.
CAN YOU TELL ME WHY NOT?
MOBALAGE WAS A STUDENT LEADER.
A DISSIDENT.
AFTER THEY TORTURED HIM, HE FLED.
WHEN I JOINED HIM HERE, HE WAS HAPPY WE WERE TOGETHER
BUT NOT INTERESTED IN ME THAT WAY.
WELL, UM...
YOU HAVE TO... YOU HAVE TO HELP HIM THROUGH THIS.
I SHOULD GO.
I'M SORRY TO BOTHER YOU.
WAIT. MRS. EKABO...
WHAT IS IT?
I CAN'T.
YOU CAN'T... WHAT?
AFTER HE LEFT, THEY CAME FOR ME.
TEN SOLDIERS...
EACH TOOK THEIR TURN.
ALL NIGHT AND INTO THE NEXT DAY.
IN OUR HOME.
I NEVER TOLD HIM.
I WANT HIM TO BE HAPPY, BUT...
I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN BE WITH A MAN AGAIN.
YOU HAVE TO TELL HIM.
IT WOULD KILL HIM.
BUT HE LOVES YOU.
NO...
HEY.
HEY.
I DIDN'T MEAN TO WAKE YOU UP.
SORRY.
WHAT TIME IS IT?
IT'S, UH... 2:30.
SUTURES LOOK GREAT.
WHO DID THEM?
PETER.
TOOK FOREVER.
KIND OF A PERFECTIONIST, IF YOU HADN'T NOTICED.
I GOT A BED FOR YOU UPSTAIRS
SO YOU CAN GET SOME REAL SLEEP.
HOW ARE YOU FEELING?
SORE.
SO WHAT IS IT?
PETER TOOK SOME MORE BLOOD.
UM...
HOW-HOW HAVE YOU BEEN FEELING LATELY?
A LITTLE RUN-DOWN.
IS IT AIDS?
NO.
YOUR T-CELL COUNT WAS NORMAL
BUT YOUR LIVER FUNCTION TESTS INDICATE
THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE HEPATITIS
AND YOUR ABDOMINAL C.T.
SHOWED A SMALL AMOUNT OF FLUID
AROUND YOUR LIVER CAPSULE.
HAVE YOU BEEN TESTED?
YEAH, I HAD, UM...
HEPATITIS "B" VACCINATION FIVE OR SIX YEARS AGO.
I HADN'T HAD AN "A."
SO YOU THINK IT'S "C"?
IT MIGHT BE.
WE NEED TO ADMIT YOU AND DO A FEW TESTS.
THAT SOUNDS LIKE THE DOCTOR ANSWER.
I WAS KIND OF HOPING FOR A GOOD FRIEND ANSWER.
YEAH.
YEAH.
THAT WOULD BE MY GUESS.
ALL THIS TIME, I'M WORRYING ABOUT HIV
AND I GET HEPATITIS "C."
HUH?
WE SHOULD DO THE BIOPSY.
I-I MIGHT... I MIGHT BE WRONG.
WOULDN'T BE THE FIRST TIME.
MAYBE THE SECOND TIME.
MAYBE THE THIRD TIME.
WOW, I JUST THOUGHT
SHE WAS ANXIOUS ABOUT THE SURGERY.
SHE IS.
IT'S SCHEDULED FOR THIS MORNING.
I KNOW.
WE NEED TO GET THEM SOME THERAPY.
I'LL CALL RILEY--
SEE IF HE KNOWS ANYBODY WHO SPECIALIZES
IN P.T.S.D. IN TORTURE VICTIMS.
DOUG SAYS HE'S GOING TO QUIT.
YEAH?
I THINK HE'S SERIOUS.
MAYBE HE SHOULD.
YOU WANT HIM TO GO?
I'M DONE, CAROL.
I LOVE HIM LIKE A BROTHER
BUT I CAN'T DO THIS ANYMORE.
IT'S TOO HARD.
HE SAYS HE WANTS TO MOVE TO SEATTLE OR PORTLAND.
HE WANTS ME TO GO WITH HIM.
ARE YOU GOING TO?
I CAN'T REMEM... REMEMBER A TIME WHEN I DIDN'T LOVE HIM.
I'LL MISS YOU...
MAYBE MORE THAN I'LL MISS HIM.
( laughs )
I GOT TO GO.
MRS. MARTINO?
ANTHONY'S STABLE.
SO, IS HE OKAY?
WELL, HE'S GOING TO NEED EXPLORATORY SURGERY
BUT I THINK HE'S GOING TO BE FINE.
CAN I SEE HIM?
YES, PLEASE.
FOLLOW ME.
THANK YOU.
SHE SEEMS HAPPY.
VERY.
IT'S GOING TO BE LIGHT SOON.
( sighs )
WHEN DID YOU SLEEP LAST?
DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY.
YOU?
24 HOURS AGO.
I FEEL LIKE AN INTERN AGAIN.
GOOD WORK.
YEAH. YOU, TOO.
IS THIS WHERE YOU WORK?
MOST OF THE TIME, YEAH.
I'M SURPRISED TO SEE YOU STILL HERE
THIS LATE AT NIGHT.
I THOUGHT DOCTORS MADE
LIFE-AND-DEATH DECISIONS ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE'S FAMILIES
AND THEN GO HOME TO THEIR MILLION-DOLLAR HOMES
AND STOLI MARTINIS.
HE WAS IN AGONY.
HE WAS DYING--
NOT IN DAYS, IN HOURS.
YOU STOLE MY SON FROM ME.
JOI CALLED AND I CAUGHT THE FIRST FLIGHT OUT.
I CAME AS QUICKLY AS I COULD.
RICKY DIED AND I WASN'T THERE.
I DIDN'T GET TO HOLD HIS HAND.
I DIDN'T GET TO SAY GOOD-BYE.
YOU STOLE THAT FROM ME.
MMM.
THAT'S DISGUSTING.
REALLY?
IT'S NOT BAD.
I WAS THINKING ABOUT GETTING ANOTHER ONE.
YOU GOT ANYMORE QUARTERS?
( door slams )
DEEP STAB WOUND TO THE CHEST, LARGE KITCHEN KNIFE.
B.P. 70 PALP.
RAN TWO LITERS SALINE IN.
COULDN'T GET THE PRESSURE BACK UP.
PULSE OX IS 91
ON TEN LITERS.
MARK, IT'S MRS. EKABO.
WHAT? WH-WHAT HAPPENED?
HER HUSBAND FREAKED OUT.
CALLED 911, BUT WOULDN'T LET US IN.
SHE WAS BLEEDING ALL OVER THE PLACE.
HANG TWO UNITS OF O-NEG.
ORDER FOUR TYPE-SPECIFIC
AND CROSS MATCH ANOTHER FOUR.
PULSE IS WEAK AND THREADY AT 140.
OKAY, EVERYBODY, WE'RE GOING TO DO THIS
ON MY COUNT, NICE AND EASY.
READY?
ONE, TWO, THREE.
OKAY, LET'S GET AN E.K.G.
Jarvik: POOR CAP REFILL.
MARK, SHE'S COLD.
NO BREATH SOUNDS ON THE RIGHT.
TRACHEAL SHIFT TO THE LEFT.
SHE'S GOT DILATED NECK VEINS.
TENSION PNEUMO, 14 GAUGE.
I'LL DECOMPRESS.
WHERE'S HER HUSBAND?
HE JUMPED OUT THE WINDOW.
WHAT?
COPS RAMMED DOWN THE DOOR FOR US.
HE TOOK OFF ON FOOT.
THEY WERE STILL CHASING HIM WHEN WE LEFT.
WHERE THE HELL'S THE TRAUMA TEAM?
REALLY, WE'RE NOT VERY COMPATIBLE.
I THINK THE BEST THING FOR US TO DO IS
TO GO BACK TO BEING...
HEY.
HI. HEY.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING UP HERE?
UH, WAITING FOR YOU.
REALLY?
UM... YEAH.
LOOK, IS THERE SOMEPLACE THAT WE CAN, UH, WE CAN GO?
UM, WE COULD GO BACK TO MY DORM.
MY ROOMMATE LEAVES BY 6:30.
YOUR DORM?
OKAY, FINE, YOUR PLACE, THEN.
WEAVER'S HOUSE?
NO, NO, SEE, THIS IS THE PROBLEM.
( clears throat )
YOU'RE A STUDENT AND I'M A RESIDENT.
RIGHT, SO YOU SAID.
AND WE'RE NOT VERY COMPATIBLE.
THAT'S TRUE.
VERY FEW PEOPLE DRIVE ME CRAZY THE WAY THAT YOU DO.
YEAH, YOU IRRITATE THE HELL OUT OF ME.
RIGHT. RIGHT.
SO, CLEARLY, THIS IS NOT SOMETHING
THAT'S GOING TO WORK.
BETWEEN HOSPITAL POLICY
AND US NOT REALLY LIKING EACH OTHER
WE SHOULD JUST ACCEPT THE FACT THAT YESTERDAY WAS A MISTAKE
AND WE SHOULD, UH... THINGS SHOULD GO
BACK TO BEING THE WAY THEY WERE BEFORE.
OH.
I THINK THAT'S THE SMARTEST THING TO DO
FOR EVERYONE INVOLVED.
OH.
WE COULD JUST HAVE SEX.
NO, NO, THAT'S MY POINT.
WE CAN'T JUST HAVE SEX.
I DON'T WANT TO HAVE...
HI. HOW ARE YOU?
IT WAS A MISTAKE. IT WAS WRONG.
GOT YOU.
CARTER, YOU'RE REALLY GULLIBLE.
OH, THAT WASN'T FUNNY.
SURE, IT IS.
YOU DON'T WANT TO HANG OUT
THAT'S FINE WITH ME.
I'M NOT ATTRACTED TO YOU ANYWAY.
OH, YOU'RE NOT?
NO. YOU'RE A LITTLE CLOSED OFF FOR MY TASTES.
CLOSED OFF?
EMOTIONALLY WITHDRAWN.
NOT IN TOUCH WITH YOUR FEELINGS.
I AM NOT. SURE, YOU ARE.
I AM NOT! JUST FORGET IT.
WE'RE NOT COMPATIBLE.
I'M IN TOUCH WITH MY FEELINGS RIGHT NOW.
I WANT TO THROTTLE YOU.
"THROTTLE"? THERE'S AN IN-TOUCH- WITH-YOUR-FEELINGS WORD.
OH, NOW YOU'RE GOING TO RIDICULE MY VOCABULARY.
I JUST MEANT OPPOSITES ATTRACT, OKAY?
WE SOUND LIKE MY GRANDPARENTS.
THEY'VE BEEN MARRIED 56 YEARS...
STILL HAVING GREAT SEX, TOO.
( rustling )
( gasping )
MY WIFE, IS SHE DEAD?
NO.
SO WHERE ARE THEY TAKING HER?
TO SURGERY.
THEY'RE... TRYING TO SAVE HER.
CAN THEY?
I DON'T KNOW.
OH, WHAT HAVE I DONE?
Weaver: CAROL, WHAT'S GOING ON?
ARE YOU...
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
YEAH, WE'RE FINE.
WE NEED MARK, THOUGH.
CAN YOU... CAN YOU GET MARK?
YES, DR. GREENE, PLEASE.
SURE, I CAN DO THAT.
AND SECURITY
P.T.S.D.
YOU'VE GOT A BIG CUT ON YOUR LEG.
I RAN AWAY.
( whimpers )
OH...
GOD.
( sobbing )
( sobbing continues )
THOUGHT I'D FIND YOU UP HERE.
HOW'S SHE DOING?
SHE'S FINE. SEDATED.
I SPOKE TO ANSPAUGH.
I TOLD HIM I WAS QUITTING.
WHAT'D HE SAY?
WELL, HE WAS POLITE ENOUGH NOT TO BURST INTO SONG.
( chuckles )
DIDN'T TRY AND TALK ME OUT OF IT.
WELL, DID YOU EXPECT HIM TO?
NO.
UH... JULIAN IN GENETICS
STOOD UP FOR ME WITH THE COPS.
AND?
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO PROSECUTE.
THAT'S GREAT.
YEAH.
LONG NIGHT, HUH?
YEP.
YOU'RE NOT COMING WITH ME, ARE YOU?
ARE YOU REALLY LEAVING?
THERE'S NOTHING FOR ME HERE.
I'M HERE.
I MEANT WORK.
I CAN'T STAY HERE.
NOT EVEN FOR ME?
COME WITH ME.
I WANT YOU TO STAY HERE.
I CAN'T.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT.
I HAVE TO GO, CAROL.
I CAN'T STAY HERE.
DOUG...
( crying ): I DON'T WANT TO WAKE UP ALONE TOMORROW.
( crying )
I LOVE YOU.
( sobbing )
( sobbing continues )
Greene: WELL, THIS IS LIVING.
BROWN-BAGGING IT ON THE LAKE IN FEBRUARY.
Ross: IF THIS ISN'T THE COLDEST PLACE ON EARTH
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS.
IT WAS YOUR IDEA TO COME OUT HERE.
I'M JUST TRYING TO REMIND MYSELF
WHY I'M SO HAPPY GETTING THE HELL OUT OF HERE.
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BECOME A TRAIL BLAZERS FAN, ARE YOU?
MAYBE...
OR THE SONICS.
THAT'S JUST WRONG.
SEAHAWKS?
I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE.
DOESN'T IT RAIN, LIKE, 300 DAYS A YEAR OUT THERE?
SAVE ME A LOT OF MONEY WATERING MY LAWN.
YOU DON'T HAVE A LAWN.
WANT TO PLAY SOME HOOPS?
SURE.
COME ON.
YOU KNOW WHAT I AM GOING TO MISS?
WHAT?
WHIPPING YOUR ASS ON THE COURT.
( chuckling ): OH, RIGHT.
I DON'T THINK I EVER LOST A GAME.
IN YOUR DREAMS.
PLAY FOR A BUCK A POINT?
HELL, NO.
( chuckles )
WHAT ARE YOU, SCARED?
NO.
YOU CHEAT.
I DO NOT.
YOU DO CHEAT.
I DO NOT.
YOU'RE A CHEATER.
( chuckling )
( sighs )
