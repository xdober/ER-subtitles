THE GASTRIC BYPASS AT 3:30.
YEAH.
HAVE YOU SEEN MY EARRING?
NO.
YEAH, WELL, LOOK, WHY DON'T YOU TRY
AND GET HOLD OF HIM AND THEN CALL ME BACK? YEAH.
YOU ALREADY DRESSED?
MY SCHEDULE'S ALL JUMBLED UP.
I NEED TO GET IN.
BESIDES, ROMANO'S GOT ME BURIED IN PAPERWORK.
OH. THERE THEY ARE.
OH, COME ON.
( laughing )
YOU'RE GOING TO COVER ME IN SHAVING CREAM.
( phone ringing )
UH... HI. DID YOU GET HIM?
UH... Y-YES. UM, HELLO.
YES, UH, OH, HE'S, HE IS.
HE'S RIGHT HERE, ACTUALLY.
( whispers ): IT'S YOUR FATHER. SORRY.
HI, DAD.
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, CALM DOWN.
WHAT? W-WHAT HAPPENED?
W-WAS ANYONE HURT?
IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?
OH, WELL, THAT'S GOOD.
YEAH, UM, SO THIS WAS LAST NIGHT?
MM-HMM.
WANT ME TO STAY?
I'LL CATCH YOU LATER.
UH, DAD, D-D-DAD.
OKAY. FINE.
LOOK, I-IT'S JUST A FENDER.
OKAY, A FENDER AND A CYPRESS TREE.
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT. UM...
JUST CORN FLAKES AND A SMALL ORANGE JUICE, PLEASE.
THAT'S IT?
THERE'S JUST NO MORE ROOM LEFT FOR FOOD.
I'M EATING LIKE A HORSE.
WELL, TWINS. THEY'RE SQUISHING MY STOMACH.
I JUST HAVE ONE.
IT'S SQUISHING MORE THAN THAT.
MEG, I CAN'T READ THIS.
WHAT'S THIS SAY?
TWO OVER MEDIUM.
LARGE COFFEE TO GO, PLEASE.
HEY, MORNING, CAROL.
HI.
WHAT?
I THINK YOU HAVE
SHAVING CREAM ON YOUR EARLOBE.
OH.
THANK YOU.
HOW IS MARK?
CLEAN-SHAVEN.
( dishes crashing )
THAT'S TWICE IN ONE MORNING.
I'M SORRY.
HOW ARE YOU MANAGING WITHOUT COFFEE?
OH, YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT SO BAD.
IT'S ACTUALLY THE, UH...
GROWING OUT OF MY MATERNITY WEAR
THAT'S STARTING TO WORRY ME.
NOT TO WORRY. YOU'LL DROP A COUPLE OF THOSE POUNDS
BREAST-FEEDING.
THANKS.
LATER. BYE-BYE.
HERE.
OH, THANK YOU.
NOT EASY MANEUVERING, IS IT?
NO.
DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE HAVING?
NO.
NOTHING ON THE ULTRASOUND?
I-I HAVEN'T HAD ONE.
OH, YOU REALLY SHOULD.
IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE BABY.
WHO'S YOUR O.B.?
I GOT TO PICK UP AN ORDER.
YOU DO HAVE AN O.B.?
MY BOSS IS GOING TO YELL AT ME AGAIN.
CAN I BORROW YOUR PENCIL?
AND YOUR PAD?
I'M A NURSE AT COUNTY.
I'M GOING TO WRITE DOWN MY NAME.
YOU SHOULD COME BY AFTER YOUR SHIFT.
WE'LL EXAMINE YOU AND CHECK OUT THE BABY.
I-I DON'T KNOW. I-I DON'T HAVE INSURANCE OR ANYTHING.
IT'S OKAY. WHERE I WORK, YOU DON'T NEED IT.
MORNING.
HEY, THE CELEBRITY HERSELF.
BEG YOUR PARDON?
DR. CORDAY, RIGHT?
YEAH, WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
"PRESCRIPTION FOR DANGER:
ARE YOU SAFE AT COUNTY GENERAL?"
GOOD PICTURE.
OH, MY GOD.
GET THAT THING AWAY FROM ME!
LEAVE ME ALONE! LET GO!
ROBIN, SETTLE DOWN.
THIS ISN'T SO BAD, IS IT?
I HATE YOU.
ROBIN. YOSH.
DO YOU LIKE KOALA BEARS, ROBIN?
WHY?
BECAUSE I HAVE A SPECIAL BEAR THAT WANTS TO MEET YOU--
MR. KOALA BEAR.
I HATE BEARS!
ROBIN, STOP IT.
( boy crying )
MAYBE YOU COULD HOLD HER.
I'LL TAKE YOU TO THE TOY STORE.
NO!
WHEN DID SHE START VOMITING?
THIS MORNING, RIGHT AFTER SHE DRANK HER JUICE.
MOMMY, MAKE THEM STOP.
WE HAD CHINESE TAKEOUT LAST NIGHT.
MY HUSBAND HAS AN UPSET STOMACH, TOO.
I HATE YOU!
ANY DIARRHEA?
A LITTLE.
CHILDHOOD ILLNESSES?
JUST A FEW COLDS.
AND PRESCRIPTION MEDICINES?
YOU KEEP THOSE OUT OF REACH?
YES. OUR HOME IS CHILDPROOF.
OKAY, OKAY. SHE PROBABLY HAS
JUST A LITTLE FOOD POISONING.
I'LL GIVE HER SOME COMPAZINE
FOR THE NAUSEA AND...
I'M SORRY.
AND OBSERVE HER FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS. OKAY?
HONEY, DID YOU HEAR THAT?
YOU'RE GOING TO STAY HERE
SO THEY CAN TAKE CARE OF YOU.
I HATE IT HERE!
WAIT. OKAY.
YOU WERE LOOKING FOR ME?
YO, DR. PETE, I DEFINITELY WAS.
I'VE GOT ONE SERIOUSLY HOT APPY HERE FOR YOU.
A HOT APPY?
READY TO BE SLICED AND DICED.
WHY DON'T YOU CALL FOR A SURGICAL CONSULT?
I THOUGHT YOU'D WANT HIM.
HE CAN'T DO GENERAL SURGERY.
I DON'T DO GENERAL SURGERY.
I TOLD YOU. THANK YOU, CONNIE.
I DON'T BLAME YOU.
HERNIAS, APPYS, GALLBLADDERS-- IT'S BORING.
YOU'RE LIKE ME-- YOU LIKE THE GUTS
THE GLORY, THE BRIGHT LIGHTS, THE BIG CITY.
WE'RE CUT FROM THE SAME CLOTH...
DO YOU KNOW WHAT IT MEANS TO BE SKATING ON THIN ICE?
OKAY, THIS IS ME BACKING OFF.
Lawrence: OKAY, THAT'S GOOD.
STAY UP THERE AS LONG AS YOU CAN.
YOU'RE DOING GREAT.
KERRY, HI.
MORNING, GABE.
HOW MUCH LONGER?
UH, THE EXPULSION OF FLATUS
MARCHES TO ITS OWN DRUMMER, MR. RINEBERRY.
AND THE MORE I FART, THE BETTER I'LL FEEL?
YEAH, WELL
TO PUT IT SOMEWHAT INDELICATELY, YEAH.
I... I'LL BE BACK.
STAY WITH IT.
KEEP YOUR EYE ON HIM, OKAY?
I WAS JUST GOING TO GRAB A CUP OF COFFEE.
GREAT. I'LL JOIN YOU.
SO YOU'RE STARTING OFF YOUR DAY
WITH A LITTLE SPLENIC FLEXURE SYNDROME, EH?
THE GUY DIDN'T WANT TO STAND ON HIS HEAD
UNTIL I REMINDED HIM-- GAS RISES.
IT SEEMS LIKE YOU'RE SETTLING IN WELL, HUH?
OH, YEAH, EVERYBODY'S BEEN TERRIFIC TO ME.
MARK GREENE IS STILL PISSING ON TREES...
DO YOU WANT ME TO SAY SOMETHING TO HIM?
NO, NO. I THINK...
DR. LAWRENCE?
YEAH, LILY.
UH, IT'S LUCY.
LUCY. SORRY.
DID YOU WANT TO ORDER THE AMOXICILLIN
FOR THE CELLULITIS IN FOUR?
CELLULITIS IN FOUR, YEAH. ABSOLUTELY.
YOU JUST DIDN'T SIGN.
OH. EASILY FIXED.
THERE YOU GO. THANKS.
SURE.
IS IT JUST ME, OR ARE MEDICAL STUDENTS
YOUNGER THAN THEY USED TO BE?
IT'S DEFINITELY THE STUDENTS.
I HAVEN'T FELT THIS OLD SINCE
YOUR CLASS GRADUATED FROM MED SCHOOL.
MY CLASS?
YEAH. I REMEMBER YOUR MOM CAME UP TO ME
AND SHE WAS THANKING ME FOR INSPIRING YOU
TO GO INTO EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AND THE WHOLE TIME SHE'S TALKING TO ME
ALL I CAN THINK IS
MY GOD, WE'RE PRACTICALLY THE SAME AGE.
OH, NO. SHE HAD A YEAR OR TWO ON YOU ANYWAY.
HOW IS SHE? HOW'S SHE DOING?
SHE PASSED AWAY A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO.
OH, I'M SORRY. THAT'S ROUGH.
YEAH, IT IS.
HOW IS YOUR FAMILY DOING?
OH, ALL MY EX-WIVES ARE ALIVE AND LIVING WELL.
AND YOUR SON WAS GOING INTO MEDICINE
TOO, WASN'T HE?
WELL, THAT WAS MY DREAM, NOT HIS, AS HE WOULD SAY.
OF COURSE HE DOESN'T SAY MUCH OF ANYTHING TO ME ANY MORE.
Girl: GET AWAY FROM ME!
GET AWAY FROM ME!
GET AWAY FROM ME!
GET AWAY FROM ME!
GET AWAY FROM ME!
GET AWAY FROM ME!
SORRY, EXCUSE US.
GET AWAY FROM ME!
THINK I'LL HAVE A LITTLE MORE CREAM.
I CERTAINLY NEVER MEANT TO CONVEY ANY DEFICIENCY AT COUNTY.
I COULD HARDLY ANTICIPATE A SHOOT-OUT.
NOT EVERYTHING IN THE ACCOUNT WAS NEGATIVE.
YOU'RE RIGHT. I PARTICULARLY ENJOYED THE DESCRIPTION
OF DR. CARTER CLAMPING OFF
HIS FIRST AORTIC RUPTURE ON A EIGHT-YEAR-OLD.
WHICH, AS THE ACCOUNT CLEARLY STATES, WAS SUCCESSFUL.
DO YOU REMEMBER, LIZZIE, THE POINT OF THIS ARTICLE?
TO TOOT COUNTY'S HORN.
ACTUALLY, IT WAS TO TOOT MY HORN
WHICH IS WHY YOU UNDERSTAND THAT I AM DISTURBED
AT NOT ONLY GETTING HEAT ON THIS FROM UPSTAIRS
BUT AT FINDING MY PICTURE IN A SIDEBAR
NEXT TO THE OBITUARIES.
I'D GLADLY GIVE UP THE FRONT PAGE.
LIZZIE, WHEN I APPOINTED YOU ASSOCIATE CHIEF
IT WAS FOR TWO REASONS.
ONE: TO SERVE, TWO: TO PROTECT-- MY NEEDS, MY INTERESTS
BUT I HAVE SENSED SOME RELUCTANCE.
TO WHAT?
CORRALLING BENTON FOR ONE.
WE'VE SETTLED THAT.
OH? HAVE WE?
SO I HAVEN'T MADE A MISTAKE IN APPOINTING YOU?
NO, ROBERT, YOU HAVEN'T MADE A MISTAKE.
GOOD. OH, BY THE WAY
THERE'S BEEN SOME SLOPOVER
FROM THE ANSPAUGH ADMINISTRATION.
IT SEEMS DONALD IS STILL SCHEDULING HIS OWN SURGERY.
SPEAK TO HIM ABOUT THAT, WOULD YOU?
YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS.
IT'S INTERFERING WITH MY SCHEDULE.
I AM COMPLETELY SERIOUS.
DR. CORDAY.
CARTER.
IS ELAINE NICHOLS' PATH REPORT BACK YET?
YOU'LL NEED TO SPEAK TO HER ABOUT THAT.
RIGHT. I WILL WHEN SHE COMES IN
TO HAVE HER SUTURES OUT
WHICH, GENERALLY, IS ABOUT A WEEK AFTER THE OPERATION?
GENERALLY.
AND THAT COULD BE SOME TIME TODAY
THIS MORNING EVEN.
CARTER...
OR PERHAPS THIS AFTERNOON?
CARTER...
YES?
THERE'S SOME CHANCE IT'LL BE THIS AFTERNOON
SAY AROUND 3:00.
THANK YOU.
BY THE WAY, LOVED THE ARTICLE.
TOMMY STEVENS-- ATTEMPTED SUICIDE BY HANGING.
MAN, THAT MAKES ONE NASTY ROPE BURN, HUH?
WHAT?
FINISH UP, DUMAR. VITAL SIGNS?
B.P. 80 PALP, PULSE THREADY, SHALLOW RESPS.
I DIDN'T WANT TO INTUBATE IN THE FIELD
IN CASE HE BROKE HIS NECK.
OKAY, EVERYBODY, NICE AND EASY ON MY COUNT.
ONE, TWO, THREE.
HE'S GETTING DUSKY.
WE NEED TO TUBE HIM.
IT'S A TRICKY INTUBATION.
TRICKY'S MY MIDDLE NAME.
AND POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS.
LIKE I SAID, DANGER'S MY MIDDLE NAME.
PULSE OX DOWN TO 84. LET'S GET IN THERE.
I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU IN-LINE STABILIZATION.
WHATEVER YOU DO, DO NOT EXTEND THE NECK.
I'M AS GENTLE... AS A KITTEN, SIR.
B.P. IS STILL 80.
ALL RIGHT, RUN ANOTHER LITER OF SALINE.
TOO MUCH EDEMA-- I CAN'T SEE THE CORDS.
WE NEED TO CRIKE HIM.
WHOA, HOLD ON. LET'S BAG HIM
GET HIS SATS UP.
WE NEED A FIBER OPTIC LARYNGOSCOPE.
I'LL GET IT.
FIBER OPTICS, THAT IS COOL.
HAVE YOU EVER DONE ONE?
I'VE CERTAINLY SEEN THEM.
SO THAT'S A NO, HUH?
BUT YOU, DR. GREENE, COULD CHANGE ALL THAT.
I'LL GIVE YOU ONE SHOT, THEN IT'S MINE.
YES.
IT DOESN'T LOOK TOO BAD.
IT'S NOT VERY DEEP.
PROBABLY JUST NEED A COUPLE OF STITCHES.
DID THE PARAMEDICS BRING YOU IN?
WOULD YOU GET US SOME MORE FOUR-BY-FOURS?
WE'RE RUNNING A LITTLE LOW HERE, OKAY?
SO... YOUR PARENTS WEREN'T WITH YOU
WHEN THIS HAPPENED, HUH?
NO.
THIS IS LIABLE TO STING A LITTLE, BECKY, OKAY?
HOW DID IT HAPPEN?
HE WASN'T OUTSIDE.
WHO-WHO WASN'T OUTSIDE?
TOMMY, MY BOYFRIEND.
DID HE DO THIS?
DID HE CUT YOU?
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THEY HAD A BASEMENT.
I SAW A LIGHTBULB HANGING DOWN THERE
AND THERE HE WAS, RIGHT NEXT TO IT.
TOMMY WAS IN THE BASEMENT?
HE TIED THE ROPE AROUND A PIPE
SO I RAN BACK UP TO THE KITCHEN
AND GOT A KNIFE...
AND YOU USED THE KNIFE TO CUT THE ROPE.
HE JUST FELL DOWN.
I COULDN'T HOLD HIM OR ANYTHING.
( crying ): THAT'S WHEN THE KNIFE SLIPPED.
AND YOU CUT YOURSELF, HUH?
IS HE GOING TO BE OKAY?
DID THE PARAMEDICS BRING HIM IN?
THEY WOULDN'T LET ME COME WITH HIM.
I CAME IN A DIFFERENT AMBULANCE.
IF YOU WAIT HERE, I'LL GO SEE WHAT I CAN FIND OUT, OKAY?
OKAY.
Greene: TELL ME WHEN YOU'RE AT THE CORDS.
WE ARE ABOUT TO MAKE CONTACT.
I'M THERE.
OKAY, ADVANCE INTO THE TRACHEA
AND SLIDE DOWN THE TUBE.
YEP. THE EAGLE HAS LANDED.
LET'S BAG HIM.
LET'S GET X RAY DOWN HERE.
NEED A PORTABLE CHEST AND A C-SPINE.
GOOD BREATH SOUNDS ON BOTH SIDES. NICE WORK.
THANKS, BOSS.
PULSE OX UP TO 91.
IS THIS THE SUICIDE, TOMMY?
YEP. HOW'S HE DOING?
GREAT. THE NECK WAS SWOLLEN UP LIKE A BLIMP
COULDN'T EVEN SEE THE CORDS.
DR. GREENE LET ME DO A FIBER OPTIC
AND I PASSED THAT BABY THROUGH
LIKE I WAS THREADING A NEEDLE.
HOW'S HE DOING?
HE'S PINKING UP.
BUT WITH THE PROLONGED OXYGEN DEPRIVATION
I'M NOT SURE ABOUT HIS NEURO STATUS.
COME ON, HE WAS TOO BLUE FOR TOO LONG.
WE MIGHT BE LOOKING AT VEGGIE BURGER.
DR. GREENE...
OH, GOD.
TOMMY...
HALEH! TOMMY! TOMMY!
Lawrence: LET'S GET YOU OUTSIDE.
TOMMY, IS HE ALL RIGHT?
HELP HER OUTSIDE.
Becky: WHAT DOES HE MEAN?!
YOU A RESIDENT?
YEAH.
ONE THING YOU STILL NEED TO LEARN
IS THAT EVERY PATIENT IN HERE IS SOMEBODY'S BOYFRIEND
GIRLFRIEND, FATHER, MOTHER, SON.
THEY DON'T EXIST SIMPLY FOR YOU TO LEARN
NEW AND INTERESTING PROCEDURES.
WELL, I DIDN'T SEE HER STANDING THERE.
WELL, NEXT TIME, OPEN YOUR EYES BEFORE YOU OPEN YOUR MOUTH!
WHAT'S WITH THE NEW GUY?
OH, WHICH NEW GUY WOULD THAT BE, MALUCCI?
DR. LAWRENCE OR YOU?
HE NEVER SAID ANYTHING ABOUT KILLING HIMSELF.
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT, BECKY.
YOU SHOULD BE THANKFUL YOU FOUND HIM.
HE'S GOT A GOOD CHANCE.
I ALMOST DIDN'T GO BACK INSIDE.
I WAS GOING TO BE LATE FOR SCHOOL, BUT...
I DON'T KNOW, I JUST DID.
WERE HIS PARENTS THERE?
NO, AT WORK.
HIS DAD-- HIS MOM LIVES IN FLORIDA.
YOU KNOW WHERE... WHERE HIS FATHER WORKS?
SOME KIND OF CONSTRUCTION?
I DON'T REALLY KNOW HIM.
HE'S NOT AROUND MUCH.
Robin: ARE YOU SICK?
YOU DON'T LOOK GOOD.
SHE'S JUST A LITTLE TIRED.
WHO DO YOU BELONG TO?
HERE, I'LL MAKE YOU BETTER.
SAY "AH."
THANK YOU, BUT THIS PATIENT ALREADY HAS A DOCTOR.
( screaming ): LET GO OF ME!
WHOA, ALL RIGHT...
LET GO OF ME! ROBIN!
( shrieking )
ONE SECOND, ONE SECOND...
LOOK, WAIT, YOUR MOMMY IS RIGHT OVER HERE.
OKAY, COME ON.
NO, LET ME GO!
I'M SO SORRY, DR. LAWRENCE.
THAT'S QUITE ALL RIGHT.
I HAVE THAT EFFECT ON WOMEN.
I WANT MY MOMMY...!
MAY I HAVE MY STETHOSCOPE BACK, PLEASE?
WHEN?
20 MINUTES AGO.
HE STARTED TRIGGERING THE VENT ON HIS OWN.
TOMMY?
MY NAME'S DR. GREENE.
YOU'RE IN THE HOSPITAL.
YOUR GIRLFRIEND FOUND YOU
AND CUT YOU DOWN
AND THE PARAMEDICS BROUGHT YOU IN.
WHAT'S HIS pO2?
98% ON AN FI-O2 OF 21.
TOMMY, WE HAVE THIS TUBE DOWN YOUR THROAT
TO HELP YOU BREATHE
BUT WE CAN TAKE IT OUT NOW, OKAY?
YOU EXTUBATING HIM?
YEP, HE'S GOT GOOD TIDAL VOLUME.
YOU GAVE US A SCARE THERE, TOMMY.
I GOT IT, THANKS.
SO, TOMMY, WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO
IS TAKE A DEEP BREATH
AND THEN BLOW OUT AS HARD AS YOU CAN
WHEN I PULL OUT THE TUBE.
OKAY?
ALL RIGHT, TAKE A DEEP BREATH.
ALL THE WAY IN-- GOOD, GOOD, GOOD.
AND, BLOW.
( coughing )
GOOD JOB.
OKAY, IT'S GOING TO BE A LITTLE TENDER.
WHERE...
DON'T TRY AND SPEAK RIGHT AWAY.
WHERE'S BECKY?
BECKY'S HERE. SHE'S FINE.
SHE'S WORRIED ABOUT YOU, OF COURSE.
SHE TOLD ME YOUR MOM'S IN FLORIDA
SO I GUESS WE'LL CALL YOUR DAD.
YOU KNOW HIS NUMBER AT WORK?
I COULD TALK TO HIM FOR YOU IF YOU WANT.
PAGER NUMBER?
HERE.
WHY DON'T YOU WRITE IT?
OKAY? HERE.
OKAY, OKAY, ALL RIGHT.
WHEN YOU'RE READY.
DR. LAWRENCE, DO YOU HAVE A SECOND?
YEAH, SURE.
TOMMY, I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
GETTING HIS FATHER IN HERE.
YEAH, WE'RE WORKING ON IT.
CHICAGO P.D.'s WORKING ON IT.
DON'T PIMP THE KID.
HE JUST ATTEMPTED SUICIDE.
CALLING A PSYCH CONSULT?
YES.
GOOD.
DO YOU THINK I SHOULD FIND OUT THE SEX?
WELL, EVERYONE'S DIFFERENT.
SOME PEOPLE LIKE TO KNOW
SOME PEOPLE DON'T.
WHAT ARE YOU HAVING?
I DON'T KNOW.
OH, COME ON, YOU KNOW.
YOU'RE A NURSE.
SO?
SEEMS LIKE YOU'D KNOW, THAT'S ALL.
WELL, I FIGURE
THERE ARE FEW REALLY TRUE SURPRISES IN LIFE.
THIS IS FOR YOUR SCRAPBOOK.
THANKS.
EVERYTHING OKAY?
FINE.
LITTLE SMALL FOR 32 WEEKS.
WE'LL PUT YOU ON SOME PRENATAL VITAMINS.
IT'S NOT TOO LATE FOR THAT?
MEG, ARE YOU SMOKING?
NO.
I MEAN...
NOT A LOT.
YOU KNOW, IT'S REALLY BAD FOR THE BABY.
IT CAN CAUSE PREMATURITY
LOW BIRTH WEIGHT.
I KNOW, I KNOW, I KNOW, I'M JUST...
I'M JUST REALLY STRESSED.
YOU KNOW, I LOST THAT STUPID JOB.
AT DOC MAGOO'S?
I DIDN'T MOVE FAST ENOUGH.
EXCUSE ME, YOU KNOW, I'M SEVEN MONTHS PREGNANT.
WELL, YOU KNOW, I COULD CALL A SOCIAL WORKER...
SEE IF THEY COULD GET YOU SOME AID.
HOW ABOUT HERE?
DO THEY NEED PEOPLE HERE?
MAYBE THE CAFETERIA?
I DON'T KNOW, I...
I COULD CHECK, I GUESS.
THAT'D BE GREAT.
THANKS.
IF YOU PROMISE TO STOP SMOKING.
DEAL.
WELL, DAD, JUST HAVE THE INSURANCE GUY CALL ME HERE.
HEY, MARK.
MARK, WE'VE GOT A DOUBLE TRAUMA COMING IN.
CAN YOU TAKE IT?
ROMANO'S CALLED THIS EMERGENCY MEETING FOR SPIN CONTROL.
DAD, IF YOU WANT TO HANDLE IT
WHY'D YOU CALL ME?
Robin: YOU CAN'T CATCH ME! WHERE'S BENTON?
YOU CAN'T CATCH ME! HE TOOK UP SOME M.V.A.
YOU CAN'T CATCH ME! OKAY, PAGE CORDAY.
HEY!
NO RUNNING. YOU CAN'T CATCH ME!
YOU CAN'T CATCH ME! HEY, NO RUNNING-- STOP!
AND THAT STUFF IS EXPENSIVE.
I DON'T CARE-- MY DAD IS RICH.
I'M GOING TO CALL SECURITY.
BRAT.
DAD, I'M GOING TO CALL YOU BACK.
WHAT'S UP?
OH, MY DAD-- HE GOT HIS INSURANCE CANCELED.
DON'T ASK.
SO, CAN YOU TAKE IT?
BECAUSE ALL THE DEPARTMENT HEADS HAVE TO GO
TO THIS PUBLIC RELATIONS MEETING.
THIS NEWSPAPER THING IS A DISASTER.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELIZABETH WAS DOING.
WHAT NEWSPAPER THING?
HAS ANYBODY SEEN LAWRENCE?
I'VE GOT THE NEIGHBOR OF THE SUICIDE KID.
SAYS HE'S GOT THE DAD'S NUMBER.
CALLING LAWRENCE?
THAT'S WHAT HE SAID.
I'LL TAKE IT.

I DON'T THINK SO-- WE'VE GOT GOOD ACCESS.
ART LINE?
HOW ABOUT A THORACOTOMY WHILE YOU'RE AT IT?
REALLY?
DAVE.
OH.
CHEST IS CLEAR.
HE'S GOING TO NEED A TETANUS

LIKE THIS?
YEAH, PERFECT, GOOD.
NOW, I APPLY ANTERIOR PRESSURE

BUT I WAS GOING TO HELP THESE GUYS.
I THINK WE'VE GOT IT COVERED, DAVE.
LISTEN, I WANT A NEURO CHECK EVERY FIVE MINUTES

I'M GLAD OUR SCHEDULES SYNCHED UP, PETER.
IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME
SINCE WE OPERATED TOGETHER.
YEAH.
ALL RIGHT
THERE ARE NO ADHESIONS TO THE ANTERIOR WALL.
WELL, THERE'S ANOTHER DEFECT.
WE BETTER DO A GORTEX REPAIR.
OKAY, METZ.
HEY, ELIZABETH.
INTERESTING ARTICLE IN THE PAPER THIS MORNING.
EXCUSE ME, DONALD.
PETER, WOULD YOU PLEASE STEP OUT?
I'M IN THE MIDDLE OF OPERATING HERE.
I'M SURE DR. ANSPAUGH CAN HANDLE IT.
PLEASE STEP OUT.
WHAT IS GOING ON?
PETER'S A TRAUMA FELLOW.
HE SHOULD BE DOWN IN THE E.R.
NOT UP HERE COVERING ELECTIVE HERNIAS.
RIGHT, BUT THIS PATIENT NEEDED SURGERY.
AND I WAS CALLED DOWN TO COVER YOUR MULTI-VICTIM TRAUMA.
I WAS DOWN THERE ALL MORNING.
AS YOU SHOULD BE.
NOW FOR THE THIRD TIME, PLEASE STEP OUT.
( sighing )
DR. ANSPAUGH
WOULD YOU, UH, TAKE OVER, PLEASE?
HEY, I SAW YOU TOUCH THAT.
BARELY.
CAN'T YOU MAKE UP YOUR MIND?
NOTHING LOOKS GOOD.
HOW ABOUT A GRILLED CHEESE SANDWICH?
LOOKS LESS THAN A DAY OLD.
MARK, PLEASE.
HERE-- THIS. IT'S ON ME.
I'M NOT GOING TO EAT THAT.
YOU'VE GOT TO EAT SOMETHING.
I HAVE A MOTHER, THANK YOU.
SHE CALLS EVERY SUNDAY FOR WEEKLY WEIGH-INS.
AW, THAT'S NOTHING.
MY DAD CALLED FOUR TIMES THIS MORNING
OBSESSING ABOUT THIS CYPRESS TREE
THAT HE CRASHED INTO LAST NIGHT.
IS HE OKAY?
YEAH. HIS PRIDE'S A LITTLE WOUNDED.
FRONT FENDER'S EXTREMELY WOUNDED
AND APPARENTLY, THE NEIGHBORS'
100-YEAR-OLD CYPRESS TREE
IS CIRCLING THE DRAIN.
HERE, HOW ABOUT SOME JELL-O?
NO.
EVERYBODY HAS ROOM FOR JELL-O.
NO.
GOT YOUR EMPLOYEE DISCOUNT CARD?
OH, YEAH.
AND I NEED TO SPEAK TO THE MANAGER.
IS SOMEONE AROUND?
VIOLA SIMPSON ACTING LIKE SHE BE THE BIG BOSS.
RIGHT OVER THERE.
GREAT. THANK YOU.
I SAW YOU EATING THAT CARROT.
GOT TO PAY FOR IT.
OKAY.
( pounding on pipe )
Dr. Finch: SHE'S KEPT DOWN THE JUICE I GAVE HER.
SHE DOESN'T HAVE ANY ABDOMINAL PAIN
SO SHE'LL BE FINE AT HOME.
JUST GIVE HER SOME FLUIDS
AND COME BACK FOR VOMITING OR FEVER.
THANK YOU, DR. FINCH.
AND YOU, TOO, YOSH.
YOU'RE WELCOME.
SHE'S BEEN A COMPLETELY FASCINATING PATIENT.
( pounding continues )
ROBIN... ROBIN... WE'RE GOING HOME.
YOU WANT TO THANK THE NICE DOCTOR AND NURSE?
NO!
OKAY. ALL RIGHT, THEN. HOLD MY HAND.
I DON'T WANT TO HOLD YOUR HAND! THANKS AGAIN.
WAIT, ROBIN!
NO, NO, NO, DON'T GO OUTSIDE!
OKAY, MR. RAYBUSH, HERE WE ARE, BACK SAFE AND SOUND.
HOW WAS THE C.T.?
UH, LIKE SOMEONE SCRAMBLED HIS BRAIN WITH AN EGGBEATER.
IS IT A SUBDURAL?
WANT TO TAKE A LOOK?
Malucci: MOSTLY DIFFUSE SWELLING, MICROHEMORRHAGES.
NOTHING WE COULD FIX.
DR. GREENE, HAVE YOU SEEN DR. LAWRENCE?
I THINK HE'S IN THE LOUNGE.
ALL RIGHT, HYPERVENTILATE HIM.
CALL NEUROSURGERY, GET AN I.C.P. MONITOR.
THEN I'LL CHECK THE BOARD, SEE WHAT ELSE IS IN.
NO, YOU TRACK DOWN HIS FAMILY.
HE'S WEARING A WEDDING RING, MUST HAVE A WIFE.
HMM. SHOULDN'T A NURSE DO THAT?
ONLY IF YOU FAIL.
( sighs )
ELAINE?
JOHN.
HOW ARE YOU FEELING?
LIGHTER.
( nervous laugh )
SORRY, THAT WAS A STUPID JOKE.
MAY I SIT DOWN?
YEAH.
I TRIED CALLING YOU.
DR. CORDAY SAID THE TESTS ARE CLEAR.
MY CANCER HASN'T SPREAD.
THAT'S... THAT'S GREAT NEWS.
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT EVERYBODY SAYS.
BUT YOU DON'T FEEL THAT WAY.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I FEEL.
WELL, I THINK THAT'S...
PROBABLY NORMAL.
I THINK MOST PEOPLE PROBABLY...
JOHN...
SORRY.
I'LL SPARE YOU THE PLATITUDES.
YOU WAITING FOR DR. CORDAY?
YEAH, I'M, UH... EARLY.
( nervous laugh )
WELL, MAYBE WE CAN GET TOGETHER LATER.
GO FOR A WALK AND GET A DRINK
OR TALK.
TALK.
ABOUT ANYTHING
OTHER THAN YOUR SURGERY
AND MY MISERABLE LIFE AS AN E.R. RESIDENT.
AND WHAT WOULD THAT LEAVE?
SPORTS.
( laughing )
OR MUSIC OR ART OR...
THE Y2K THING.
OH, YEAH, THE Y2K THING.
YEAH, I'M GRASPING AT STRAWS HERE.
YEAH, I...
SEE THAT.
BUT I'M NOT GIVING UP.
WELL...
I GUESS I'M...
PROBABLY FREE AT 7:00.
MRS. RAYBUSH, THE PARACHUTE ACCIDENT WAS EXTREMELY SERIOUS
AND HE'S... HE'S IN A COMA.
WELL, I THINK YOU NEED TO GET HERE AS SOON AS YOU CAN.
YOU'RE IN DALLAS.
DALLAS. RIGHT.
UM, OF COURSE, A THREE-HOUR FLIGHT.
I NEED TO BE HONEST WITH YOU.
THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE
HE WON'T BE ABLE TO HOLD OUT THAT LONG.
I'M VERY SORRY.
EXCUSE ME?
YOU WANT TO DICTATE A MESSAGE
AND HAVE IT READ TO HIM?
UM... I DON'T THINK THAT... THAT'S...
DO IT.
OF COURSE I COULD DO THAT, MRS. RAYBUSH.
YEAH, I HAVE A PEN.
DOC GREENE, IT'S YOUR DAD.
HEY, DAD, WHAT IS IT?
OKAY, GO AHEAD.
HE WANTS A REPLACEMENT CYPRESS.
WELL, THAT SEEMS REASONABLE.
HOW MUCH?
WELL, I KNOW IT'S A 100-YEAR-OLD TREE, BUT...
CONNIE, WHO'S THAT TALKING TO DR. LAWRENCE?
HE'S THE FATHER OF THE KID-- TOMMY STEVENS.
LISTEN, DAD, I GOT TO GO.
DON'T WORRY, WE'LL WORK SOMETHING OUT.
NO, I'LL CALL YOU LATER.
YEAH... DON'T... I WILL.
I'LL CALL YOU LATER. BYE.
Lawrence: THAT'S A HELL OF A LOUSY EXCUSE.
Father: I HAD TO TAKE ON EXTRA PROJECTS.
WE NEED THE MONEY.
WHAT, MORE THAN YOU NEED YOUR SON? NO.
HI, I'M DR. MARK GREENE. CAN I BE OF SOME HELP?
YEAH, YOU CAN GET THIS GUY OUT OF MY FACE.
HASN'T EVEN LET ME SEE MY SON YET.
TOMMY IS IN A VERY FRAGILE STATE
RIGHT NOW, MR. STEVENS.
I'M NOT SURE IT'S GOOD FOR HIM TO SEE YOU...
WHAT THE HELL? I AM HIS FATHER.
WHAT, LIKE, FOR AN HOUR A DAY?
OKAY, DR. LAWRENCE, DR. LAWRENCE-- JUST A MINUTE.
MR. STEVENS, YES, AS A FATHER
YOU DO HAVE A RIGHT TO SEE YOUR SON.
HALEH, CAN YOU TAKE MR. STEVENS
DOWN TO CURTAIN AREA THREE?
THIS WAY, SIR.
WHAT WAS THAT ALL ABOUT?
HE EXPECTS TO WALTZ RIGHT IN THERE.
HE'S THE FATHER.
SOMEBODY OUGHT TO GIVE HIM A TALKING-TO.
THAT'S NOT YOUR JOB.
THE HELL IT ISN'T, MAN.
YOU DON'T KNOW THE DETAILS.
YEAH, I KNOW ENOUGH.
Meg: AND WHAT DID YOU SAY HER NAME WAS?
VIOLA SIMPSON-- SHE SAID SHE WAS GLAD YOU HAD FOOD EXPERIENCE.
AND WAS SHE GLAD TO HEAR I WAS PREGNANT?
WELL, GLAD'S AN OVERSTATEMENT
BUT SHE DIDN'T SEEM TO CARE.
YOUR APPOINTMENT'S AT 5:30.
OH, WELL, THAT GIVES ME PLENTY OF TIME.
I CAN PICK UP THE REST OF MY STUFF AT MAGOO'S
AND STILL GET HOME AND... AND CHANGE.
THANKS, MRS. HATHAWAY.
OH, IT'S CAROL, AND YOU'RE WELCOME.
LET ME KNOW HOW IT GOES.
OKAY.
AND STAY OFF THOSE CIGARETTES.
SCOUT'S HONOR.
NO, NO, NOT A RETRACTION, REALLY
JUST SIMPLY THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STORY.
YEAH.
WELL, THINK ABOUT IT.
ELIZABETH, YOU WANTED TO TALK?
PLEASE.
YES, THANK YOU.
IF IT'S NOT A BAD TIME.
NO, NOT IF YOU DON'T MIND MY SCRUBBING.
NOT AT ALL.
HAS THIS MIRROR ALWAYS BEEN THERE?
I BELIEVE IT IS A RECENT ROCKET ADDITION.
WHATEVER FOR?
ONE CAN ONLY IMAGINE.
GOD, I HATE THESE CAPS.
I LOOK LIKE A YORKSHIRE PUDDING.
ELIZABETH?
YES, UM...
I DID NEED TO TALK TO YOU, DONALD.
I'M SORRY TO EVEN HAVE TO MENTION IT.
DON'T APOLOGIZE.
SOMEONE HAS TO DO THE DEVIL'S WORK.
WELL, I'M RELIEVED YOU SEE IT THAT WAY.
AND IT IS NOT EASY MANAGING COLLEAGUES.
YEAH, I'M BEGINNING TO REALIZE THAT.
WHEN I WAS DOING MY ROTTEN JOB
MUCH OF WHICH YOU'VE RECENTLY TAKEN ON
I ALWAYS TRIED TO GET TO THE CORE OF THE ISSUE.
RIGHT.
ASK YOURSELF THIS:
DO YOU BELIEVE PETER BENTON IS A GOOD SURGEON?
PETER BENTON?
MM-HMM.
YES, OF COURSE.
HE'S AN EXCELLENT SURGEON.
AH, EVEN BETTER.
NOW ASK YOURSELF THIS:
SHOULD COUNTY HAVE EXCELLENT SURGEONS WORKING ON ITS STAFF?
ABSOLUTELY.
THEN DON'T YOU THINK WE SHOULD ALL WANT PETER
TO PRACTICE SURGERY WHENEVER HE CAN?
YES.
I-I DO, ACTUALLY, UM...
I DON'T AGREE WITH DR. ROMANO.
YOU KNOW, ONE THING TO KEEP IN MIND
IN YOUR NEW POSITION...
IF YOU DON'T AGREE WITH THE DIRTY WORK...
DON'T DO IT.
HEY, MALOOCH
I'VE GOT A GNARLY SPLIT KNEECAP IN EXAM TWO
IF YOU'RE INTERESTED.
AH, YOU'RE TEASING ME.
NO, IT'S A DISGUSTING MESS, YOUR KIND OF CASE.
I'M SORRY, BUT I GOT A LITTLE READING TO CATCH UP ON.
SURE, YOU DO.
WHAT HAPPENED?
HE CODED.
DR. BENTON CALLED IT.
WAIT, YOU CALLED IT? WHY?
THAT'S USUALLY WHAT I DO WHEN A PATIENT DIES.
OH, MAN.
WHAT THE HELL AM I SUPPOSED TO DO WITH THIS?
Weaver: THIS THE FOUR-YEAR-OLD?
Zadro: FULL ARREST-- BOUNCE-BACK FROM THIS MORNING.
Weaver: I REMEMBER.
Mrs. Bourke: I COULDN'T WAKE HER UP.
Olbes: FOUND HER IN V-FIB, UNRESPONSIVE TO DEFIBRILLATION TIMES THREE.
EPI AND LIDOCAINE.
CONNIE, GET CLEO.
SHE'S BEEN DOWN AT LEAST 30 MINUTES.
DO SOMETHING!
Weaver: WE WILL, MRS. BOURKE. EVERYTHING WE CAN.
HERE WE GO, ON MY COUNT:
ONE, TWO, THREE, GENTLY.
WHAT HAPPENED? CARDIAC ARREST AT HOME.
YOU SEE PROBLEMS THIS MORNING?
NO, I THOUGHT IT WAS GASTROENTERITIS.
HOLD COMPRESSIONS. CHECK THE RHYTHM.
Oligario: SHE'S STILL IN V-FIB.
PADDLES. CHARGE TO 30.
IS SHE GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT?
CLEAR!
OH, MY GOD!
PROCAINAMIDE. 17 PER KILO.
COULD SHE HAVE INGESTED ANYTHING?
CHINESE FOOD. I TOLD DR. FINCH.
WHAT ABOUT DRUGS?
ANTIDEPRESSANTS, POISONS, INSECTICIDES.
NO.
GASOLINE, CLEANING FLUIDS, BLEACH?
CLEO, ARE YOU RUNNING THIS?
YES, CHARGE TO 50.
THINK, MRS. BOURKE, WE NEED TO KNOW-- IRON TABLETS
DETERGENT, SHOE POLISH...
OH... WE KEEP VITAMINS
ON THE KITCHEN TABLE.
VITAMINS WITH IRON?
YES. IT'S IRON POISONING.
CLEAR!
Mrs. Bourke: OH, GOD!
SHE'S ASYSTOLE.
PUPILS ARE FIXED AND DILATED.
HIGH-DOSE EPI.
CONNIE, MOVE HER OUT.
NO, NO, NO, I WANT TO STAY.
COME ON, DEAR.
I WANT TO STAY.
MRS. BOURKE, COME ON OUT WITH US.
NO, PLEASE...
IT'S ALL RIGHT. IT'S ALL RIGHT.
Takata: DR. FINCH, YOU WANT ATROPINE?
DO YOU WANT ATROPINE, DR. FINCH?
NO.
WE GOT A CASE NUMBER FROM THE CORONER'S OFFICE.
WHY DON'T YOU SEE IF YOU CAN TRACK DOWN
THE FAMILY PEDIATRICIAN.
THE NURSES CAN DO THAT.
I WANT TO DO IT.
I'M SORRY.
YOU KNOW THERE'LL BE AN M & M
AND THERE COULD ALSO BE
MEDICAL LEGAL ISSUES.
DO YOU MIND IF I LOOK OVER YOUR NOTES?
CHART'S ON THE COUNTER.
NOW, WHAT WAS YOUR DISCHARGE IMPRESSION?
FOOD POISONING...
OR A MILD CASE OF GASTROENTERITIS.
OKAY, DID YOU ASK ABOUT HOUSEHOLD POISONS?
THE MOM SAID THE HOUSE WAS CHILDPROOFED.
PRESCRIPTION MEDS?
OUT OF REACH.
DID YOU ASK ABOUT IRON?
NO.
I'M NOT SURE I WOULD HAVE, EITHER.
OKAY, THE CHART LOOKS GOOD.
EVERYTHING YOU DID
WAS WITHIN THE STANDARD OF CARE.
RISK MANAGEMENT WON'T HAVE A PROBLEM.
IS THAT IT?
CLEO, YOU SAW THE CHILD
IN THE SECOND PHASE OF THE OVERDOSE
WHEN SHE LOOKED AND FELT COMPLETELY NORMAL.
YOU DID EXACTLY WHAT ANY ONE OF US WOULD HAVE DONE.
I SHOULD HAVE ASKED.
IRON IS ON A DIFFERENTIAL.
SO ARE 200 OTHER THINGS... I SHOULD HAVE ASKED.
YOU DID EVERYTHING YOU COULD.
NO, I DIDN'T.
SHE'S DEAD.
MALUCCI, DID YOU CALL PUBLIC HEALTH ABOUT THAT BAT BITE?
HUH?
THE GUY IN EXAM THREE.
HE'S GOING TO NEED A RABIES SERIES.
HE DIED ON ME.
THE PARACHUTE GUY.
HE SUFFERED MASSIVE HEAD INJURIES.
HE DIDN'T STAND MUCH OF A CHANCE.
I WROTE DOWN EVERYTHING
HIS WIFE WANTED TO TELL HIM ON THIS BOX
BUT HE DIED BEFORE I HAD A CHANCE TO READ IT TO HIM.
YOU TOOK THE MESSAGE MORE FOR HER THAN FOR HIM.
I GUESS.
JUST FEELS WEIRD THROWING IT AWAY NOW.
SHE SAID SOME REALLY NICE THINGS.
PRIVATE THINGS.
I'VE GOT A BAD NOSE BLEED.
CAN SOMEONE TAKE HIM?
IF WE HAD ANY BEDS.
HEY, WHY IS THAT RHINITIS STILL IN FOUR?
I DON'T KNOW.
ASK DR. LAWRENCE.
HERE, LET ME.
I THINK I KNOW WHERE HE IS.
I USED TO WORK ALL THE TIME.
HELL, I EVEN VOLUNTEERED FOR THE SHIFT AT CHRISTMAS.
DIDN'T MEAN I DIDN'T LOVE MY KIDS.
DADS ARE LIKE THAT.
HOW YOU FEELING, TOMMY?
OKAY.
HIS BLOOD GAS IS BACK.
GOOD pO2.
GOOD. THANKS.
TOMMY'S FATHER HAD TO LEAVE.
BACK TO WORK.
THERE WAS A PROBLEM AT THE SITE.
WERE YOU ABLE TO TALK TO DR. DeRAAD?
THE SHRINK?
I KNOW IT'S HARD TALKING TO SOMEBODY YOU DON'T KNOW
BUT THEY'RE HERE TO...
YOU KNOW, THEY'RE HERE TO LISTEN.
I'M NOT CRAZY.
I DIDN'T SAY THAT.
I JUST...
I KNOW YOU THINK IT'S STUPID, BUT I LOVE HER.
I MEAN, I REALLY LOVE HER.
WHO?
YOUR GIRLFRIEND?
AND SHE LOVED ME.
AND THEN SUDDENLY, SHE DIDN'T.
HOW COULD SOMEBODY LOVE YOU THAT MUCH AND THEN JUST STOP?
WHEN DID SHE TELL YOU ABOUT THIS?
I DIDN'T BELIEVE HER UNTIL THIS MORNING.
LIZZIE, DID YOU TALK WITH ANSPAUGH?
YES.
AND HOW DID HE TAKE IT?
HE DIDN'T. I DIDN'T DISCUSS IT WITH HIM.
YOU DIDN'T GET AROUND TO IT OR WHAT?
I HOPE WHEN YOU OFFERED ME THIS POSITION
YOU DID IT BECAUSE MY SURGICAL SKILLS ASIDE
YOU TRUST MY JUDGMENT.
NATURALLY.
NOW, IF I'M HERE TO PROTECT YOUR INTERESTS
THEN I HAVE TO TELL YOU IT'S IN YOUR BEST INTERESTS
TO KEEP DONALD ANSPAUGH HAPPY.
NOT ONLY IS HE A GREAT ASSET TO THE SURGICAL STAFF AND TO YOU
BUT HE'S ALSO EARNED SPECIAL CONSIDERATION.
NOW, IF THIS INTERFERES
WITH YOUR TENNIS LESSONS IN ANY WAY, THEN I'M SORRY...
I DON'T PLAY TENNIS.
WELL, WHATEVER. THE POINT IS
IF YOU WANT TO PUSH DONALD OUT
YOU'LL HAVE TO DO IT BY YOURSELF... WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
WHO SAID ANYTHING ABOUT PUSHING HIM OUT?
I ASSUMED THIS IS JUST THE FIRST STEP.
LIZZIE, WHEN YOU "ASSUME," YOU MAKE AN ASS OF "U" AND "ME."
WHAT?
WHATEVER. LOOK, I-I JUST WANTED FRIDAYS OFF.
I THOUGHT YOU COULD TALK TO DONALD
ABOUT THE O.R. SCHEDULE.
IF YOU'RE NOT COMFORTABLE
I UNDERSTAND.
OH.
OKAY?
YEAH, THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
YOU'RE FEEDING IT WRONG.
WHAT?
TRY FOLDING IT LONGWAYS
AND THEN FLIP UP THE CORNERS
AND FOLD IT FLAT.
OR YOU CAN JUST TELL ME TO MIND MY OWN BUSINESS.
GO AHEAD.
NO. I'M KIDDING.
I USE QUARTERS MYSELF.
WHAT DO YOU WANT?
UH, COKE.
CAFFEINE--
THE E.R. DOC'S BEST FRIEND.
TOMMY WENT UP TO MEDICINE.
DeRAAD PUT HIM ON A HOLD.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO FILL ME IN.
I JUMPED TO CONCLUSIONS WITH THE DAD.
I WANTED TO HELP.
YEAH, SURE.
WELL, KID'S IN TROUBLE.
YOU GO TO THE PARENTS FIRST.
THE DAD WAS STILL AN ASS FOR GOING BACK TO WORK.
YOU HAVE A FAMILY?
A DAUGHTER.
ARE YOU DIVORCED?
GET TO SEE HER A LOT?
SHE LIVES IN ST. LOUIS.
YOU KNOW, WHEN I WAS ABOUT YOUR AGE
MY SON WAS BROUGHT INTO THE E.R.
HE-HE'D, UH, FALLEN OUT OF A TREE.
THEY PATCHED HIM UP GOOD AS NEW.
IT WASN'T TILL LATER I REALIZED
HE HAD JUMPED OUT OF THE TREE.
HE WANTED TO COME SEE ME.
BUT THAT WAS THEN...
Lucy: DR. LAWRENCE.
UH, MR. HENDERSON IS ON HIS WAY TO THE O.R.
I JUST NEED YOU TO CO-SIGN THIS CHART.
I CAN DO THAT.
THANKS FOR THE COKE.
YOU BET.
DID YOU CHECK A SECOND CRIT?
38, UM, AND THE E.K.G. WAS NORMAL.
I REVIEWED THE FILMS WITH RADIOLOGY
AND YOU WERE RIGHT.
A COMMINUTED TIB-FIB
NON-DISPLACED CALCANEAL FRACTURE
AND THE CYSTOGRAM WAS NORMAL.
CYSTOGRAM? WHERE DID YOU GET A CYSTOGRAM?
YOU ORDERED IT WHEN THE URINE
TESTED POSITIVE FOR BLOOD.
HE HAD MICROSCOPIC HEMATURIA.
I ORDERED AN I.V.P.
NO, YOU SAID CYSTOGRAM.
I WOULDN'T ORDER A CYSTOGRAM FOR 30 RED CELLS.
YOU DID.
LUCY, I'VE BEEN TREATING
TRAUMA PATIENTS FOR 30 YEARS.
I THINK I KNOW WHAT I ORDERED.
GET AN I.V.P. BEFORE HE GOES UP.
HE'S ALREADY ON HIS WAY.
THEN CATCH HIM AND GET HIM INTO RADIOLOGY.
HE'S NOT GOING TO SURGERY WITHOUT AN I.V.P.
SUTURED THE SCALP LAC IN ONE.
I'M OUT OF HERE.
YOU SIGN OUT YOUR PATIENTS?
YEP. HOLD ON.
FORGOT THIS.
HEY, DAD, IT'S MARK.
NO. NOTHING.
I WAS JUST CALLING TO SEE HOW YOU'RE DOING.
I'M SURE IT'S A MISTAKE.
SEE YOU, MARK.
YOU TAKING OFF?
YEAH. I'VE GOT TO GO HOME, SOAK MY FEET...
AND THE REST OF MY BODY.
Meg: CAROL.
MEG, HOW DID IT GO?
I SCREWED UP.
WHAT HAPPENED?
I MISSED THE INTERVIEW.
I... I THOUGHT YOU SAID 6:30
BUT IT WAS 5:30 AND I-I BLEW IT.
IT'S NOT TRUE.
I-I COULDN'T GO THROUGH WITH IT.
WHY NOT?
NO ONE WANTS TO HIRE A PREGNANT WOMAN
AND I CAN'T BLAME THEM.
I MEAN, WHY SHOULD I WASTE THEIR TIME?
IT'S NOT LIKE I'M NOT GOING TO QUIT IN A MONTH ANYWAY.
MEG, STOP.
WE'RE GOING TO GO THERE TOGETHER
AND WORK SOMETHING OUT, OKAY?
OKAY.
Weaver: COMING THROUGH!
BEN SESSA, 6 YEARS OLD
TWO-DAY HISTORY OF FEVER AND VOMITING.
CARTER, I NEED YOUR HELP!
I'M OFF IN 15 MINUTES.
I GOT IT.
PULSE 140, B.P. 60.
WHAT IS IT?
COULDN'T GET AN I.V.
WHAT IS IT?
ALTERED WITH FEVER.
COULD BE SEPSIS, MAYBE MENINGITIS.
ON MY COUNT-- ONE, TWO, THREE, LIFT.
C.B.C., BLOOD CULTURES, CHEM PANEL.
OKAY, LET'S GET A LINE IN THIS KID.
HE'S DRY AS A BONE.
LET'S GET A FLUID BOLUS.
NO RESPONSE TO PAINFUL STIMULI.
HE'S GOT NO VEINS, I CAN'T GET A DRAW.
CALL SURGERY FOR A CUT-DOWN.
I'LL TRY A CENTRAL LINE.
THAT'S GOING TO BE TOUGH.
HIS VEINS ARE COMPLETELY COLLAPSED.
PREP THE ANKLE.
IF I DON'T GET IT, SURGERY CAN DO THE CUT-DOWN.
SYSTOLIC'S DOWN TO 50. PULSE 145.
OKAY, DO IT.
CUT-DOWN TRAY NOW. SPIKE TWO LITERS
OF SALINE-- ONE AT THE ANKLE
AND ONE AT THE HEAD.
PULSE OX 92.
GOT IT. HERE'S YOUR BLOOD.
SPIN A CRIT AND GET AN ACCU-CHECK.
STAND BY WITH SALINE.
I WANT A BOLUS OF 20 PER KILO
ABOUT 400cc's.
RUN IN A GRAM
OF CEFTRIAXONE AND CATH A URINE.
I'M IN. LET'S GO.
DR. WEAVER, I HAVE ROBIN BOURKE'S PEDIATRICIAN ON LINE TWO.
CLEO, YOU GOT THIS?
YEAH. I GOT THIS.
SEND UP A U.A. AND CULTURE.
AFTER THAT, I'LL DO AN L.P.
CARTER, DO YOU HAVE A SECOND?
NOT REALLY.
DID YOU HEAR DR. LAWRENCE
ORDER THAT CYSTOGRAM FOR MR. HENDERSON?
NO. DID HE HAVE GROSS HEMATURIA?
NO. JUST MICROSCOPIC.
THEN YOU DON'T NEED ONE.
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT
BUT HE TOLD ME TO ORDER IT.
YOU MUST HAVE HEARD HIM WRONG.
NO, HE SAID CYSTOGRAM.
DR. LAWRENCE WOULDN'T ORDER A CYSTOGRAM
FOR MICROSCOPIC HEMATURIA.
RIGHT. IT SEEMED STRANGE TO ME
BUT I FIGURED HE KNEW WHAT HE WAS DOING.
HE DOES KNOW WHAT HE'S DOING.
YOU ORDERED THE WRONG TEST. SEE YOU TOMORROW.
"I LOVE YOU, LARRY.
"THE GIRLS LOVE YOU.
"YOU HAVE BEEN THE BEST HUSBAND, THE BEST FATHER
"THE LOVE OF OUR LIVES, THE LIGHT OF OUR LIVES
"OUR TRUE NORTH.
"YOU CAN NEVER LEAVE US
"BECAUSE YOU'LL BE WITH US AND IN US.
WE LOVE YOU ALWAYS."
SO WHAT DID YOU TELL HIM?
THAT I SPOKE TO THE ADJUSTER
AND THEY AGREED TO ACCEPT THE LATE PAYMENT.
EXCEPT THEY CANCELED HIS POLICY.
RIGHT.
SO WHO PAYS FOR THE CYPRESS TREE?
YOU'RE LOOKING AT HIM.
( chuckles )
THE DUTIFUL SON.
YEAH, WELL, DUTY COMES AT A PRICE.
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO BUY ME DINNER.
WHATEVER YOU WANT.
GOOD, 'CAUSE I'M HUNGRY.
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT THERE?
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT?
MARK... WHAT IS IT?
QUIT GRABBING.
QUIT GRABBING!
I'M NOT GOING TO GRAB.
ALL RIGHT.
I GOT IT FRAMED FOR YOUR OFFICE.
YOU'VE JUST LOST DINNER, MISTER.
WHAT?
HEY, DR. LAWRENCE.
OH, PLEASE, IT'S GABE.
ARE YOU OFF?
ALMOST.
UH, WE'RE GETTING A BITE TO EAT.
CARE TO JOIN US?
NO, THANKS. I STILL HAVE SOME DICTATIONS AND...
WE'RE JUST GOING ACROSS TO DOC MAGOO'S
IF YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND.
RIGHT, THANKS.
HAVE A GOOD NIGHT.
YEAH, YOU, TOO.
GOOD NIGHT.
Greene: IT'S NOT EVERYBODY WHO GETS TO BE
ON THE FRONT PAGE OF THE NEWSPAPER.
Corday: I'M SO NOT TALKING TO YOU.
YOU GOING TO MAKE ME STARVE?
I'M GOING...
I'M GOING TO ELBOW YOU.
