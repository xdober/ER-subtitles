Corday: YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS.
Greene: WHY NOT?
Corday: BARBECUING IN JANUARY?
Greene: WELL, YOU JUST FREEZE YOUR BUTT OFF
FOR, LIKE, TEN, 15 MINUTES.
NO, YOU FREEZE YOUR BUTT OFF FOR TEN OR 15 MINUTES.
IS THIS A SAN DIEGO RITUAL?
DAD AND I DID BARBECUE A COUPLE OF TIMES LAST WEEK.
WELL, I'M GAME IF YOU ARE.
LET'S STOP BY AFTER WORK
PICK UP SOME STEAKS.
SOUNDS GOOD.
GOOD MORNING.
GOOD MORNING. YOU'RE, UH...?
UH, ANDREW. AND YOU'D BE DRS. GREENE AND CORDAY?
YEAH.
I'VE MESSAGES FOR BOTH OF YOU.
THE FIRST OF WHICH IS THAT I'M LOOKING FOR BOTH OF YOU.
I BELIEVE THE FIRST ONE FOR DR. GREENE...
WHAT'S YOUR NAME AGAIN?
ANDREW. ANDY, YEAH.
I THINK YOU MIGHT WANT TO ANSWER THOSE PHONES.
THANK YOU. YEAH, GOOD KID.
FEW MORE YEARS OF TRAINING AND HE MIGHT JUST CUT IT.
WE HAVE A NEW E.R. RESIDENT STARTING TODAY
NAMED JING-MEI CHEN OR SWING MY...
I NEED YOU TO SAY HOWDY-DOODY.
STARTING IN JANUARY?
APPARENTLY, HER PROGRAM IN NEW YORK FELL APART
AND SHE'S GOT A DADDY WITH DEEP POCKETS.
SOUNDS LIKE DEEP DONATION TO COUNTY GENERAL.
LET'S KEEP THAT AMONGST OURSELVES.
LIZZIE, YOU GOT A MINUTE?
DR. GREENE, THAT MESSAGE I WANTED TO GIVE YOU EARLIER.
UH, APPARENTLY, YOUR FATHER'S DISAPPEARED
FROM HIS RETIREMENT HOME.
I'M SENSING IT'S MORE OF A RUNAWAY THING.
I DON'T BELIEVE THEY'RE SUSPECTING FOUL PLAY.
THANKS, ANDREW. I FEEL BETTER ALREADY.
WHAT'S OPEN? OH, UH, CURTAIN TWO.
AND NOW ANOTHER CASE HAS COME UP.
A GIRL, JENNY CORDOVA, MISSING ABOUT SIX WEEKS AGO.
WE FOUND THE CAR ABANDONED.
DEAN ROLLINS' PRINTS WERE ON IT.
YOU HAVEN'T FOUND THE BODY YET?
NO.
AND YOU WANT ME TO ASK HIM WHERE IT IS?
YES.
LIZZIE, FOR BETTER OR WORSE
YOU'VE DEVELOPED A RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM.
YOU TALKED HIM INTO TELLING YOU WHERE THE OTHER BODY WAS
YOU TALKED HIM INTO HAVING THE SURGERY.
THIS FAMILY NEEDS YOUR HELP.
HE'S A COLD-BLOODED SON OF A BITCH.
I DON'T THINK HE'LL TELL ME.
I'LL ASK.
BUT I CAN TELL YOU NOW, IT'S HOPELESS.
THE CORDOVAS DON'T HAVE ANY OPTION
SO "HOPELESS" IS BETTER THAN NOTHING.
FIVE OF HALDOL? I JUST ITCH, OKAY.
CASSANDRA. MA'AM. CAN YOU DO SOMETHING?
ARE YOU TAKING ANY MEDICATIONS?
HAVE YOU SEEN A DERMATOLOGIST?
WHOA. SECURITY!
STOP, STOP, STOP.
WE NEED SECURITY!
GET HER OFF! COME ON.
JOHN.
OH, MY GOD.
DEB.
YEAH, IT'S ME.
I'M SURPRISED TO SEE YOU DOWN HERE.
THOUGHT YOU'D GET A SURGICAL RESIDENCY FOR SURE.
I DID. I GAVE IT UP.
DEB CHEN? YOU'RE THE NEW RESIDENT?
THAT'S RIGHT, DR. GREENE.
OH, BUT IT'S JING-MEI NOW.
ACTUALLY, IT ALWAYS WAS.
CARTER, LISTEN, I MIGHT HAVE TO FLY TO SAN DIEGO THIS MORNING
SO IF YOU COULD SHOW, UH, DEB...
JING-MEI... THE ROPES, OKAY?
SURE. HEY, IS EVERYTHING OKAY?
MY FATHER'S BARRICADED HIMSELF IN OUR OLD HOUSE.
THERE'S NO HEAT, THERE'S NO ELECTRICITY.
HE'S RUNNING AROUND IN HIS UNDERWEAR
SO ACTUALLY, EVERYTHING ISN'T OKAY
BUT THANKS FOR ASKING.
YEAH, I'M ACTUALLY PRETTY SURPRISED
TO SEE YOU AROUND HERE.
I, UH, THOUGHT YOU DROPPED OUT OF MEDICINE AFTER...
I ALMOST KILLED THAT PATIENT BY LEAVING A GUIDE WIRE IN HIS CHEST.
I'M SORRY, I DIDN'T MEAN TO BRING THAT UP.
OH, YES, YOU DID, JOHN, BUT THAT'S OKAY.
AND IT WAS KIND OF A LOW POINT
BUT IT DID FORCE ME TO FACE THE TRUTH.
I WAS BEING WAY TOO AGGRESSIVE
TOO COMPETITIVE, TOO MUCH OF AN OVERACHIEVER
ALWAYS TRYING TO SHOW PEOPLE UP.
AND WAY TOO SUCCESSFUL AT IT.
I'D LEFT THE PATIENT OUT OF THE PICTURE.
WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE YOUR WRESTLING PARTNER TIRED HERSELF OUT.
HI. I'M YOSH TAKATA.
HI. JING-MEI CHEN.
SHE'S MUCH BETTER WITH HALDOL.
THIS IS CASSANDRA HARPER.
SHE CAME IN EXTREMELY AGITATED GLOVES.
WITH INTENSE PRURITUS.
CALLED FOR A PSYCH CONSULT.
DR. MYERS SAID HE'LL BE DOWN.
DO YOU THINK IT'S A PSYCHIATRIC DISORDER?
I DO, YES.
EITHER SEVERE O.C.D. OR A BODY
DYSMORPHIC DISORDER.
YES, BUT, UM, DID YOU SEE THESE?
WHAT?
BURROWS, PAPULES.
I THINK THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE IT'S LINDANE TOXICITY.
SHE'S GOT BODY LICE.
CLASSIC SYMPTOMS.
APPLIED LINDANE FOR THE LICE
SCRATCHED HERSELF
AND THE LINDANE ENTERED HER BLOODSTREAM
THEREBY CAUSING HER ALTERED MENTAL STATUS.
BUT I GUESS WE SHOULD WAIT FOR DOCTOR, UH...
MYERS. I'LL GIVE HIM A CALL.
RIGHT.
TAXI'LL BE HERE IN FIVE MINUTES.
SORRY ABOUT NO BARBECUE.
DON'T BE RIDICULOUS.
I'M WORRIED ABOUT YOUR FATHER.
YOU SHOULD BE WORRIED.
I MAY HAVE TO KILL HIM FOR PULLING THIS.
YOU KNOW HOW HARD IT WAS TO GET HIM INTO THAT RETIREMENT COMMUNITY?
YES, I BELIEVE YOU HAVE SHARED THAT WITH ME.
WISH YOU WERE COMING.
YEAH, SO DO I.
I'M OFF TO SEE DEAN ROLLINS NEXT.
I'LL BE GLAD WHEN YOU'RE RID OF HIM.
MAKES TWO OF US.
HEY, CALL ME WHEN YOU GET THERE.
I WILL.
OH, ANDREW!
YEAH.
UH, CAN YOU GIVE THAT
TO YOSH TAKATA.
DR. WEAVER'LL BE HERE ANY MINUTE
AND, UH, IN THE MEANTIME, YOU'RE IN CHARGE.
WHAT IF THERE'S AN EMERGENCY?
CALL A DOCTOR.
THERE'S ONE!
WE NEED A DOCTOR.
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?
SMILE.
WE'RE ON A SCAVENGER HUNT.
WE HAVE TO FIND A DOCTOR
A POLICEMAN, A BRIDEGROOM AND A POLAR BEAR.
THANKS. BYE.
MR. AND MRS. SUMPTER
THIS IS DR. CHEN.
HI.
MR. SUMPTER SLIPPED ON HIS ROOF TWO WEEKS AGO.
NO BIG DEAL AT THE TIME, BUT THE PAIN
KEPT GETTING WORSE?
RIGHT-- IT'S THE LAST DAY OR SO
IT'S REALLY BEEN HURTING.
IT COULD BE A TORN MENISCUS
OR AN A.C.L.
I ACTUALLY ALREADY TOLD THEM THAT, DEB
BUT THANK YOU.
AN 18-GAUGE NEEDLE AND A 50cc
SYRINGE, PLEASE.
YOU SURE? WON'T THAT HURT?
OH, IT SHOULD BE FINE.
DR. CARTER'S GOING TO INSERT THE NEEDLE
INTO THE JOINT SPACE AND ASPIRATE THE BLOOD
WHICH SHOULD RELIEVE THE PAIN ALMOST IMMEDIATELY.
HERE WE GO.
THAT IS GROSS.
DEFINITELY BACTERIAL.
LOOKS LIKE YOU PICKED UP
A BIT OF A STAPH INFECTION AFTER YOUR FALL.
AS SOON AS WE GET THE RESULTS
WE'LL START YOU ON SOME ANTIBIOTICS
AND YOU'LL BE BETTER IN NO TIME.
THANK YOU. THANK YOU.
YOU'RE VERY WELCOME.
YEAH, WE'LL BE BACK.
Takata: DR. CARTER, DR. CHEN.
YOSH MENTIONED SOMETHING ABOUT LINDANE TOXICITY?
OH, JUST A CRAZY GUESS.
HI. I'M JING-MEI CHEN.
PRETTY GOOD CRAZY GUESS, DR. CHEN.
GOOD PICKUP.
PAUL MYERS, PSYCHIATRY.
THANKS FOR THINKING OF US, CARTER.
FEELS GOOD TO BE BACK.
NEED A TRAUMA SURGEON?
UH, NO, JUST A FENDER BENDER.
I CAN HANDLE IT.
THE PATIENT DOESN'T MEET TRAUMA CRITERIA.
WELL, I'M HERE. MIGHT AS WELL HAVE A LOOK.
AND LIFT.
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
TAMARA DAVIS.
ALL RIGHT, LET'S TAKE A LOOK HERE.
PUPILS ARE EQUAL AND REACTIVE.
DO YOU KNOW
WHERE YOU ARE?
THE HOSPITAL.
I HAVE A BASKETBALL GAME TONIGHT. CAN I PLAY?
LET'S FINISH THE EXAM FIRST.
HOW DID THE ACCIDENT HAPPEN?
I WAS DRIVING TO SCHOOL AND THE NEXT THING I REMEMBER
IS BEING PUT INTO THE AMBULANCE.
OUCH! POINT TENDERNESS AT THE SNUFF BOX.
MY SHOOTING HAND.
WE'LL NEED TO GET SOME X RAYS OF YOUR WRIST.
MAKE SURE YOU DO A CONE-DOWN OF THE NAVICULAR.
THANKS, PETER.
WHAT WOULD I DO WITHOUT YOU?
OH, HEY, JOHN, GRAM STAIN'S BACK
ON THAT KNEE PATIENT, MR. SUMPTER.
IS IT STAPH?
IN HIS DREAMS.
TRY GONORRHEA.
OUCH.
MORE LIKE HIS NIGHTMARE.
YOU GOING TO TELL THEM?
I'LL TELL HIM.
LEGALLY, WE CAN'T TELL HER WITHOUT HIS PERMISSION.
HOPEFULLY HE'LL TELL HER HIMSELF.
YEAH, BUT WE STILL HAVE TO REPORT IT TO PUBLIC HEALTH, RIGHT?
THEY CAN FOLLOW UP, TELL THE WIFE.
KIND OF DOUBT IT. BETWEEN SYPHILIS AND HIV
THEY HAVE THEIR HANDS FULL.
WHAT IF SUMPTER DOESN'T TELL HIS WIFE?
THEN HE DOESN'T TELL HIS WIFE.
( groaning )
GOOD MORNING.
YOU LIED TO ME.
YOU TURNED MY LIFE INTO PAIN.
I DIDN'T LIE TO YOU AND I'M SORRY FOR HOW YOU'RE FEELING
BUT YOU FRACTURED YOUR PELVIS
YOU TORE UP THE NERVES AND ARTERIES IN YOUR LEG
AND IT'S GOING TO BE A LONG RECUPERATION.
GIVE ME SOMETHING.
GIVE HIM TEN OF MORPHINE.
TEN?
DEAN, I WANT TO TALK TO YOU.
TEN IS A JOKE FOR WHAT I GOT.
WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO DO TO ME?
BELIEVE IT OR NOT, I'M TRYING TO HELP YOU.
WELL, I DON'T BELIEVE IT
AND I WANT YOU OUT OF HERE.
GET HER OUT OF HERE!
YOU'RE FIRED.
I WANT A NEW DOCTOR.
GET OUT.
EXCUSE ME, IS THERE A PAY PHONE?
ANDREW.
PAY PHONE?
UH, YEAH.
UH, PAY PHONE.
PAY PHONE IS, UH...
OVER BY CHAIRS.
OKAY, I KNOW HE'S ANDREW, BUT WHO ARE YOU?
OH, JING-MEI CHEN, NEW RESIDENT STARTING TODAY.
HEY. DR. DAVE MALUCCI.
DID YOU SAY TODAY?
I'M KERRY WEAVER, CHIEF OF THE E.R.
WHY ARE YOU STARTING IN JANUARY?
UM, COULD I SPEAK TO YOU ALONE?
OF COURSE.
AS CHIEF, I THINK YOU SHOULD KNOW
MY FATHER BOUGHT MY WAY INTO THE PROGRAM
BY GIVING COUNTY A HUGE AMOUNT OF MONEY.
I'M NOT PROUD OF IT, BUT I AM GRATEFUL.
I'M NOT A BAD DOCTOR, BUT, UH, AS A MED STUDENT
I DID ALMOST KILL A PATIENT IN THIS VERY E.R.
I'M MORE COMPETENT NOW
SO HOPEFULLY, THIS WILL ALL WORK OUT.
HOPEFULLY IT WILL.
ANDREW, COULD YOU, UH, DIG OUT THE YELLOW PAGES?
MY CAR BROKE DOWN ACROSS THE STREET.
SAY NO MORE, DR. WEAVER.
AUTOMOTIVE REPAIR IS MY MIDDLE NAME.
I'M SURE YOU HAVE PATIENTS.
NO. I'M NOT EVEN ON YET.
I'M JUST IN DOING PAPERWORK.
OKAY, I HOPE I DON'T REGRET THIS.
GIVE IT A SHOT.
STOPPED, I COULDN'T GET IT STARTED AGAIN.
AND REMEMBER, IT'S BROKE, IT'S NOT DEAD.
ANDREW, SINCE YOU'RE NOT LOOKING UP CAR REPAIR
COULD YOU, UH, FIND ME THE NUMBER
FOR THE PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT?
SURE.
MY WIFE WENT TO USE THE PHONE.
THAT'S OKAY, ACTUALLY.
WE DON'T NEED HER FOR THIS.
MR. SUMPTER, THE GRAM STAIN SHOWS THAT YOU HAVE GONORRHEA.
WHAT?!
YOU TAPPED MY KNEE. I DON'T GET THIS.
THE BACTERIA'S CARRIED THROUGH THE BLOOD.
IT HAPPENED TO SETTLE IN YOUR KNEE.
HAVE YOU HAD ANY DISCHARGE DURING URINATION?
COUPLE WEEKS BACK. IT WENT AWAY.
YOU HAD SEX WITH ANYONE OTHER THAN YOUR WIFE?
WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON?
MR. SUMPTER, YOU HAVE
A SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASE.
HAVE YOU HAD SEX WITH ANYONE OTHER THAN YOUR WIFE?
STOP. STOP.
ONE TIME, OKAY?
ME AND THE GUYS
WE WERE OUT CELEBRATING A NEW CONTRACT...
I DON'T NEED TO KNOW THE DETAILS
BUT I THINK THAT YOU SHOULD TELL YOUR WIFE.
OH, MAN.
MR. SUMPTER
I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO...
YOU SON OF A BITCH!
COME ON, COME ON, COME ON...
MRS. SUMPTER!
CARTER! CHEN!
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!
YO, I CAN WALK.
I'M SURE YOU CAN.
I CAN WALK.
IT'S OKAY, JAKE.
BUT I CAN WALK.
DID YOU DRIVE HERE BY YOURSELF?
YEAH.
I CAN DRIVE.
NOT RIGHT NOW, JAKE, ALL RIGHT?
OKAY, LET'S TAKE A LOOK.
I WANT YOU TO SIT HERE.
HEY, NO, JAKE.
LET HIM DO IT, ALL RIGHT?
SHE WAS NOT SUPPOSED TO TELL THE WIFE.
I DID NOT TELL THE WIFE.
I HELD OUT THE PHONE
SO THAT PUBLIC HEALTH COULD TELL HIS WIFE.
OKAY, OKAY, HEY!
NOBODY'S DONE ANYTHING WRONG.
NEXT TIME, LET'S JUST KEEP IT
FROM BECOMING A SLUGFEST.
CARTER, SUMPTER'S YOUR PATIENT, CLEAN IT UP. CHEN!
YES.
WE'VE GOT A JANE DOE IN CHAIRS WITH OFFICER GRABARSKY.
CHECK IT OUT.
HI. I'M JING-MEI CHEN.
JING WHAT?
THIS JANE DOE?
YEAH, SHE'S A PROBABLE RUNAWAY.
SHE WON'T GIVE US HER REAL NAME.
SHE WAS PANHANDLING UNDER THE EL.
SHE GOT SOME FROSTBITE
AND A BAD LAC ON HER FOREARM.
I'M FINE.
Grabarsky: HEY, LOOK, IT'S WARM IN HERE.
THEY FEED YOU, THEY LET YOU SLEEP.
MY ADVICE, TAKE THE DAY OFF.
SHE'S ALL YOURS.
THANKS.
YEAH.
HI. COME ON.
SO, YOU WERE COOKING BREAKFAST, HUH?
YEAH, WAS NO BIG DEAL.
I LIKE FRENCH TOAST.
OH, SO DO I, JAKE, WITH MAPLE SYRUP.
I LIKE FRENCH TOAST.
THAT'S WHAT YOU WERE COOKING?
I'M SORRY, DILLON. I'M SORRY.
JAKE, SHUT UP AND SIT DOWN.
DON'T BE MAD. I'M SORRY.
JAKE, I'M NOT MAD. JUST SHUT UP.
IT'S OKAY. HE CAN TALK.
WAS IT GREASE THAT BURNED YOU?
WHAT THE HELL DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE?
JUST PUT SOME STUFF ON IT
AND WE'LL BE OUT OF HERE.
AND YOU WERE HAVING A KIND OF LATE BREAKFAST, HUH?
YEAH.
DID YOU MISS SCHOOL?
I'M 18. I'M OUT OF SCHOOL.
WHAT ABOUT JAKE?
I WANTED FRENCH TOAST! I'M SORRY! I'M SORRY!
SHUT UP, JAKE!
I'M SORRY, DILLON! I'M SORRY!
I'M SORRY, I'M SORRY, I'M...
JAKE!
NO, I'LL GET HIM. I'LL GET HIM.
HEY, IT'S OKAY. IT'S OKAY.
DON'T WORRY. IT'S OKAY.
HEY, DAVE, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
STEALING WEAVER'S CAR?
JUST TAKING A LOOK.
COULDN'T GET IT STARTED.
SO, UH... CARTER...
DID YOU KNOW THIS NEW RESIDENT, JING SOMETHING-OR-OTHER?
THAT'S GOOD, SCREW UP HER NAME. THAT'LL IMPRESS HER.
I HEARD SHE WAS A MEDICAL STUDENT HERE.
IS THAT RIGHT?
YES, SHE WAS. YES, I KNEW HER.
AND?
AND... NOTHING.
AH, IT DIDN'T WORK OUT, HUH?
I DID NOT TRY AND GO THROUGH EVERY MEDICAL STUDENT.
OH, YEAH? WHY NOT?
I'M JUST KIDDING, MY FRIEND.
YOU WANT ME TO BACK OFF, YOU JUST SAY SO.
NO, I THINK YOU GUYS WOULD BE GREAT TOGETHER.
GO FOR IT.
CONSIDER IT DONE.
SO, JAKE WAS THE ONE COOKING, HUH?
I HAD SOME BUSINESS TO HANDLE
SO I DIDN'T GET HOME TILL, LIKE, 2:00
SO I SLEPT IN.
JAKE WANTED SOME FRENCH TOAST
SO HE STARTED FIXING IT HISSELF.
DAMN... HALF THAT KITCHEN CAUGHT ON FIRE.
AND HE KNOWS BETTER THAN THAT.
DON'T YOU, JAKE?
YOU CAN TALK NOW.
I'M NOT MAD NO MORE.
HE HATES IT WHEN HE THINK HE'S DONE SOMETHING WRONG.
JUST GOES ALL QUIET.
WHERE ARE YOUR PARENTS?
THEY DON'T ASK ABOUT US
WE DON'T ASK ABOUT THEM.
CAN'T EVEN REMEMBER WHEN POPS LEFT.
MOM IS ON THE STREETS.
WE SEE HER EVERY NOW AND THEN
BUT WE MOVE AROUND A LOT.
MUST MAKE IT HARD FOR SOCIAL SERVICES TO KEEP UP WITH YOU.
THEY GOT ENOUGH TO DO
WITHOUT WORRYING ABOUT US.
MAYBE THEY COULD HELP YOU.
OR MAYBE WE JUST KEEP HELPING OURSELVES.
CAN YOU?
YEAH, I DO OKAY, ALL RIGHT?
JAKE WORKS AROUND THE COMPLEX
SWEEPING UP AND STUFF.
PEOPLE PAY HIM.
WE DO FINE.
I DO MY JOB.
YOU DO, MAN.
YOU DO A GOOD JOB.
WE DO JUST FINE.
YOU CAN'T FORCE ME TO DO THIS.
WE'RE NOT FORCING YOU, WE ARE HELPING YOU.
THAT'S THE DEAL.
YOU GET TO LIE ABOUT YOUR NAME AND AGE.
BUT YOU DO NOT GET TO SIT AROUND
IN THESE STINKY CLOTHES.
MAYBE I CAN FIND YOU SOMETHING IN LOST AND FOUND.
THANKS, HALEH.
SO...
JANE DOE, HUH?
MY PARENTS WEREN'T VERY CLEVER.
MAYBE NOT, BUT I BET THEY MISS YOU.
I WOULDN'T KNOW.
SO... JANE...
HOW DID YOU GET THESE OTHER MARKS
ON YOUR ARMS?
I DON'T RECALL.
YOU ARE JUST A FOUNTAIN OF INFORMATION, AREN'T YOU?
YEP.
DR. CHEN, YOU HAVE A CALL ON FIVE
OUT HERE AT THE DESK.
UH, COULD YOU TAKE A MESSAGE, PLEASE?
UH, NO, IT'S THE LAB CALLING ABOUT
THE LITTLE BOY WITH MENINGITIS?
LITTLE BOY WITH MENINGITIS?
THEY SAID IT WAS URGENT.
OKAY, UM...
I'LL BE BACK. DON'T RUN AWAY.
VERY FUNNY.
UM, HALEH, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT ANY...
WALLET. FOUND IT IN HER COAT POCKET.
NAME'S ALYSSA ADAMS.
ADDRESS AND PHONE NUMBER.
WE'RE STILL WAITING ON YOUR X RAYS
BUT IN THE MEANTIME, WE'RE GOING TO PUT YOU NEXT DOOR.
I CAN'T JUST WALK?
I'M SURE YOU CAN, IF IT WEREN'T FOR THE DAMN RULES.
SO WHERE WERE YOU DRIVING THIS MORNING
WHEN YOU MET UP WITH THAT TELEPHONE POLE?
LATE TO SCHOOL.
I GUESS I FELL ASLEEP AT THE WHEEL.
AT 9:00 IN THE MORNING?
PULLED AN ALL-NIGHTER.
CHEMISTRY MIDTERM TODAY.
SCHOOL PRETTY TOUGH?
SOMETIMES.
HAVE YOU BEEN FEELING DEPRESSED ABOUT IT?
WOULDN'T YOU, IF YOU WERE GETTING
A C-MINUS IN CHEMISTRY?
DEPRESSED ENOUGH TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT?
WHAT ARE YOU...?
YOU'RE THINKING I MEANT TO DRIVE INTO THAT TELEPHONE POLE
LIKE SUICIDE OR SOMETHING?
DID YOU?
MY PARENTS WOULD KILL ME IF I DID ANYTHING LIKE THAT.
NOT TO MENTION MY COACH.
ESPECIALLY TODAY.
THAT'S RIGHT. BASKETBALL GAME TONIGHT.
AGAINST UNION, WHO WE HAVEN'T BEATEN IN THREE YEARS.
EXCEPT THIS YEAR THEY SUCK AND WE'RE GOOD.
I USED TO SHOOT A FEW MYSELF.
YOU PLAYED?
HIGH SCHOOL AND COLLEGE.
ALTHOUGH, TRACK WAS MY THING.
I DO TRACK IN THE SPRING.
I RUN THE 100 AND THE FOUR-BY-ONE.
I WAS MORE DISTANCE--
THE 800, THE TWO-MILE.
OH, TAMMY
THERE YOU ARE.
WE WERE WORRIED SICK ABOUT YOU.
SWEETHEART, ARE YOU OKAY?
MOM, DAD, I'M FINE.
MR. AND MRS. DAVIS, I'M DR. FINCH.
IS SHE GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT?
WILL SHE BE ABLE TO PLAY TONIGHT?
WE'RE STILL WAITING ON HER WRIST X RAYS.
I'LL CHECK BACK.
I CALLED COACH AVERY AND HE'S AGREED
TO KEEP YOU ON THE ROSTER UNTIL HE HEARS FROM US.
I CAN TALK TO HIM, DAD.
AND I'M GOING TO CALL MR. WILLIAMS.
SEE ABOUT YOU TAKING CHEMISTRY IN SUMMER SCHOOL.
YOU PAGED ME.
YEAH, YEAH, UM...
DETECTIVE CRUSON WAS UNABLE TO PERSUADE ROLLINS TO TALK.
I DIDN'T THINK HE'D HAVE MUCH LUCK.
PERHAPS YOU COULD TRY AGAIN.
I ALREADY TRIED.
BESIDES, HE WANTS ANOTHER DOCTOR.
I THINK YOU SHOULD TRY AND TALK HIM OUT OF THAT, TOO.
I DON'T WANT TO EVER TALK TO HIM AGAIN.
THE CORDOVAS.
YEAH, MRS. CORDOVA'S OTHER DAUGHTER, JENNY
WAS ONLY 19 YEARS OLD.
THIS IS NOT FAIR OF YOU, ROBERT.
YOU AND I BOTH KNOW I AM CAPABLE OF A LOW BLOW.
HOWEVER, I RARELY USE IT TO SUCH PURITY OF PURPOSE.
WHAT'S UP?
JASON BENDER, 11.
SHORTNESS OF BREATH DURING PHYS ED.
ALSO COMPLAINING OF MILD PAIN TO THE UPPER LEFT CHEST.
I GOT HIT YESTERDAY WITH A HOCKEY STICK.
I GET HIT ALL THE TIME, USUALLY IN THE HEAD.
SQUEEZE MY HAND.
IS THAT WHY YOU'RE TRYING
TO TAKE A CAR APART IN THE SNOW?
WE'LL GET YOU FIXED UP GOOD. YOU CALL HIS PARENTS?
MOM'S ON HER WAY.
HOW'S THAT BOY WHO BROKE THE LIGHT BOX?
HE'S OKAY NOW.
HE LIVES WITH HIS OLDER BROTHER, RIGHT?
THERE'S NO PARENTS?
RIGHT.
HMM... HAVE YOU CALLED D.C.F.S.?
I THINK THE OLDER BOY NEEDS A JOB
MORE THAN HE NEEDS SOCIAL SERVICES.
WELL, ARE EITHER ONE OF THEM IN SCHOOL?
THEY'VE BEEN MOVING AROUND A LOT.
YEAH.
LOOK, I MEAN, WE SEE A LOT OF KIDS LIKE THIS.
IT'S ROUGH, BUT IF THEY GET AN EDUCATION
THEY HAVE SOME KIND OF CHANCE AT A FUTURE.
CALL D.C.F.S., SEE IF YOU CAN GET THEM SOME HELP?
SURE.
MRS. ADAMS?
YES, HI, THIS IS DR. CHEN FROM COUNTY GENERAL.
I'M CALLING ABOUT YOUR DAUGHTER, ALYSSA.
UH, DR. WEAVER, THERE'S A PHONE CALL
FOR A CAROL HATHAWAY?
YEAH, SHE'S ON MATERNITY LEAVE FOR ANOTHER WEEK.
TAKE A MESSAGE.
ARE YOU A DOCTOR?
WE NEED A DOCTOR.
( clears throat )
YES.
EXCELLENT! CAN WE TAKE YOUR PICTURE?
YES.
THANKS. THANKS, MAN.
YOUR FINGERPRINTS WERE FOUND ALL OVER HER CAR.
THEY WANT TO KNOW WHERE THE BODY IS.
YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES I FEEL
EVERYONE JUST WANTS A LITTLE PIECE OF ME.
WILL YOU TELL THEM?
NO, I DON'T RECALL THIS GIRL.
WHAT IS THE POINT, DEAN?
YOU'VE ALREADY BEEN CHARGED WITH MURDER.
WHY CAUSE MORE NEEDLESS GRIEF?
"NEEDLESS GRIEF" IS WHAT I DO BEST.
OH, FINE, THEN.
W-WAIT!
WAIT! WAIT! I...
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW...
IF I TALK, WILL YOU STILL BE MY DOCTOR?
YES.
THEN I WILL.
BUT ONLY TO THE SISTER.
WELL, I DON'T THINK THEY'LL ALLOW THAT.
WHY DON'T YOU JUST TELL ME?
UH-HUH. I WANT TO DO IT
BUT I DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO LOOK AT THE MOTHER.
TAKE A DEEP BREATH.
OKAY, LET IT OUT.
HOW LONG YOU BEEN SHORT OF BREATH?
COUPLE OF DAYS.
ANY FEVER?
WELL, HE HAD A MILD TEMPERATURE A FEW DAYS AGO.
I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST A COLD.
AND HAVE YOU BEEN TIRED LATELY?
YEAH, I GET UP AT 5:00 EVERY MORNING FOR HOCKEY PRACTICE.
OKAY, LIE BACK DOWN.
JASON HAS A CONSOLIDATION IN HIS LEFT LUNG.
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
HE PROBABLY HAS PNEUMONIA
WHICH WOULD ACCOUNT FOR THE CHEST PAIN
AND SHORTNESS OF BREATH.
IS THAT BAD?
NAH, WE CALL IT WALKING PNEUMONIA
BECAUSE YOU'RE SUCH A TOUGH GUY
IT DOESN'T STOP YOU FROM PLAYING HOCKEY.
LOW VOLTAGE, OTHERWISE NORMAL E.K.G.
THIS MACHINE'S TOTAL BULL...
YOU KNOW, WHY DON'T WE FIND ANOTHER ONE
AND RUN IT AGAIN.
IN THE MEANTIME, I'M GOING TO GET A CHEST X RAY
AND START JASON ON ANTIBIOTICS.
WHO'S YOUR FAVORITE HOCKEY TEAM?
THE BRUINS.
THE BRUINS? OH, MAN, YOU'RE IN CHICAGO.
YOU'RE KILLING ME.
BEEHAWKS, BABY, BEEHAWKS.
ADELE.
HEY, KERRY.
WERE YOU ABLE TO HELP THAT BOY
WITH THE BURNED ARMS AND HIS YOUNGER BROTHER?
IT'S NOT RINGING A BELL.
TWO BROTHERS, DR. KOVAC'S PATIENT.
NO, HE DIDN'T MENTION ANYTHING.
OH, WELL, YOU'LL NEED TO SEE THEM.
I'LL CHECK ON IT.
ALL RIGHT. I'LL BE AROUND.
PETER, WE'VE GOT A RULE-OUT APPY IN FOUR.
I KNOW IT'S NOT TRAUMA, BUT MARK'S OFF.
COULD YOU TAKE IT?
YEAH, SURE.
SHE LOOKS CLEAR TO ME.
YEAH, EXCEPT SCAPHOID FRACTURES CAN BE PRETTY DIFFICULT TO SEE.
THAT'S WHY WE HAVE MULTIPLE VIEWS.
I WASN'T IMPRESSED WITH HER EXAM.
SHE CAN COME BACK NEXT WEEK
AND WE'LL TAKE A LOOK AT HER AGAIN.
ALL RIGHT. YOU FILL IN THE PARENTS.
I'LL GO TALK TO HER.
SURE.
GOOD NEWS-- YOU CAN GET OUT OF THIS JOINT.
NO FRACTURE.
OH, REALLY?
SO, DOES THAT MEAN I CAN PLAY TONIGHT?
IF YOU'RE FEELING UP TO IT
I DON'T SEE WHY NOT.
HEY.
WHAT'S GOING ON?
YOU OKAY?
I HAVE A CHEMISTRY EXAM I'M ABOUT TO FLUNK
AND ALL I DO IS PRACTICE--
THREE MORNINGS A WEEK, EVERY DAY AFTER SCHOOL...
I LOVE IT, YOU KNOW.
I REALLY DO.
I'M JUST TIRED RIGHT NOW.
LET'S DO THIS, OKAY?
WHY DON'T YOU HANG OUT HERE FOR A WHILE
AND I'LL GET THE RADIOLOGIST TO TAKE A LOOK
AT THESE X RAYS.
YOU SAID THERE WAS NO FRACTURE.
I'LL GET AN EXPERT'S OPINION.
YOU GET SOME REST.
WHAT DO YOU SAY?
THE DOCTOR, SHE WAS CHINESE
OR THE NURSE, SHE WAS BLACK--
I NEED TO SPEAK TO THEM RIGHT NOW.
I'LL TRY AND FIND THEM IF YOU JUST...
COULD YOU TELL ME WHERE THE LOST AND FOUND IS?
I NEED SOME CLOTHES...
ALYSSA, WHAT ARE YOU DOING OUT HERE?
WHAT DID YOU CALL ME?
I NEED TO GET OUT OF HERE.
NO, NO, ALYSSA, WAIT, WAIT...
LOOK, YOU STOLE MY CLOTHES
AND YOU STOLE MY COAT.
YOU'RE TRYING TO TRICK ME...
WE DIDN'T STEAL ANYTHING.
AND WE'LL GIVE IT ALL BACK TO YOU.
YOU'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE
UNTIL I SEW UP THAT LACERATION
AND YOU TELL ME WHAT'S GOING ON.
PLEASE, LET ME HELP.
YOU CAN'T, OKAY? YES, I CAN.
NO, YOU CAN'T!
SIT DOWN. SIT DOWN.
JUST LISTEN FOR A MINUTE, WILL YOU?
OKAY, YOU ARE SAFE HERE.
WHO TRICKED YOU?
YOUR PARENTS?
YES, THEY...
TO GET ME INTO THIS TREATMENT CENTER.
THAT'S WHERE I RAN AWAY FROM.
OKAY, TREATMENT CENTER
LIKE FOR DRUGS OR ALCOHOL?
NO.
FOR GENDER IDENTITY.
WHAT?
MY PARENTS SENT ME AWAY
BECAUSE THEY THINK I'M SICK AND CONFUSED.
I KEEP TELLING THEM, "MOM, DAD, GET OVER IT.
ALL I AM IS GAY."
ULTIMATELY IT'S YOUR OWN DECISION.
MOM, I CAN DO IT.
I DON'T WANT YOU NEAR HIM.
Cruson: I'LL BE JUST OUTSIDE
AND ROLLINS IS STILL IN RESTRAINTS.
SINCE THE ACCIDENT
HE'S NO LONGER ABLE TO GET OUT OF BED.
HE CAN'T HURT ANYONE.
HE KILLED MY DAUGHTER.
MRS. CORDOVA... I DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS MAN
AND I DON'T CARE TO.
BUT RIGHT NOW, YOU HAVE NOTHING TO LOSE.
IF LINSEY ASKS HIM, I THINK HE MIGHT
JUST TELL HER WHERE YOUR DAUGHTER IS.
AND IF HE DOESN'T?
WE MAY NEVER FIND HER.
PLEASE?
MOM, I HAVE TO KNOW.
I'LL BE IN THERE WITH HER.
DAVE, DO YOU HAVE A SEC?
WHAT A MESS.
WHAT?
WEAVER'S CAR-- I GOT IT STARTED
BUT THESE SPARK PLUGS ARE RIDICULOUS.
I NEVER SHOULD HAVE OPENED MY BIG MOUTH.
YOU OUGHT TO LOOK AT THIS.
HOLD ON, I'M ALMOST DONE.
IT'S YOUR 11-YEAR-OLD WITH PNEUMONIA.
SINCE WHEN DO YOU PULL X RAYS FOR ME?
RADIOLOGY FLAGGED IT.
WHOA, WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?
MEDIASTINAL MASS.
AROUND THE HEART?
FLINT SUSPECTS LYMPHOMA.
NO WONDER THE E.K.G. SHOWED LOW VOLTAGE.
LOOKS LIKE INFILTRATES THROUGH BOTH LUNG FIELDS.
IT'S INOPERABLE.
THIS BOY IS DEAD.
THEY CALL THIS PLACE A TREATMENT CENTER, JOHN
LIKE THEY'RE GOING TO CURE HER.
HER PARENTS SENT HER AWAY FOR DEPROGRAMMING?
YEAH, THEY GRANTED THEM GUARDIANSHIP.
GET HER OUT OF HERE BEFORE THEY SHOW UP.
I DIDN'T TELL HER I CALLED THEM.
SHE NEEDS HELP AND I DON'T WANT HER TO BOLT.
CALL SOCIAL SERVICES.
WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO DO?
I'M ASSUMING THIS PLACE IS LEGAL.
IT SHOULDN'T BE.
RIGHT.
DR. CHEN, WE HAVE A SITUATION HERE.
OH?
I'M NOT GOING BACK!
CALM DOWN, ALYSSA. DON'T TOUCH ME!
SOMEBODY CALL SECURITY!
YOU GOT IT.
NO NEED FOR THAT.
I'M HER LEGAL GUARDIAN.
YOU CALLED MY PARENTS?! YOU BITCH!
DR. RAMSEY, PRINCIPAL OF THE SECOND TURN TREATMENT CENTER.
SECOND TURN?
HER PARENTS ASKED ME TO PICK HER UP.
WE CAN'T ALLOW THAT.
I HAVE TEMPORARY CUSTODY.
WELL, SHE'S NOT READY TO BE DISCHARGED.
WHY NOT? 'CAUSE WE NEED TO DO FURTHER TESTS.
FOR WHAT?
SHE'S PREGNANT.
PREGNANT?
YES, LAB WORK CONFIRMS IT.
I BET.
UNFORTUNATELY, FOR YOU
THIS MEANS ALYSSA IS NOW AN EMANCIPATED MINOR.
SHE CAN DECIDE WHERE SHE WANTS TO GO.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS GIRL HAS TOLD YOU
ABOUT THE CENTER, BUT THIS IS A LOAD OF BUNK
AND FRANKLY, AN OBSTRUCTION OF PARENTAL RIGHTS.
WELL, ALYSSA, DO YOU WANT TO STAY HERE
OR GO WITH MR. RAMSEY?
I WANT TO STAY HERE.
WE ALL KNOW SHE CAN'T BE PREGNANT.
SHE'S A HEALTHY YOUNG WOMAN OF CHILDBEARING AGE.
YOU MIGHT TALK TO SOME OF THE MALE MEMBERS OF YOUR STAFF.
I WANT TO SEE THIS LAB REPORT.
OH, MEDICAL RECORDS ARE CONFIDENTIAL.
CONFIDENTIAL? YOU JUST TOLD ME.
YOU'RE RIGHT, I SHOULDN'T HAVE.
FINE.
I'LL BE BACK WITH A COURT ORDER.
I'LL BE PRAYING FOR YOU, ALYSSA.
DON'T BOTHER.
( coughing )
DR. CORDAY.
MR. ROLLINS.
THIS IS LINSEY CORDOVA.
HI, LINSEY.
I'D, UH...
I'D SHAKE HANDS, BUT...
SO HOW CAN I HELP YOU?
I WANT TO BURY MY SISTER.
PLEASE, JUST...
TELL ME WHERE SHE IS.
WERE YOU CLOSE TO HER, LINSEY?
YES, I WAS.
I DIDN'T HAVE BROTHERS OR SISTERS.
I MEAN, ALL MY LIFE, I'VE NEVER KNOWN WHAT THAT WAS LIKE.
YOU KNOW, TO BE PART OF A FAMILY.
( coughing )
I HAVE DONE TERRIBLE THINGS, LINSEY.
I'VE DONE EVIL THINGS.
I KNOW.
BUT I AM PAYING FOR THEM NOW.
WE DON'T WANT YOU TO SUFFER.
WE JUST WANT TO KNOW WHERE JENNY IS.
YOU'RE A GOOD PERSON.
MORE FORGIVING THAN MOST PEOPLE.
DO YOU KNOW THAT MAYBE IF I HAD MET YOU
JENNY WOULD STILL BE ALIVE.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
IF ONLY I'D MET YOU, LINSEY.
I KNOW IT NOW.
YOU'RE WARM...
AND LOVING.
IF ONLY I'D MET YOU.
I COULD HAVE HAD YOU INSTEAD.
WHAT?!
JENNY SCREAMED
ALL THE TIME.
I WAS GLAD TO GET RID OF HER, LINSEY.
OH, GOD... YOU BASTARD!
HEY, WHAT'S HER PROBLEM?!
I PULLED HIS MEDICAL RECORDS.
HE HAD LYMPHOMA TWO YEARS AGO.
CHEMO PUT IT IN REMISSION.
THE MOTHER DIDN'T MENTION CANCER?
SHE SAID SHE MUST HAVE BLOCKED IT OUT OF HER MIND.
IT NEVER AFFECTED HIS BREATHING BEFORE.
ARE YOU DOING A THORACENTESIS?
AS SOON AS THE MOM FIGURES OUT A WAY TO TELL HIM.
SHE SAYS SHE CAN'T SO...
YEAH, THEN YOU SHOULD.
I PAGED ONCOLOGY.
NO, YOU TELL HIM.
WAIT A MINUTE. EXCUSE ME...
WAIT. DON'T YOU THINK ONCOLOGY
WOULD BE BETTER AT THAT?
NO, YOU'RE HIS DOCTOR.
Kovac: DILLON!
JUST KEEP WALKING.
DILLON, WAIT.
HE'S CALLING YOU. I KNOW.
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
NOT YOUR PROBLEM.
YOUR BROTHER NEEDS A TETANUS SHOT.
SURE, HE DOES.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND. WH-WHAT'S WRONG?
YEAH, DILLON, WHAT'S WRONG?
HE GAVE US UP.
GAVE YOU UP?!
GAVE US UP? SHUT UP, JAKE.
YOU CALLED A SOCIAL WORKER.
I DIDN'T CALL THE SOCIAL WORKER.
RIGHT. I'M SURE SHE ALWAYS COME BY
AND VISITS ALL THE RETARDS.
I'M NOT A RETARD!
I KNOW, I'M SORRY.
THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT, OKAY?
I SWEAR I DIDN'T CALL ANYONE!
THAT WAS A MISTAKE!
BUT YOU GUYS NEED HELP.
I'VE BEEN TAKING CARE OF HIM FOR TWO YEARS.
WE DO JUST FINE.
HE DOESN'T GO TO SCHOOL.
YOU HAVE NO JOB, NO MONEY.
GOD KNOWS WHERE YOU LIVE.
YOU'VE GOT EVERYTHING UNDER CONTROL.
WE GET BY.
YEAH, BUT SOMETIMES NOT VERY WELL.
YOU'RE BURNED, JAKE IS CUT.
JUST, PLEASE, HEY, LET ME FIGURE SOMETHING OUT, HUH?
HE SAID HE WAS GOING TO GET A COURT ORDER.
HAVE YOU HEARD FROM THE PARENTS?
NO. AND SHE'S REALLY NOT PREGNANT.
YEAH, I ASSUMED THAT PART.
I ASSUME YOU DIDN'T WRITE IT ON HER CHART?
NO. DID YOU? NO.
THERE'S A GAY AND LESBIAN CENTER ON WABASH.
ANDREW CAN GET YOU THE NUMBER.
GET HER IN A CAB, GET HER OVER THERE
THEN CALL HER PARENTS.
LET THEM KNOW THAT SHE'S OKAY.
OKAY. RIGHT. THANK YOU.
HEY, DR. CHEN.
AS A RULE WE DON'T LIE
ABOUT OUR PATIENTS' MEDICAL CONDITIONS.
YEAH.
AH, IT'S HER FIRST DAY.
I BETTER GET BACK TO WORK.
GOOD IDEA.
EXCUSE ME? ARE YOU A DOCTOR?
YES.
CAN I TAKE YOUR PICTURE? WH-WHAT?
I'M ON THIS SCAVENGER HUNT...
WHO'S CLEANING AUTO PARTS IN TRAUMA ONE?
I KNOW IT'S NOT STERILE, BUT COME ON.
OH, MALUCCI.
CAN I TAKE YOUR PICTURE?
I'M ON THIS SCAVENGER HUNT.
WHAT? GO AWAY.
DR. BENTON, I THOUGHT YOU SAID HER WRIST WAS ALL RIGHT.
YEAH, JUST A LITTLE SORE.
YEAH, BUT CAN SHE PLAY? YEAH.
THEN WHY IS THE OTHER DOCTOR PUTTING A CAST ON?
WHAT?
DR. FINCH?
DR. BENTON.
SHE SAYS IT'S SOME KIND OF CULT FRACTURE.
IT'S HARD TO SEE.
OCCULT. AND YES, IT CAN BE HARD TO SEE.
RADIOLOGY COULDN'T RULE IT OUT.
I THOUGHT YOU LOOKED AT THE X RAY.
UH... YEAH, I DID.
UM, DR. FINCH, DO YOU HAVE A MINUTE?
SURE.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK, TAMARA.
I MEAN, IT FEELS OKAY, RIGHT?
YOU THINK YOU CAN PLAY?
YEAH.
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT SHE PLAYS.
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT SHE STAYS HEALTHY.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
CASTING HER WRIST.
I TOLD HER PARENTS SHE WAS FINE.
I RAN IT BY RADIOLOGY.
THEY COULDN'T SAY FOR SURE THAT IT WASN'T FRACTURED.
OH, COME ON, YOU KNOW THE CHANCES OF HER
HAVING A FRACTURE ARE NEGLIGIBLE.
I'D RATHER BE SAFE. SHE'S AN ATHLETE.
SHE CAN PUSH TOO FAR, REALLY HURT HERSELF.
WELL, THEN TELL HER NOT TO.
THE GIRL'S UNDER TOO MUCH PRESSURE TO PERFORM.
SHE NEEDS A BREAK.
DID SHE ASK YOU TO PUT A CAST ON?
SHE'S EMOTIONALLY AND PHYSICALLY EXHAUSTED.
SHE CAN ALWAYS DECIDE NOT TO PLAY, YOU KNOW.
THAT GIRL HASN'T MADE A DECISION
FOR HERSELF SINCE SHE WAS 11.
EVERYTHING SHE DOES REVOLVES AROUND PLEASING HER COACH
HER PARENTS, HER TEAMMATES, HER TEACHERS.
I'M TRYING TO GIVE HER A LITTLE BIT OF TIME TO REST...
DID SHE ASK YOU? YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND, SHE CAN'T.
YOU'RE CONTROLLING HER?
I'M PROTECTING HER.
OH, I'M SURE THAT'S WHAT HER PARENTS THOUGHT
THEY WERE DOING, TOO.
THAT'S WHY MY CHEST HAS BEEN HURTING?
IT'S SPREAD THROUGHOUT YOUR LUNGS.
SO MORE CHEMO?
WELL, THAT'S AN OPTION.
WE CAN TRY TO SHRINK IT, BUT...
BUT WHAT?
THE CANCER IS SURROUNDING YOUR HEART.
AM I GOING TO BE OKAY?
I DON'T THINK SO.
DR. MALUCCI...
NOT RIGHT NOW.
DID YOU LEAVE...
DR. WEAVER, I'M BUSY.
EXCUSE ME, I'M SORRY.
DAD?
DAD, YOU THERE?
DAD...
OH, IT'S YOU.
SO, YOU, UH... CHANGED THE LOCKS?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
WORRIED ABOUT YOU.
NO ONE COULD FIND YOU.
YOU WEREN'T ANSWERING THE PHONE.
THE DAMN REALTOR KEEPS CALLING.
I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY TIMES I HAVE TO TELL HER
THE HOUSE IS OFF THE MARKET.
CAN I COME IN?
OH, SURE.
YOU DON'T WANT TO SEARCH ME FIRST?
Kovac: KERRY, WHAT DID YOU HIRE ME FOR?
WHAT?
I'M NOT HERE TO SIMPLY PERFORM PROCEDURES.
I'M AN EXPERIENCED EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN.
YOU HAVE TO TRUST MY JUDGMENT.
IS THIS ABOUT THAT DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED BOY?
YES. YOU CALLED D.C.F.S.
YES, I THOUGHT WE AGREED YOU WOULD.
IF YOU DIDN'T INTEND TO
YOU SHOULD HAVE SAID SOMETHING.
BUT THEY WALKED OUT.
YOUR SOCIAL WORKER SCARED THEM.
THEY'RE GONE?
YEAH.
I CONVINCED THE OLDER BROTHER TO COME BACK
SO I COULD TRY TO HELP HIM.
PLEASE, JUST LET ME HANDLE IT.
ALL RIGHT. SEE THAT YOU DO.
OKAY. WHO IS THE SOCIAL WORKER?
NEUMAN. ADELE NEUMAN.
YOUR PARENTS LEFT?
THEY WENT TO GET THE CAR.
I'VE GOT TO GO.
MY COACH MAKES US SIT ON THE BENCH IF WE CAN'T PLAY.
YOU CAN PLAY, TAMARA
IF YOU REALLY WANT TO.
IT'S NOT BROKEN?
I CAN'T BE ABSOLUTELY SURE.
BUT PROBABLY NOT.
SO I DON'T NEED THIS?
I WAS HOPING IT WOULD SLOW YOU DOWN A BIT.
BUT IT'S YOUR CHOICE.
I CAN'T SLOW DOWN RIGHT NOW.
THINGS'LL GET BETTER
ONCE WE GET THROUGH THIS SEASON.
YOU DON'T WANT TO START RESENTING YOUR TALENT.
DON'T LET IT GET TO THAT.
PLAY FOR YOU.
IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE.
I KNOW.
PROMISE YOU'LL TRY?
600 SOUTH STONE.
OKAY, 8:30.
YEAH, HE'LL BE THERE.
OH, DID YOU WANT TO TALK TO DR. KOVAC?
OKAY.
THANKS, BYE.
MY LANDLORD SAID YES.
YES?
HE OWNS A BUNCH OF BUILDINGS.
HE'S ALWAYS LOOKING FOR A SUPER
AND HE'LL INTERVIEW DILLON TOMORROW MORNING.
LUCY, THANK YOU.
SURE, NO PROBLEM.
AND WHAT EXACTLY IS A SUPER?
COLLECTS RENT, KEEPS THE BUILDING CLEAN.
GOOD. GOOD.
IT GIVES THEM SOMEWHERE TO LIVE, SOME CASH.
DILLON! IF D.C.F.S. SEES THAT DILLON
IS SUPPORTING JAKE DILLON!
HE CAN APPLY FOR GUARDIANSHIP.
DILLON! DILLON!
EXCUSE ME.
HOLD STILL, HOLD STILL.
I DON'T WANT TO HURT YOU.
DON'T TOUCH HIM!
WHERE ARE YOU TAKING HIM?
HEY, DON'T DO THAT!
LET HIM GO! YOU ARE SCARING HIM!
ADELE NEUMAN, D.C.F.S. WE NEED TO TAKE JAKE
TO AN EMERGENCY INTAKE CENTER.
YOU'RE NOT TAKING HIM NOWHERE, YOU BITCH!
I'M NOT RELEASING HIM!
THE BOY HAS BEEN NEGLECTED
AND IT'S MY OBLIGATION TO PROTECT
HIS SAFETY AND HIS HEALTH.
I NEVER NEGLECTED HIM! HE'S MY BROTHER!
I'M GETTING HIM A JOB. THEY'LL BE FINE.
HEY!
I SAID LET HIM GO!
STAND BACK OR I HAVE TO ARREST YOU.
I HAVE TO PUT HIM
IN PROTECTIVE CARE.
ALL RIGHT! ALL RIGHT!
JUST LET ME GO WITH HIM.
I'M SORRY.
DON'T BE SCARED, JAKE.
DON'T BE SCARED.
( Jake sobbing )
I'LL BE RIGHT BEHIND YOU, OKAY?
OKAY?!
YOU CAN'T DO THIS.
THOSE TWO ONLY HAVE EACH OTHER.
I'LL FIND YOU! I KNOW THAT.
I PROMISE! DON'T BE AFRAID, JAKE!
I'LL BE RIGHT BEHIND YOU, ALL RIGHT!
I'M GOING TO FIND YOU, OKAY?
OKAY?!
I'LL BE RIGHT BEHIND YOU!
I'M GOING TO FIND YOU, I PROMISE!
DON'T LET ME GO!
DON'T BE AFRAID, JAKE!
DON'T BE AFRAID!
DON'T BE SCARED!
DON'T BE SCARED, JAKE!
DON'T WORRY.
WE'LL GET HIM BACK.
YOU WANTED TO SEE ME?
I'M SICK.
NO MORE GAMES, DEAN.
WHAT IS IT THAT YOU WANT?
THE GAMES...
THEY'RE NO FUN ANYMORE.
NOT EVEN THAT LAST ONE.
DR. CORDAY...
THAT DAY ON THE ROAD
YOU SHOULD HAVE LET ME DIE.
THAT'S WHAT I WANT.
SHANNON MURPHY, 26, SLIPPED DOWN A 15-FOOT INCLINE
INTO A POLAR BEAR PIT.
POLAR BEAR?
YEAH, AT THE ZOO.
HE WAS REALLY GENTLE, ACTUALLY.
HE LICKED MY FACE.
EVERYBODY ELSE GOT A PICTURE OF THE POLAR BEAR.
I GOT ONE WITH THE POLAR BEAR.
THIS THAT STUPID SCAVENGER HUNT?
DON'T CALL IT STUPID.
I JUST WON $1,000.
YEAH, YOU ALSO JUST BROKE BOTH YOUR ANKLES.
AND A FOREARM FRACTURE.
STARTED AN I.V. AND GAVE HER TEN OF MORPHINE.
CLEO, YOU WANT THIS ONE?
NO, I'VE DONE ENOUGH CASTING FOR ONE DAY.
COULD SOMEONE TAKE THIS LADY
WHO BURNED HER BUTT IN THE BATHTUB?
SHE WILL NOT STOP SCREAMING FOR A DOCTOR.
YOU'RE NOT A DOCTOR?
I WON'T TELL ANYBODY IF YOU WON'T.
OH, MY GOD. WHERE'S MY CAMERA?
DID YOU BRING MY CAMERA?
SOMEBODY, I NEED A PICTURE OF A DOCTOR.
SOMEBODY GET ME A CAMERA!
IT'S WORTH $1,000!
MAKE HER SPLIT IT WITH US.
LUKA, I HEARD ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED.
I'M SORRY.
DON'T APOLOGIZE.
IT MIGHT NOT ALWAYS MAKE SENSE TO US
BUT WHEN THERE'S A DIFFICULT FAMILY SITUATION
WE CALL D.C.F.S.
BECAUSE THEY HAVE EXPERTISE IN THIS AREA.
WE HAVE TO DEFER TO THEIR JUDGMENT.
YOU DON'T BREAK UP FAMILIES.
SOMETIMES WE DO. IT'S COMPLICATED.
NO.
MY WIFE AND KIDS WERE TAKEN.
IN THE WAR?
YEAH.
AND THEN KILLED.
YOU DON'T BREAK UP FAMILIES.
SO MUCH FOR THE RETIREMENT COMMUNITY, HUH?
I GAVE IT A TRY, MARK.
YOU WERE ONLY THERE A WEEK.
YEAH, THE LONGEST WEEK OF MY LIFE.
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO NOW?
I'LL GET BY.
DON'T TROUBLE YOURSELF.
IT'S NO TROUBLE.
YEAH, LIKE HELL.
YOU MOVE IN WITH THAT GIRL YET?
ELIZABETH?
NO, NOT YET.
ACTUALLY, I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT IT
AND, YOU KNOW, WE NEVER REALLY TALKED ABOUT IT.
MAYBE YOU SHOULD COME LIVE WITH ME IN CHICAGO.
FOR A WHILE.
WHY WOULD I DO THAT?
I DON'T KNOW.
THE WEATHER COULD BE BETTER
BUT IT'S A GREAT CITY.
YOU'D BE CLOSER TO RACHEL.
YOU'D BE CLOSER TO ME.
FOR A WHILE?
AS LONG AS YOU LIKE.
I'M NOT SELLING THIS HOUSE, MARK.
HOW COULD YOU?
ANSWERING THE DOOR IN YOUR UNDERWEAR
TENDS TO SCARE OFF THE BUYERS.
( chuckling ): I SUPPOSE SO.
CHICAGO, HUH?
YOU ARE NOT ONE TO GET YOUR TUNE-UPS
DONE ON A TIMELY BASIS, ARE YOU?
DID YOU GET IT STARTED?
SORRY, YEAH.
IT'S NOT GOING TO BREAK DOWN ON THE WAY HOME?
NOPE. I CAN AT LEAST FIX CARS.
WHAT? NOTHING.
YOU'RE GOOD TO GO, BOSS.
THANK YOU, DR. MALUCCI.
MY PLEASURE.
HEY! SO, HOW WAS YOUR FIRST DAY?
EVERYONE TREAT YOU ALL RIGHT?
UH, YEAH, FEELS LIKE I NEVER LEFT.
YOU GUYS WANT TO GO GET SOMETHING TO EAT?
OH... NO.
I DON'T THINK SO. OKAY.
HEY, YOU WORKING TOMORROW?
ME? YEAH.
UH-HUH.
OH, WHAT A COINCIDENCE. SO AM I.
SEE YOU, CARTER.
DO I HAVE TO WARN YOU ABOUT HIM?
OH, PLEASE!
SO HOW WAS YOUR FIRST DAY?
UH, WELL, I WISH I COULD HAVE DONE MORE FOR ALYSSA.
AT LEAST YOU DID SOMETHING.
YEAH, I GUESS SO.
WHY DID YOU COME BACK?
I TOLD YOU.
UH, MY PROGRAM IN NEW YORK CLOSED.
NO, NO, I MEAN, UH, I MEAN TO MEDICINE.
OH, OH... UM, WELL
FOUR MONTHS AFTER I QUIT, I WAS ON THE SUBWAY
AND THIS GUY, PRETTY YOUNG, IN HIS 40s
WENT INTO CARDIAC ARREST.
HE WAS DYING
AND EVERYONE WAS JUST STANDING THERE STARING AT HIM.
SO I SUDDENLY REALIZED, HEY, I KNOW WHAT TO DO.
JUMPED IN, SAVED HIS LIFE.
IT'S A GREAT FEELING.
YEAH, IT CAN BE.
THEN I FIGURED...
I'M PRETTY GOOD AT THIS.
WHY WASTE IT?
DEB, YOU HAVEN'T CHANGED A BIT.
IT'S JING-MEI.
GOOD NIGHT, JING-MEI.
GOOD NIGHT, JOHN.
OH, AND, DEB...
WELCOME BACK.
MORPHINE.
100 MILLIGRAMS INJECTED INTO YOUR BLOODSTREAM
AND YOU SIMPLY DRIFT AWAY.
WON'T EVEN HURT.
IS THAT AN OFFER?
YOU'D HAVE TO TELL ME WHERE THE BODY IS.
WHY DO YOU CARE SO MUCH?
WERE YOU SERIOUS OR NOT?
WON'T YOU GET INTO TROUBLE?
THE HIPPOCRATIC OATH AND ALL?
YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT ME NOW, ARE YOU, DEAN?
NO.
BUT I KNOW YOU.
AS SOON AS YOU GET WHAT YOU WANT
YOU'LL JUST, YOU'LL STOP.
I WON'T.
BUT HOW DO I KNOW?
WHAT? ARE YOU GOING TO PROMISE ME
DR. CORDAY?
BELIEVE ME, YOU'LL KNOW.
YOU'LL FEEL YOURSELF GOING.
I JUST HOPE
YOU HAVE BREATH ENOUGH TO TELL ME.
WHAT IF I DON'T?
THEN I'LL CRACK OPEN YOUR CHEST
AND BRING YOU BACK TO LIFE.
OKAY.
LET'S DO IT.
ARE YOU SURE?
YEAH.
ARE YOU?
I'M GLAD IT'S YOU, ELIZABETH.
WHERE IS SHE, DEAN?
