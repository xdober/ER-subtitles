( helicopter approaching )
THREE GUNSHOTS.
ONE LOOKS FATAL.
YOU SHOULD HAVE LET US LAND TEN MINUTES AGO.
SUSPECT WAS PINNED DOWN.
HE WAS STILL FIRING.
HE WAS SHOOTING AT THE SCHOOL?
THEY WERE SHOOTING EVERYWHERE.
A UNIT RESPONDED TO A TRUCK ROBBERY.
THE SUSPECTS OPENED FIRE.
I'LL TAKE THIS ONE.
WHERE ARE MY GLASSES?
WHERE ARE MY GLASSES?!
IS HE ALERT?
SORT OF.
NAME'S DANIEL.
DANIEL, DO YOU KNOW WHERE YOU ARE?
I LOST MY GLASSES.
TELL ME WHERE YOU ARE.
SCHOOL.
EXIT WOUND OUT THE RIGHT TEMPLE.
WHAT KIND OF AMMUNITION WERE THEY USING?
ONE HAD A LARGE CALIBER ASSAULT RIFLE
TO SHOOT THROUGH THE ENGINE BLOCK.
WE'LL NEVER GET HER BACK WITH A HEAD WOUND LIKE THAT.
STOP COMPRESSIONS.
( sobbing )
MY DAD...
SOMEBODY CALL MY DAD!
I'M DR. KOVAC. WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
NICHOLAS.
TAKE A DEEP BREATH, NICHOLAS.
COULD YOU CALL MY DAD?
VINNY ROSATO.
HE WORKS AT COVIN.
312-54...
HOW'S HE DOING?
CHEST IS CLEAR, GOOD RADIAL PULSE.
TITRATE FOUR OF MORPHINE.
54... 548.
Kovac: DON'T WORRY. I'M SURE THE SCHOOL HAS IT.
THAT COULD TAKE AWHILE.
WE'RE EVACUATING OUT OF THE FRONT
OF THE BUILDING.
WHY?
WE APPREHENDED TWO.
THERE MIGHT BE ANOTHER.
MIGHT BE?
CAN YOU FEEL YOUR LEG?
Nicholas: KIND OF.
IT'S LIKE GOING TO SLEEP.
WHAT, PINS AND NEEDLES?
YEAH.
WHERE ARE THE PARAMEDICS?
WE'RE WAVING THEM THROUGH.
YOU GOT ANY ANCEF?
RED BAG, SIDE POCKET.
IS YOURS STABLE BY GROUND?
HE SHOULD BE.
BULLET FRAGMENT-- MISSED THE BRAIN. YOURS?
Kovac: CLEAN THROUGH THE SHOULDER.
ONE TO THE GROIN WITH A COLD FOOT.
WE'VE GOT TO REVASCULARIZE WITHIN...
( gunshot )
OKAY, CLEAR OUT.
WHAT?!
GO! NOW!
HE'S IN THE BUILDING, COMING OUT!
Benton: LET ME EXAMINE HIM.
IS HE STILL BREATHING?
YEAH, HE'S CLEAR.
ALL RIGHT, COME AHEAD.
YOU SHOT HIM THROUGH THE VEST?
RIGHT CHEST.
ALL RIGHT, B.P.?
SIR, I'M A DOCTOR.
CAN YOU TALK?
GO TO HELL.
I'LL TAKE THAT AS A YES.
DIMINISHED BREATH SOUNDS ON THE RIGHT.
B.P.'s 100/65.
HIS PULSE IS AT 88.
LET'S GET A LARGE-BORE I.V.
AND LET'S ROLL HIM.
NO EXIT WOUND.
HE NEEDS A CHEST TUBE.
LET'S GET BETADINE AND STERI-DRAPE
AND TAKE THAT MASK OFF HIM.
Kovac: YOU GOT THIS?
Benton: YEAH. LIDOCAINE.
I'M SENDING THE EYE BY AMBULANCE
AND TAKING THE LEG IN THE CHOPPER.
HOLD ON, I MIGHT NEED TO FLY THIS GUY.
NO ROOM. TAKE HIM BY GROUND.
I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE HE'S STABLE.
BRING HIM TO MERCY.
COUNTY'S THE CLOSEST PEDIATRIC TRAUMA CENTER.
JUST WAIT UNTIL I GET THE CHEST TUBE IN.
ALL RIGHT, 32 FRENCH.
Kovac: CHRIS, TAKE TWO UNITS
OF O-NEG FROM THE COOLER IN THE CHOPPER.
I'M LOADING MY KID.
I SAID WAIT!
KOVAC!
The suspect is apparently alive.
We are waiting for confirmation on that.
If you are just joining us
This is a live shot of Phalen Elementary School.
IS THAT DR. KOVAC?
IT'S HARD TO SAY.
HE'S TOO SHORT TO BE KOVAC.
HAS ANYONE SEEN THE TOOL KIT?
WHAT TOOL KIT?
THE DO-IT-YOURSELF KIT.
THE ONE WITH THE HAMMER, PLIERS, SCREWDRIVER.
YOU GOING TO BUILD A TREE HOUSE?
I GOT A GUY WHO DRILLED A WOOD SCREW
INTO HIS TIBIA WITH A POWER DRILL.
( beeping ) SOMEBODY GOING TO GET THAT?
THANKS, ABBY.
WHAT ARE YOU WATCHING?
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?
A SHOOTING NEAR A SCHOOL.
WEAVER SENT BENTON AND KOVAC.
WHY DID THEY GET TO GO?
BECAUSE THEY DON'T GET SICK IN THE CHOPPER.
I TOLD YOU I HAD THE FLU.
I GOT IT.
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO
TAKE IT OUT WITH A SCREWDRIVER?
YOU GOT A BETTER IDEA?
M.V.A. COMING IN.
SINGLE AUTO VERSUS PARKING STRUCTURE.
E.T.A.?
FIVE TO TEN.
GET WEAVER.
I'LL MEET YOU IN TRAUMA TWO.
HEY, WHY DO YOU GET IT?
I'LL CALL YOU IF HE NEEDS HIS OIL CHANGED.
THE DRIVE MIGHT BE FASTER IN MORNING TRAFFIC.
IT'S YOUR CALL.
HOLD ON. PULSE IS WEAK AND THREADY.
HEY, MAN, ARE YOU STILL WITH ME?
HEART RATE'S UP TO 120.
CHEST TUBE OUTPUT'S OVER 500cc's.
HE'S BLEEDING OUT.
SPIKE A UNIT OF O-NEG.
B.P.'s DOWN TO 70 PALP.
FOLLOW ME.
WE'LL TRANSPORT BY CHOPPER.
HALF LITER BOLUS, THEN T.K.O.
HE'S BLEEDING OUT.
WHAT?
THE SHOOTER. I NEED THE CHOPPER.
WHERE ARE WE GOING TO PUT HIM?
WE HAVE TO TAKE THE BOY OFF.
HE HAS A PULSELESS LEG.
YEAH, BUT WE GOT FIVE HOURS TO REVASCULARIZE.
I'M NOT GOING TO WASTE TIME TRANSPORTING BY GROUND.
THIS GUY'S PRESSURE'S CRASHING!
GIVE HIM BLOOD.
GET OUT OF THE CHOPPER!
NO WAY.
MY PATIENT IS MORE CRITICAL.
YOUR PATIENT KILLED PEOPLE.
THAT'S NOT OUR CALL.
COME ON.
CLOSE THE DOOR.
LET'S GO.
KOVAC, OPEN UP THE DOOR!
STAND BACK.
OPEN UP THE DOOR!
STAND BACK!
OW! OW! OW!
I.V.'s IN.
I'M OUT OF HERE.
SCREW YOU! YOU'RE WELCOME.
THANK YOU, DORIS.
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT, CARTER?
A COMBATIVE SINGLE M.V.A.
RAN INTO A PARKING LOT BOOTH.
GET THIS THING OFF MY NECK!
WAS ANYBODY IN IT? NO.
I CAN'T BREATHE! ALTERED, TACHY AND HYPERTENSIVE.
HE'LL NEED A HEAD C.T.
GET THIS THING OFF!
NECK LOOKS CLEAR.
OKAY, REMOVE THE COLLAR.
B.P.'s UP-- 200/100.
OKAY, HOLD STILL.
GET IT OFF.
THAT'S WHAT I'M DOING.
LOOKS LIKE A POSTERIOR HIP DISLOCATION.
ALL RIGHT, TITRATE 200 OF FENTANYL
AND SIX OF VERSED.
I'LL REDUCE IT.
YOU MIGHT WANT TO LOOK AT THIS.
IT'S A GOITER, I THINK-- A BIG ONE.
THAT'S ONE OF VERSED
AND 50 OF FENTANYL.
DON'T TOUCH ME!
KEEP GOING. HE CAN TAKE A LITTLE MORE.
DID YOU NOTICE ANY HAND TREMORS?
NO, HE WAS MOVING AROUND ALL OVER THE PLACE.
THAT'S ANOTHER 50 OF FENTANYL.
YOU THINKING THYROID STORM?
I.V. INDERAL, 100 P.T.U.
Lockhart: HE'S NOT ON DRUGS?
NO, HIS THYROID IS HYPERACTIVE.
I'M GOING TO KILL SOMEONE, I SWEAR.
Haleh: HOW MUCH INDERAL?
Weaver: TITRATE A MILLIGRAM
EVERY TWO MINUTES.
OKAY, HE'S OUT.
YOU EVER REDUCE A HIP BEFORE?
NO.
YOU JUST WANT TO STABILIZE THE PELVIS.
NO, FROM ABOVE-- UP.
YEAH.
YOU GOT IT?
YEAH.
ALL RIGHT, I'M GOING TO PULL UP.
ON THREE. ONE, TWO, THREE.
( yelling )
( screaming )
Lockhart: OH, MY GOD!
Weaver: CARTER!
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
Man: LET ME UP!
CARTER!
PUSH ANOTHER TWO OF VERSED.
OKAY, SOMEBODY GRAB MALUCCI. HE CAN DO THIS.
JOHN... I CAN DO IT.
I SAID I CAN DO IT.
Man: STAY OFF ME.
IS HE OUT THIS TIME?
YEAH, HE'S OUT.
I DON'T WANT YOU TO AGGRAVATE YOUR INJURY.
ARE YOU READY?
YEAH. YOU READY?
THANK YOU, NOW...
MAINTAIN DOWNWARD PRESSURE.
DON'T BE GENTLE.
ONE, TWO, THREE.
OKAY, I GOT IT.
FEMORAL HEAD IS BACK IN PLACE.
GOOD JOB, CARTER.
IT'S JUST LIKE FALLING OFF A HORSE.
Haleh: HEART RATE'S DOWN TO 110.
DR. WEAVER.
GOT A HOT M.I. IN CURTAIN THREE.
YOU GOT IT FROM HERE?
HARD PART'S OVER.
LET'S GET HIM UP TO RADIOLOGY
AND THEN WE'LL GET A POST-REDUCTION FILM LATER.
Lockhart: I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT.
NOW YOU KNOW. IT TAKES A LOT OF COUNTER-TRACTION.
HEY, CAN YOU BABY-SIT HIM IN RADIOLOGY?
Lockhart: SURE.
THANK YOU.
DID I LEAVE HIS CHART IN HERE?
IS IT OVER ON THE MAYO STAND?
UH... NO.
JUST CLEANING UP.
YEAH.
THERE IT IS.
OVER ON THE PULSE OX.
WHAT?
THE CHART.
THANKS.
OH, THIS IS A NEEDLE STICK WAITING TO HAPPEN.
CAN'T BE TOO CAREFUL.
THAT'S RIGHT.
HEY, MAKE SURE THEY DO A HEAD, ABDOMEN AND PELVIS ON THAT GUY.
SURE.
COME FIND ME, HUNT ME DOWN.
LET ME SEE THE FILMS.
OKAY.
THANKS.
YEAH.
WHAT'S HIS LAST PRESSURE?
STABLE-- 110/70.
HOW IS HE?
G.S.W. TO THE GROIN WITH A PULSELESS LEG.
WHAT ABOUT THE ARM?
THROUGH AND THROUGH.
DOES HE HAVE SENSATION IN THE FOOT?
WE'RE LOSING IT.
I'M GOING TO LOSE MY LEG?
NOT IF I HAVE ANYTHING TO SAY ABOUT IT.
SEND BURNS FOR A SHOULDER X RAY.
SUBRAMANIAM NEEDS A DILANTIN LEVEL.
( man yelling )
WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?
MR. GOODWRENCH
IS TUNING UP A PATIENT.
WHAT?
YOU GOT TO HOLD STILL, MAN.
MALUCCI, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
HEY, BOSS.
YOU KNOW WHAT? LET'S TAKE A BREAK, OKAY?
OKAY.
GUY DROVE A SCREW INTO HIS LEG.
YEAH, I CAN SEE THAT.
YOU THINK HE NEEDS A LITTLE MORE LIDOCAINE?
HE WON'T EVEN TAKE AN ASPIRIN.
"IT INTERFERES WITH THE HEALING PROCESS."
YOU TELL HIM HE'S WRONG?
YEAH, THE CHIEF EVEN TRIED TO TALK SENSE INTO HIM.
TELL HIM IF HE WANTS TO BE A MASOCHIST
HE CAN'T SCREAM SO MUCH.
HE'S GOING TO SCARE THE OTHER PATIENTS.
RIGHT, RIGHT. I'LL HAVE HIM
BITE DOWN ON A BULLET OR SOMETHING.
CARTER, I HEAR YOU GOT PUNTED ACROSS THE TRAUMA ROOM.
YEAH? WHO TOLD YOU THAT?
I HEAR EVERYTHING.
HALEH?
YEAH.
( screaming continues )
MALUCCI...
I KNOW. SO'D YOU HURT YOURSELF?
NO, IT JUST KNOCKED THE WIND OUT OF ME
BUT EVERYTHING'S WORKING.
ANOTHER TOUGH GUY.
SOMETHING ROLLING UP?
ROLLING DOWN.
IT'S THE KID FROM THE SHOOTING.
I THOUGHT I MIGHT JUMP IN.
WELL, DON'T JUMP OFF ANY GURNEYS. YES, SIR.
SO, DID YOU CALL ANY OF THOSE PSYCH REFERRALS?
WHAT PATIENT?
THAT LIST I GAVE YOU.
OH, YEAH...
UH-HUH. HOW'D IT GO?
UM, YOU KNOW... OKAY, I GUESS.
IT'S KIND OF TOUGH TO TELL.
YEAH, IT COULD TAKE A WHILE.
Kovac: C.B.C., LYTES, P.T., P.T.T.
TYPE AND CROSS FOR TWO UNITS.
CAN WE GIVE MORE MORPHINE?
ANOTHER FOUR, AND GET A CHEST X RAY AND PELVIS.
YOU WANT ANCEF?
GAVE IT IN THE FIELD.
NICHOLAS, WE ARE JUST GOING TO TAKE A LOOK AT YOU HERE
AND THEN WE'LL BRING YOU UPSTAIRS FOR AN OPERATION, OKAY?
ON MY COUNT: ONE, TWO THREE.
DID THEY CALL MY DAD?
WE'LL TAKE CARE OF IT.
MARY, CALL THE POLICE
THE SCHOOL OR WHOEVER
TO REACH HIS FATHER AT WORK.
IT'S BEEN ALL OVER THE NEWS.
I'M SURE HIS DAD'S LOOKING FOR HIM.
MAKE SURE.
GOT IT.
LUNGS ARE CLEAR.
B.P. 115/75.
PULSE 80.
LEFT INGUINAL ENTRANCE WOUND-- WHERE'S THE EXIT?
COULDN'T FIND ONE FOR THE LEG.
THE BULLET'S STILL INSIDE.
WE SHOULD SEE IT ON THE PELVIC FILM.
NO PULSE BY DOPPLER. LET'S LOOK AT THE BACK.
IT'S THROUGH AND THROUGH, MISSED EVERYTHING.
I ASSESSED IT IN THE FIELD.
Corday: I NEED TO EXAMINE IT MYSELF.
OKAY, LET'S ROLL HIM.
HOLD ON, NICHOLAS.
WE NEED TO MOVE YOU ON YOUR SIDE
SO WE CAN LOOK AT YOUR BACK.
CARTER...?
CARTER.
YEAH, I GOT IT.
Corday: LET'S ROLL.
DID YOU HIT YOUR HEAD OR PASS OUT?
OF COURSE I HIT MY HEAD, IT'S RUGBY.
ANY PAIN IN YOUR CHEST OR YOUR BELLY? NO, NOTHING.
I DIDN'T WANT TO COME IN, BUT THE FELLAS MADE ME.
HEY, HEY, HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
WE NEED TO CUT OFF YOUR SHIRT SO THAT WE CAN EXAMINE YOU.
LIKE HELL YOU DO.
WE JUST GOT THESE JERSEYS.
IF YOU'VE BROKEN YOUR COLLARBONE
IT WILL BE VERY PAINFUL TO LIFT YOUR HANDS ABOVE YOUR HEAD.
PAIN IS RELATIVE, MATE.
( screaming )
WHAT WAS THAT?
( screaming )
SOMEONE WHO DIDN'T WANT US TO CUT OFF HIS SHIRT.
RIGHT.
OKAY, ABBY?
ABBY, GO AHEAD.
YOU ARE BLUE. DID YOU KNOW THAT, MR. TANNER?
YEAH, IT HAPPENS AS SOON AS YOU SWEAT IN THESE NEW JERSEYS.
WELL, MAYBE YOU SHOULD WASH THEM FIRST.
IT'S BRAND-NEW.
OKAY, LET ME KNOW IF YOU FEEL ANY PAIN.
Tanner: UH, YEAH, YEAH.
PROBABLY A MID- SHAFT FRACTURE.
YEAH, IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S BROKEN.
WILL I BE ABLE TO PLAY NEXT WEEK?
I DOUBT IT, BUT WE'RE GOING TO WAIT AND SEE THE X RAY.
BE RIGHT BACK.
ABBY?
GET A CLAVICLE FILM.
RIGHT.
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?
YEAH.
ARE YOU SURE?
DO YOU HAVE A MINUTE?
I DON'T SEE A BULLET.
IT MUST BE HIGHER UP IN THE ABDOMEN.
LET'S SHOOT A K.U.B.
YOU SURE YOUR STOMACH DOESN'T HURT?
IT'S JUST MY LEG.
( alarm beeping )
P.V.C.s ON THE CARDIAC MONITOR.
WHERE'S THE CHEST X RAY?
WHOA, RUN OF FIVE.
BOLUS 60 OF LIDOCAINE.
START ONE PER MINUTE. WHAT IS IT?
JUST AN EXTRA HEARTBEAT.
NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BELIEVE THIS.
Kovac: WHAT?
I FOUND YOUR BULLET.
OH, GOD... IT'S IN HIS HEART.
Kovac: IT TRAVELED THROUGH THE FEMORAL VEIN.
FROM THERE TO THE I.V.C.
INTO THE RIGHT ATRIUM AND VENTRICLE.
Corday: LYDIA, CALL THE O.R.
TELL THEM WE'RE ON OUR WAY UP.
CARTER, MAKE SURE THERE'S AN OPEN CARDIAC ROOM
WITH A PERFUSIONIST STANDING BY.
HE MAY NEED A BYPASS.
I GOT IT.
REVASCULARIZE THE LEG AT THE SAME TIME.
PUT HIM IN RIGHT LATERAL DECUBITUS
REVERSE TRENDELENBERG.
WE DON'T WANT IT EMBOLIZING
TO THE LUNG.
NICHOLAS, WE NEED TO MOVE YOU
ONTO YOUR SIDE AGAIN. WHAT'S WRONG?
REMEMBER I SAID WE WOULD TAKE YOU UPSTAIRS?
YEAH.
WELL, WE ARE GOING NOW.
HEY.
GOOD EFFORT.
18-YEAR-OLD COLLEGE STUDENT MUGGED OUTSIDE HER DORM
STABBED IN THE LOWER ABDOMEN.
HEY, PETER.
200cc's IN THE FOLEY.
TYPE AND CROSS FOR SIX UNITS.
HAVE TWO OF F.F.P. ON HAND.
SHE'S GOING TO FIX YOU UP, OKAY?
HANG IN THERE, BUDDY.
YOU'LL GET MY DAD?
I'LL GET YOUR DAD.
Weaver: 200cc's IN THE FOLEY.
HEY, PETER.
ELIZABETH NEEDS ANOTHER SURGEON.
CONGRATULATIONS, HE'S DEAD.
WHO?
THE MAN HE ABANDONED AT THE SCENE.
I DIDN'T ABANDON HIM.
HE WENT INTO ASYSTOLE
FIVE MINUTES OUTSIDE OF MERCY.
THEY CRACKED HIM, BUT IT WAS TOO LATE.
AND TEN MINUTES WOULD HAVE MADE A DIFFERENCE?
WE WON'T KNOW, WILL WE?
ARE WE TALKING ABOUT THE SHOOTER?
FIRST RULE OF TRIAGE: MOST CRITICAL PATIENT--
THAT'S THE PRIORITY.
THE BOY HAS A BULLET IN HIS HEART.
IT CAN EMBOLIZE AT ANY MINUTE AND HE COULD
LOSE HIS LEG. PETER, GET UPSTAIRS.
YOU DIDN'T MAKE A MEDICAL JUDGMENT
I MADE BOTH! YOU MADE A VALUE JUDGMENT!
UPSTAIRS, PETER!
HE WAS CRASHING
AND YOU DIDN'T CARE, MAN!
I WAS CARING FOR THE BOY!
HEY, HEY, HEY!
THAT'S ENOUGH, THAT'S ENOUGH.
KERRY, I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.
JUST A SEC. I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT GUY.
SETTLE DOWN, STOP SHOUTING. B.P.'s 118/78, PULSE 84.
CAN YOU DESCRIBE THE MAN WHO STABBED YOU?
I-I DON'T KNOW, IT HAPPENED SO FAST.
GET AN ULTRASOUND AND A FETAL MONITOR-- TRAUMA TWO.
CLEO, YOU NEED SOME HELP?
YEAH, I MIGHT.
KERRY, NOW, IT'S IMPORTANT.
YOU SAW THE BOY.
HE NEEDED TO GET TO A TRAUMA CENTER.
CALM DOWN.
GO HELP CLEO.
I'M SUPPOSED TO DELAY CARE
WHILE THEY TAKE THE GUY WHO WAS
SHOOTING AT KIDS AND COPS?
GO HELP CLEO!
Finch: ONE, TWO, THREE!
( groans )
CAN YOU GIVE ME A PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION?
HE WAS, UM, DARKER, MAYBE MEXICAN.
WHAT IS IT?
VICTIM OF ASSAULT.
SINGLE RIGHT STAB WOUND TO THE LOWER RIGHT QUADRANT
FOUR CENTIMETERS OFF THE MIDLINE.
WHAT WAS HE WEARING?
A GRAY SWEATSHIRT, I THINK.
OKAY, A FULL TRAUMA PANEL
AND CHECK A HEMOCUE.
HOW FAR ALONG ARE YOU, MISS?
WHAT?
WHAT MONTH ARE YOU IN?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
YOUR PREGNANCY-- WHEN ARE YOU DUE?
I'M NOT PREGNANT.
YOU LOOK ABOUT EIGHT MONTHS.
GOT THE ULTRASOUND.
BETTER CATH A URINE.
ANYTHING ELSE YOU CAN TELL ME ABOUT THE ATTACK?
NO, HE JUST RAN UP, GRABBED MY PURSE.
WHEN I DIDN'T LET GO
HE STABBED ME.
OKAY, I'LL BE BACK.
FETAL HEART TONES ARE 142.
HEMOCUE'S 13.4.
NO INTRAABDOMINAL BLEED ON MOM.
HOW ABOUT THE BABY?
32-WEEK SIZE, GOOD CARDIAC ACTIVITY.
I'M PREGNANT?
VERY.
OH, MY GOD.
HOLD ON.
WHAT?
THERE.
A BLOOD CLOT. ABRUPTION?
COULD BE.
12 MILLIGRAMS
OF BETAMETHASONE, NOW.
YOU CAN'T TELL MY PARENTS.
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
G-GLORIA... GLORIA MILTON.
GLORIA, THE STAB WOUND HAS DAMAGED THE PLACENTA
CAUSING IT TO BLEED
WHICH WOULD CUT OFF OXYGEN TO YOUR BABY.
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW I HAD A BABY.
WELL, YOU DO.
RIGHT NOW, IT LOOKS OKAY, BUT WE MAY NEED
TO BRING YOU UPSTAIRS FOR A C-SECTION.
YOU MEAN, CUT ME OPEN?
YES, 32 WEEKS IS EARLY
BUT WE ARE GIVING YOU STEROIDS NOW
TO HELP MATURE THE BABY'S LUNGS.
NO, WAIT!
I DON'T WANT AN OPERATION.
YOU MIGHT NOT HAVE A CHOICE.
IF THE ABRUPTION CONTINUES, THE BABY WILL DIE.
BUT NOTHING BAD WILL HAPPEN TO ME, RIGHT?
RIGHT NOW, YOU'RE ALL RIGHT, BUT...
THEN, DON'T.
DON'T CUT ME OPEN.
DON'T DO ANYTHING.
HEY, IT'S DR. TORQUEMADA.
WHO?
NOTHING.
YOU DISCHARGE YOUR SCREAMER YET?
HE WAS PRETTY TOUGH, CARTER.
COULDN'T TELL THAT FROM OUT HERE.
HE TOOK ON THE HURT AND WON, MY FRIEND.
YOU GOT TO RESPECT THAT.
RIGHT, NO BRAIN, NO PAIN.
SOME CULTURES SEE PAIN AS A RIGHT OF PASSAGE.
SOMEBODY CALL A STAFF MEETING?
NO.
HEY, YOU KNOW THE KID MADE IT UP TO THE O.R. OKAY.
CARDIAC TEAM'S IN, BENTON'S WORKING ON THE LEG.
GOOD, THANKS.
AT AGE 13, THE MASAI WARRIORS
OF TANZANIA SCAR THEMSELVES
WITH RED HOT SPEARS AND YANK OUT THEIR BOTTOM FRONT TEETH
WITH NO NOVOCAINE, MIND YOU.
HMM.
HEY, DAVE, WHY DON'T YOU GIVE US A MINUTE?
OH, YEAH...
SURE, SORRY.
CARTER, HOLD ON.
WHAT'S UP?
I THINK YOU KNOW.
AH, LOOK AT THAT.
THE GUY LEAVES, LIKE
A MILLIMETER OF COFFEE IN THE BOTTOM OF THE POT.
ABBY SAW YOU.
SHE SAW ME WHAT?
ABBY.
I SAW YOU INJECT THE FENTANYL
INTO YOUR WRIST.
WHAT?
IN THE TRAUMA ROOM
WHEN YOU SAID YOU WERE CLEANING UP.
I WAS CLEANING UP.
JOHN, I HAVE THE CHART HERE.
YOU DREW UP 200 OF FENTANYL INTO THE SYRINGE.
WHAT IS THIS?
YOU GAVE 150 MIKES TO THE PATIENT.
OKAY...
HOLD ON, SLOW DOWN...
THIS IS A MISTAKE.
AND YOU STOPPED AFTER 3cc's.
YEAH, HALEH GAVE HIM A BUNCH OF VERSED.
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE REST OF THE FENTANYL?
I DON'T KNOW.
MUST HAVE WASTED IT DOWN THE SINK.
SOMEBODY'S SUPPOSED TO WITNESS YOU DOING THAT.
COME ON.
COME ON, WE DO THAT ALL THE TIME.
WE HAVE A PROTOCOL FOR DISPOSAL OF NARCOTICS.
OKAY, FINE, WHATEVER.
THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT I INJECTED IT.
ABBY.
IF YOU THOUGHT YOU SAW SOMETHING
WHY WOULDN'T YOU COME TALK TO ME?
IT'S APPROPRIATE FOR ABBY
TO COME TO US.
NOT WHEN SHE'S WRONG.
CARTER, ARE YOU STILL
ON PAIN MEDICATION?
WHY... WHAT?
FOR YOUR BACK.
YEAH, WHY? A LITTLE, WHY?
HOW MUCH IS A LITTLE?
WELL, THAT'S BETWEEN ME
AND MY DOCTOR, ISN'T IT?
SO, YOU'RE NOT OVERMEDICATING?
YOU THINK I'M A DRUG ADDICT?
HMM?
DO YOU HONESTLY THINK I'M A DRUG ADDICT?
THAT I'M-- WHAT?-- SNEAKING AROUND
INJECTING WHATEVER NARCOTICS I CAN FIND?
YOU GUYS, YOU KNOW ME, THIS IS RIDICULOUS.
SO YOU DENY THIS.
YES, I DENY IT. ABBY...
I, UH, THINK YOU'RE SEEING THINGS.
MAYBE YOU'RE ON DRUGS.
YEAH, I THINK I SAW YOU WITH A NEEDLE ONCE.
Greene: OKAY, CARTER...
IF THIS IS A MISUNDERSTANDING, I APOLOGIZE.
THIS IS A MISUNDERSTANDING.
YOU KNOW WHY WE HAD TO ASK YOU.
CAN I GO BACK TO WORK NOW?
THANK YOU.
AND THANK YOU, ABBY.
I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT.
HE'S LYING, MARK.
I KNOW.
Finch: WE'LL CALL SOMEONE--
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE YOUR PARENTS.
IT CAN BE A FRIEND, A ROOMMATE...
NO, PLEASE, I DON'T WANT TO TALK TO ANYONE.
GLORIA, WE DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME.
IF WE'RE GOING TO SAVE THAT BABY
WE NEED TO OPERATE NOW.
I TOLD YOU, I DON'T WANT IT.
Finch: YOU CAN GIVE THE BABY UP FOR ADOPTION.
YOUR MOM AND DAD WOULD NEVER HAVE TO KNOW.
I DON'T WANT AN OPERATION
SO JUST LEAVE ME ALONE, ALL OF YOU!
OKAY, OKAY... JUST LEAVE ME ALONE, ALL OF YOU...
OKAY, BUT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO KEEP MONITORS ON.
WHY?
FOR YOUR OWN SAFETY.
WE NEED TO KNOW IF YOU START BLEEDING INTERNALLY.
DR. KOVAC.
WHY DON'T YOU SPIN ANOTHER CRIT
AND CYCLE THE DYNAMAP EVERY FIVE MINUTES?
17 YEARS OF PRACTICE, I THOUGHT I'D SEEN EVERYTHING.
ARE YOU TAKING HER UP?
I CAN'T, NOT IF SHE DOESN'T WANT TO.
THE FETAL HEART RATE IS DOWN TO 100.
THE ABRUPTION IS PROGRESSING.
SHE NEEDS A C-SECTION.
I MADE THE CONSEQUENCES VERY CLEAR TO HER.
SHE DOESN'T CARE ABOUT THE CONSEQUENCES.
YOU CAN'T CUT A WOMAN OPEN WITHOUT
HER CONSENT-- THAT'S ASSAULT.
THE BABY WILL DIE. I'M AWARE OF THAT.
AND YOU CAN STAND BY AND WATCH IT HAPPEN?
THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO. YOU CAN OPERATE.
NO, I CAN'T, I'M SORRY.
I'M CALLING ANOTHER O.B.
WHO? I AM THE HEAD OF THE DEPARTMENT.
WE DON'T FORCE C-SECTIONS ON WOMEN IN THIS HOSPITAL.
WHAT IF I CAN
GET HER DECLARED INCOMPETENT?
SHE SEEMED COHERENT TO ME.
I THINK THE STAB WOUND WAS SELF-INFLICTED.
YOU CAN PROVE THAT?
SHE'S DELUSIONAL.
SHE CLAIMS SHE DIDN'T KNOW SHE WAS PREGNANT.
SHE WAS LYING. THAT DOESN'T MEAN SHE'S CRAZY.
WHAT KIND OF WOMAN CARRIES A CHILD FOR EIGHT MONTHS
AND THEN REFUSES TO LET US HELP HER BABY?
CALL PSYCH, GIVE IT A SHOT.
THEN I CAN BRING HER UP?
YEAH, IF THEY SAY YES.
SIDE-BITING CLAMP.
5.0 PROLENE.
IF YOU ASK ME, PETER
WE'RE LUCKY TO HAVE THIS EXTRA TIME.
KOVAC DIDN'T KNOW THE BULLET MOVED TO HIS HEART.
WELL, I'D HAVE TROUBLE PRIORITIZING SOMEONE
WHO SHOOTS AT A PLAYGROUND, TOO.
B.P.'s DOWN-- 80 PALP.
IS THAT YOU?
NO, NO ACTIVE BLEEDING.
FEMORAL VESSELS ARE CLAMPED.
SHIRLEY, RECHECK THE PRESSURE.
STILL FALLING-- 70 PALP.
WHAT IS IT?
DID THE BULLET EMBOLIZE?
FLUOROSCOPE ON.
IT'S STILL IN THE HEART FOR NOW
BUT IT IS MOVING CLOSER
TO THE PULMONARY ARTERY.
WE GOT BLOOD DRIPPING ON THE FLOOR.
SHIRLEY, TAKE THE TOWEL OFF THE SHOULDER.
Shirley: HE'S BLEEDING OUT.
AW, DAMN IT. SALINE SPONGE NOW.
WE NEED SIX MORE UNITS
OF PACKED CELLS UP HERE.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
LOCATING THE SOURCE. I JUST OPENED HIS HEART.
IT WON'T MAKE A DIFFERENCE
IF WE DON'T STOP THE BLEEDING. WAIT, JUST WAIT.
CLAMP THE AURICLE. I CAN'T.
JUST FOR A SECOND-- THE OTHER BULLET
MUST HAVE HIT THE AXILLARY ARTERY.
CLAMP THE SUBCLAVIAN.
I NEED TO GET THIS BULLET OUT.
THEN I'LL DO IT MYSELF. MOVE.
POTTS, LET'S GO.
PRESSURE'S DOWN TO 60.
WHERE'S THAT DAMN BLOOD?!
SHIRLEY, GIVE HIM A SALINE BOLUS.
Benton: AW, COME ON
DAMN IT.
I CAN'T REACH THE ARTERY.
ALL RIGHT
CRANK THE STERNUM OPEN A LITTLE WIDER.
( alarm sounding )
HE'S IN V-FIB! PADDLES, PADDLES!
PETER, GET YOUR HANDS OUT NOW.
HOLD ON, HOLD ON! CLEAR, NOW!
GOT IT, GO!
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO TELL YOU.
BUT I'VE GOT A TOURNAMENT NEXT WEEK.
I CAN'T MISS THE TOURNAMENT.
YOU'VE BROKEN YOUR COLLARBONE, MR. TANNER.
ASIDE FROM SERIOUSLY HURTING YOURSELF
YOU'D BE WORTHLESS ON THE FIELD.
WELL, CAN'T YOU JUST PUT A CAST ON IT OR SOMETHING?
NO, WE SLING IT, AND YOU REST.
WELL, THEN IT CAN'T BE THAT BAD.
YOSH, COULD YOU GET MR. TANNER A SLING?
I'LL HAVE TO CALL CENTRAL.
ALL WE HAVE ARE SMALLS, HE LOOKS LARGE.
HEY, MARK...
YOU BETTER MAKE THAT EXTRA-LARGE, MATE.
I'LL BE BACK TO DISCHARGE YOU.
SO, I TALKED TO LEGAL.
DID YOU USE HIS NAME?
NO, I SPOKE IN HYPOTHETICALS.
BOTTOM LINE-- WE NEED MORE EVIDENCE.
BUT HE CAN'T TREAT PATIENTS, RIGHT?
IT'S ONE ACCUSATION-- WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL.
CAN WE ASK HIM TO DRUG TEST?
HE'S TAKING A PRESCRIBED PAIN MEDICATION--
HE'LL TEST POSITIVE--
AND I'M AFRAID JUST ASKING WILL PUSH HIM FURTHER AWAY.
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?
I WANT TO GET HIM SOME HELP.
LET ME TALK TO HIM AGAIN.
HE MIGHT OPEN UP
IF HE DOESN'T SEE IT AS A THREAT.
MARK, HOW COULD WE LET THIS HAPPEN?
I MEAN, HE SHOWED ALL THE SIGNS.
I KNOW, I KNOW...
BUT IT'S CARTER--
YOUR MIND JUST DOESN'T GO THERE.
Finch: SHE'S A LITTLE CALMER NOW-- THAT'S A GOOD SIGN.
HE'LL TALK HER INTO IT.
HOW DO YOU KNOW?
HE HAS TO.
Marquez: DR. KOVAC? YEAH?
THIS IS VINNY ROSATO, NICHOLAS' FATHER-- THE BOY FROM THE SCHOOL.
OH, YES, YES. HI, MR. ROSATO.
YOUR SON IS IN SURGERY.
HOW BAD IS IT?
HE WAS SHOT IN THE LEG AND THE SHOULDER.
THE SURGEONS SHOULD BE ABLE TO REPAIR THOSE INJURIES
BUT ONE BULLET HAS TRAVELED TO HIS HEART.
HE WAS SHOT IN THE HEART? NO, NO, NO, NO.
THE BULLET WAS SWEPT THROUGH THE VEIN
BUT THERE SHOULDN'T BE ANY MAJOR TISSUE DAMAGE.
CAN THEY GET IT OUT?
WE SHOULD TAKE YOU UPSTAIRS.
THERE YOU CAN GET MORE UPDATED INFORMATION.
I'LL TAKE YOU, MR. ROSATO.
THANK YOU, CLEO.
SHE'S CERTAINLY EMOTIONALLY DISTRAUGHT.
SHE COULD BE CLINICALLY DEPRESSED
AND EVEN HAVE A PERSONALITY DISORDER...
CAN YOU DECLARE HER INCOMPETENT?
BUT SHE'S NOT ACUTELY PSYCHOTIC.
SHE UNDERSTANDS THAT FAILING TO PERFORM THE C-SECTION
COULD ENDANGER HER BABY'S LIFE.
YOU MEAN KILL IT.
SHE'S WILLING TO TAKE THE RISK.
IT'S NOT A RISK-- SHE WANTS IT TO HAPPEN.
SHE STABBED HERSELF TO MAKE IT HAPPEN.
YOU HAVE NO EVIDENCE OF THAT.
AND SHE'S A DANGER TO OTHERS.
WHO? THE BABY.
DOESN'T COUNT-- IT'S STILL HER BODY.
IS THE C-SECTION NECESSARY TO SAVE HER LIFE?
SOMEWHERE THERE HAS TO BE A POINT...
IS IT?
NO.
THEN WITHOUT A COURT ORDER, YOU CAN'T TOUCH HER.
I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR A COURT ORDER.
THAT BABY NEEDS TO COME OUT NOW.
WE CAN TRY TO EXPEDITE IT.
OUR LEGAL DEPARTMENT KNOWS FRIENDLY JUDGES.
YOU'LL HAVE TO WRITE UP AN AFFIDAVIT.
YEAH, WHATEVER.
WHEN DID YOU START SMOKING?
WELL, THAT DEPENDS-- DOES IT MAKE ME A DRUGGIE?
ASK THE SURGEON GENERAL.
I'M WORRIED ABOUT YOU, CARTER.
LOOK, I'M OKAY.
I GOT ANGRY... AND I SHOULDN'T HAVE.
NOT THAT I DIDN'T HAVE A RIGHT.
I'M OKAY.
YOU DIDN'T TALK TO ANYONE, DID YOU?
ANY PSYCHIATRISTS?
NO.
WHY NOT?
'CAUSE I DIDN'T FEEL LIKE TALKING.
LOOK, I'M GOING TO BE FINE
OR I HOPE... I WILL BE.
IT'S BEEN ROUGH.
YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THAT--
I GOT STABBED IN THE BACK TWICE WITH A SIX- INCH BUTCHER KNIFE.
I'M IN A LOT OF PAIN
AND THIS PLACE ISN'T EXACTLY THE EASIEST WORK ENVIRONMENT.
LUCY'S DEAD, WHICH IS PARTLY MY FAULT.
I HAVEN'T SLEPT IN MONTHS.
I HAD TO TAKE MORE PAIN MEDICATION JUST TO FUNCTION.
I DIDN'T STEAL IT.
IT WAS PRESCRIBED TO ME.
DID YOU TAKE THE PRESCRIBED AMOUNT?
YEAH...
MORE OR LESS.
I THINK YOU NEED HELP, CARTER.
LOOK, I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU HAVE TO MAKE THIS YOUR BUSINESS...
BUT PLEASE, PLEASE LET ME DEAL WITH IT.
WHEN ARE YOU OFF?
MIDNIGHT.
OKAY, I DON'T WANT YOU TO SEE ANY MORE PATIENTS.
YOU CAN WORK ON Q.A. CHART REVIEWS.
I CAN SEE PATIENTS.
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH...
CARTER, YOU HAVE TO TRUST ME.
LET ME FIGURE THIS OUT.
WE GOT TO WRITE THIS ONE UP.
INCLUDING THE PART WHERE YOU LIFTED HIM OFF THE TABLE
WHILE I WAS OPENING HIS HEART?
AND CRANKING HIS CHEST WITH ONE HAND
AND SUTURING WITH THE OTHER.
I STILL HAVE A FEW MOVES YOU HAVEN'T SEEN.
OH, YEAH? MM-HMM.
DIBS ON THE BULLET. NO WAY, IT'S MINE.
I WAS THE ONE THAT CALLED IT.
YEAH, BUT I FISHED IT OUT.
YEAH, BUT... HEY, CLEO.
HEY, WE JUST MADE A GREAT SAVE.
I CAN SEE THAT.
YEAH, WE GOT THE BULLET OUT OF THE BOY'S HEART
AND PETER SAVED HIS ARM AND HIS LEG.
THE FATHER'S OUTSIDE RECOVERY, WAITING TO TALK TO SOMEONE.
OH, OKAY. I'LL DO IT.
WHAT'S WRONG?
NOTHING.
HEY.
DR. CARTER, I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO
SO I ASKED DR. GREENE. I'M SORRY.
AND I KNOW I DON'T KNOW YOU VERY WELL
BUT I THINK YOU'RE A GOOD DOCTOR
AND I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH A LOT IN A SHORT TIME
AND I'M SURE I COULDN'T HANDLE IT MYSELF
BUT I FELT I HAD TO TELL THEM.
FEEL BETTER?
BECAUSE I HAVE WORK TO DO.
OKAY, MR. TANNER, HERE'S A PRESCRIPTION.
YOU'LL NEED TO TAKE ONE EVERY SIX HOURS FOR PAIN.
YOU WANT TO ICE, MR. TANNER.
MR. TANNER?
YOSH, GET DR. GREENE, NOW!
WHAT IS IT?
BARELY HAS A PULSE.
LILY, I NEED A B.P.
WHAT DID HE PRESENT WITH?
FRACTURED CLAVICLE
ABSENT BREATH SOUNDS ON THE LEFT.
MUST BE A TENSION PNEUMO.
GET A 14-GAUGE NEEDLE ON AN OPEN SYRINGE.
COME ON, LET'S GO.
Jarvik: B.P.'s 50 PALP.
Lockhart: BETADINE? YEP.
QUICKLY, QUICKLY, GET HIM ON A PULSE OX.
I GOT IT.
OKAY, CHECK A PULSE.
IT'S STRONGER.
HE'LL NEED A CHEST TUBE.
HE JUST HAD A BROKEN COLLARBONE.
NOT ANYMORE.
SATTING AT 95.
OKAY, GIVE ME A TEN BLADE.
CARTER, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
I'M SAVING THIS GUY'S LIFE.
YOU MUST'VE MISSED AN OCCULT RIB FRACTURE.
I'LL TAKE IT FROM HERE.
THE NEEDLE DECOMPRESSED. GIVE ME THE KELLY.
I GOT IT, CARTER.
I'M ALMOST IN.
RIGHT. RIGHT, YOU TAKE IT.
32 FRENCH.
Lockhart: SUCTION'S READY.
Takata: B.P.'s 100/60.
YOU'RE WELCOME.
Greene: I'M IN. HOOK ME UP.
ABBY...
CALL AS SOON AS YOU KNOW.
THANK YOU.
HE DIDN'T SIGN IT?
THEY GOT THERE AT 6:30.
THE JUDGE HAD ALREADY LEFT
BUT THE CLERK IS TRYING TO TRACK HIM DOWN.
CAN'T WE TRY ANOTHER JUDGE?
THEY'RE WORKING ON THAT. I CAN'T WAIT.
YOU CAN'T DO ANYTHING UNTIL WE GET IT.
I'VE WAITED TOO LONG ALREADY.
PROMISE ME THAT YOU WON'T DO ANYTHING.
NO, I'M GOING
TO CHANGE HER MIND.
WE NEED TO DO THIS TONIGHT.
Benton: I DON'T BELIEVE IT.
WELL, IT MAKES SENSE.
HE'S BEEN SO UNPREDICTABLE
I THOUGHT HE MIGHT BE BIPOLAR.
CARTER? COME ON, NO WAY.
HE AS MUCH AS ADMITTED IT TO ME.
PETER, HE'S USING.
I DON'T KNOW FOR HOW LONG
BUT THE BEHAVIOR'S BEEN THERE FOR A WHILE.
BUT IS THIS THE RIGHT WAY TO DO IT?
HE MIGHT FEEL GANGED-UP ON.
IT'S EITHER THIS
OR WE HAVE TO KICK IT TO SOME COMMITTEE.
YOU KNOW, I'D RATHER APPROACH HIM AS A SMALL GROUP
THAT HE KNOWS AND TRUSTS
AND GIVE HIM A CHANCE TO CLEAR IT UP.
AND WHAT ABOUT ROMANO?
NO, WE DON'T WANT TO BRING HIM INTO THIS.
CARTER CAN BE STUBBORN.
HE MIGHT JUST WALK OUT.
WE HAVE TO BE PREPARED FOR THAT.
ALL WE CAN DO IS BE COMPASSIONATE BUT CLEAR.
HE HAS TWO OPTIONS-- THAT'S IT.
ARE YOU WITH US, PETER?
Anspaugh: KERRY?
YOU NEEDED ME?
YEAH, DON.
SO, WHAT'S THE BIG EMERGENCY?
Weaver: WHY DON'T YOU HAVE A SEAT?
FETAL HEART RATE DOWN TO 60.
GET A BABY WARMER IN HERE.
GLORIA, I DON'T HAVE TIME
TO ARGUE ANYMORE.
THIS BABY NEEDS TO COME OUT NOW.
I WANT ANOTHER DOCTOR.
THE PLACENTA'S DETACHING.
YOU COULD HEMORRHAGE TO DEATH.
YOU'RE TRYING TO SCARE ME.
YOU SHOULD BE SCARED.
IF YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT YOUR BABY
AT LEAST THINK OF YOURSELF.
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.
YOU WOULD'VE DONE SOMETHING ALREADY.
HEART RATE'S DOWN TO 50.
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A BOY, GLORIA.
I CAN TELL FROM THE ULTRASOUND.
YOU REALLY WANT TO KILL YOUR SON?
LEAVE ME ALONE.
I WANT ANOTHER DOCTOR!
DOWN TO 40.
OKAY, THAT'S IT.
100 OF KETAMINE, I.V. PUSH.
DR. KOVAC...
YOU HEARD ME.
DRAW UP THE KETAMINE.
YOU CAN'T.
I'M THE ATTENDING!
I'LL TAKE RESPONSIBILITY!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
PLEASE DON'T DO THIS.
I DON'T WANT THE BABY.
C-SECTION TRAY, PREP HER.
I DON'T WANT THE BABY!
HEART RATE'S DOWN TO 20.
PLEASE! PLEASE, HELP ME!
CLEO, SET UP THE SUCTION.
NO, I WON'T.
THEN GET OUT OF THE WAY!
LUKA, SHE DIDN'T CONSENT.
YOU COULD LOSE YOUR LICENSE.
TEN BLADE.
LOST THE HEART RATE.
YOU CAN'T DO THIS.
YOU CAN'T.
IS THAT IT?
CARTER...
GOT A MINUTE?
NO, I'M DONE WITH THESE.
IF YOU GUYS DON'T WANT ME TO SEE PATIENTS TODAY
I'M GOING TO GO HOME.
NOT YET. I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.
IS THIS MY SUSPENSION?
NOT HERE, COME ON.
OH, GOD.
GIVE ME A BREAK.
CARTER, JUST LISTEN.
NO, I TOLD YOU
I AM ON PAINKILLERS FOR MY BACK
BUT I'M FUNCTIONAL.
Anspaugh: DR. CARTER...
YOU WOULD BE WISE TO BE QUIET AND LISTEN.
MY VAN IS PARKED OUTSIDE.
YOU HAVE A TICKET TO ATLANTA.
THERE'S A DRUG REHAB...
THERE'S A DRUG REHAB CENTER THERE
THAT SPECIALIZES IN TREATING
DOCTORS WITH ADDICTION.
WELL, THAT'S GREAT
BUT I'M ON PRESCRIBED PAINKILLERS
AND THAT DOESN'T MAKE ME AN ADDICT
AND I THINK YOU ALL KNOW IT.
I'M NOT FINISHED!
IT'S APPARENT TO ALL OF US THAT YOU HAVE A DRUG PROBLEM.
THEREFORE WE CANNOT ALLOW YOU
TO CONTINUE WORKING HERE
OR ANYWHERE ELSE AS A PHYSICIAN.
SO YOU HAVE TWO CHOICES:
GET IN THE VAN, GO TO THE AIRPORT
CHECK YOURSELF IN
AND WHEN YOU COME BACK
WE WILL SUPPORT YOU IN ANY WAY THAT WE CAN.
OR I'M FIRED?
YEAH.
Anspaugh: EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM CARES ABOUT YOU.
NO ONE IS JUDGING YOU.
YES, YOU ARE.
YOU'VE ALREADY JUDGED ME.
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT I'VE BEEN THROUGH
THESE LAST FEW MONTHS
BUT I'VE BEEN HERE, I'VE SHOWED UP.
I HAVEN'T MADE EXCUSES.
I HAVEN'T COMPLAINED.
THAT'S NOT THE POINT.
NO, THAT IS THE POINT.
CAN ANYBODY TELL ME THAT, UH...
THAT I HAVE ENDANGERED PATIENTS?
I MEAN
CAN ANYBODY HERE SAY THAT MY PERFORMANCE HAS CHANGED?
HMM? THAT I'M SOME KIND OF LIABILITY?
JOHN, YOU PUT A PATIENT
INTO ANAPHYLACTIC SHOCK BY GIVING HER BACTRIM
WHEN SHE TOLD YOU THAT SHE WAS ALLERGIC TO IT.
AND YOU ALMOST KILLED SOMEBODY
BY LEAVING A GUIDE WIRE IN THEIR CHEST.
IS THIS ABOUT MISTAKES?
HMM?
WHO HERE HASN'T MADE A MISTAKE?
HELL, I SAVED YOUR ASS THIS AFTERNOON.
Weaver: JOHN, YOU'VE DEMONSTRATED
COMPULSIVE, DRUG-SEEKING BEHAVIOR.
WHEN? JUST TELL ME WHEN?
I THINK MAINLINING FENTANYL
IN THE TRAUMA ROOM QUALIFIES.
I TOLD YOU I DIDN'T DO THAT.
YOU WANT TO CALL ME A LIAR, FINE--
CALL ME A LIAR-- BUT I DIDN'T DO THAT.
SHOW US YOUR WRISTS.
WHAT?
SHOW US YOUR WRISTS!
ARE WE LOOKING FOR TRACK MARKS?
YEAH.
WELL, THERE, SEE?
HERE, WANT ME TO ROLL UP MY SLEEVES?
TAKE OFF YOUR WATCH.
UH, YOU KNOW... YOU KNOW WHAT?
FORGET THIS, FORGET IT.
THIS IS YOUR ONLY CHANCE, CARTER.
GREAT, I QUIT.
WELL... IS THAT IT?
NO.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
I DON'T NEED THIS.
I'VE NEVER NEEDED THIS.
I WANTED TO BE A DOCTOR.
I WANTED TO HELP PEOPLE
BUT I DON'T NEED THEIR DAMN JOB.
CARTER, YOU DON'T WANT TO DO THIS.
I'M NOT DOING IT, THEY ARE.
CARTER, WAIT! NO.
CARTER, WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?
PISS IT ALL AWAY?
EIGHT YEARS OF YOUR LIFE...
THEY'RE THE ONES HANDING OUT THE ULTIMATUMS.
NO ULTIMATUMS, CARTER!
YOU'RE GETTING IN THAT VAN!
LIKE HELL I AM.
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO DO THIS.
THEY TELL YOU THAT I'M A JUNKIE
AND YOU BELIEVE THEM
AND YOU COME DOWN AND AMBUSH ME!
CARTER, YOU'RE OUT OF CONTROL, MAN!
YOU'RE GETTING INTO THAT VAN.
NO. GET IN THE VAN.
DON'T TOUCH ME. GET IN THE...
DON'T TOUCH ME!
WHERE DOES IT END, MAN, HUH?
THIS WEEK FENTANYL, NEXT WEEK YOU END UP DEAD
OR WORSE, YOU END UP LIKE YOUR COUSIN--
SOME BABBLING GORK IN A NURS...
CARTER, YOU WANT TO FIGHT, THAT'S COOL, MAN
BUT EITHER WAY
YOU'RE GETTING YOUR ASS IN THAT VAN.
( stifled sob )
( crying )
IT'S ALL RIGHT, MAN.
IT'S ALL RIGHT, CARTER.
( groaning loudly )
GOOD JOB, THAT'S GOOD.
HE'S CROWNING.
ALMOST THERE, GLORIA.
ONE MORE PUSH SHOULD DO IT.
READY? AND PUSH.
PUSH...
THE HEAD IS OUT.
OKAY, YOU CAN STOP NOW.
( panting )
CLAMP.
AND CUT.
DOES SHE WANT TO SEE HIM?
WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE HIM, GLORIA?
NO.
YOU WANT ME TO PRONOUNCE HIM?
NO, I'LL DO IT.
TIME OF DEATH: 19:47.
DID HE GET ON THE PLANE?
I DON'T KNOW. PETER HASN'T CALLED.
I WONDER WHAT HE SAID. WHO KNOWS?
I JUST HOPE CARTER GETS ON.
YEAH.
WELL, IT'S NICE TO SEE THE E.R. BRAIN TRUST
IS DILIGENTLY WORKING AFTER HOURS.
HELLO, ROBERT.
I.C.U. IS A ZOO.
SEEMS NICE AND PEACEFUL DOWN HERE.
YEAH, SAME OLD STUFF.
THE FUN NEVER STOPS.
ELIZABETH, WALT NEWMAN
THE INTUSSUSCEPTION UPSTAIRS....
WHAT ABOUT HIM?
TRIED TO REDUCE WITH AN ENEMA.
LEFT A BIG MESS.
WE HAVE TO GO IN.
NOW?
YEAH, IT'S NOT QUITE AS SEXY
AS SNAKING A BULLET OUT OF THE HEART
BUT IT'S A LIFE-SAVING PROCEDURE NONETHELESS.
COMING RIGHT UP.
THANK YOU.
GOOD NIGHT, ALL.
I GUESS I LOST MY RIDE.
THAT'S RIGHT.
THAT'S ALL RIGHT. I'LL TAKE THE EL.
YOU SURE? YEAH, I'LL SEE YOU AT HOME.
I'LL TRY NOT TO WAKE YOU.
GOOD NIGHT, KERRY. GOOD NIGHT.
WANT TO GO GET SOMETHING TO EAT OR SOMETHING?
UH, NO, I THINK I'LL WAIT TO HEAR THAT HE GOT ON.
OKAY, WELL, CALL ME.
OKAY. THANKS.
UH, JUST A MINUTE.
YEAH. DR. WEAVER?
I'VE GOT LEGAL ON LINE THREE.
THEY SAY TO GO AHEAD.
THE JUDGE SIGNED A COURT ORDER.
