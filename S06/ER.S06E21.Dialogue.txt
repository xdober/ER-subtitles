( sighs )
HEY, SWEETIE, GO BACK TO SLEEP, OKAY?
( baby fussing )
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. SHH, SHH, SHH.
WHAT HAPPENED?
DID YOU HAVE A BAD DREAM?
OH, MAN, TESS, YOU'RE KILLING ME.
Haleh: ABBY?
ABBY?
YEAH?
PARAMEDICS ARE BRINGING IN A 22-YEAR-OLD WOMAN.
PELVIC PAIN.
OKAY.
YOU GETTING UP?
YEP.
YOU WANT ME TO WAKE MALUCCI?
NOPE. I'M UP.
I'M SORRY.
HOW LONG WAS I OUT?
ABOUT 20 MINUTES.
THAT MUST BE WHY I FEEL SO REFRESHED.
SO IS THIS A MED STUDENT HAZING THING
OR DO YOU GUYS JUST HATE ME?
YOU'RE YOUNGER THAN US, PRETTIER THAN US
AND SKINNIER THAN US.
WE HATE YOU.
THANKS FOR THE CANDOR.
ANY TIME.
IT'S COLD OUT HERE.
I SHOULD HAVE BROUGHT MY JACKET.
SO GO BACK IN.
WE DON'T NEED YOU TO HELP US PUSH IN A GURNEY.
YOU KNOW, I NEVER THOUGHT
I'D ACTUALLY GET INTO MED SCHOOL.
I WAS JUST LOOKING FOR A CHANGE.
YOU REALLY WANT TO STOP TALKING
BEFORE ONE OF US HITS YOU.
I LOVE YOU.
DO I TELL YOU THAT ENOUGH?
I LOVE YOU.
HEY.
HEY.
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU PLAYED BASKETBALL.
I DON'T.
HELLO, TESS.
DID YOU LET YOUR MAMA SLEEP FOR A CHANGE?
NO, SHE DID NOT.
DID I MAKE YOU ANGRY?
THE FLOWERS ON YOUR BIRTHDAY?
NO, THEY WERE BEAUTIFUL.
THEY WEREN'T ANIMAL CRACKERS, HUH?
YOU HEARD ABOUT THAT, HUH?
ARE YOU STILL IN LOVE WITH HIM?
I DON'T KNOW.
YOU KNOW, I THINK I'M STILL TOO ANGRY WITH HIM
TO THINK STRAIGHT.
I DON'T THINK SO.
WHY?
NO, IT WASN'T LIKE THAT.
DOUG DIDN'T KNOW I WAS PREGNANT WHEN HE LEFT.
HE DIDN'T COME BACK WHEN HE FOUND OUT.
WELL, IT WASN'T ALL DOUG.
I COULD HAVE GONE WITH HIM.
HE ASKED ME TO.
WHY DIDN'T YOU?
PRIDE.
I WANTED HIM TO STAY HERE FOR ME.
I THOUGHT I SHOULD BE AT LEAST THAT IMPORTANT TO HIM.
I STILL LOVE MY WIFE...
BUT IT'S TIME TO GET ON WITH MY LIFE.
HEY.
LET'S HELP YOUR MOMMY GET INSIDE, HUH?
OH, YEAH, HERE WE GO.
LIKE A COWBOY.
Lockhart: SLIDE YOUR BOTTOM DOWN A LITTLE BIT.
GOD, I HATE THESE.
HOW MANY SEXUAL PARTNERS HAVE YOU HAD IN THE PAST YEAR?
ONE.
YOU USE CONDOMS?
MOST OF THE TIME.
DO YOU THINK I'M PREGNANT?
NO.
THE URINE JUST CAME BACK NEGATIVE.
WOW. THAT DIDN'T HURT AT ALL.
WARM WATER. I KNOW A FEW TRICKS.
THOUGHT YOU GUYS KEPT THESE IN THE FREEZER.
Chuny: I GOT TO REMEMBER TO TELL MY GYNECOLOGIST.
CULTURES?
G.C. AND CHLAMYDIA?
YOU THINK I MIGHT HAVE CHLAMYDIA?
WE CHECK EVERYBODY FOR SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES.
THERE'S A PURULENT DISCHARGE AROUND THE CERVIX.
I'VE BEEN WITH MY BOYFRIEND FOR OVER A YEAR.
IF HE GAVE ME SYPHILIS OR SOMETHING
I'M GOING TO KILL HIM.
WE HAVEN'T MADE A DIAGNOSIS YET.
OKAY, SPECULUM'S COMING OUT.
I'M GOING TO MOVE YOUR CERVIX.
TELL ME IF THIS HURTS.
( groans )
SORRY. THERE'S NO OTHER WAY TO DO THAT.
I'LL TRY TO BE GENTLE WHEN I EXAMINE YOUR OVARIES.
OKAY, YOU CAN PUT YOUR LEGS DOWN.
EVERYTHING SEEMS FINE.
IT'S PROBABLY P.I.D.
P.I.D.?
PELVIC INFLAMMATORY DISEASE.
WE'LL GIVE YOU A SHOT OF ANTIBIOTICS, SOME PILLS
AND I'LL THROW IN SOMETHING FOR THE PAIN.
YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND GET DRESSED.
250 OF CEFTRIAXONE I.M., A GRAM OF ZITHROMAX P.O.
AND 550 OF ANAPROX.
HANG ONTO HER FOR 30 MINUTES
MAKE SURE SHE DOESN'T HAVE AN ALLERGIC REACTION.
YOU WANT ME TO GET MALUCCI TO SIGN OFF?
NO. I'VE SEEN MORE OF THESE THAN HE HAS.
LET HIM SLEEP.
I COULD FIND WEAVER.
I WOULDN'T GO THERE.
SHE'S ON HER SECOND DOUBLE THIS WEEK.
BEEN HERE SINCE YESTERDAY MORNING.
WEAVER'S UPSTAIRS WITH A CODE IN C.C.U.
MARK'S COMING BACK TODAY.
THANK GOD.
WEAVER GETS ANY NASTIER
WE'D HAVE TO CALL ANIMAL CONTROL.
AMARA.
AMARA!
FRANK.
WHERE'S AMARA?
SHE GOT OFF AT 7:00.
WHO ARE YOU?
FRANK. PERSONNEL SENT ME DOWN.
YOU HAVE ANY EXPERIENCE, FRANK?
26 YEARS AS A CHICAGO COP.
IN MEDICINE?
I HAD MY KNEE REPLACED ABOUT SIX MONTHS AGO.
THIS IS GREAT.
WHAT THE HELL ARE ALL THOSE PEOPLE DOING OUT THERE?
SICK, I GUESS.
THANKS FOR THAT ASTUTE AND PENETRATING OBSERVATION.
WHY AREN'T THEY BEING SEEN BY DOCTORS?
I DON'T KNOW. I JUST GOT HERE.
NO DOCS.
DR. MALUCCI'S HERE.
Lydia: I THINK HE'S ASLEEP IN EXAM ONE.
WHAT ABOUT KOVAC?
FOREIGN GUY?
HE AND SOME NURSE CAME IN TOGETHER.
THEY TOOK HER BABIES UPSTAIRS TO DAY CARE.
DR. CHEN? DR. CARTER?
SOME PEOPLE CAME IN WHEN I DID.
I THINK THEY'RE IN THE LOUNGE.
IT'S FIVE AFTER 7:00.
IS THERE SOME KIND OF NATURAL DISASTER
THAT I'M UNAWARE OF?
AN EARTHQUAKE OR HALF OF CHICAGO'S
BEEN SWALLOWED UP BY A GIANT SINKHOLE?
COULD YOU STOP YELLING AT ME?
I WAS HERE ON TIME.
MARK GREENE CALLED.
HE SAID HE'D BE IN BEFORE 10:00.
HE HAD TO GO BY THE MORTUARY.
DO YOU STILL HAVE THAT RAPE WHISTLE THING?
GET ON THE PHONE TO EVERYBODY
WHO'S SUPPOSED TO BE HERE
AND SCREAM ON THEIR MACHINES THAT THEY'RE LATE.
AND IF THEY ANSWER, TELL THEM THEY'RE FIRED.
RISE AND SHINE.
PATIENTS ARE WAITING.
( loud whistle )
OW! DR. MALUCCI
IF I DON'T SEE YOU STANDING OVER A SICK PATIENT
LOOKING COMPASSIONATE AND ENGAGED
IN THE NEXT 30 SECONDS
YOU'RE GOING TO SPEND THE NEXT WEEK
DOING NOTHING BUT DISIMPACTIONS AND YEAST INFECTIONS.
I'M UP, CHIEF, I'M UP.
I GET CALLED UPSTAIRS FOR 20 MINUTES
AND THIS WHOLE PLACE GOES TO HELL!
THEY'RE IN THE LOUNGE? UH-HUH.
SHE USES A WHISTLE?
YOU OKAY, JOHN?
YEAH, FINE.
YOU LOOK TERRIBLE.
THANK YOU.
( knocking )
DR. CARTER, WHAT TIME DO YOU HAVE?
FIVE MINUTES AFTER 7:00.
SO WHY ARE YOU TWO STILL IN THE LOUNGE?
A 7:00 SHIFT STARTS AT 7:00.
THAT MEANS YOU GET HERE IN TIME TO BE SEEING PATIENTS AT 7:00.
IS THAT CLEAR? MOVE IT.
COUNTY'S NOT PAYING YOU
TO DRINK COFFEE.
WHOO, SOMEBODY WOKE UP ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE COFFIN.
TODAY OUGHT TO BE A LOT OF FUN.
CHEN, WEAK AND DIZZY IN EXAM TWO
AND ABDOMINAL PAIN IN CURTAIN ONE.
MALUCCI, BLEEDING HEMORRHOIDS
IN EXAM EIGHT. OH, OH, COME ON, CHIEF.
HEMORRHOIDS IN EIGHT AND A BOIL THAT NEEDS LANCING IN FIVE.
OH, TERRIFIC.
I HOPE THAT TONE OF VOICE IS ONE OF UNBRIDLED ENTHUSIASM.
I CAN'T WAIT.
OKAY, AND KEEP AN EYE ON YOUR MED STUDENT, PLEASE, FOR A CHANGE.
WHERE IS ABBY?
P.I.D. DOWN IN SUTURES.
YOU'RE SUPERVISING, MALUCCI?
UH, YEAH.
CARTER, TAKE THE PYELO LADY IN CURTAIN THREE.
KOVAC, RULE OUT M.I., OR A NAIL THROUGH THE HANDS
STILL WAITING IN CHAIRS? BOTH.
EMS IS BRINGING IN A TERMINAL CANCER PATIENT FIVE MINUTES OUT.
OKAY. THAT'LL BE US, CAROL.
LET'S GET CRACKING, PEOPLE.
THERE'S PLENTY MORE WHERE THOSE CAME FROM.
BUTT BOIL AND HEMORRHOIDS.
THIS IS WHAT I WENT TO MEDICAL SCHOOL FOR.
COULD'VE BEEN WORSE.
THERE'S AN EXPLOSIVE DIARRHEA UP THERE.
YOU OKAY, HOSS? YOU DON'T LOOK SO GOOD.
AND SO EVERYBODY KEEPS TELLING ME.
I'M HAVING TROUBLE SLEEPING.
WELL, TRY READING THE ANNALS AT BEDTIME.
THAT-THAT USUALLY PUTS ME RIGHT OUT.
HEY, YOU WANT ME TO DIP A URINE ON OUR PYELO?
YEAH. YEAH, IN FACT I'LL BE RIGHT IN.
I'M JUST GOING TO USE THE BATHROOM.
YOU ON ALL NIGHT?
YEAH, I'M SUPPOSED TO BE OFF TODAY, BUT I SWAPPED WITH CLEO.
SHE'S TAKING MY SATURDAY NIGHT.
I GOT TICKETS FOR RAGE AGAINST THE MACHINE, MY FRIEND.
RIGHT IN THE PIT, BABY. HEY, LUCKY YOU.
I THINK WEAVER'S GOT IT IN FOR ME.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I EVER DID TO FESTUS TO GET HER SO PISSED.
MAYBE IT WAS CALLING HER "FESTUS."
WELL, NEVER TO HER FACE.
( toilet flushing )
( clears throat )
HOW'S IT GOING?
ALL RIGHT.
Man: I COULDN'T WAKE HER UP.
Paramedic: B.P. IS 85/60, TACHY AT 122.
MR. O'BRIEN SAYS SHE HADN'T EATEN ANYTHING IN A COUPLE OF DAYS.
HAS SHE HAD ANY FLUIDS?
LITTLE GINGER ALE YESTERDAY.
SHE WAS OPERATED ON FOR A BOWEL OBSTRUCTION LAST MONTH.
THEY SAID THE TUMOR SPREAD TO HER LIVER AND DIAPHRAGM.
SHE COULD BE ENCEPHALOPATHIC FROM LIVER FAILURE.
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
YOUR WIFE'S LIVER ISN'T REMOVING TOXINS FROM HER BLOOD.
THAT MIGHT EXPLAIN WHY SHE ISN'T WAKING UP.
OKAY, HERE WE GO. GENTLY, NOW.
AND ONE, TWO, THREE.
CAROL, GET A C.B.C., LYTES, LIVER PANEL AND A P.T.
RESPS ARE DOWN TO EIGHT.
MR. O'BRIEN...
YOUR WIFE'S BREATHING IS VERY SLOW.
WE MAY HAVE TO DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT TO INTUBATE.
OH, GOD.
Hathaway: DOES SHE HAVE
A "DO NOT RESUSCITATE" ORDER?
YES. SHE DOESN'T WANT ANY MACHINES.
IS... IS THERE ANY WAY YOU CAN HELP HER?
WE'LL GIVE HER SOME I.V. FLUIDS
AND SEE IF THAT MAKES HER MORE COMFORTABLE.
CAROL, COULD YOU SHOW MR. O'BRIEN AND HIS FAMILY
TO WHERE THEY CAN WAIT, PLEASE.
SURE. LET'S GO SEE IF WE CAN FIND YOU
SOME CRAYONS AND SOME COLORING BOOKS, OKAY?
BYE-BYE, MOMMY.
COME ON, SWEETHEART.
I BROUGHT HER THINGS.
THAT'S MY JOB WHEN WE GO TO THE HOSPITAL.
SHE LIKES TO HAVE HER THINGS WITH HER.
OKAY.
THERE ISN'T ANYWHERE TO PUT THEM IN HERE
SO DO YOU THINK YOU COULD HOLD ON TO THEM FOR A LITTLE LONGER?
ALL RIGHT, SWEETHEART.
ALL RIGHT, HONEY. COME ON.
SO... MRS...
WYATT. WYATT.
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN EXPERIENCING THE BURNING?
A COUPLE OF DAYS.
IT USUALLY CLEARS UP WITH CRANBERRY JUICE.
ANY FEVER?
101.4.
OPEN YOUR MOUTH FOR ME, WOULD YOU, PLEASE?
WEAVER SENT YOU A PRESENT, A WHEEZER.
WOULD YOU EXCUSE ME?
UH... HISTORY OF ASTHMA.
SINCE I WAS A KID.
GET HIM INTO BED.
GIVE HIM FIVE OF ALBUTEROL.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
COULD YOU SIT UP FOR ME, PLEASE?
I WANT YOU TO TELL ME IF THIS HURTS YOU AT ALL.
OH, OH. YEAH.
LOOKS LIKE YOU GOT PYELONEPHRITIS.
IS THAT SERIOUS?
YOU'RE GOING TO BE FINE.
FRANK SAID YOU HAD TWO PATIENTS
MIGHT NEED A HAND.
NO, I GOT THIS.
HAVE YOU EVER BEEN ON STEROIDS?
( wheezes ): LAST YEAR...
FOR A FEW WEEKS.
GIVE HIM 60 OF PREDNISONE.
SET HIM UP FOR CONTINUOUS NEBS
AFTER THIS ONE.
WHEN WAS YOUR LAST PERIOD?
ABOUT A MONTH AGO. YOU SURE?
I'M JUST WAITING ON LABS.
I GOT 'EM. THANKS ANYWAY, THOUGH.
ANY ALLERGIES?
I GET HIVES FROM SULFA.
TELL ME WHAT INHALERS YOU'RE USING.
VENTOLIN AND VANCERIL.
ANY CHANCE YOU'RE PREGNANT?
Man: NO. DEFINITELY NOT.
( laughs )
YOU BELIEVE THIS GUY?
NOT YOU. YOU. ARE YOU PREGNANT?
Mrs. Wyatt: NO, I DON'T THINK SO.
I GOT SCARED WHEN I COULDN'T
WAKE HER UP.
CALLED 911.
Weaver: YOU DID THE RIGHT THING CALLING THE PARAMEDICS.
SHE'S DEHYDRATED.
I TRIED TO GET HER TO DRINK MORE
BUT SH-SHE'S SO WEAK SHE CAN'T SWALLOW.
SHE CAN HARDLY HOLD A STRAW.
LABS ARE BACK.
HER LIVER ISN'T MAKING CLOTTING FACTORS.
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
IT'S A SIGN OF SEVERE LIVER FAILURE.
IS THERE ANYTHING YOU CAN DO?
NO. NOT REALLY.
WE CAN ONLY MAKE HER COMFORTABLE NOW.
SO THIS IS IT?
I THINK PROBABLY SO.
( sighs ): OH, BOY.
WH-WHERE ARE MY GIRLS?
ONE OF THE NURSES IS TAKING CARE OF THEM IN THE LOUNGE.
DO EVERYTHING YOU CAN.
I, I, I DON'T WANT HER TO SUFFER, PLEASE.
OF COURSE NOT.
Lockhart: COME BACK
IF YOU GET A FEVER
OR EXPERIENCE ANY VOMITING
IF YOU WAIT I CAN GET YOU A LIST OF CLINICS
THAT TREAT S.T.D.s.
CAN I WAIT OUTSIDE? I'M DYING FOR A CIGARETTE.
SURE.
BUT YOU'RE GOING TO QUIT REALLY SOON, RIGHT?
ABSOLUTELY.
HEY.
22-YEAR-OLD WITH P.I.D.
GAVE HER 250 OF CEFTRIAXONE
A GRAM OF ZITHROMAX.
NEED YOU TO SIGN THE CHART.
BENTON ON?
KOVAC HAS A HOT BELLY.
NO, BENTON TRADED WITH CORDAY AGAIN.
AND CLEO JUST HAPPENS TO BE OFF, TOO.
SHOCKING.
THIS DATE IS WRONG.
TODAY'S THE 11th, NOT THE TENTH.
NO, I THOUGHT TOMORROW WAS THE 11th.
TODAY'S THE 11th ALL DAY.
OH.
I WAS EXPECTING TODAY TO BE A REALLY AWFUL DAY
BUT IT SEEMS TO BE TURNING OUT OKAY.
VENUS OUT OF ALIGNMENT
WITH THE NINTH MOON OF JUPITER OR SOMETHING?
NO, NOTHING LIKE THAT.
JUPITER ONLY HAS EIGHT MOONS.
YOU WANT ME TO NAME THOSE?
WHO IS THIS GUY?
FRANK. HE'S TEMPING.
LET'S SEE, UH, INNER MOONS
METIS, ADRASTEA, AMALTHEA AND THEBE.
THANK YOU. I BELIEVE YOU.
YOUR HEMORRHOID GUY'S COMPLAINING, DR. DAVE.
SAYS THE SUPPOSITORY ISN'T HELPING.
OUTER MOONS...
IO, EUROPA, GANYMEDE AND CALLISTO.
WHAT'S HE GOING ON ABOUT?
MOONS.
SATURN HAS 18 CONFIRMED MOONS.
DO YOU WANT ME TO NAME THEM?
NO. NO. NO.
YOUR P.I.D. GIRL COLLAPSED IN THE BAY.
WHAT HAPPENED?
SHE'S BREATHING, BUT I CAN BARELY FEEL HER PULSE.
SHE NEEDS A COUPLE OF LARGE-BORE I.V.s
TWO LITERS OF SALINE WIDE OPEN.
CATHY... CATHY, WAKE UP.
MAYBE IT'S AN ECTOPIC.
NO, SHE'S NOT PREGNANT.
B.P. IS 70 PALP.
WHO'S HER DOCTOR?
MALUCCI. I'LL GET HIM.
MIX UP DOPAMINE, GET AN ULTRASOUND
AND LET'S GET HER ON THE GURNEY.
ONE, TWO, THREE...
PRESSURE'S 85 AFTER TWO LITERS.
UP THE DOPAMINE TO 12 MICS.
HEMOCUE, 14.1.
RIGHT ADNEXA NORMAL.
LEFT SIDE...
THERE'S A MASS OF FREE FLUID. DAMN IT.
WHAT IS IT? TUBE-OVARIAN ABSCESS.
THEY GET SEPTIC AND HYPOTENSIVE.
WANT ME TO PAGE G.Y.N.?
NO. DIAL 7614. GIVE ME THE PHONE.
TEMP'S 102.
THAT'S THE INFECTION.
GOT 'EM.
HI. WHO'S THIS?
PAULA, IT'S ABBY LOCKHART.
I NEED TO REDLINE A RUPTURED T.O.A.
SET UP THE O.R. AND PAGE A CHIEF RESIDENT.
WHAT'S THE HELL'S GOING ON?
MY PATIENT HAD A SYNCOPAL EPISODE.
DROPPED HER PRESSURE.
WHAT PATIENT?
ABBY, WHAT PATIENT?
THE P.I.D. I JUST HAD YOU DISCHARGE.
PRESSURE'S UP TO 100.
GOOD, LET'S MOVE HER.
MAYBE IT'S A HEMORRHAGIC OVARIAN CYST.
NO, CRIT'S FINE, MASS IS LOCULATED.
AND SHE'S RUNNING A FEVER.
YOU PICKED UP A LOCULATED MASS? YEAH.
NO KIDDING?
I WOULDN'T KNOW ONE IF IT BIT ME ON THE ASS.
( whistling )
( humming )
YOU HAVEN'T GOTTEN YOUR ANTIBIOTICS YET.
I DON'T THINK SO.
SORRY, I'VE BEEN BUSY.
I WROTE THE ORDER 45 MINUTES AGO.
YEAH, YOU ALSO WROTE FOR A CONTINUOUS ALBUTEROL
AND STEROIDS FOR THIS GUY.
WHEN CAN YOU DO IT?
WHEN I'M FINISHED.
FORGET IT.
I'LL GET YOUR ANTIBIOTICS MYSELF.
( whistling )
HEY, WHEN DID YOU GET BACK?
UH, 20 MINUTES AGO.
STILL HOLDING.
MARK, I'M SO SORRY ABOUT YOUR DAD.
THANKS.
YOU OKAY? I TRIED CALLING YOU A COUPLE TIMES.
LEFT MESSAGES.
I WANTED TO SEE IF I COULD DO ANYTHING.
I APPRECIATE YOU CALLING.
RACHEL ENDED UP COMING UP
AND WE WERE JUST HANGING OUT.
YES.
NO, I'M TRYING TO FIND OUT
HOW TO GET MY FATHER INTO A V.A. CEMETERY.
TRANSFERRING ME TO YET ANOTHER DEPARTMENT.
DIDN'T HE WANT TO BE BURIED NEXT TO YOUR MOTHER?
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE WANTED.
HE SAID HE DIDN'T WANT TO BE ANY TROUBLE.
SUGGESTED I PUT HIM OUT WITH THE TRASH.
OH, THAT WAS HELPFUL.
THREW IN A COUPLE HARANGUES
ABOUT MORTUARY VULTURES, TOO.
ANOTHER RECORDING TELLING ME TO HOLD.
YOU LOOK BEAT.
YEAH, WELL, TESS HASN'T BEEN SLEEPING.
TEETHING, PROBABLY.
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT LUKA SAID.
WELL, HE SEES THEM ENOUGH TO KNOW.
HEY.
DON'T GIVE ME A HARD TIME ABOUT THAT.
I'M STRUGGLING ENOUGH WITH THIS AS IT IS.
I THINK IT'S GREAT.
I WANT YOU TO BE HAPPY.
SO, WHY DO I STILL FEEL SO... UNSURE?
MAYBE YOU'RE JUST AFRAID
OF MAKING YOURSELF VULNERABLE AGAIN.
( sighs )
CAROL, SHE'S WAKING UP.
LET ME KNOW IF YOU NEED ANYTHING.
THANKS.
CONNIE, COULD YOU GET WEAVER FOR ME?
WHERE, WHERE AM I?
YOU'RE IN THE HOSPITAL, SWEETHEART.
NO, I DON'T WANT THAT.
MRS. O'BRIEN
I'M CAROL HATHAWAY.
I'M A NURSE.
WE'RE GIVING YOU FLUID THROUGH AN I.V.
BECAUSE YOU STOPPED DRINKING.
THAT'S WHY YOU DIDN'T WAKE UP TODAY.
I WANT TO GO HOME.
PLEASE.
HONEY, WE NEED TO GET YOU ADMITTED TO THE HOSPITAL
SO YOU CAN FEEL BETTER.
NO, I WANT TO GO HOME.
MRS. O'BRIEN
YOU WANT TO GO HOME?
AND YOU DON'T WANT TO BE PUT ONTO ANY MACHINES?
NO. PLEASE, NO MACHINES.
HONEY, THEY CAN HELP YOU IF WE STAY.
THEY'LL GIVE YOU SOMETHING
FOR THE PAIN. NO.
MR. O'BRIEN...
PLEASE, SWEETHEART. HOME.
MR. O'BRIEN.
CONNIE, PLEASE START HER ON A MORPHINE DRIP.
I THINK THAT WE SHOULD EXPLORE HOME HOSPICE CARE.
AN AMBULANCE COULD TAKE HER HOME
AS LONG AS SOMEONE WAS THERE
TO TAKE CARE OF THE I.V.s
AND THE PAIN MEDICATION.
IT'S CLEARLY WHAT SHE WANTS.
SHE'S DYING. SHE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT SHE WANTS.
I THINK SHE DOES.
SHE WAS VERY CLEAR.
DON'T YOU THINK SHE DESERVES TO DIE
WHERE SHE WANTS TO AT HOME?
WITH HER FAMILY IN HER OWN BED?
GOOD.
WHY DON'T YOU GO TELL HER.
I THINK IT'LL HELP CALM HER DOWN.
CAROL.
OH, GOD, I REALLY DIDN'T NEED THIS TODAY.
WHY DON'T YOU CALL SOCIAL SERVICES.
MAYBE THE HUSBAND'S RIGHT
AND WE COULD ADMIT HER FOR A DAY OR TWO.
NO, CAROL, PLEASE.
PLEASE, NOT TODAY.
SHE WOULD GO HOME EVENTUALLY.
THE WOMAN WANTS TO GO. WE CAN'T KEEP HER HERE.
SHE WANTS TO DIE.
I KNOW IT'S NOT PLEASANT
BUT WE HAVE TO RESPECT HER WISHES.
YES, BUT SHE IS IN EXCRUCIATING PAIN
AND WE DIDN'T EVEN TRY
TO EXPLAIN THE OPTIONS TO HER.
JUST CALL AND SET IT UP.
ALL RIGHT.
THIS SHOULD TAKE ABOUT 20 MINUTES.
AND YOU SHOULD START FEELING BETTER IN A COUPLE OF DAYS.
I'M GOING TO HAVE THE NURSE COME IN
AND GIVE YOU YOUR PRESCRIPTIONS.
HOW ARE YOU FEELING, MR. CAPAZIAN?
THE STEROIDS AND ALBUTEROL HELPING?
YEAH, I FEEL MUCH BETTER.
YEAH, IT'S AMAZING STUFF.
( moaning )
YOU OKAY, MRS. WYATT?
HARD... HARD TO BREATHE.
FEELING ANY CHEST PAINS?
NO.
THIS EVER HAPPENED TO YOU BEFORE?
WHEN I... WHEN I GOT BACTRIM.
BACTRIM?
I TOLD YOU... I WAS ALLERGIC
TO SULFA.
I'M FEELING DIZZY.
OKAY, JUST LIE DOWN, LIE DOWN.
YOU NEED SOME HELP?
NO.
EVERYTHING'S UNDER CONTROL.
HOW YOU DOING, MRS. WYATT?
NOT TOO... NOT TOO GOOD.
WHAT HAPPENED?
NOTHING.
SOMEBODY HIT THE CALL BUTTON.
I DID.
WHAT?
SHE WAS HAVING TROUBLE BREATHING.
WHAT HAPPENED?
UH, SHE WAS COMPLAINING OF HIVES
SO I GAVE HER A SUB-Q EPI.
WHERE'S ALL THE BLOOD COMING FROM?
SHE MUST'VE PULLED OUT HER I.V.
WHY WOULD SHE?
HOW THE HELL WOULD I KNOW THAT?
WHY DON'T YOU START ANOTHER LINE?
JUST, UM, GIVE HER 50 OF BENADRYL
125 OF SOLUMEDROL.
YOU JUST NODDED OFF FOR A SECOND THERE, MRS. WYATT.
ALL RIGHT, GOOD PULSE, GOOD RESPIRATION.
YOU WANT ANY FLUIDS?
YEAH. WHY DON'T YOU RUN A LITER OVER AN HOUR.
( sobbing )
THIS ISN'T GOING TO BE PRETTY.
WHY WAS A CRITICAL PATIENT LIKE THIS
DISCHARGED FROM THE E.R.?
SHE WASN'T CRITICAL AT THE TIME.
HER VITALS WERE STABLE.
I THOUGHT IT WAS P.I.D.
YOU DIDN'T APPRECIATE THE MASS ON EXAM?
NO, I DIDN'T.
WHO WAS SUPERVISING? YOU, DR. MALUCCI?
DIDN'T YOU APPRECIATE ANYTHING?
UH, NO, I DIDN'T.
WHAT WERE YOU WEARING, OVEN MITTS?
ACTUALLY, DR. MALUCCI NEVER HAD A CHANCE
TO EXAMINE THE PATIENT.
I THINK YOU TWO NEED A MOMENT ALONE
TO GET YOUR STORIES STRAIGHT.
HE DIDN'T EXAMINE HER BECAUSE I NEVER CALLED HIM IN.
HAVE YOU RECENTLY AND UNEXPECTEDLY
GRADUATED FROM MEDICAL SCHOOL
MISS LOCKHART?
I THOUGHT MY EXPERIENCE IN OB-GYN QUALIFIED ME.
OBVIOUSLY, I WAS WRONG.
SO YOU SIGNED A DISCHARGE ORDER FOR A PATIENT YOU NEVER SAW
EXAMINED AND TREATED ONLY BY A MEDICAL STUDENT.
THIS WOMAN COULD HAVE DIED, AND YOU'RE YEARS AWAY
FROM HAVING THE EXPERIENCE
TO MAKE THESE DECISIONS.
I KNOW.
OH, GOOD!
I'D LIKE A MOMENT ALONE TO SPEAK WITH DR. MALUCCI.
CAN I... CAN I SAY SOMETHING?
I, UH...
I THINK YOUR CAUSE WOULD BETTER BE SERVED
BY KEEPING YOUR MOUTH SHUT.
WHEN RESIDENTS ARRIVE HERE, WE SIZE YOU UP.
WE HAVE GREAT HOPES FOR YOU, WE WANT YOU TO SUCCEED
BUT GRADUALLY OVER TIME AND THROUGH INTERACTION
WE FORM OPINIONS.
DO YOU WANT TO KNOW THE STAFF'S OPINION OF YOU?
YOU'RE LAZY, SLOPPY
AND YOUR CARELESS ATTITUDE
TOWARDS YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES AS A PHYSICIAN
ENDANGERS PATIENTS' LIVES AS WITNESSED TODAY.
IN OTHER WORDS, NONE OF US THINKS
YOU'RE MUCH OF A DOCTOR.
HE'S ALL OVER THE PLACE
EMOTIONALLY.
DEPRESSED ONE MOMENT, ELATED THE NEXT.
HAVE YOU TALKED TO HIM ABOUT IT?
YEAH, I'VE TRIED TO ASK HIM HOW HE'S DOING
BUT HE ISN'T VERY FORTHCOMING.
DO YOU KNOW IF HE'S SEEING ANYONE?
LET'S GET OUT OF THE HALLWAY.
HALEH, CAN YOU GIVE US A MINUTE?
YOU MEAN A THERAPIST?
I DON'T KNOW.
WELL, DON'T YOU THINK HE SHOULD?
I'M NOT A PSYCHIATRIST.
LOOK, I KNOW YOU THINK IT'S NONE OF MY BUSINESS
BUT I GOT OUT THE D.M.S.-4...
SO NOW YOU'RE A PSYCHIATRIST?
HE HAS VIOLENT MOOD SWINGS.
SOMETIMES HE'S DEEPLY DEPRESSED
OTHER TIMES HE'S MANIC AND ELATED.
SO, YOU'RE SUGGESTING HE'S BIPOLAR?
DO YOU KNOW IF THERE'S A FAMILY HISTORY?
HE WAS ALMOST KILLED.
HE FEELS PARTIALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR LUCY'S DEATH.
MY MOODS WOULD BE ALL OVER THE PLACE, TOO.
BUT ARE YOU SURE THAT'S ALL IT IS?
LOOK, DR. GREENE, I MAY BE WRONG
BUT WHAT IF I'M RIGHT?
IF WE CARE ABOUT HIM, DON'T WE OWE IT TO HIM
TO AT LEAST TRY AND FIND OUT?
HOW'S SHE DOING?
BREATHING'S AGONAL, RESPS ARE SEVEN.
SO SHE'S NOT GETTING ANY BETTER?
NO, I'M AFRAID NOT.
WE'RE DOING WHAT WE CAN TO REHYDRATE HER
AND WE CALLED SOCIAL SERVICES
TO HELP SET UP THE HOSPICE CARE.
WHERE ARE YOUR DAUGHTERS?
DOWN IN THE CAFETERIA.
THEY'RE GETTING SOMETHING TO EAT
WITH SOME OF THE NURSES.
SHE'S BEEN SLEEPING SO PEACEFULLY.
YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN HER TWO YEARS AGO.
SHE WAS SO BEAUTIFUL--
ALIVE AND VIBRANT, ALWAYS LAUGHING.
I WISH I COULD HAVE IT BACK--
THE TIME I MISSED WITH HER...
TRAVELING FOR WORK...
LATE NIGHTS AT THE OFFICE
ALL THE WEEKENDS I WAS PREPPING FOR TRIAL.
BUT WHEN SHE
WAS FIRST DIAGNOSED...
I KEPT WORKING.
CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT?
INSTEAD OF SPENDING TIME WITH HER
I KEPT WORKING.
I'M GOING TO CALL SOCIAL SERVICES AGAIN
FIND OUT WHAT'S KEEPING THEM.
THANKS.
( alarm beeping )
SHE'S NOT BREATHING.
OH, GOD.
SHEILA? SHEILA!
PLEASE, THE GIRLS AREN'T HERE.
I-I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS GOING
TO HAPPEN THIS FAST.
UM, CONNIE, CAN YOU HELP ME?
CAROL, SHE'S A D.N.R.
DOESN'T MEAN WE CAN'T STIMULATE HER BREATHING.
PLEASE, THEY DIDN'T GET TO SAY GOOD-BYE.
YOU WANT ME TO GET WEAVER?
NO, GET KOVAC, TELL HIM I NEED HIM
THEN GO DOWNSTAIRS AND GET THE DAUGHTERS.
COME ON, SHEILA.
SHEILA.
COME ON, SHEILA.
PLEASE, GOD.
NOT YET, PLEASE.
WHAT HAPPENED?
END-STAGE OVARIAN CANCER.
SHE STOPPED BREATHING.
WHY ARE YOU BAGGING HER? LET'S INTUBATE.
WE CAN'T.
SHE'S A D.N.R.
THEN LET HER GO.
HER DAUGHTERS ARE DOWNSTAIRS, AND HAVEN'T SAID GOOD-BYE.
PLEASE...
I THOUGHT WE HAD MORE TIME.
CAN'T WE USE
A NASAL TRUMPET?
THE CHILDREN HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE
TO SAY GOOD-BYE TO THEIR DYING MOTHER.
IT'S NOT A VENTILATOR.
PLEASE?
WHERE ARE THE TRUMPETS?
I'LL GET IT.
OKAY, LET ME IN.
OKAY, SHE'S BREATHING.
WHAT'S GOING ON IN HERE?
PUT IN A NASAL TRUMPET.
SHE'S D.N.R.
WE DIDN'T INTUBATE, JUST OPENED THE AIRWAY.
YOU RESUSCITATED HER.
SHE'S YOUR PATIENT?
YES, DR. KOVAC, SHE'S MY PATIENT.
HER DAUGHTERS WEREN'T HERE
TO SAY GOOD-BYE.
MR. O'BRIEN, WILL YOU EXCUSE US FOR A MOMENT?
YOU DELIBERATELY VIOLATED A PATIENT'S WISHES.
I DID WHAT I THOUGHT BEST UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES.
THAT'S NOT YOUR DECISION TO MAKE.
I'M SORRY, KERRY.
DAMN RIGHT, YOU SHOULD BE.
YOU'RE A SENIOR MEMBER OF THIS STAFF.
WE DISCUSSED THIS EARLIER, WE DISAGREED.
I LISTENED TO YOUR POINT OF VIEW.
I TOLD YOU EXACTLY
WHAT I WANTED DONE.
IF YOU CAN'T RESPECT MY AUTHORITY
YOU SHOULDN'T BE WORKING HERE.
IF SHE CODES AGAIN
I DON'T WANT EITHER OF YOU TO TOUCH HER.
IS THAT CLEAR?
I'M SORRY, LUKA.
LUKA, DON'T JUST WALK...
Greene: HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING DOWN HERE?
I THOUGHT YOU WERE STUCK UPSTAIRS ALL DAY.
I CAME DOWN TO TALK TO KERRY ABOUT MALUCCI.
WHAT'D HE DO THIS TIME?
I'VE JUST BEEN THROUGH THE WHOLE THING WITH HER.
CAN I TELL YOU LATER?
SURE.
DID YOU GET YOUR DAD SORTED OUT?
YEAH.
WHERE IS HE NOW?
HE'S, UH, ACTUALLY IN THE TRUNK OF MY CAR.
I DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO GO HOME.
WHERE'S RACHEL?
JEN'S PARENTS, BEING SPOILED ROTTEN.
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT LIKE THESE BACK.
I DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE KEEPING THEM.
MY FATHER GAVE THEM TO YOU.
YES, AND IT WAS VERY SWEET OF HIM
BUT I JUST THINK IT'S A BAD IDEA.
I REALLY THINK YOU SHOULD GIVE THEM TO RACHEL.
I WAS 12 ONCE, I KNOW WHAT THEY'LL MEAN TO HER.
HEY.
DON'T READ TOO MUCH INTO THIS.
DO I DO THAT?
YOU DO IT REGULARLY.
MARK, WE HAVE AN ACUTE M.I. COMING IN.
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.
WELL, ARE YOU, UH, STILL COMING BY TONIGHT?
WHERE WILL RACHEL SLEEP?
ON THE PULL-OUT IN THE LIVING ROOM.
I DON'T GET OFF TILL 12:00.
I'LL LEAVE THE LIGHT ON.
OKAY.
YOU HAD NO RIGHT TO PUT ME IN THAT POSITION.
I KNOW.
KERRY IS MY SUPERIOR. I WORK HERE.
I DON'T WANT TO LOSE MY JOB.
YOU HAVE EVERY REASON TO BE MAD.
YOU TOOK ADVANTAGE OF OUR PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP.
I DID WHAT I THOUGHT WAS RIGHT.
YEAH, DAMN THE CONSEQUENCES.
IN THIS CASE, YES.
YOU HAD EVERY RIGHT TO MAKE THAT DECISION
FOR YOURSELF, BUT NOT TO MAKE IT FOR ME.
YOU'RE REALLY MAD.
YES, I AM.
WHY ARE YOU SMILING?
I GUESS I THOUGHT I WAS IMMUNE.
WELL, YOU'RE NOT.
LUKA, I'M SORRY.
YES?
REALLY, IT WILL NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN.
GOOD.
AND THANK YOU.
FOR WHAT?
FOR HELPING HER.
YOU'RE WELCOME.
WHAT?
NOTHING.
YOU SURE?
YEAH.
Frank: "GOOD NIGHT, LITTLE HOUSE, AND GOOD NIGHT, MOUSE.
"GOOD NIGHT, COMB.
GOOD NIGHT, BRUSH."
NOW, CAN YOU SEE THE MOUSE?
THERE'S THE MOUSE.
HEY, GUYS.
YOUR MOM'S READY TO SEE YOU NOW.
FRANK, COULD YOU TAKE JENNIFER?
SURE.
WE'LL BE IN IN A MINUTE.
DON'T YOU WANT TO SEE YOUR MOM?
SHE'S GOING TO DIE, ISN'T SHE?
YEAH.
IT'S NOT FAIR.
NO, IT'S NOT.
I DON'T WANT TO ONLY HAVE A DAD.
I WANT TO BE A FAMILY
LIKE WE USED TO BE.
COME ON, WE SHOULD GO.
OKAY?
YOU READY?
HI, MOMMY.
HI, THERE.
HOW'S MY GIRL?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
OH... JUST GATHERING MY THOUGHTS.
HALEH SAID YOU'VE BEEN IN HERE FOR A WHILE.
YEAH, I FINISHED UP SOME SUTURES
AND, UH, IT SEEMED LIKE A QUIET PLACE TO HANG OUT.
IS THAT A PROBLEM?
NO.
SOME OF US ARE JUST A LITTLE WORRIED ABOUT YOU.
WELL, YOU DON'T NEED TO BE.
HOW ARE YOU?
FINE.
YOU SEEING ANYBODY?
THERAPIST...?
NO.
NEED A REFERRAL?
SURE.
YEAH?
'CAUSE NADIO GAVE ME SOME NAMES.
YEAH, THAT'D BE GREAT.
IT MIGHT HELP.
THANKS.
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.
I'LL GO.
OKAY.
DID SOCIAL SERVICES GET YOUR PATIENT HOME?
NO, SHE DIED.
I'M SORRY.
SHE WAS END STAGE.
I'M OFF IN A COUPLE OF HOURS.
WOULD YOU LIKE TO GET SOME DINNER?
SURE.
WE DON'T HAVE TO.
UH, NO, THAT WOULD BE NICE.
EXCUSE ME, MISS HATHAWAY?
I'LL FIND YOU WHEN I GET OFF.
I JUST WANTED TO THANK YOU
FOR EVERYTHING YOU DID FOR US TODAY.
YOU'RE WELCOME.
( sighs )
DO YOU BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE SOUL MATES?
THAT THERE'S ONLY... ONE PERSON WE'RE SUPPOSED TO FIND?
YOU KNOW, ONLY ONE PERSON WE CAN REALLY LOVE?
I DIDN'T USED TO...
BUT I-I-I DO NOW.
SH-SHE WAS THE LOVE OF MY LIFE
AND I'LL NEVER LOVE ANYONE AGAIN
THE WAY I LOVED HER.
CAROL, I NEED SOME MORE ATROPINE.
CAROL!
HEY. HALEH, WHERE'S MARK?
CAROL, IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?
WHERE'S MARK?
EXAM ONE.
OKAY.
MARK, I GOT TO GO.
TELL KERRY I WON'T BE IN TOMORROW, OKAY?
TWINS OKAY?
I'M GOING TO DROP THEM OFF AT MY MOM'S.
WHAT?
I'LL CALL YOU FROM THE PLANE.
HEY, MALIK, WHERE'S KOVAC?
CURTAIN THREE.
LUKA, I CAN'T HAVE DINNER WITH YOU TONIGHT.
OKAY.
I'M SO SORRY.
FOR WHAT?
I HAVE TO GO FIND OUT.
FIND OUT WHAT?
IF HE'S STILL IN LOVE WITH ME...
BECAUSE...
I'M STILL IN LOVE WITH HIM.
I AM.
I'VE BEEN IN LOVE WITH HIM SINCE I WAS 23 YEARS OLD.
HE'S...
HE'S EVERYTHING TO ME.
HE'S MY LIFE.
I FEEL COMPLETE WHEN I'M WITH HIM
AND I FEEL EMPTY WHEN WE'RE APART...
AND...
HE'S THE FATHER OF MY CHILDREN...
AND HE'S MY SOUL MATE.
YOU'LL FIND SOMEONE, LUKA, YOU WILL.
YOU'RE SUCH A WONDERFUL MAN.
SHE'S OUT THERE, I KNOW SHE IS--
SOMEONE WHO'LL LOVE YOU THE WAY YOUR WIFE LOVED YOU.
YOU'LL FIND HER.
YOU WILL.
YOU WILL FIND HER.

DAD, YOU'RE CRAZY.
THIS WAS YOUR GRANDFATHER'S FAVORITE SPOT
IN CHICAGO.
RIGHT HERE.
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.
YEAH.
LISTEN, I HAVE TO GO TO SAN DIEGO NEXT WEEK
TO, UH, BURY HIS ASHES NEXT TO YOUR GRANDMOTHER'S.
CAN YOU COME WITH ME?
SURE.
I-I'D LIKE THAT.
YOU MISS HIM, HUH?
YEAH, I DO.
IT'S KIND OF FUNNY.
WHY?
WELL, WE DIDN'T LIKE EACH OTHER MUCH
FOR A VERY LONG TIME.
HOW COME?
I CAN'T REMEMBER NOW.
PROBABLY MOSTLY MY FAULT.
I HAVE SOMETHING FOR YOU.
THESE WERE YOUR GRANDMOTHER'S.
DO YOU LIKE THEM?
THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL.
CAN I PUT THEM ON YOU?
OKAY, TURN AROUND.
( whispering ): THERE YOU GO.
OKAY, LET ME SEE.
YOU... YOU LOOK LOVELY.
THANK YOU.
PROMISE ME YOU WON'T GROW UP TOO FAST, OKAY?
OKAY.
