YOU SHOULD BE SITTING.
OH, THAT'S OKAY. I'M FINE.
UH...
EXCUSE ME.
WOULD YOU MIND GIVING YOUR SEAT TO THIS LADY?
DIDN'T YOU HEAR ME? I SAID...
I HEARD YOU.
IT'S OKAY, REALLY.
I CAN STAND.
SHE'S PREGNANT.
SO THAT'S, LIKE, MY PROBLEM?
ALL I'M SAYING IS A LITTLE COMMON COURTESY.
SORRY, POPS.
I GOT NONE.
REALLY, IT'S OKAY.
THANK YOU ANYWAY.
OH...

YEAH.
WE'RE JUST LEARNING.
JUST A FEW SCRAPES.

ICE BLENDED DOUBLE MOCHA MOCHA SUPREMO.
ICE BLENDED DOUBLE MOCHA MOCHA SUPREMO.
OH, YOU'RE A LUCKY GIRL
HAVING A BABY.
HOW FAR ALONG ARE YOU?
ALMOST SIX MONTHS.
MY, YOU'RE GETTING BIG.
THANKS. TWINS.
MY NIECE HAD TWINS.
WHAT A DELIVERY THAT WAS.
18 HOURS ON THE FIRST ONE
AND THE SECOND ONE WAS BREECH.
EXCUSE ME, MA'AM?
YOUR ORDER?
JUST REGULAR COFFEE, PLEASE...
FOR HERE.
BUT I'M SURE
YOURS'LL GO JUST FINE.
MAY I?
YOU KNOW, I'D REALLY RATHER YOU NOT.

EVERYONE WANTS TO TOUCH YOU WITHOUT EVEN ASKING.
ALTHOUGH I DID ASK.
REGULAR COFFEE?
THANK YOU.
HI. I'LL HAVE A TALL WARM MILK TO GO, PLEASE.
NASTY.
EXCUSE ME?
WARM MILK IS NASTY.
REALLY?
AND WHAT ARE YOU HAVING?
DOUBLE TALL VANILLA LATTE.
A LATTE.
DIDN'T YOU KNOW THAT COFFEE STUNTS YOUR GROWTH?
THAT IS SO NOT TRUE.
DO YOUR PARENTS LET YOU DRINK IT?
WHO ARE YOU, THE COFFEE POLICE?
TALL WARM MILK?
THANKS.
YOU'RE WELCOME.
DOUBLE TALL VANILLA LATTE.
DOUBLE TALL VANILLA LATTE.
( balloon popping )
MY BALLOON!
HONEY, THAT'S OKAY. WE'VE GOT ANOTHER ONE.
NO! I DON'T WANT BLUE!
BUT THIS ONE IS JUST AS GOOD
NO!
HONEY, DON'T MAKE A SCENE...
I WANT YELLOW!
IT'S A PERFECTLY GOOD BALLOON...
OH, MY GOD, WATCH OUT!
GET OUT OF THE WAY!
( screaming )
MOVE! MOVE!
CAROL, WHAT HAPPENED?
I'M FINE.
MINOR LACERATIONS.
PROBABLE SHOULDER DISLOCATION.
WHERE'S KEVIN? IS HE ALREADY HERE?
DON'T WORRY. I'LL FIND HIM.
WHAT'S OPEN?
I CAN TAKE HER IN TWO.
YOU'RE ALL RIGHT? WHAT A MORNING.
GET A TRAUMA PANEL, TYPE AND CROSS FOR FOUR.
SET ME UP WITH A CHEST TUBE.
PETER, WHAT HAVE WE GOT?
DEEP LACERATIONS TO THE CHEST.
DECREASED BREATH SOUNDS ON THE LEFT.
B.P.'s 100/60. PULSE 120.
HELP ME, WILL YOU!
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
SCREW THAT! I'M HURTING HERE.
I WANT TO SPEAK TO THE MANAGER.
YOU WANTED THE TRAUMA FELLOWSHIP.
YEAH, WELL, BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU WISH FOR.
ALL RIGHT, ONE PERCENT LIDOCAINE.
DID YOU FORGET YOUR TRAUMA GOWN?
I'LL TELL YOU ABOUT IT LATER.
PULSE OX 92 ON FOUR LITERS.

DO YOU HAVE ANY ALLERGIES?
NO, YOU SONS OF BITCHES!
JUST... JUST...
GIVE ME SOMETHING FOR THE PAIN!
ALL RIGHT, TITRATE FOUR OF M.S.
YEAH, YOU WIN, BUD. MORPHINE?
I'VE SEEN YOU SOMEWHERE.
THE COFFEE SHOP.
RIGHT, AND BEFORE THAT, THE EL TRAIN, REMEMBER?
YOU WORK HERE?
SHE'S THE MANAGER.
OH, MAN!
THORASEAL'S READY.
HOOK ME UP. FIRST CRIT 35.
PRESSURE'S DOWN TO 70.
TACHY AT 130.
HE'S BLEEDING OUT.
1,000cc's IN THE THORASEAL.
PUT THE BLOOD ON THE RAPID INFUSER.
GIVE HIM WHAT HE'S LOST
AND KEEP HIM FOUR AHEAD.
DR. CORDAY JUST TOOK ANOTHER CRITICAL
AND I'VE GOT A TON OF LACERATIONS IN CHAIRS.
CLOSE US TO TRAUMA.
TELL THE PATIENTS WAITING WE'LL GET TO THEM.
WHEN'S THAT GUY COMING ON?
WHAT GUY?
I NEED HELP WITH THE ROLLERBLADER.
SHE'S IN A LOT OF PAIN.
FOUR OF MORPHINE, ONE OF VERSED.
YOU KNOW, THE DOC
WHO'S MOONLIGHTING?
DR. KOVAC? YEAH.
CHECK THE BOARD.
SEE WHEN HE'S DUE.
WHAT'S THIS?
THE DRIVER OF THE TRUCK.
CALL TRANSPORT-- GET HIM TO THE MORGUE.
HEY, YOU!
ARE YOU A DOCTOR?
I GOT ONE MOTHER OF A MIGRAINE.
WE'LL GET TO YOU AS SOON AS WE CAN, SIR.
I HAD SOME COMPAZINE AT HOME, SUPPOSITORY.
SHOVED IT RIGHT UP MY ASS
BUT IT AIN'T WORKING.
JUST HAVE A SEAT.
SOMEONE'LL BE WITH YOU IN A MINUTE.
THAT'S WHAT THEY SAID 20 MINUTES AGO.
REALLY, THEY WILL.
UH, DR. WEAVER?
PHONE.
PETER, CAN YOU TAKE IT FROM HERE?
I'M GOING TO GO CHECK ON ELIZABETH.
YEAH, WE'RE JUST WAITING ON AN O.R.
CAROL?
Woman: PLEASE, YOU HAVE TO FIND MY DAUGHTER.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO HER OR WHERE SHE IS.
WHAT'S HER NAME?
MICHELLE, MICHELLE KINNEY.
Lydia: YOU'D BETTER
GET THAT CHECKED FIRST.
Greene: I'LL TAKE A LOOK.
IT'S OKAY, MARK.
WE'RE GOING TO LOOK FOR YOUR DAUGHTER
BUT YOU NEED TO TELL ME WHERE IT HURTS.
ALL OVER MY CHEST AND I CAN'T BREATHE.
ANY PAIN HERE?
NO, NOT REALLY.
PULSE OX IS 88 ON TEN LITERS.
OKAY, POOR TIDAL VOLUME. I'LL INTUBATE.
FOUR OF VERSED, 100 OF SUX.
WE'RE GOING TO GIVE YOU SOME MEDICINE, OKAY?
IT'LL MAKE YOU SLEEPY.
WHEN YOU WAKE UP, A TUBE WILL BE
DOWN YOUR THROAT, HELPING YOU TO BREATHE.
GET X RAY DOWN HERE
AND I NEED AN ULTRASOUND.
DR. CORDAY?
I'M IN.
UH... THIS MAN'S HERE TO SEE YOU.
CHARLES CAMERON
FROM RUSH.
WE WERE TO HAVE COFFEE.
OH, OF COURSE. I'M SORRY.
UM, I'M A BIT INVOLVED HERE.
MIND IF I HANG OUT?
NO, SURE, SURE.
THAT'D BE FINE.
DR. CAMERON, DR. MARK GREENE.
HEY.
OH, UM...
LET ME JUST CHECK THIS PAGE.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
( sighs )
I'D COMPLETELY FORGOTTEN WE'D SET UP A COFFEE
YOU KNOW, FOR AN INTERVIEW, AT RUSH.
AN INTERVIEW FOR...?
CARDIOTHORACIC.
I THOUGHT YOU HAD THAT SEWED UP WITH ROMANO.
YEAH, THAT'S JUST IT-- THE PROSPECT OF ROMANO.
SEEMED LIKE A GOOD IDEA
TO CHECK OUT OTHER OPPORTUNITIES.
YOU'RE RIGHT, PROBABLY IS A GOOD IDEA.
I'M REALLY SORRY, MARK.
I THOUGHT I'D MENTIONED IT.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO TELL ME EVERYTHING.
Hathaway: I'M LOOKING
FOR A LITTLE GIRL, MICHELLE KINNEY.
NOT HERE. WE GOT A ROLLERBLADER.
HIM, TOO-- IS HE ALL RIGHT?
IF THE LAVAGE IS POSITIVE, WE'LL TAKE HIM TO THE O.R.
I'LL TELL THE GIRLFRIEND.
DR. ANSPAUGH, THE PHONE-- SOMETHING ABOUT
REVISIONS ON THE JAYCO REPORT.
THEY CALL IN THE MIDDLE OF A TRAUMA.
MY GOD...
THE MIND-NUMBING, DAY-TO-DAY DETRITUS OF THIS JOB.
YOU OKAY FINISHING THE D.P.L.?
Carter: OH, YEAH.
YES?
YOU GOING TO ASK HIM?
ASK HIM WHAT?
ABOUT THE RUMOR HE'S QUITTING AS CHIEF OF STAFF.
WHAT?
GOING BACK TO GENERAL SURGERY.
I HAVEN'T HEARD ANYTHING.
RESIDENTS ARE OUT OF THE LOOP.
WHY WOULD HE DO THAT?
I DON'T KNOW, SOMETHING ABOUT
THAT DAY-TO-DAY WHATEVER OF HIS JOB.
HOW WE DOING, CARTER?
ALL RIGHT, PREP FOR TRANSFER.
HOW TOUGH IS IT TO GET SOMETHING FOR THE PAIN?
SORRY, SIR, WE'VE GOT A LOT OF CRITICAL CASES RIGHT NOW.
AND THIS JACKHAMMER IN MY HEAD AIN'T CRITICAL?!
WHAT KIND OF BUSH-LEAGUE JOINT IS THIS?!
RANDI, CAN YOU KILL THAT GUY WITH THE MIGRAINE?
HAPPILY.
DID A LITTLE GIRL COME IN
WITH THIS ACCIDENT--
ABOUT FIVE, MICHELLE KINNEY?
I DIDN'T SEE HER.
MIGHT BE ON HER WAY.
JUST GOT OFF THE M.I.C.N.
SENDING TWO MORE CRITICALS, TEN MINUTES OUT.
WH-WH-WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU TO CLOSE US TO TRAUMA.
I KNOW, BUT DR. ROMANO TOLD ME TO KEEP US OPEN.
AND WHO ASKED HIM?
I DID.
IT'S A PROTOCOL THING.
HE IS ACTING CHIEF.
GET BACK ON THE RADIO
AND TELL THEM TO GO TO MERCY.
YOU, GET ROMANO ON THE PHONE.
WHAT THE HELL'S HE THINKING?
WE'RE BARELY KEEPING OUR HEAD ABOVE WATER AS IT IS.
PRESSURE'S DOWN TO 75.
ANOTHER TWO UNITS OF O-NEG.
NO BLEEDING IN THE BELLY.
CHEST X RAY SHOWS
DIFFUSE BILATERAL PULMONARY CONTUSIONS.
NO SIGNS OF BLOOD LOSS.
Lydia: PULSE OX FALLING TO 80 ON 100% OXYGEN.
LET ME CHECK THE HEART.
COULD BE A TENSION PNEUMO.
14-GAUGE NEEDLE ON AN OPEN SYRINGE.
CRIT'S 42.
THERE'S NO PERICARDIAL EFFUSION.
NO TENSION PNEUMO.
BUT SHE'S GOT A TERRIBLE EJECTION FRACTION.
MUST BE CARDIAC CONTUSION.
SHE'S BRUISED THE HELL OUT OF HER HEART AND LUNGS.
ANOTHER FIVE OF PEEP.
Lydia: PRESSURE'S DOWN TO 60.
OKAY, MIX UP DOPAMINE.
SHOULD I BOOK AN O.R.?
NOTHING TO REPAIR SURGICALLY.
RIGHT YOU ARE, UNFORTUNATELY.
WHAT DO WE DO?
PRESSURE AND VENTILATORY SUPPORT--
THAT'S ABOUT IT.
WAIT, HANG ON A MINUTE.
RUN UP TO THE O.R.
WE'LL JUST TRY SOMETHING.
BRING DOWN A BYPASS MACHINE.
CUTDOWN TRAY NOW.
PREPARE THE GROIN FOR BYPASS CATHETERS.
PUT HER ON BYPASS?
THAT'S PRETTY GUTSY.
IT'S WORTH A TRY.
BETADINE AND STERILE DRAPES.
WELL, WELL, WELL, THIS IS QUITE A CONVENTION.
CHARLIE CAMERON, STILL AT RUSH?
HAVEN'T SEEN YOU IN...
OH, GOSH, WHO REALLY CARES?
SO, WHAT BRINGS YOU TO OUR FAIR LAND?
COFFEE, ACTUALLY.
I HEAR IT'S THE BEST IN THE CITY.
MM-HMM.
WELL...
THERE'S ENOUGH COOKS IN THIS BROTH, I THINK.
I'LL GO
AND INSPIRE
THE REST OF THE TROOPS.
O.R.'s READY.
PULSE OX, 99 ON 100%.
PETER, WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?
PENETRATING CHEST TRAUMA.
1,000cc's OUT OF THE CHEST.
TAKING HIM UP TO THE O.R.
UH-HUH, AND HIS PRESSURE?
IT'S 95 SYSTOLIC, UP FROM 70.
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, KEEP HIM HERE.
WHAT? Romano: CHECK ANOTHER PRESSURE.
Benton: HE NEEDS A THORACOTOMY.
A LITER OF INITIAL CHEST TUBE OUTPUT INDICATES THE O.R.
HOW MUCH BLOOD HAVE YOU GIVEN HIM?
Takata: TWO UNITS OF O-NEG WITH 1,000cc's AUTOTRANSFUSED.
WHAT'S IN THE THORASEAL? 100cc's.
Romano: UH-HUH, AND THE PRESSURE?
105/74.
OKAY, SO, PETER, LET'S REVIEW.
HIS PRESSURE'S IN THE NORMAL RANGE
AND HIS CHEST TUBE OUTPUT HAS SLOWED TO A TRICKLE.
NOW, AS A SURGEON, I WOULD SAY HE'S FORMING A CLOT.
AS A TRAUMA FELLOW, YOU WOULD DISAGREE? MAYBE.
"MAYBE." IF WE CRACK A KID'S CHEST OPEN
EXPOSE HIM TO GENERAL ANESTHESIA
AND PUT HIM THROUGH A PAINFUL SIX-MONTH RECOVERY
LET'S MAKE SURE "MAYBE"
IS NOT A PART OF THE EQUATION, OKAY?
THANKS.
HI.
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
MY NAME IS LUKA.
IT'S A FUNNY NAME, ISN'T IT?
CAN YOU SAY IT?
"LUKA"?
DOES YOUR ARM HURT?
I'M A DOCTOR, YOU KNOW.
I WANT MY MOM.
I CAN HELP YOU.
SO, YOU GOING TO COME OUT NOW?
IN THAT CASE, DO YOU MIND IF I... COME IN?
I'D BE HAPPY TO MENTOR YOU.
I'M FLATTERED YOU'D ASK.
HELLO?! I'M DYING HERE! ANY YOU PUTZES CARE?!
I REALLY WANT TO FOCUS ON EMERGENCY MEDICINE
FOR MY FINAL YEAR
AND I THINK IT WOULD BE GREAT
TO HAVE THAT ONE PERSON TO GO TO.
I KNOW THAT IT WILL.
I HAD A GREAT MENTOR WHEN I WAS IN SCHOOL.
WHAT'S IT TAKE, HUH?!
I GOT TO GET RUN OVER BY SOME TRUCK?!
I FINISHED WITH THE D.P.L. AND SENT THE HEAD TRAUMA TO C.T.
THANKS, CARTER.
HAVE YOU HEARD RUMORS ABOUT DR. ANSPAUGH
QUITTING AS CHIEF OF STAFF?
NO. WHERE'D YOU HEAR THAT?
I HEARD A SCARIER ONE.
NOT ONLY IS DR. ANSPAUGH QUITTING,
DR. ROMANO IS THE FRONT-RUNNER
TO TAKE HIS PLACE.
ROMANO AS CHIEF OF STAFF?
CARTER, TAKE THIS SHEET.
WHOA!
YOU OKAY?
Greene: STAND BY WITH PADDLES.
MALIK, GET READY FOR CHEST COMPRESSIONS.
I'M IN. HOOK THIS UP.
MARK, WHEN YOU HAVE A MOMENT
I NEED TO SPEAK WITH YOU.
IT'S IMPORTANT. SURE.
RUN OF NINE.
CHARGE 200.
START THE BYPASS.
SHE'S STABILIZING.
ALL RIGHT.
WANT TO GO IN HERE?
WEAN OFF THE DOPAMINE.
ANSPAUGH'S STEPPING DOWN
AND ROMANO'S IN LINE FOR THE CHIEF'S JOB.
I DON'T BUY IT.
ANSPAUGH WOULD'VE SAID SOMETHING TO US.
YOU'RE RIGHT.
IT'S PROBABLY JUST CRAZY RUMOR MILL STUFF.
I'LL GO UPSTAIRS AND TALK TO HIM ABOUT IT.
GOOD IDEA.
( alarm blaring )
WHOA... IT'S THE FIRE ALARM!
PLEASE, TELL ME THIS IS A DRILL!
OKAY, YOU BETTER PREP YOUR PATIENT FOR TRANSFER.
I'LL COVER THE MAIN HALL!
WHERE IS IT?
I DON'T KNOW, BUT START MOVING PATIENTS TO THE AMBULANCE BAY.
ARE WE GOING TO HAVE TO MOVE?
MAYBE. BE READY TO.
DR. BENTON, HE'S CRASHING.
CARTER! GET IN HERE NOW!
HE'S IN FIB!
CHARGE TO 200.
ANOTHER 1500 IN THE THORASEAL.
EPI'S ONBOARD.
THORACOTOMY TRAY. LET'S MOVE! COME ON!
SCALPEL.
LET'S SQUEEZE IN THE BLOOD.
SHOULD I PAGE ROMANO?
NO TIME.
RIB SPREADER.
OH, MAN, THERE'S LIKE A GALLON OF BLOOD IN HERE.
COME ON, COME ON, MORE SUCTION!
PLEASE DON'T RUN!
EVERYBODY MOVE SLOWLY AND QUIETLY TO THE AMBULANCE BAY.
CURTAIN THREE'S CLEAR. WHERE THE HELL'S THE FIRE?
I DON'T KNOW. CAN YOU CLEAR EXAM ONE AND TWO?
GOT FOUR UNITS OF TYPE-SPECIFIC.
HANG IT NOW.
CARTER, COME TAKE OVER INTERNAL COMPRESSION.
SPONGE STICK!
INTERNAL PADDLES ARE READY.
WHAT ABOUT THE FIRE ALARM?
LET'S SAVE HIS LIFE FIRST.
ALL RIGHT, I GOT IT.
THERE, THERE, YOU SEE IT? THERE'S A BLEEDER.
ALL RIGHT, 2-0 VICRYL AND PICKUPS-- LET'S MOVE.
YOU WANT F.F.P.?
YEAH, TWO UNITS, AND A GRAM OF ANCEF.
STILL IN FIB!
GOOD FEMORAL PULSE WITH COMPRESSIONS.
ALL RIGHT, MAMMARY ARTERY IS LIGATED.
ALL RIGHT, PADDLES. CHARGE TO 20.
EVERYBODY CLEAR.
DON'T TELL ME YOU JUST PULLED THAT THING.
MAYBE NOW I'LL GET SOME ATTENTION.
Marquez: WHOA, RANDI!
HE PULLED THE ALARM.
HEY, CHUNY, GET BACK TO ADMIT.
LET PEOPLE KNOW IT'S A FALSE ALARM.
AND YOU, STAY DOWN!
YOU MOVE AND I'LL LET HER AT YOU.
EVERYONE, PLEASE LISTEN! IT'S A FALSE ALARM.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO EVACUATE.
THERE IS NO FIRE.
POR FAVOR, NO SE TIENE QUE SALIR.
NO HAY NADA DE FUEGO.
CALMESE, POR FAVOR.
STAY CALM IN YOUR SEATS.
THANK YOU!
NORMAL SINUS!
B.P.'s 80 SYSTOLIC.
HIS OXYGEN TANK IS ALMOST EMPTY.
ALL RIGHT, CARTER, GO GET ANOTHER CYLINDER.
LET'S MOVE.
ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY
LET'S GET HIM UP TO THE O.R.
HERE WE GO. GIVE IT HERE.
CARTER, LET'S MOVE!
GO, PEOPLE, GO!
WATCH IT!
HAVE YOU EVER BEEN TO THE CIRCUS?
YOU HAVE NOW.
YOU CAN RENT ONE AND TAKE THEM TO A PARTY...
JUDY, MALIK, FIND MR. MIGRAINE.
GIVE HIM SIX MILLIGRAMS OF IMITREX.
THEN CALL THE POLICE AND REPORT HIM
FOR INCITING A RIOT.
EXCUSE ME, WHICH ROOM IS OPEN FOR MICHELLE?
OH, THANKS, DR. KOVAC
BUT WE HAVE A PEDIATRIC RESIDENT WHO CAN TAKE HER.
UH, CLEO'S NOT ON YET.
YEAH, SHE'S DUE SHORTLY.
WHY DON'T YOU SET HER UP IN THE PEDES ROOM?
SHE WANTS TO SEE HER MOTHER.
THAT'S PROBABLY NOT A GOOD IDEA.
HER MOTHER'S BEEN INTUBATED AND SHE'S ON BYPASS.
OKAY.
WE GOT PLENTY OF OTHER PATIENTS WHO NEED SUTURING.
SURE. ANYTHING IS FINE.
I'LL CHECK THE BOARD. GOOD.
KERRY, I'M GOING TO RUN UPSTAIRS
AND TRY AND FIND ANSPAUGH.
DR. WEAVER, THE FILMS ARE BACK ON THE ROLLERBLADER.
LET'S TAKE A LOOK.
DR. WEAVER, ONE LAST CRITICAL COMING IN FROM THAT ACCIDENT--
SOMEONE THEY FOUND UNDER THE RUBBLE.
NOW? AT THE BACK DOOR.
OKAY, LUCY, FOLLOW ME ON THIS.
CAROL, WE GOT ANOTHER LAC FOR DR. KOVAC.
GOT IT.
Weaver: I'LL GIVE YOU TWO OR THREE ARTICLES A WEEK AND THEN WE CAN
GO OVER THEM.
OKAY, GREAT.
GOOD MORNING.
CLEO, I'M GLAD YOU'RE HERE.
I GOT A PEDES CASE, AND IF YOU NEED HELP, PULL CARTER IN.
SOUNDS GOOD.
DR. FINCH, DO YOU ALWAYS JOG TO WORK?
IT'S ONLY FOUR MILES.
KIND OF MAKES YOU WANT TO DISLIKE HER, DOESN'T IT?
THIS LITTLE TUBE RIGHT HERE?
THAT'S FOR GIVING YOUR MOTHER MEDICINE
TO MAKE HER BETTER.
AND WHAT'S THAT?
THAT'S A MACHINE
THAT HELPS HER TAKE REALLY DEEP BREATHS.
YOU KNOW, LIKE WHEN YOU GO UNDERWATER TO SWIM?
YOU TAKE DEEP BREATHS.
Little girl: I'M NOT ALLOWED TO GO UNDERWATER.
I HAVE TO WEAR WINGS.
WINGS?
IT'S KIND OF LIKE A LIFE JACKET FOR LITTLE KIDS.
OH.
THEY GAVE MY MOMMY SOME MEDICINE TO MAKE HER SLEEPY.
THAT'S RIGHT, BUT SHE'S GOING TO WAKE UP SOON
AND BE VERY HAPPY TO SEE YOU.
NOW WE'RE GOING TO GO FIND THE DOCTOR
WHO WILL LOOK AT YOUR ARM.
OKAY?
OKAY.
Romano: WELL, PETER, I AM IMPRESSED.
WE'RE TEN MINUTES IN ON THIS TEENAGER OF YOURS
AND YOU HAVEN'T EVEN SO MUCH AS WHISPERED AN "I TOLD YOU SO."
OKAY, WE'RE READY FOR THE SECOND CHEST TUBE.
LET'S MAKE IT A 36-FRENCH.
ALL RIGHT, ANOTHER LITER OF IRRIGANT.
OH, UH, BY THE WAY, YOU'VE MET CHARLES CAMERON, HAVEN'T YOU?
FROM RUSH?
UH, YEAH.
HE HAS PRIVILEGES HERE.
UH, CARDIOTHORACIC, I THINK.
YEAH, THAT'S THE, UH, SAME SPECIALTY
THAT ELIZABETH-- DR. CORDAY-- IS STILL INTERESTED IN, ISN'T IT?
I WOULDN'T KNOW.
OH. SHE HASN'T MENTIONED MUCH
ABOUT THAT, HUH, LATELY, HUH?
( sighing ): NO, NOT TO ME.
NOT TO ME, EITHER-- WHICH IS ODD
CONSIDERING I SPONSORED HER.
WHY DO YOU THINK THAT IS?
I ONLY ASK YOU THAT BECAUSE I KNOW YOU TWO
HAVE BEEN... FRIENDS.
YOU OBVIOUSLY KNOW HER MUCH BETTER THAN I DO.
DR. ROMANO, DO ALL OUR CONVERSATIONS
HAVE TO REVOLVE AROUND ELIZABETH?
WELL, DR. BENTON, PERHAPS YOU AND I
DON'T NEED TO HAVE ANY FURTHER CONVERSATIONS...
AT ALL.
OKAY!
SOME NUMBER TWO DEXON, PLEASE
FOR THE INTERCOSTALS, AND, UH, THEN I WILL CLOSE.
IS THIS THE LAST ONE FROM THE ACCIDENT?
YEP. PROBABLY RUPTURED HER AORTA.
BLED OUT IN A MATTER OF SECONDS.
GOT A MINUTE?
SURE.
LUCY, GOOD WORK.
WHY DON'T YOU STAY AND WRITE THE DEATH NOTE?
OKAY.
I'LL GET THE DEATH KIT.
I TALKED TO ANSPAUGH, AND THE RUMORS ARE TRUE.
BOTH OF THEM?
HE'S QUITTING AND ROMANO'S GOING TO BE CHIEF OF STAFF?
DONALD IS LEAVING THE JOB
BUT HE'S GOING TO STAY AT COUNTY AND DO GENERAL SURGERY.
HE WANTS TO SPEND MORE TIME WITH HIS DAUGHTER.
AND ROMANO TAKING OVER IS A POSSIBILITY.
WE'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING, MARK.
I GOT ANSPAUGH TO AGREE TO A MEETING.
WE CAN WEIGH IN ON WHETHER WE THINK ROMANO IS THE RIGHT GUY.
YEAH, HE'S NOT THE RIGHT ONE FOR US.
I DON'T GET THIS-- YOU'RE A REGULAR OLD DOCTOR.
YES.
BUT YOU DON'T WORK HERE.
NO, I DO WORK HERE, BUT ONLY WHEN THEY NEED ME.
I AM, UH, WHAT THEY CALL A "MOONLIGHTER."
BECAUSE YOU'RE FROM ANOTHER COUNTRY?
NO, BECAUSE I ONLY WORK HERE
FROM TIME TO TIME, WHEN THEY NEED ME.
AND THEY NEEDED YOU TODAY BECAUSE OF THE TRUCK CRASH.
NO. UH...
I'M HERE BECAUSE ONE OF THE REGULAR DOCTORS
IS ON VACATION.
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
YOU WERE ONE OF THE REGULAR DOCTORS.
I JUST... FILL IN WHEN SOMEONE ELSE IS ABSENT.
OH, I GET IT.
YOU'RE LIKE A SUB.
A SUB.
YEAH, YEAH.
I'M A SUB.
WHAT KIND OF ACCENT
IS THAT?
THICK.
NEIGHBORS HEARD THE BABY CRYING FOR A COUPLE DAYS.
FINALLY CALLED US AND THE POLICE.
BROKE THE DOOR DOWN, WHAT A MESS.
ANY KNOWN RELATIVES?
NEIGHBORS DIDN'T THINK SO.
MOM LIVED ALONE WITH THE BOY.
THEY ALSO THINK SHE HAS AIDS.
WHAT ABOUT THE BABY?
DON'T KNOW.
NEED ANYTHING ELSE?
NO. WE GOT IT FROM HERE.
SHE'S TACHYCARDIC
PULSE THREADY, SEVERE HYPOXIA.
POSSIBLY FULMINANT PNEUMOCYSTIS.
LET'S GET HER STARTED ON
BACTRIM, THREE AMPS I.V., 125 MIGS OF SOLUMEDROL.
MAKE SURE THE O2 IS CRANKED UP TO TEN LITERS.
SHE'S NOT MOVING MUCH AIR.
YOU WANT A C.B.C. AND LYTES?
YEAH. CHECK WITH THE I.C.U., WE NEED TO GET A BED.
HOW'S THAT BABY?
( baby crying softly )
TEMP'S 102.
HE'S DEHYDRATED.
I'VE STARTED AN I.V.
RALES BILATERALLY AT THE BASES.
I THINK THERE'S A CONSOLIDATION ON THE RIGHT.
I NEED A COMPLETE BLOOD COUNT, CHEM SEVEN AND A CHEST FILM.
I'LL GET THE PORTABLE.
PNEUMONIA?
IT'D BE A PRETTY SAFE BET.
WANT AN HIV TEST?
CAN'T TEST THE BABY WITHOUT THE MOM'S PERMISSION
WHICH IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.
MORE THAN LIKELY, HE'S POSITIVE.
YEAH, BUT WE HAVE TO WAIT FOR
THE MOM OR THE COURT TO ALLOW THE TEST.
FOR NOW, WE'LL START HIM ON CEFUROX.
HIV-POSITIVE, GOES AHEAD AND HAS A BABY
NO SIGN OF ANY SUPPORT.
WHAT WAS SHE THINKING?
DR. FINCH, THE FILMS ARE BACK
ON THAT LITTLE GIRL WITH THE BROKEN ARM.
THANKS, HALEH.
I'LL FILL OUT THE LABS ON THEM BOTH.
OKAY. THANKS.
HALEH? CAN YOU GET THESE TO THE LAB FOR ME?
OH, SURE.
THANKS.
WAIT A SECOND. I FORGOT.
ADD AN HIV TEST TO, UH, THIS ONE.
CARLOS ORTEGA?
RIGHT.
NO PROBLEM.
OKAY.
AM I INTERRUPTING?
NO, NOT AT ALL.
PLEASE COME IN.
WE ARE DONE HERE.
HEY, VANILLA LATTE, I WONDERED ABOUT YOU.
GLAD TO SEE YOU'RE DOING OKAY.
YOU'RE THE WARM MILK LADY.
THAT'S RIGHT. I WORK HERE.
YEAH, BUT DOES THAT MEAN YOU REALLY WORK HERE?
DON'T ANSWER THAT ONE.
YOU'RE DONE.
FEEL OKAY?
I FEEL FINE.
ON YOUR WAY.
THANKS.
OH, MY GOD.
THAT BOY IS RELENTLESS.
I THINK HIS PARENTS FEEL QUITE EXHAUSTED, HUH?
( chuckling )
IT SEEMS LIKE I NEED SOME STITCHES.
I ALREADY IRRIGATED.
I HEARD YOU WERE AT THAT COFFEE PLACE
WHEN THE ACCIDENT HAPPENED.
I HAD JUST LEFT TEN SECONDS EARLIER.
I DON'T EVEN WANT TO THINK ABOUT IT.
STILL, IT SEEMS LIKE MOST PEOPLE CAME OUT OF IT OKAY...
MIRACULOUSLY.
SO, YOU TOOK THAT LITTLE GIRL IN TO SEE HER MOTHER?
YES.
EVEN THOUGH DR. WEAVER AND DR. GREENE
DIDN'T THINK IT WAS SUCH A GOOD IDEA?
MOSTLY, THEY'RE NOT SURE IF I'M A GOOD DOCTOR.
WHY DO YOU SAY THAT?
THIS IS, LIKE, THE SECOND OR THIRD TIME
YOU'VE WORKED HERE, ISN'T IT?
YEAH. ENOUGH TIME FOR THEM TO STOP CALLING ME "DR. KOVAC."
YOU KNOW, WHEN PEOPLE ARE NOT SURE
THEY TEND TO KEEP THINGS MORE FORMAL.
I HOPE YOU WILL BE HAPPY ENOUGH
WITH YOUR SUTURES TO CALL ME LUKA.
I TOOK THE GIRL IN
BECAUSE CHILDREN NEED TO KNOW, NEED TO SEE.
EVEN IF WHAT THEY SEE IS NOT GOOD
IT'S STILL BETTER THAN BEING IN THE DARK, YOU KNOW...
HAVING... THAT KIND OF FEAR.
YOU SOUND EXPERIENCED IN THESE THINGS.
WELL, WHATEVER EXPERIENCE I HAVE WITH CHILDREN
DIDN'T HELP ME WITH THAT BOY.
CAROL, ARE YOU BUSY?
NO. I JUST GOT SUTURED.
THEIR MOTHER WAS IN THAT ACCIDENT.
MASSIVE BLUNT CHEST TRAUMA.
THEY'D LIKE TO VIEW THE BODY.
SURE. NO PROBLEM.
THANK YOU.
HELLO.
I'M CAROL HATHAWAY.
I'M VERY SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS.
THANK YOU.
WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO SHOW YOU IN?
YES, PLEASE.
Wright: DID I HEAR ROMANO'S GOING TO BE CHIEF OF STAFF?
YOU ARE GOING TO FIGHT THIS, AREN'T YOU?
DR. WEAVER AND I HAVE AN APPOINTMENT WITH DR. ANSPAUGH
AND WE'RE SUPPOSED TO GIVE OUR HONEST OPINION.
SO YOU ARE GOING TO FIGHT IT. GOOD.
THAT BABY BOY, CARLOS ORTEGA
NEEDS TO GET UP TO PEDES.
I CAN GO WITH HIM.
WE ALREADY SENT THE MOM TO THE I.C.U.
I'LL CALL YOU.
GREAT.
AWFULLY LONG CUP OF COFFEE.
OH, HE GOT PAGED.
HAD TO LEAVE, BUT HE CAME BACK
FOR A BITE OF LUNCH.
HOW'D IT GO?
WHOEVER KNOWS WITH INTERVIEWS.
I'M LATE FOR A LAP CHOLE.
I'LL TAKE THAT BACK PAIN IN FOUR.
SURE.
DO YOU NEED SOME HELP?
I THINK I'M OKAY, BUT THANKS ANYWAY.
MARK, I DON'T MEAN TO PRY.
HOW ARE THINGS GOING WITH YOU AND ELIZABETH?
OKAY.
YOU GUYS ARE STILL GOING OUT, RIGHT?
A LITTLE.
AM I GOING TO HAVE TO BEG FOR INFORMATION HERE?
CAROL, I'D HATE TO SEE YOU BEG.
EVERYTHING'S OKAY, REALLY.
I MAY HAVE BACKED OFF A LITTLE BIT.
WHICH MEANS SHE'S BACKED OFF.
THESE THINGS JUST KIND OF HAVE A LIFE
OF THEIR OWN, DON'T THEY?
IF THAT'S NOT ENOUGH
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO BEG.
M.V.A., B.M.W. VERSUS A TOYOTA.
VITALS ARE STABLE, BUT SHE'S COMPLAINING
OF SOME NECK PAIN.
SHE DIDN'T WANT TO COME TO THE E.R.
BUT SHE'S BEEN VERY POLITE ABOUT IT.
WHAT'S M.V.A.?
MOTOR VEHICLE ACCIDENT.
IT WAS A LITTLE FENDER BENDER.
I'M COMPLETELY FINE.
"ELAINE NICHOLS"?
YES.
I'M JOHN CARTER.
DOUGLAS' COUSIN.
OH, YES. OF COURSE.
SEEING AS WE'RE PRACTICALLY RELATED, COULD I
GET OUT OF THIS?
SURE.
YOU JUST HAVE TO HOLD STILL
WHILE I EXAMINE YOU.
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE OLD ENOUGH TO BE A DOCTOR.
OH, YEAH.
NO MIDLINE TENDERNESS?
TURN YOUR HEAD TO THE RIGHT.
TO THE LEFT.
FULL RANGE OF MOTION.
YOU'RE CLEAR.
CAN I GET UP?
MM-HMM.
IS THAT BETTER?
I GUESS YOU ARE OLD ENOUGH.
YES. SO, NO NECK PAIN?
IT'S MY LITTLE FINGER, ACTUALLY.
I THINK I JAMMED IT
WHEN THEY STUCK ME ON THIS GURNEY.
LET'S JUST CHECK THEM ALL OUT.
( gasps )
YEAH, THAT'S THE ONE.
HAND X RAY?
I'LL GO ORDER IT.
THANK YOU, CHUNY.
YEAH, WE'LL WANT TO MAKE SURE
THAT YOU DON'T HAVE A FRACTURE.
OH, I GUESS I'LL BE STAYING HERE FOR A WHILE.
IF THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
SO, I CAN'T REALLY THINK HOW LONG IT'S BEEN.
LET'S SEE. I DIVORCED YOUR COUSIN, DOUGLAS
THREE YEARS AGO.
I REMEMBER YOUR WEDDING.
I DIDN'T REALIZE YOU WERE THERE.
OH, YEAH.
DOUGLAS LOOKED NERVOUS AS HELL
AND YOU LOOKED INCREDIBLE...LY CALM.
( laughs )
WELL, THAT MUST HAVE BEEN THE CALM BEFORE THE STORM
GIVEN THE WAY OUR MARRIAGE WENT.
ANCIENT HISTORY.
BUT DIVORCE SUITS ME.
SO I'M ASSUMING YOU WERE DRIVING
THE B.M.W. AND NOT THE TOYOTA.
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK THAT?
Boulet: X RAY CONFIRMS PNEUMONIA.
PNEUMOCYSTIS?
LOOKS MORE BACTERIAL.
IS THIS THE ORTEGA BABY?
YES. I'M JEANIE BOULET.
I BROUGHT HIM UP FROM THE E.R.
ROBERT MARTIN, D.C.F.S.
ANY IDEA HOW LONG HE'LL BE HERE?
NEEDS I.V. ANTIBIOTICS.
AT LEAST A FEW DAYS.
THE LONGER THE BETTER.
GIVE US TIME TO FIND A PLACEMENT.
ANY IDEAS WHERE?
NO. CASES LIKE THIS ARE A MESS.
MOTHER WITH AIDS ON HER DEATHBED.
PROBABLY HAVE TO GO TO COURT
TO GET THE BOY TESTED.
AND IF HE'S POSITIVE?
THEN WE NEED A FOSTER FAMILY
WILLING TO TAKE ON A CHILD OF COLOR WITH HIV.
NOT EXACTLY A DIME A DOZEN.
YOU'RE LATE.
DR. BENTON, CHRIS HUNEGS, FAMILY COUNSELING SERVICES.
HEY. HOW YOU DOING?
FINE, THANKS.
BUT YOU ARE A LITTLE LATE, SO LET ME GET RIGHT TO IT.
THIS, AS YOU KNOW, IS A MEDIATION
IN WHICH WE HOPE TO NEGOTIATE AN AGREEMENT
REGARDING THE CUSTODY OF YOUR SON.
NOW, I AM NOT A JUDGE
AND THIS SESSION IS CONFIDENTIAL.
NOTHING SAID HERE CAN BE USED AS EVIDENCE IN COURT, OKAY?
WHY CAN'T WE JUST GO TO COURT
AND PRESENT THE EVIDENCE?
BECAUSE THIS IS
A COURT-ORDERED MEDIATION.
YEAH, 'CAUSE YOU
GOT A RESTRAINING ORDER
PUT OUT ON ME AN ROGER.
NO. A RESTRAINING ORDER ON YOU AND ROGER
TAKING MY SON TO GERMANY WHERE HE HAS NO CHANCE
OF DEVELOPING HIS LANGUAGE SKILLS.
MY SON IS DEAF.
OUR SON, AND HE KNOWS IT.
IT'S ON THE FORM. AND REESE WOULD DO
JUST FINE WITH AN AMERICAN SIGN LANGUAGE TUTOR.
MISS SIMMONS...
AND YOU HAVE THIS TUTOR? I WILL.
AND WHAT IF YOU DON'T? GERMAN SIGN LANGUAGE?
THE PURPOSE OF THIS SESSION
IS TO TALK ABOUT YOUR CHILD'S NEEDS.
HE NEEDS TO BE WITH HIS MOTHER.
AND HE NEEDS TO BE WITH HIS FATHER.
AND SO, WHAT?
YOU GOING TO BRING HIM HOME FROM WORK
AND PUT HIM TO BED ON THE SOFA IN YOUR LIVING ROOM?
HE DOESN'T HAVE HIS OWN ROOM?
OF COURSE, HE DOES.
SINCE WHEN?
WE MOVED IN WITH MY SISTER
JACKIE AND HER FAMILY
SO THAT REESE COULD HAVE
MUCH MORE OF A COMPLETE FAMILY UNIT.
AS HE WOULD WITH US.
HIS BLACK MOTHER
AND HIS BLACK STEPFATHER.
WHAT THE HELL IS THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?
WHAT IS THAT, CARLA?
BECAUSE I WENT OUT WITH A WHITE WOMAN?
I'M JUST SAYING...
YOU KNOW WHAT? I CAN'T DO THIS.
OH, YES, YOU CAN.
COURT ORDERED, REMEMBER?
SO, WHAT'S THE PROGNOSIS?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN HERE?
YOU SAID SOMETHING ABOUT WAITING IN CHAIRS, SO I FOUND ONE.
HUH. I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WE HAD A CHAIR.
IS THAT ME?
YES.
NOT MUCH OF A MEASURE OF A HAND, IS IT?
I MEAN, OF WHAT A HAND CAN DO.
LOOKS TOO SPINDLY.
WELL, AT LEAST THERE'S NO FRACTURE.
WELL, THAT'S GOOD.
SO I'M FREE TO GO?
I'LL WALK YOU OUT.
DO YOU NEED A RIDE?
I'LL BE TAKING CABS UNTIL MY CAR GETS FIXED.
GUESS I WAS HOPING FOR SOMETHING
A LITTLE MORE DRAMATIC, YOU KNOW?
A CAST OR A SLING MAYBE.
SOMETHING TO GET ME OUT OF THIS FUND-RAISER
I PROMISED I'D GO TO TONIGHT.
OH, DON'T TELL ME.
THAT'S RIGHT. THE CARTER FAMILY FOUNDATION.
EVEN IN DIVORCE, GAMMA STILL HAS HER CLAWS INTO YOU?
HOW COME WE NEVER SEE YOU
AT ANY OF THESE FUNCTIONS?
OH, I MANAGED TO GET MYSELF DECLAWED.
SO WHAT IS IT TONIGHT, "SAVE THE LAKE"?
NO, NO. IT'S "CHILDREN'S LIBRARY"?
CLOSE. "CHILDREN'S ART LEAGUE."
AH. RANDI, CAN YOU CALL A CAB
FOR MS. NICHOLS?
SURE.
SO, THANK YOU, DR. CARTER.
YOU ARE WELCOME. YOU'RE WELCOME.
AND I'LL BE THINKING OF YOU.
YOU WILL?
I MEAN, TONIGHT, MIXING IT UP
WITH THE REST OF THE CARTERS.
WELL, THEN, I'LL JUST HAVE TO BE THINKING OF YOU.
IT'S NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN, ELAINE.
JOHN.
Greene: I HOPE ANSPAUGH HASN'T ALREADY MADE UP HIS MIND.
IF ENOUGH OF US COME OUT AGAINST ROMANO
HOW CAN ANSPAUGH GO AHEAD AND APPOINT HIM?
WILL THERE BE ENOUGH OF US?
IF IT COMES DOWN TO JUST YOU AND ME?
DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT THAT.
Flint: DR. ROMANO CERTAINLY IS CAPABLE
AND WE ALL KNOW HE'S EAGER, IF NOT DOWNRIGHT BREATHLESS
SO I CAN FIND NO COMPELLING REASON NOT TO SUPPORT HIM.
ALTHOUGH, AS HEAD OF RADIOLOGY, I WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT
THAT NO HEAD OF RADIOLOGY HAS EVER BEEN CONSIDERED
FOR CHIEF OF STAFF.
BUT PERHAPS THAT'S A TOPIC FOR SOME OTHER DAY.
NO WONDER IT TAKES SO LONG TO GET OUR X RAYS READ.
THANK YOU, STEVE. CARL?
UP IN PSYCH, WE PRETTY MUCH RUN OUR OWN SHIP.
IT WAS SIX MONTHS BEFORE I KNEW DONALD HAD TAKEN OVER.
SEEING AS THIS WON'T ROCK MY WORLD MUCH
DR. ROMANO'S FINE WITH ME.
HOW ABOUT YOU, JACK?
GOD KNOWS, I'M LIKE YOU, DONALD.
I'VE HAD MORE THAN ENOUGH BUREAUCRATIC CRAP.
I ALREADY HAD ONE HEART ATTACK.
YOU FIND A GUY WILLING TO TAKE THAT STUFF ON
I SAY "BOOK HIM."
MARK?
WELL, I HATE TO BE THE VOICE OF DISSENT
AND IT CERTAINLY ISN'T PERSONAL, ROBERT
BUT I FEEL I SHOULD BE HONEST.
Romano: ABSOLUTELY.
AS ACTING CHIEF OF THE E.R.
FOR THE PAST FEW MONTHS, DR. ROMANO HAS...
WELL, THERE HASN'T BEEN A GREAT DEAL OF SUPPORT.
HIS MANAGEMENT STYLE IS
I GUESS, ABRUPT AND SEVERAL MEMBERS OF OUR STAFF HAVE...
WELL, THEY'VE EVEN FOUND IT OFFENSIVE.
GO ON.
WELL, I GUESS I'D HAVE TO SAY
THAT I'D WORRY IF DR. ROMANO WAS TO HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY
OF THE ENTIRE STAFF AND FACULTY.
WELL, THANK YOU, MARK, FOR YOUR CANDOR.
KERRY?
AS ANY OF US WHO'VE BEEN IN MANAGEMENT KNOW
IT'S NEVER EASY TAKING OVER ANOTHER DEPARTMENT
AND I AGREE WITH MARK.
THERE HAVE BEEN A FEW BUMPS IN THE ROAD.
BUT I FEEL
DR. ROMANO HAS SUCCEEDED IN STABILIZING THE SITUATION
AND IS NOW PROVIDING SOME GENUINE LEADERSHIP
IN THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT.
Anspaugh: SO YOU WOULD
SUPPORT HIM AS CHIEF OF STAFF?
I THINK IT'S ONLY FAIR
THAT WE GIVE HIM ALL THE SUPPORT THAT WE CAN.
MARK, I'M SORRY, BUT IT WAS OBVIOUS
ROMANO WAS GOING TO GET THE JOB.
IMAGINE HOW HE WOULD HAVE TAKEN IT OUT ON THE E.R.
IF WE'D BOTH GONE AGAINST HIM.
IT JUST SEEMED POLITICALLY SMART.
OH, I SEE. SO YOU WERE BEING SMART
WHILE I WAS STICKING OUT MY NECK BEING STUPID AND HONEST.
OH, STOP IT.
I WAS ONLY TRYING TO PROTECT THE DEPARTMENT.
YOU MAY BELIEVE THAT, KERRY, BUT DON'T ASK ME TO.
DONALD THROWS THE DULLEST MEETINGS, DOESN'T HE?
NO WONDER WE ALL NEED A LITTLE KICK OF JAVA, HUH?
SO... WHAT DO YOU THINK?
GAVE IT THE OLD
REMINGTON HEAVE-HO. NEW LOOK FOR A NEW JOB, HUH?
OH, WELL, BACK TO WORK.
OH, UH, ACTUALLY, KERRY, IF YOU HAVE A MINUTE
THERE'S SOMETHING I WANT
TO DISCUSS WITH YOU.
HEY, DID I LEAVE MY SUNGLASSES AT YOUR PLACE?
I'M NOT SURE. WE CAN CHECK LATER.
RIGHT. SO, GO ON, WHAT ELSE DID THE GUY SAY?
JUST THAT CARLOS WOULD BE REALLY HARD TO PLACE.
'CAUSE HE'S HIV-POSITIVE?
RIGHT. AND I COULDN'T EVEN TELL THEM THAT,
I ORDERED THE TEST ILLEGALLY.
WELL, YOU'D THINK THEY'D WANT TO KNOW
GET HIM ON THE COCKTAIL. I KNOW.
ANYWAY, I REALIZED THAT I WOULD BE
THE PERFECT FOSTER MOM FOR THIS BABY.
I CERTAINLY KNOW HOW TO DEAL WITH THE HIV.
I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT, YOU'D BE PERFECT.
THAT'S NOT WHAT THE D.C.F.S. WOULD SAY
CONSIDERING MY HIV STATUS.
YOU'RE HEALTHIER THAN HALF
THE PEOPLE IN THE CITY. BUT I'M NOT MARRIED.
YET. ( laughs softly )
SO THERE'S NO SUPPORT SYSTEM IN PLACE FOR THE BABY
IF SOMETHING WERE TO HAPPEN TO ME.
YET.
REGGIE...
WE CAN TAKE CARE
OF THAT PART RIGHT NOW.
I'VE GOT TO GET TO WORK.
LET'S JUST DRINK OUR COFFEE.
UH-UH. NOT TILL YOU SAY YOU'LL MARRY ME.
REGGIE. YOU DON'T THINK I'M SERIOUS?
I THINK YOU'RE CRAZY.
UH-HUH.
JEANIE BOULET...
WILL YOU MARRY ME?
( applause ) GOOD JOB, DR. GREENE.
WHAT'S THIS ALL ABOUT?
THE MEETING WITH ANSPAUGH.
HOW'D YOU KNOW?
NURSES KNOW EVERYTHING.
YOU FOUGHT THE GOOD FIGHT. THANKS, MARK.
AND A LOT OF GOOD IT DID US.
MARK, DO YOU HAVE A MINUTE?
I WAS JUST HEADING OUT.
YOU KNOW, UM...
I THINK THAT WE SHOULD TALK.
I THINK WE'VE TALKED ENOUGH, KERRY.
THIS IS ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE.
30-YEAR-OLD WOMAN, PREGNANT, M.V.A.
T-BONED WITH PASSENGER SPACE INTRUSION.
NO PULSE IN THE FIELD.
TRAUMATIC FULL ARREST, TEN MINUTES DOWN.
COULDN'T INTUBATE.
ONE, TWO, THREE.
OH, MAN, SHE'S GOT TO BE FULL-TERM.
CHUNY, TAKE OVER C.P.R.
I NEED AN 8-0 E.T. TUBE NOW.
SEE IF YOU CAN GIVE ME SOME SUCTION.
LET'S SET ME UP FOR A CENTRAL LINE.
FOUR UNITS OF O-NEG, AND SOMEBODY GET
ANOTHER DOCTOR IN HERE.
HALEH, CHECK FOR FETAL HEART TONES.
ASYSTOLE ON THE MONITOR.
OKAY, CRICOID PRESSURE.
I.V.'s BLOWN.
ALL RIGHT. I'M IN.
GIVE ME AN AMP OF EPI TO PUT DOWN THE TUBE.
BLOOD'S HERE. HANG IT ON THE RAPID INFUSER.
I'LL THROW IN A SUBCLAVIAN.
SHE LOOKS FULL-TERM. FETAL HEART RATE?
CAN'T FIND IT.
WHAT'S THE MOTHER'S RHYTHM?
Carter: ASYSTOLE. WE GOT HER INTUBATED.
ANY PULSE IN THE FIELD? PARAMEDIC SAID NO.
DOWN TIME?
WE'RE AT 12 MINUTES.
THE MOTHER IS DEAD. WAIT. WHY CAN'T WE...
NO. SHE'S DEAD. WE NEED TO GET THE BABY OUT NOW.
Carter: SUBCLAVIAN'S IN. GO WITH THE O-NEG.
CHUNY, KEEP UP COMPRESSIONS.
I NEED RETRACTORS.
GET A BABY WARMER IN HERE.
OPEN A CUTDOWN TRAY.
NO TIME.
GIVE ME YOUR HANDS.
HOLD IT OPEN LIKE THIS.
ALL RIGHT. CHEST TUBE, 32-FRENCH.
I'M OPENING THE UTERUS.
BANDAGE SCISSORS.
BULB SUCTION.
IT'S A GIRL.
COME HERE, SWEETIE.
SHH, SHH, SHH... ( crying )
SHH... SHH... THAT'S A GIRL. ( stops crying )
OKAY, OKAY.
Carter: LEFT CHEST IS FULL OF BLOOD.
FULL COMPRESSIONS.
STILL ASYSTOLE.
OKAY, LET'S RALLY HERE. ONE MORE TRY.
GIVE ME AN AMP OF ATROPINE AND REPEAT THE EPI.
CHUNY, CONTINUE C.P.R.
HEART RATE IS 140.
SHE'S PINKING UP.
ONE MINUTE APGAR, EIGHT OUT OF TEN.
SHE'S GOING TO BE FINE. YEAH.
ALL RIGHT, THAT'S IT. THAT'S IT.
TIME OF DEATH: 1848.
( sighs )
HOW'S HE DOING?
BETTER. FEVER'S DOWN.
HE'S RESTING COMFORTABLY.
GOOD.
ANY NEWS ON HIS MOM?
NO. I DIDN'T REALIZE SHE HAS END-STAGE AIDS.
YEP.
( gurgling )
LET'S GET HIM STARTED ON THE TRIPLE COCKTAIL.
HE HASN'T EVEN BEEN TESTED YET.
GET HIM STARTED, KIT.
OKAY.
Carter: HEY, RANDI
HAVE YOU SEEN DR. GREENE?
HE LEFT FOR THE NIGHT.
HEY, CARTER, DO YOU HAVE A MINUTE?
YEAH. SURE. HEY, SO I HEARD IT WAS TRUE
THE RUMOR ABOUT ROMANO BECOMING CHIEF.
YES, AND ALTHOUGH I HAVEN'T MADE AN OFFICIAL ANNOUNCEMENT
HE'S APPOINTED ME CHIEF OF THE E.R.
WHILE THEY KEEP UP THEIR ENDLESS SEARCH
FOR SOMEBODY PERMANENT?
NO. ACTUALLY, I AM THE PERMANENT.
HEY, WOW! HEY... CONGRATULATIONS.
THANK YOU. THANK YOU.
THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME KNOW.
BUT WHAT I WANTED TO MENTION TO YOU
IS, YOU KNOW, I'M NOT SO SURE IT'S APPROPRIATE
FOR YOU TO CONTINUE TO RENT MY BASEMENT APARTMENT. WHAT?
WELL, IT JUST FEELS LIKE WHO'S EVER DOWN THERE
SHOULD BE SOMEONE FROM OUTSIDE THE DEPARTMENT.
YOU ASKING ME TO MOVE OUT?
TAKE YOUR TIME, OF COURSE-- A WEEK OR TWO.
LOOKING FOR SOMETHING?
OH, NO. JUST, UH, PUTTING BACK THE SUTURE KIT.
I KNOW YOU DON'T KEEP THE OPENED ONES
BUT, UH, THE SCISSORS HAVEN'T BEEN USED, THE FORCEPS...
SEEMS SUCH A WASTE TO THROW THEM AWAY.
ARE YOU OKAY?
OH, YOU MEAN AFTER THAT TRAUMA?
YEAH. I FEEL PRETTY LUCKY.
GOOD.
YOU KNOW, LUKA
WHATEVER GREENE AND WEAVER THINK...
YOU'RE A GOOD DOCTOR.
THANK YOU.
WHAT WAS IT YOU SAID?
"I'LL BE THINKING OF YOU TONIGHT"?
I GUESS I MEANT IT.
( chuckles )
SO, HOW DO YOU LIKE JEEPS?
IT'S NOT A B.M.W.
WELL, IT'S ALSO NOT A CAB.
I LIKE JEEPS.
I WAS THINKING MAYBE WE COULD GO GET A DRINK
OR SOMETHING.
I DON'T REALLY WANT A... DRINK.
Lucy: OH, DR. WEAVER, CAN I TALK TO YOU
FOR A SECOND? YEP.
I JUST CHECKED ON THE ANAPHYLACTIC SHOCK IN FOUR
AND HER RESPIRATORY RATE AND PULSE ARE DOWN
SO I THINK SHE'LL BE FINE.
WE'RE ADMITTING THE HEMATURIA UP TO MEDICINE
AND WE'RE READY TO DISCHARGE THE CONTACT DERMATITIS.
EXCELLENT. AND I WAS JUST WONDERING IF I SHOULD BE DOING
ANY EXTRA READING OR ANYTHING TONIGHT. OH...
LUCY, I'M AFRAID I'M NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE
MENTORING YOU.
I'VE JUST BEEN APPOINTED THE NEW PERMANENT CHIEF
OF THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT.
BUT THAT'S GOOD, ISN'T IT?
YES, BUT I'M AFRAID IT WOULD SEEM LIKE FAVORITISM
IF I MENTORED ONE STUDENT OVER ANOTHER.
YOU SHOULD TALK TO DR. GREENE-- HE MIGHT HAVE SOME TIME.
DR. WEAVER, RANDI'S GOT A CALL ON TWO FOR DR. GREENE.
TAKE A MESSAGE. HE'S LEFT.
I THINK YOU NEED
TO TAKE THIS ONE-- IT'S HIS FATHER.
HE SAID THAT DR. GREENE'S MOTHER
HAS DIED.
HELLO. THIS IS KERRY WEAVER. CAN I HELP YOU?
SO THIS IS WHAT AMERICAN MALES DO
TO VENT THEIR ANGER AND FRUSTRATION.
I FIGURED A ROMANO/WEAVER DOUBLE HOMICIDE WAS OVERKILL.
HOW'D YOU FIND ME?
I HAVE MY SOURCES.
I HEARD WHAT YOU DID IN THE MEETING WITH ANSPAUGH.
WHAT I DID WAS COMMIT CAREER SUICIDE...
OPENED THE DOOR FOR KERRY TO BECOME CHIEF.
SPEAKING YOUR MIND IN FRONT OF ROMANO TOOK A LOT OF COURAGE.
FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH, I'M REALLY PROUD OF YOU.
YOU DID THE RIGHT THING.
THANK YOU.
SO WHAT IS ALL THIS HITTING-THE-BASEBALL THING?
DOESN'T LOOK THAT TOUGH.
HA. IT DOESN'T, HUH?
WELL, YOU SEEM TO BE DOING IT.
YOU WANT TO GIVE IT A TRY?
COME ON.
OKAY.
ALL RIGHT.
LIKE... LIKE THIS?
( hits ball )
NICE! WHOA.
GOT THAT ONE.
SMACK IT.
( grunts )
( both laughing )
WHOOPS.
I'M DOING OKAY.
YOU'VE GOT A GOOD EYE.
KEEP YOUR EYES ON THE BALL. HERE IT COMES.
( bat hitting ball )
VERY GOOD. ( Corday laughing )
