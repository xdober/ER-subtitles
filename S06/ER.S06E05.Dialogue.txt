MOVE IT OR LOSE IT! WHOA!
( laughing )
SORRY, BOSS.
I, UH, DIDN'T REALIZE IT WAS YOU.
MALUCCI, AS AN E.R. RESIDENT
YOU SHOULD KNOW ENOUGH TO WEAR A HELMET.
DON'T WORRY. I'VE GOT A MELON LIKE A WRECKING BALL.
BEEN HIT THREE TIMES-- NOTHING WORSE THAN ROAD RASH.
LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING-- YOU ALWAYS BEEN AT COUNTY?
GOING ON TEN YEARS.
DAMN. GUYS KILL THEIR ENTIRE FAMILIES
DON'T GET TEN YEARS.
IT'S NOT A PRISON, DAVE.
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT.
DR. WEAVER SURE ACTS LIKE A WARDEN.
HEY, WHAT'S WITH THE LEG?
SHE LAY HER HARLEY DOWN IN TRAFFIC OR SOMETHING?
I DON'T KNOW. I NEVER ASKED.
SO, YOU WANT A LIFT?
ON YOUR BIKE?
YEAH. WHY NOT?
YOU NEVER RIDE DOUBLE BEFORE?
NOT SINCE I WAS EIGHT YEARS OLD
HAD A SISSY BAR AND A BANANA SEAT.
WHAT?
FORGET IT. IT'S BEFORE YOUR TIME.
THANKS, ANYWAY. ALL RIGHT, SUIT YOURSELF.
SEE YOU IN THE TRENCHES.
YOU'RE SUCH A GOOD BOY.
JEANIE...
DADDY'S HOME.
THERE YOU GO.
HEY. HI.
SORRY I'M LATE-- I GOT HELD UP
WITH THIS HIT-AND-RUN, TOOK FOREVER. IT'S OKAY. NO PROBLEM.
BETTER GET GOING. YOU'LL BE LATE.
HOW'S MY BUDDY? SAY GOOD-BYE TO MOMMY, CARLOS.
( high-pitched ): BYE, MOMMY.
DADDY AND I ARE GOING TO WATCH SOME ESPN.
( both laughing )
HEY, THE MED SCHEDULE IS...
ON THE FRIDGE. DON'T FORGET TO WEAR GLOVES WHEN YOU CHANGE HIM.
JEANIE, DON'T WORRY. WE'LL BE FINE.
OKAY.
LOVE YOU.
LOVE YOU, TOO.
HAVE A GOOD DAY. 'KAY.
SORRY, WE DON'T HAVE A PROSTHESIS DEPARTMENT.
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GO TO THE V.A.
NO, NO, NO. I'VE GOT TO GET TO WORK
AND I CAN'T CROSS THE KIDS SAFELY
IF I CAN'T HOLD UP MY SIGN.
WHY CAN'T YOU HOLD IT IN THAT HAND?
UH, THAT'S MY WHISTLE HAND.
THERE. PROBLEM SOLVED.
( blowing whistle )
RANDI, CAN YOU HELP THIS GENTLEMAN, PLEASE?
MALUCCI, YOU BETTER NOT HAVE PARKED YOUR BIKE
IN THE LOUNGE AGAIN.
IT'S NOT. YOU KNOW THERE'S A BIKE RACK
IN THE AMBULANCE BAY? YEAH, I KNOW.
MY BIKE'S NOT IN THE LOUNGE.
OKAY, TAKE JESSE KEENAN, CURTAIN ONE--
SEVERE ABDOMINAL PAIN.
HEY, HOW YOU DOING, JESSE?
I'M DR. DAVE.
I'M NOT FEELING TOO WELL.
WELL, WHAT SEEMS TO BE THE PROBLEM?
( retching ) OH, THAT'S COLORFUL.
ALL RIGHT. UH, LUCY...
MEET JESSE. NOT MY PATIENT.
HE IS NOW-- I GOT TO GET MY BIKE
OUT OF THE LOUNGE BEFORE WEAVER SHOOTS ME.
HEY, ISN'T THAT YOUR BIKE?
( whistle blowing )
HEY!
OOH. THAT'S GOING TO LEAVE A MARK.
[Captioning sponsored by NBC
and WARNER BROS. TELEVISION]
HOW'S REGGIE LIKE BEING A FATHER?
HE'S LOVING IT.
WHO TOOK MR. OPOTOSKI'S CHART?
EVERY TIME I TURN AROUND
ONE OF THE NURSES IS TAKING MY CHART.
YOU LEFT THIS IN THE SUTURE ROOM.
I WASN'T IN THE SUTURE ROOM.
YOU'RE WELCOME.
Carter: HEY, DR. LAWRENCE.
DR. CARTER.
A GRATEFUL PATIENT GAVE ME TWO TICKETS
TO THE BLACKHAWKS GAME TONIGHT.
RIGHT BEHIND THE PENALTY BOX. YOU INTERESTED?
TRAUMA ON ICE-- WHO COULD SAY NO? ALL RIGHT.
WHAT HAVE WE GOT HERE?
WE'VE GOT A GUY SLASHED WITH A KNIFE.
MM, IT LOOKS PRETTY CLEAN AND SUPERFICIAL.
UH-HUH. HERE, CHECK THIS OUT.
THIS IS DERMABOND.
WE'VE BEEN USING IT SINCE JANUARY.
IT'S PRETTY NIFTY STUFF.
LIKE MEDICAL SUPER GLUE.
YEAH. THE ARMY HAD A VERSION OF THAT
IN THE '60s. COME ON.
YEAH. REALLY.
IT TOOK THE FDA 30 YEARS TO APPROVE IT FOR CIVILIAN USE.
YOU PROBABLY BETTER UPDATE HIS TETANUS.
GABE, DID YOU WORK UP
THE WOMAN WITH THE DOG BITE?
IS THERE A PROBLEM?
I CAN'T READ THE CHART-- IT'S ILLEGIBLE.
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE ABLE TO READ
A PHYSICIAN'S HANDWRITING.
DIDN'T THEY TEACH YOU THAT IN MED SCHOOL?
HA! YOU WERE A STUDENT?
OKAY, ALL RIGHT, LOOK...
ADMIT IT-- HEY, YOU CAN'T EVEN READ THAT.
WELL, THAT'S, YOU KNOW, THAT'S FOR SECURITY PURPOSES.
WHY DON'T YOU TRY PUTTING YOUR ORDERS INTO THE COMPUTER?
BECAUSE THE COMPUTER CRASHES; MY NOTES DON'T.
I CAN HELP YOU FIGURE OUT THE COMPUTER SYSTEM.
THAT'S A GREAT IDEA, CARTER.
HAVEN'T YOU EVER HEARD THE OLD SAYING
"YOU CAN'T TEACH AN OLD DOG NEW TRICKS"?
YOU'RE NOT OLD; YOU'RE JUST STUBBORN.
HI.
HELLO.
ELAINE.
JOHN.
DR. GABE LAWRENCE, THIS IS ELAINE NICHOLS.
NICE TO MEET YOU.
HAVE YOU GOT A MINUTE, JOHN? YEAH.
WOULD YOU EXCUSE US?
YEAH. CERTAINLY.
HEY, DR. LAWRENCE.
DR. DAVID. IT'S JUST DAVE.
LISTEN, YOU'RE AN OLD FRIEND OF WEAVER'S RIGHT? YEAH.
DID SHE EVER TELL YOU WHAT HAPPENED TO HER LEG?
NOT THAT I CAN RECALL. WHY?
I'M JUST CURIOUS.
DON'T LOOK AT ME.
ASK CARTER-- HE LIVED WITH HER.
REALLY?
MM-HMM.
I'M DOING EVERYTHING BY THE BOOK.
I EVEN GAVE UP CAFFEINE.
ARE YOU GETTING PLENTY OF REST?
I'M TRYING.
I'M REALLY SORRY ABOUT THE CAFETERIA THING...
BUT I GOT A NEW JOB
AT THE BIG-T PHARMACY...
AND I, UM, I GAVE THEM YOUR NAME
AS A REFERENCE, IF THAT'S OKAY.
UH, SURE.
I TOLD THEM I'VE KNOWN YOU FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS
SO... JUST IN CASE THEY CALL.
BUT I DOUBT THEY WILL.
IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH MY EYES?
ARE YOU TAKING ANY MEDICATIONS?
JUST... UM, PRENATAL VITAMINS.
GOOD.
OKAY. I'LL BE BACK.
( sighs )
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE A BREAK?
I'LL COVER.
OH... THANKS.
COULD YOU SEND THIS UP TO THE LAB--
U.A. AND A TOX SCREEN?
SURE THING. THANK YOU.
TAKING A BREATHER?
YOU KNOW, MY BREATHING'S FINE
BUT... MY ANKLES ARE ABOUT TO EXPLODE.
MM-HMM.
I WONDER IF I COULD WRAP THEM IN DUCT TAPE.
I DON'T THINK THAT'S RECOMMENDED.
IS THIS OUR M.V.A.?
YEAH. BENJAMIN HEARN, 16, WITH C.F.
AUTO VERSUS PEDESTRIAN.
BLUNT TRAUMA TO THE RIGHT SIDE.
HOW YOU FEELING, BEN?
IT HURTS TO BREATHE.
TACHY AT 130, B.P. IS 110/72.
DID YOU TAKE HIS TEMPERATURE?
OKAY. CALL ME IF YOU NEED ME. BYE.
OKAY, THERE'S NO SIGN OF A FRACTURE
AND DID HIS BLOOD WORK COME BACK?
JEANIE? YEAH?
BLOOD WORK?
OH. NO, IT ISN'T BACK YET.
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?
YOU SEEM A LITTLE DISTRACTED.
YEAH. I'M SORRY. IT'S JUST CARLOS.
HE WAS A BIT OFF THIS MORNING
AND REGGIE'S STILL GETTING USED TO THE DAD ROUTINE.
WELL, WHY DON'T YOU CALL AND MAKE SURE EVERYTHING'S OKAY?
I DID. EVERYTHING'S FINE.
I JUST HATE BEING AWAY FROM HIM.
WHAT DO WE GOT?
RIB FRACTURES; POSSIBLE LIVER LACERATION.
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU WERE HOSPITALIZED FOR CYSTIC FIBROSIS?
ABOUT A YEAR AGO.
ALL RIGHT. REBOUND AND GUARDING
RIGHT UPPER QUADRANT.
LET'S GET A C.B.C., TYPE AND CROSS FOR FOUR
CHEST AND C-SPINE.
OKAY, LET'S GET ULTRASOUND.
CAROL, CALL UP O.R., TELL THEM TO HOLD ON
AND, UH, LET'S GET GENETICS DOWN HERE
FOR A PRE-OP CONSULT.
OH...
CAROL? CAROL, YOU OKAY?
I THINK I'M HAVING A CONTRACTION.
OKAY, WHY DON'T YOU STEP OUT.
NO. NO, IT'S GONE.
I'M FINE. IT MUST HAVE BEEN A BRAXTON-HICKS.
OKAY, CAROL, I WANT YOU TO GO SIT DOWN
AND IF YOU HAVE ANOTHER ONE, YOU'RE GOING ON A MONITOR.
SOFT, MILD TENDERNESS.
NO REBOUND.
LET'S GET A TOX SCREEN, C.B.C., CHEM SEVEN
LIVER PANEL AND A LEAD TEST.
COMING RIGHT UP.
SO, JESSE... HOW MUCH PAINT DID YOU EAT?
I DON'T KNOW.
HALF A TUBE, MAYBE.
AND DO YOU DO THIS VERY OFTEN?
JUST THIS ONCE.
I HAD A PRETTY BAD DAY.
YOU DEPRESSED?
CREATIVELY CHALLENGED.
SO, YOU'RE AN ARTIST?
NO.
FRANCIS BACON, WILLIAM BLAKE--
THOSE GUYS WERE ARTISTS.
YOU KNOW, I'M ACTUALLY FEELING PRETTY GOOD NOW.
UH, NO, NO. YOU'VE GOT TO STAY.
WE NEED TO RUN SOME TESTS, AND I WANT TO CHECK
THE TOXICITY OF THE PAINT YOU INGESTED.
YOU MUST THINK I'M PRETTY STUPID.
NO. CREATIVELY CHALLENGED.
DR. BENTON, ROGER JULIAN, GENETICS.
THIS YOUR C.F. PATIENT?
YEAH. 16-YEAR-OLD, NEEDS A LAPAROTOMY FOR A LIVER LAC.
I'D LIKE YOU TO SIGN OFF ON A GENERAL ANESTHESIA.
WHAT ARE HIS ROOM AIR SATS? 97%
HOW'S HIS X-RAY? NO INFILTRATES.
OKAY. UH, GIVE ME FIVE MINUTES.
LET'S SET UP FOR BEDSIDE SPIROMETRY.
HIS FATHER'S HERE.
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.
PETER, YOU GOT THIS?
YEAH. GO.
HEY, ANY MORE CONTRACTIONS?
NO.
PERHAPS YOU SHOULD GO HOME
AND GET OFF YOUR FEET FOR A WHILE.
I'M FINE, MARK-- AS LONG AS THESE GUYS
WOULD STOP USING MY BLADDER AS A SOCCER BALL.
STILL, MAYBE YOU SHOULD BACK OFF THE BIG TRAUMAS
SLOW THINGS DOWN A LITTLE.
I DON'T NEED YOU WORRYING ABOUT ME.
SOMEBODY'S GOT TO WORRY ABOUT YOU.
I'VE GOT TO PEE.
ULTRASOUND SHOWED A TEAR IN BENJAMIN'S LIVER.
IS HE GOING TO BE OKAY?
HE HAS AN EXCELLENT CHANCE
OF SURVIVAL, BUT HE'S GOING TO NEED SURGERY
TO REPAIR THE DAMAGE.
SHOULD WE DONATE BLOOD?
WE HAVE TO OPERATE IMMEDIATELY.
WE'LL USE A CELL SAVER TO GIVE HIM BACK HIS OWN BLOOD.
IF HE DOES REQUIRE A TRANSFUSION
I CAN ASSURE YOU, OUR BLOOD SUPPLY HAS BEEN SCREENED.
NO. I DON'T WANT BENJAMIN
GETTING BLOOD FROM SOME STRANGER.
CHUNY, WOULD YOU TYPE AND SCREEN MR. HEARN AND HIS SON?
THEY WANT TO BE DESIGNATED DONORS TO BENJAMIN HEARN.
SURE. YOU WANT TO FOLLOW ME?
I'M SORRY I DIDN'T RETURN YOUR CALLS
AND I APOLOGIZE FOR STANDING YOU UP.
IT'S OKAY.
I GUESS I JUST NEEDED TIME
TO... SORT THINGS OUT.
AND HAVE YOU?
I THINK SO.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT ME ANYMORE, JOHN.
I'M... I'M GOING TO BE OKAY.
AND YOUR FOLLOW-UP?
I'M SEEING A PLASTIC SURGEON ON WEDNESDAY...
AND AFTER THAT, I'M...
I'M THINKING ABOUT GOING TO EUROPE.
FOR HOW LONG?
I DON'T KNOW. A COUPLE OF MONTHS.
JUST DO A LITTLE SOUL SEARCHING.
SO THIS IS GOOD-BYE?
THIS IS THANK YOU...
FOR EVERYTHING.
WILL YOU GIVE ME A CALL WHEN YOU GET BACK?
I'LL SEND YOU A POSTCARD.
HEY, CARTER.
UH, IS IT TRUE YOU LIVED WITH WEAVER?
IN HER BASEMENT.
SHE KEPT YOU IN THE BASEMENT?
SHE WAS MY LANDLADY.
OKAY, SURE.
SO WHEN YOUR "LANDLADY" WAS COLLECTING THE RENT
YOU MUST HAVE SEEN HER LEG, RIGHT?
GO AWAY, DAVE.
COME ON.
HEY, LUCY.
I'M NOT TALKING TO YOU.
WHY IS EVERYBODY SO GRUMPY AROUND HERE?
UNIT CONTACTING COUNTY GENERAL.
MEET ME ON ONE-ALPHA.
County from Rescue 43.
At the scene of a multi-victim casualty incident.
How many can you take?
TWO AND EIGHT.
TWO MAJOR, EIGHT MINOR.
RANDI, PAGE BENTON AND CORDAY.
LET'S PREP TRAUMA ONE AND TWO.
KIDNEY FAILURE, LIVER DAMAGE.
YOUR RED BLOOD CELLS COULD LITERALLY EXPLODE.
OKAY, OKAY. YOU'VE MADE YOUR POINT.
I WON'T EAT ANY MORE PAINT.
AND WHAT ABOUT THE COCAINE?
YOUR URINE TESTED POSITIVE.
OKAY, SO ON OCCASION, I...
I HAVE USED SOME MIND-EXPANDING CHEMICALS
TO FACILITATE MY CREATIVE PROCESS.
I'M NOT THE FIRST ARTIST TO DO SO.
BUT YOU'VE BEEN USING THEM THE LAST FEW DAYS.
I WANT TO PUT YOU IN A REHAB PROGRAM.
I APPRECIATE YOUR CONCERN, BUT I'M REALLY COOL.
I MEAN, I'VE BEEN UNDER A LOT OF STRESS LATELY.
MY WORK SUCKS.
MAYBE YOUR WORK IS SUFFERING BECAUSE YOU'RE
USING COCAINE.
LOOK, JESSE, YOU CAME HERE FOR MEDICAL HELP
SO LET ME HELP YOU.
( groaning )
THEY LET YOU PAINT IN THESE PROGRAMS?
I'M SURE ARRANGEMENTS COULD BE MADE.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
I DON'T KNOW.
I CAN'T PROMISE ANYTHING.
I'LL CHECK IT OUT THOUGH.
GREAT.
EXPLOSION IN A HIGH SCHOOL SCIENCE CLASS.
I TOLD THEM WE COULD TAKE TWO MAJOR AND EIGHT MINOR.
FEELING GENEROUS, WERE YOU?
VICTOR SUTHERLAND.
52-YEAR-OLD SCIENCE TEACHER.
ALTERED L.O.C., MODERATE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS.
B.P. IS 90/60, PULSE 120. ( muttering )
WHAT'S HE SAYING?
HAZMAT BOYS SAID IT WAS CHLORINE GAS.
IT'S OKAY, SIR. DON'T TRY TO SPEAK.
LUNGS ARE WET.
WE HAVE TO TUBE HIM. ANY OTHER CRITICALS?
HE'S THE WORST.
GABE, COULD YOU TRIAGE THE OTHERS
AND KEEP AN EYE ON THE RESIDENTS?
NO PROBLEM.
WHAT IS THIS? WHAT DO WE GOT HERE?
KEN KRANICS, 17, BLUNT HEAD TRAUMA WITH L.O.C.
TUBED HIM FOR A RESPIRATORY RATE OF FOUR.
B.P. 124/86, PULSE 74.
GET A HEAD C.T. AND HAVE NEUROSURGE COME BY.
I'M ON IT.
CALL ME IF YOU NEED ME.
NEED A HAND, CARTER?
NO, THERE'S MORE COMING.
MALUCCI. WHAT'S GOING ON?
SCIENCE ROOM EXPLODED.
THERE'S A DOZEN MORE COMING.
THIS IS QUINN.
LOOKS LIKE PARTIAL THICKNESS BURNS
TO THE HEAD, FACE AND HANDS.
NOTHING CIRCUMFERENTIAL.
SHE'S A LITTLE WHEEZY.
16-YEAR-OLD LEANNE LAWLER.
PENETRATING ABDOMINAL INJURY, NOT SURE HOW DEEP.
B.P. 95/65, PULSE 110.
WE GAVE A LITER IN THE FIELD.
PULL THIS THING OUT OF ME.
WE WILL. JUST HANG IN THERE.
IT'S RIGHT OVER THE SPLEEN.
WE'VE GOT TO HAVE AN ULTRASOUND
BEFORE WE SEND HER UP TO THE O.R.
WHAT'S OPEN? TRAUMA ONE.
DR. LAWRENCE, LOOKS LIKE A COLLES' FRACTURE
WITH AN OVERLYING LACERATION.
THAT'S A GRADE ONE OPEN FRACTURE; THE BONE
PUNCTURED THE SKIN.
SHOULD I SET UP FOR AN OPEN REDUCTION?
ONLY IF THERE'S MORE THAN 20 DEGREES
OF DORSAL ANGULATION.
YOU WANT SOMETHING FOR THE PAIN?
NO, I'M OKAY.
GRAM OF ANCEF.
STOP IT! YOU'RE NOT HELPING ANY!
YOU HAVE TO LET ME IRRIGATE.
HOW WE DOING HERE?
HE'S ALREADY HAD TEN OF MORPHINE.
GLASS INJURIES
TO THE EYES AND FACE.
DR. LAWRENCE, SHOULD I GIVE THIS GUY MANNITOL?
IT'S A TRICKY CALL.
I THINK I SEE PAPILLEDEMA ON THE RIGHT...
SLOW DOWN. WHO ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
MY HEAD TRAUMA PATIENT.
HE HASN'T BLOWN A PUPIL, BUT HIS G.C.S. IS NINE
AND THE DISC MARGINS ARE SLIGHTLY BLURRED.
DO YOU THINK HE NEEDS MANNITOL?
HAS HE BLOWN A PUPIL?
NO. THEY'RE FOUR MILLIMETERS, EQUAL AND REACTIVE.
NO. HOLD OFF. WAIT FOR THE HEAD C.T.
WHAT WERE YOU GOING TO SAY?
HUH? WHAT?
THIN CUTS...
YEAH, THIN CUTS THROUGH THE ORBITS.
OPHTHOL CONSULT. TITRATE SOME ATIVAN.
I CAN'T SEE ANYTHING.
YOU'RE IN GOOD HANDS, SON.
YOU'RE IN GOOD HANDS.
DR. LAWRENCE, JANET GUNDERSON, 17.
CHEST HIT THE EDGE OF A DESK.
COMPLAINS OF PLEURITIC PAIN
PULSE 100, B.P. 132/74.
WHAT'S OPEN?
UH, TRY CURTAIN THREE.
CHEST X RAY AND AN E.K.G.
DR. LAWRENCE, WE GOT A FINGER AMPUTATION HERE.
IS THE FINGER ON ICE?
HE GAVE IT TO A FRIEND WHO SEEMS TO HAVE LOST IT.
GIVE HIM A GRAM OF ANCEF
AN ASPIRIN SUPPOSITORY
AND CALL THE REIMPLANTATION SERVICE.
SOMETHING FOR THE PAIN?
DRAW UP TEN OF LIDOCAINE.
I'LL DO A WRIST BLOCK.
DR. LAWRENCE, WE COULD USE YOU.
WH-WHAT PATIENT?
THE GIRL WITH THE HAND BURNS
AND THE FACIAL BURNS.
MALUCCI'S WORRIED ABOUT HER LUNGS.
WHAT ARE YOU PUTTING ON ME?
IT'S JUST ANTIBIOTIC OINTMENT, HONEY.
CALL THE BURN TEAM?
YEP. EIGHT PERCENT BODY SURFACE AREA--
SECOND-DEGREE BURNS.
DR. LAWRENCE, VANCOMYCIN OKAY FOR MY PATIENT?
WHAT PATIENT?
THE HAND INJURY.
THE AMPUTATION?
NO, THE WRIST KID; YOU SAID ANCEF
BUT HE'S ALLERGIC TO PENICILLIN.
YEAH, FINE. WHAT ROOM IS HE IN?
EXAM FOUR.
ALL RIGHT, I'LL BE THERE IN A MINUTE.
Malucci: THEN SHOULD I GIVE STEROIDS?
STEROIDS?
YEAH, FOR THE WHEEZING.
NO, I WOULDN'T.
WHY NOT?
IT... IT'S NOT GOOD.
JUST... DON'T DO IT, TRUST ME.
HOW YOU DOING?
ALL I DID WAS PUKE.
YOU WEREN'T IN THE EXPLOSION?
NO. IS THAT WHAT HAPPENED?
SOUNDS PRETTY CRAZY OUT THERE.
YEAH.
( groaning and clamoring )
Malik ( echoing ): TAKE SLOW, DEEP BREATHS, OKAY?
HALEH, YOU GOT THE DRUG KEY?
I NEED TEN OF MORPHINE.
TEN OF MORPHINE, TEN OF MORPHINE
TEN OF MORPHINE.
THANKS.
Marquez ( echoing ): COMING THROUGH! COMING THROUGH! COMING THROUGH!
Lucy: DR. LAWRENCE, WE NEED YOU IN HERE.
Weaver: OKAY, I'M IN. BAG HIM.
KERRY, WHAT'S UP?
I COULD USE AN EXTRA PAIR OF HANDS.
HIS LUNGS ARE FULL OF FLUID.
ALL RIGHT.
IT'S PULMONARY EDEMA FROM THE CHLORINE.
HE'S STILL HYPOTENSIVE
AFTER DECOMPRESSING A TENSION PNEUMO.
32 FRENCH, RIGHT HERE.
BETTER CHECK THE BELLY.
TEN BLADE. LET'S GET
ULTRASOUND IN HERE.
IT'S TIED UP IN THE OTHER ROOM.
I'LL DO A D.P.L.
UH, DR. LAWRENCE, MY E.K.G.-- MY PATIENT MAY HAVE
A STERNAL FRACTURE, AND WITH THE Q.R.S. VOLTAGE
I'M AFRAID OF TAMPONADE.
SO DO A CARDIAC ECHO.
OKAY, BUT DON'T YOU THINK...?
JUST DO THE DAMN ECHO.
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?
PERITONEAL LAVAGE KIT.
IT'S A PERCUTANEOUS KIT.
USE THE SELDINGER TECHNIQUE.
NO. I WANT TO DO AN OPEN LAVAGE.
IT'S A NEW KIT. THEY WORK WELL.
WHERE'S THE DRUG BOX?
JUST GET ME A SCALPEL, COUPLE OF TOWEL CLIPS
A PAIR OF RAKES, AND A... AND A... A...
A CURVED, UH...
YOU KNOW, A...
Jarvis: A HEMOSTAT?
WHAT? WHAT?
HEMOSTAT?
YEAH, YEAH, COME ON, HURRY UP.
COME ON, COME ON.
THE KIT'S FAIRLY EASY TO USE, GABE.
YOU JUST SPREAD
THE GUIDE WIRE THROUGH THE THINWALL NEEDLE
AND THEN INTRODUCE THE CATHETER...
THESE ARE UNRELIABLE.
HALF THE TIME YOU WIND UP IN THE PREPERITONEAL SPACE.
I THINK IF YOU TRIED THEM...
I SAID NO, DAMN IT.
I ALWAYS DO AN OPEN TECHNIQUE.
IT'S THE GOLD STANDARD.
THAT'S WHAT I'M
GOING TO DO.
THESE ARE CRAP!
DR. LAWRENCE, YOUR FINGER AMPUTATION
IS READY FOR HIS WRIST BLOCK.
ALL RIGHT.
YOU SEEM TO HAVE EVERYTHING UNDER CONTROL HERE, KERRY.
ANOTHER PATIENT
NEEDS ME.
I'M SORRY, KERRY.
THAT WAS UNPROFESSIONAL
AND TOTALLY UNCALLED-FOR.
DO YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT?
THERE'S NOTHING TO TALK ABOUT.
I SCREWED UP.
I LOST MY COOL.
IT'S BEEN A WHILE SINCE I'VE HAD
MULTIPLE CASUALTIES LIKE THAT.
IF YOU WERE IN TROUBLE, YOU SHOULD HAVE
ASKED FOR HELP.
YOU HAD YOUR HANDS FULL.
I WAS OVERLOADED, THAT'S ALL.
IT HAPPENS TO THE BEST OF US.
YOU REMEMBER THAT TIME YOU WERE...
YOU WERE THIRD YEAR, I THINK.
A DOUBLE-DECKER TOUR BUS HIT A BRIDGE
AND IT SHEARED OFF THE TOP, REMEMBER?
THAT WAS AN INSANE TRAUMA.
THAT WAS A LITTLE HECTIC.
A LITTLE HECTIC?
THERE WERE THREE GURNEYS IN EVERY SPACE.
EVERYBODY LOST IT.
BUT YOU KEPT YOUR COOL.
I DON'T KNOW IF I SHOULD BE TELLING YOU THIS.
WHAT IS IT, GABE?
THERE WERE TIMES WHEN YOU DROVE ME NUTS.
YOU WERE LIKE HAVING TEN OTHER STUDENTS.
I SWEAR YOU ASKED MORE QUESTIONS
THAN I THOUGHT WAS HUMANLY POSSIBLE.
BUT IT PAID OFF.
I'M PROUD OF YOU, KERRY.
CHIEF OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE.
YOU WERE GREAT IN THERE.
DAMN, I WAS A GOOD TEACHER.
YOU WERE.
AND YOU STILL ARE, ACCORDING TO CARTER.
YEAH, WELL, I THINK YOU'RE MAKING A BIG MISTAKE
WITH THESE NEW LAVAGE KITS BUT I'LL USE THEM.
IT'S YOUR E.R. NOW.
FOR THE RECORD, MY WAY MAY BE OLDER
BUT IT'S STILL FASTER AND BETTER...
KIND OF LIKE ME.
ARE YOU TAKING ANY PAIN MEDICATION?
NO. WHY?
YOUR URINE TESTED POSITIVE FOR OPIATES.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.
YOU'RE TAKING DRUGS
WHICH MEANS YOUR BABY'S TAKING DRUGS.
WHAT IS IT, CODEINE, HEROIN?
I'M NOT USING DRUGS.
IF YOU'RE SHARING NEEDLES
YOU'RE PUTTING BOTH YOU AND YOUR BABY AT RISK
FOR HEPATITIS, HIV, ENDOCARDITIS...
I'M NOT SHARING NEEDLES.
BUT YOU ARE USING.
MEG, I KNOW YOU CARE ABOUT YOUR BABY.
I DO.
I DO CARE.
YOU DON'T WANT TO HURT IT, DO YOU?
THEN YOU HAVE TO STOP.
I'M HARDLY USING.
JUST...
JUST A LITTLE.
JUST SO I DON'T GET SICK.
YOU CAN'T USE AT ALL.
LET ME PUT YOU INTO A DETOX PROGRAM
AND HELP YOU GET CLEAN.
OKAY.
I'LL SEE WHAT I CAN DO.
YOU'RE PUTTING HIM ON PSYCH HOLD?
NO, IT'LL BE VOLUNTARY ADMISSION.
HE'S WILLING TO COME IN AND GET CLEAN.
I'LL CALL DOWN WHEN THE BED'S OPEN.
THANKS.
SO DID I PASS THE AUDITION?
YEP. YOU SHOULD GO UP WITHIN THE HOUR.
THEY WON'T LET ME PAINT.
I'M SORRY.
IT'S OKAY.
THEY SAID I COULD SKETCH.
THANKS... FOR HELPING ME.
I REALLY NEEDED IT.
DR. MYERS?
CAROL.
HI.
I HAVE AN EXPECTANT MOTHER IN NEED OF A REHAB BED.
ANY WAY YOU COULD SEE HER?
SURE, BUT I JUST GAVE OUR LAST SPOT
TO A GUY IN EXAM ONE.
SHE'S PREGNANT.
I'M SORRY, WE ONLY HAVE SO MANY SPOTS.
I CAN SIGN HER UP FOR AN OUTPATIENT PROGRAM
UNTIL A SPACE OPENS UP.
COULD YOU SIGN THE GUY UP FOR AN OUTPATIENT PROGRAM?
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE WELFARE OF AN UNBORN CHILD.
LET'S SEE WHAT WE GOT. WHERE IS SHE?
THANKS. IN HERE.
HEY.
HEY, HOW'S IT GOING?
HAVE YOU SPOKEN TO YOUR BROTHER YET?
NO. IS HE DOING OKAY?
UH, YOU KNOW WHAT, LET'S TALK IN HERE.
IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH BEN?
NO, NO, NO.
YOUR BROTHER, HE'S GOING TO BE FINE.
IT'S JUST THAT WHEN I SCREENED YOUR BLOOD, UH...
YOU TESTED...
HIV-POSITIVE.
YOU SHOULD HAVE TOLD ME.
I DIDN'T KNOW FOR SURE...
UNTIL NOW.
WELL... I'M SORRY.
I FIGURED THIS WOULD HAPPEN SOONER OR LATER.
YOU DIDN'T PRACTICE SAFE SEX?
APPARENTLY NOT.
YOU KNOW, I COULD SEND YOU TO A CLINIC
TO START TREATMENT.
THE SOONER THE BETTER.
YOU AREN'T GOING TO TELL MY PARENTS, ARE YOU?
THAT'S YOUR CHOICE.
BUT LISTEN...
FAMILY SUPPORT IS VERY IMPORTANT
WHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH HIV.
SUPPORT? ARE YOU KIDDING?
MY OLD MAN WOULD DISOWN ME.
I TRIED TELLING HIM ONCE.
I DID THE WHOLE
"I GOT THIS FRIEND WHO'S GAY."
HE FREAKED.
HE SAID IF I EVER BROUGHT A "FAG" TO HIS HOUSE
HE'D KICK MY ASS.
IT WOULD BE EASIER FOR YOUR TREATMENT
IF YOUR FAMILY KNEW THE TRUTH.
NO.
NO, FORGET IT.
EVERY FAMILY HAS THEIR SECRETS, ANYWAY...
RIGHT?
DR. LAWRENCE, COULD YOU SEE A POSSIBLE C.V.A. IN EXAM TWO?
ASK CARTER.
I GOT TO FINISH THESE CHARTS.
YOU TOOK MY SPOT.
WHAT?
MY PATIENT'S DETOX SPOT.
DR. MYERS SAID HE COULD BE AN OUTPATIENT.
AFTER YOU CONVINCED HIM.
WE NEEDED THE SPOT FOR A PREGNANT WOMAN.
IF SHE DOESN'T GET OFF HEROIN, THE BABY WILL BE ADDICTED.
YOU CAN'T DO THAT. YOU'RE A NURSE AND I'M A...
YOU'RE A WHAT?
YOU'RE A MED STUDENT.
I DIDN'T KNOW HE WAS YOUR PATIENT.
I'M SURE HE'LL BE ADMITTED AS SOON AS THERE'S AN OPEN BED.
THAT'S EASY FOR YOU TO SAY.
YOU GOT THE BED.
DID YOU FIND LAWRENCE?
YEP.
AND?
AND WHAT?
HE PRACTICALLY HAD A MELTDOWN IN THE TRAUMA ROOM, KERRY.
THAT'S A LITTLE MELODRAMATIC, DON'T YOU THINK?
I DON'T KNOW.
COME ON, MARK, GABE IS NOT THE FIRST DOCTOR TO LOSE HIS TEMPER
IN THE HEAT OF THE MOMENT.
OVER A LAVAGE KIT?
YOU KNOW WHAT?
HE'S BEEN DOING THIS FOR 30 YEARS.
HE'S SET IN HIS WAYS.
HE DOESN'T LIKE SOME OF THE NEWER EQUIPMENT.
I KNOW YOU TWO ARE CLOSE...
WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO SAY, MARK?
HE'S ACTING A BIT STRANGE.
I DON'T THINK HE'S SETTING A VERY GOOD EXAMPLE.
YEAH, HE'S ECCENTRIC.
HE'S ALSO ONE OF THE BEST DOCTORS I'VE EVER WORKED WITH.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO GET DEFENSIVE, KERRY.
I'M NOT.
YOU DON'T LIKE THAT I HIRED GABE.
BUT I DID, SO DEAL WITH IT.
I REPAIRED BENJAMIN'S LIVER.
HE'S DOING WELL.
ANY COMPLICATIONS?
HE LOST A LITTLE BLOOD DURING THE OPERATION
SO WE GAVE HIM A TRANSFUSION.
BUT I EXPECT HIM TO MAKE A FULL RECOVERY.
YOU GAVE HIM OUR BLOOD, RIGHT?
WELL, JUST YOURS.
I COULDN'T USE AARON'S.
WHY NOT?
IT WASN'T A GOOD MATCH.
THE NURSE SAID WE ALL HAD THE SAME BLOOD TYPE.
YEAH, I KNOW
BUT AARON'S BLOOD HAS A DIFFERENT MINOR ANTIGEN
THAT COULD CAUSE
A TRANSFUSION REACTION.
I'M SORRY.
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.
THE IMPORTANT THING IS
THAT BENJAMIN'S GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT, HUH?
OH, YEAH, YEAH.
THANKS.
THANKS.
MOST OF YOUR FRIENDS WERE BROUGHT IN AN HOUR AGO.
WHERE WERE YOU HIDING?
I WASN'T HIDING.
I JUST DIDN'T THINK IT WAS SO BAD.
HOW'S MY TEACHER, MR. SUTHERLAND?
I HAVEN'T HEARD.
WHAT KIND OF EXPERIMENT WERE YOU GUYS DOING?
THE WRONG ONE.
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
NOTHING.
DO YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TODAY, HOWIE?
IF YOU HAVE ANY...
INFORMATION ABOUT THE EXPLOSION, I THINK YOU SHOULD LET ME KNOW.
IT MIGHT HELP US TREAT MR. SUTHERLAND.
DO YOU PROMISE TO KEEP THIS BETWEEN US?
LIKE, DOCTOR-PATIENT CONFIDENTIALITY
AND ALL THAT?
ALL I CAN PROMISE YOU IS THAT YOU'RE GOING
TO FEEL A LOT BETTER IF YOU TELL ME THE TRUTH.
THE RIGHT EYE IS GOING TO BE FINE.
BUT THE GLASS SLICED THROUGH THE LEFT EYEBALL
AND DISPLACED THE LENS.
WELL... HOW LONG BEFORE THEY CAN FIX THAT?
IT'LL BE A DIFFICULT REPAIR JOB.
CAN I SEE?
I DON'T THINK THAT, THAT IS...
GEEZ.
DAD?
WHAT IS IT? WHAT'S WRONG?
EVERYTHING'S OKAY, NATHAN.
WE JUST HAVE TO WAIT FOR THE SPECIALIST.
IS EVERYTHING OKAY, DAD?
MR. PEREZ, COULD YOU COME WITH ME?
DAD? WHERE'S HE GOING?
Weaver: YOUR FATHER NEEDS TO SIGN SOME...
THEY CAN'T FIX THAT.
I'M NOT A SPECIALIST.
THE OPHTHALMOLOGIST WILL BE ABLE TO TELL...
HIS EYE IS GONE. HE'S GOING TO BE BLIND.
WE DON'T KNOW THAT.
MY SON HAS AN ATHLETIC SCHOLARSHIP.
HE'S THE FIRST IN OUR FAMILY TO GO TO COLLEGE.
HE'S WORKED VERY HARD.
AND NOW HE'S LOST EVERYTHING...
MR. PEREZ, PLEASE.
WHAT'S IMPORTANT RIGHT NOW
IS THAT YOU'RE HERE FOR YOUR SON.
HE NEEDS YOU.
OKAY?
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?
EVERYTHING'S FINE, MIJO.
JEANIE, REGGIE'S ON LINE ONE.
SAYS IT'S URGENT.
THANKS.
REGGIE?
FOR HOW LONG?
OKAY, OKAY, I WILL. BYE.
JEANIE, IS EVERYTHING OKAY?
CARLOS IS SICK.
I THINK HIS PNEUMONIA MIGHT BE COMING BACK.
I NEED TO GET HOME.
YOU DO. GO ON.
THANKS.
DID THEY BRING IN A PATIENT NAMED HOWIE McMURTRY?
I DON'T KNOW. WHY?
TELL HER.
HOWIE'S THE ONE THAT CAUSED THE EXPLOSION.
THE JOCKS TALKED ME INTO DOING IT.
I SWITCHED THE CHEMICALS.
IT WAS ONLY SUPPOSED TO BE A SMALL EXOTHERMIC REACTION.
A LITTLE SMOKE AND A FEW BUBBLES, THAT'S ALL.
BUT MR. SUTHERLAND CHANGED THE EXPERIMENT
AND I DIDN'T HAVE A CHANCE TO WARN HIM.
THIS WASN'T SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN.
IT WAS JUST A JOKE.
YOU LITTLE SON
OF A BITCH.
I'M SORRY, SIR.
MY SON IS BLIND BECAUSE OF YOU.
MR. PEREZ, NATHAN AND HIS FRIENDS
TOLD ME TO DO IT.
YOU'LL HAVE TO LEAVE...
YOU'RE A LIAR!
HEY, HEY...
GET OUT OF THE WAY.
SECURITY!
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.
GET OFF OF HIM.
GET OFF OF HIM.
GET AWAY!
GET OFF OF HIM!
YOU OKAY, CARTER?
YEAH.
Marquez: SIR? SIR?!
HE'S NOT BREATHING.
WE HAVE TO INTUBATE?
LET'S GET HIM TO THE BED.
COME ON.
GO, GO, GO, GO, GO.
LET'S GET HIM OUT.
GIVE ME AN 8-0 E.T. TUBE.
Greene: I NEED SUCTION.
THANKS FOR PULLING HIM OFF OF ME.
JUST GET THE TUBE IN, CARTER.
IS HE OKAY?
Greene: LET'S GET HIM ON A PULSE OX.
ALL RIGHT.
I'M IN.
LET'S BAG HIM.
NO BREATH SOUNDS.
HE'S NOT PINKING UP.
IT WAS GOOD INTUBATION.
I SAW THE CORDS.
OH, MAN, HE'S BLOWING UP LIKE A BALLOON.
Greene: SUBCUTANEOUS EMPHYSEMA.
YOU BROKE HIS LARYNX?
LET'S PREP HIS NECK.
I'LL DO A CRIKE.
THE INJURY COULD BE BELOW THE CRICOID.
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO TRACH HIM. MELKER KIT.
WHAT ABOUT THE TUBE?
PULL IT OUT. IT'S USELESS.
PULSE OX FALLING TO 81.
HEART RATE'S DOWN TO 5O.
AMP OF ATROPINE.
CARTER, BLOW SOME OXYGEN DOWN THERE.
I'M NOT SEEING HIS CHEST RISE.
Marquez: PULSE OX 76.
RUN OF FIVE.
I SEE IT.
LET'S GET A CRASH CART.
I'M IN. BAG HIM.
Carter: TAKE OVER FOR ME.
I GOT BREATH SOUNDS.
PULSE OX UP TO 85.
THAT'S A NICE SAVE.
YEAH.
GOOD NEWS, QUINN.
I SPOKE WITH THE PLASTIC SURGEON
AND HE SAID THAT YOUR BURNS
SHOULDN'T LEAVE MUCH SCARRING.
RIGHT.
WELL, UM...
I'LL CHECK ON YOU A LITTLE LATER.
IF YOU NEED ANYTHING, JUST... HIT THE BUZZER.
I'M GOING TO HAVE SCARS?
THE... NEW SKIN
MAY HAVE IRREGULAR, UH, UH, PIGMENTATION
BUT IT'S ONLY TEMPORARY.
HOW TEMPORARY?
SIX MONTHS TO A YEAR.
THE PLASTIC SURGEON
HE'LL BE ABLE TO GIVE YOU ALL THE DETAILS.
I MIGHT LOOK LIKE THIS FOR A YEAR?
NO, NO.
UM... IT WILL TAKE UP TO A YEAR FOR YOU TO HEAL
BUT YOU-YOU MAY, IN FACT, HEAL MUCH FASTER... OKAY?
HOW MUCH FASTER?
I... DON'T KNOW.
UM...
YOU WILL GET A LITTLE BIT BETTER EACH DAY.
YOU KNOW, UH...
( mumbling uncomfortably )
UH, YOU WERE LUCKY, QUINN.
IT COULD'VE BEEN MUCH WORSE.
YOU THINK THIS IS LUCKY?
I LOOK LIKE A HIDEOUS FREAK.
NO, NO, YOU...
NO, YOU LOOK LIKE, UM...
LIKE A GIRL WHO WAS FORTUNATE ENOUGH
TO SURVIVE A DANGEROUS ACCIDENT.
( sniffling softly )
( crying ): I'D RATHER BE DEAD THAN LOOK LIKE THIS.
( wailing plaintively )
( wailing continuing )
YOU OKAY?
PEACHY.
YOU WERE TRYING TO PROTECT THE PATIENT.
YOU DID THE RIGHT THING.
WELL, SOMETHING TELLS ME THAT MR. PEREZ IS GOING
TO FEEL DIFFERENTLY WHEN HE WAKES UP.
I WAS A WITNESS.
Weaver: MARK?
WE NEED TO TALK.
HOWIE, YOU ALL RIGHT?
YEAH.
HOW'S MR. PEREZ?
HE'S GOING TO BE OKAY.
BUT NOT MR. SUTHERLAND, HUH?
I DON'T KNOW.
A LOT OF KIDS THOUGHT HE WAS A GEEK...
'CAUSE, SOMETIMES, HE'D MESS UP THE EXPERIMENTS
BUT I THINK HE DID IT ON PURPOSE...
JUST TO MAKE CLASS A LITTLE MORE FUN.
HE WAS A REALLY GOOD TEACHER.
THERE'S STILL A CHANCE HE MIGHT RECOVER, THOUGH, RIGHT--
LIKE A LONG SHOT OR SOMETHING...
LIKE ONE IN A MILLION?
YEAH.
I TOLD HIM.
I TOLD MY FATHER I WAS HIV-POSITIVE.
GOOD FOR YOU.
HE KICKED ME OUT.
WELL, YOU KNOW, HE MIGHT JUST NEED
A LITTLE TIME TO DEAL WITH IT.
( chuckles ruefully )
HE NO LONGER CONSIDERS ME HIS SON.
HMM.
I'M SORRY.
AT LEAST HE KNOWS THE TRUTH NOW.
SCREW HIM IF HE CAN'T HANDLE IT.
Knight: AND IT MIGHT BE
A FEW DAYS BEFORE I CAN GET YOU INTO THE DETOX PROGRAM.
I SHOULD'VE CALLED AHEAD FOR RESERVATIONS.
I KNOW, I'M SORRY, BUT IN THE MEANTIME
I CAN GET YOU INTO AN OUTPATIENT PROGRAM.
DON'T SWEAT IT.
JESSE, YOU NEED HELP.
I NEED A REAL JOB.
I WATCHED YOU HERE TODAY, RUNNING AROUND--
YOU, THE DOCTORS, THE COPS, PARAMEDICS.
EVERYBODY'S DOING SOMETHING IMPORTANT
HELPING PEOPLE, SAVING LIVES
AND I'M IN HERE FOR EATING PAINT.
IT'S PATHETIC.
LOOK, WHY DON'T I GET SOMEONE
FOR YOU TO TALK TO?
I DON'T NEED A SHRINK TO TELL ME
I NEED TO GET MY ACT TOGETHER.
I'LL SEE YOU AROUND, LUCY.
HEY, COULD YOU, UH, SPEAK WITH ONE OF MY PATIENTS?
NO, GO AWAY, DAVE. I DON'T WANT ANY MORE PATIENTS.
WHY NOT? LOOKS LIKE YOU FIXED UP THAT LAST GUY PRETTY GOOD.
YEAH, REAL GOOD.
BUT THIS ONE'S DIFFERENT, ALL RIGHT?
I GOT A TEENAGE GIRL
THAT BURNED HER FACE IN THE EXPLOSION.
SHE'S... REALLY DEPRESSED AND...
( sighs )
NOTHING I SAY SEEMS TO BE THE RIGHT THING.
REALLY?
Carter: DR. LAWRENCE
ABOUT THE HOCKEY GAME TONIGHT
I'M AFRAID I'M GOING TO HAVE TO CANCEL...
BUT YOU GO, YOU GO WITHOUT ME.
EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?
OH, YEAH, YEAH, EVERYTHING.
OH, JUST SOMETHING CAME UP.
( chuckling ): YEAH, SO I CAN SEE.
( chuckles wryly )
WHAT?
WELL, MOOD SWINGS... HAGGARD BROW...
INABILITY TO CONCENTRATE.
CLASSIC SIGNS OF WOMAN PROBLEMS.
IS IT THAT OBVIOUS?
ONLY IF YOU'VE BEEN MARRIED AS MANY TIMES AS I HAVE.
PLUS, I MET HER TODAY, REMEMBER?
I NEVER FORGET A PRETTY FACE.
YOU GOT ANY PROFESSIONAL ADVICE?
( chuckling ): FROM ME?
I CAN DIAGNOSE A MILLION DISEASES
BUT I STILL CAN'T FIGURE OUT WOMEN.
I GUESS THAT'S WHAT MAKES THEM
SO DAMNED IRRESISTIBLE.
YEAH.
I DO KNOW...
LIFE'S TOO SHORT TO, YOU KNOW, TO WASTE ON REGRET.
HMM.
I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW.
Haleh: DR. LAWRENCE.
YEP?
I'VE GOT YOUR ANKLE FILMS.
HAS ANYONE SEEN MEG CORWIN
THE PREGNANT WOMAN IN CURTAIN THREE?
NO, SORRY.
I THINK SHE LEFT.
SHE WAS SUPPOSED TO GO TO DETOX.
HOW'S HE DOING?
Julian: OH, CHEST IS CLEAR.
SATTING AT 98 ON TWO LITERS.
I'D, UH, I'D GIVE HIM ALBUTEROL TREATMENT Q4
AND, UH, I'LL STOP BY TOMORROW.
OKAY, THANKS.
DR. JULIAN, I WANTED
TO... ASK YOU A QUESTION ABOUT DNA TESTING.
WHAT ABOUT IT?
WELL, YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES WE GET
PREGNANT TEENAGERS, SINGLE MOTHERS
THAT HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT PATERNITY TESTING
AND I WAS WONDERING IF THERE'S ANYTHING
THAT WE COULD, YOU KNOW, USE DOWN IN THE E.R.
YEAH, YEAH, WE'VE, UH, WE'VE GOT A TEST KIT YOU CAN USE.
JUST, UM, CALL MY OFFICE
AND THEY'LL GIVE YOU THE NAME OF THE SUPPLIER.
OKAY, GREAT, THANKS.
HE SAID MY SKIN WOULD BE DISCOLORED.
THE NEW SKIN WILL BE SENSITIVE TO U.V. RAYS
SO YOU HAVE TO BE VERY DILIGENT ABOUT USING SUNSCREEN.
SO MUCH FOR MY TAN NEXT SUMMER.
AW, YOUR SKIN WILL BE HEALTHIER FOR IT
AND YOU'LL LOOK YOUNGER.
THERE WILL COME A DAY, QUINN
WHEN YOUNGER IS BETTER, TRUST ME.
WHAT ABOUT MY HAIR?
IT'LL BE THINNER, MAYBE A LITTLE PATCHIER AT FIRST
BUT IT'LL GROW BACK.
HOW LONG DOES THAT TAKE?
DOES YOUR HAIR GROW FAST?
NO.
WELL, THEN, UH...
YOU MIGHT HAVE TO WEAR A WIG FOR A WHILE.
A WIG?
YOU COULD TRY BEING A BLOND.
IT'S TRUE WHAT THEY SAY ABOUT US.
BUT JUST BE PATIENT, OKAY?
AND IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS
CALL ME... OR DR. DAVE, OKAY?
THANK YOU.
WOW, YOU'RE GOOD.
THANKS.
NO, I MEAN REALLY GOOD.
YOU'RE WELCOME, DAVE.
DR. MALUCCI.
CHIEF.
YOU, UH, WANTED TO SEE ME?
NO.
NO? HMM.
I HEARD YOU HAD A QUESTION ABOUT MY LEG.
ME?
UH, NO, NOT-NOT ME.
I MEAN, I-I HAD A... A PATIENT WITH A BAD ANKLE
BUT SOMEONE MUST'VE MISUNDERSTOOD
WHAT I WAS ASKING.
OH... I SEE.
WELL, YOU KNOW, IF YOU DO EVER WANT TO KNOW
YOU SHOULD... JUST ASK.
NO PROBLEM...
BUT IT'S REALLY NONE OF MY BUSINESS, RIGHT?
NO.
NO, IT'S NOT.
WELL, WELL, WELL.
IF IT ISN'T THE LEAN GREENE FIGHTING MACHINE.
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT, ROBERT.
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO TREAT ACCIDENTS, NOT CAUSE THEM.
IT WAS SELF-DEFENSE.
OH, HE ATTACKED YOU?
NO, HE ATTACKED CARTER.
YEAH, BUT CARTER DIDN'T CRUSH THE GUY'S THROAT.
OKAY, WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?
A FORMAL APOLOGY TO MR. PEREZ AND HIS FAMILY
WOULD BE A GOOD PLACE TO START.
FINE. SOMETHING ELSE?
WELL, HEY, HEY, LOOK
I DIDN'T BRING THIS ON, MARKIE.
I'M GOING TO DO AS MUCH DAMAGE CONTROL AS I CAN
BUT I CAN'T MAKE ANY PROMISES.
THIS GUY'S FAMILY'S GOING TO BE COMING AT US
WITH BOTH BARRELS BLAZING.
THEY ARE GOING TO BE LOOKING FOR A SACRIFICIAL LAMB
AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU
RIGHT NOW, YOU ARE LOOKING PRETTY WOOLLY.
E.R.
HEY, JEANIE.
HOW'S CARLOS?
GOOD.
NO, NO, KERRY LEFT ALREADY.
MARK?
YEAH...
HE'S RIGHT HERE, HONEY.
HI, JEANIE.
IT'S MARK.
SORRY THAT I HAD TO RUSH OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF MY SHIFT.
YEAH, HE'S BETTER.
HE'S JUST A LITTLE WHEEZY.
WOULD YOU TELL KERRY
THAT I MIGHT BE A LITTLE LATE TOMORROW?
THANKS, MARK.
OKAY.
GOT TO GO.
BYE.
HEY, YOU.
HEY, BIG BOY.
HEY, BIG BOY.
OH.
HOW'S MY FAVORITE LITTLE MAN?
HMM?
HOW'S MY FAVORITE LITTLE MAN?
JOHN.
HI.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
CAN I COME IN?
IF YOU WANT ME TO LEAVE, JUST SAY SO.
I DON'T WANT YOUR SYMPATHY.
I KNOW.
GABE?
HEY, KERRY.
EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?
I THINK SOMEBODY STOLE MY CAR.
WHAT?
I NEVER LEAVE IT UNLOCKED, BUT MAYBE I DID.
I DON'T KNOW.
YOU KNOW, I LEFT THE HOUSE
IN SUCH A HURRY THIS MORNING.
AND ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE ON THIS LEVEL?
WHAT?
DID YOU PARK ON THIS LEVEL?
OH, YEAH, YEAH, I...
EVERY DAY, I PARK ON FOUR
SO I... YOU KNOW
SO I WON'T HAVE TO FIGHT FOR A SPACE.
THIS IS THREE.
WHAT AN IDIOT.
( chuckling )
YOU KNOW, AFTER A WHILE
THEY ALL LOOK THE SAME.
I SWEAR, I-I'D FORGET MY HEAD IF IT WASN'T ATTACHED.
DO YOU WANT ME TO HELP YOU FIND IT?
NO, NO-NO-NO-NO-NO-NO, THANKS.
PLEASE, I'M-I'M...
I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW.
OKAY, GOOD NIGHT, GABE.
YEAH, GOOD NIGHT.
