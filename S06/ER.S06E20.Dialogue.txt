( sighs )
David: MARK...
MARK, I'M COLD.
ALL RIGHT, DAD.
I'LL GET YOU A BLANKET.
DID YOU GET ANY SLEEP?
YOU LOOK AWFUL.
I'M FINE.
I NEED TO TURN UP YOUR OXYGEN, DAD.
IF YOU STILL HAVE TROUBLE BREATHING
WE'LL HAVE TO PUT YOU ON A MASK.
NO MASK.
WE'LL SEE.
YOU OUGHT TO GO BACK TO WORK.
MAYBE LATER.
I WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE COMFORTABLE.
IN THAT CASE, HOW ABOUT A DRINK?
WHAT?
I'VE GOT A HANKERING FOR A BLOODY MARY.
YOUR MOTHER USED TO MAKE THEM FOR BRUNCH.
I DON'T THINK THAT'S SUCH A GOOD IDEA.
WHY? YOU THINK IT'S GOING TO KILL ME?
WITH OR WITHOUT WORCESTERSHIRE?
WITHOUT.
BUT I'LL TAKE A DASH OF TABASCO.
( grunts )
( knocking on door )
Millicent: JOHN?
YEAH.
WHAT'S ALL THE RACKET?
OH, SORRY.
I'M JUST TRYING TO GET BACK INTO SHAPE.
WHEN DID YOU GET THIS EQUIPMENT?
( grunting )
COUPLE OF DAYS AGO.
I DIDN'T MEAN TO WAKE YOU.
YOU KNOW ME-- I'M UP WITH THE BIRDS.
HOW DID YOU SLEEP?
LIKE A BABY.
GOOD.
WELL, I'LL LET YOU GET BACK TO YOUR REGIMEN.
TOAST AND COFFEE FOR BREAKFAST?
( exhaling )
I FEEL LIKE PANCAKES TODAY.
WELL, I THINK WE CAN MANAGE THAT.
MORNING.
MORNING.
IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?
I ONLY GOT YOUR ANSWERING MACHINE THE LAST FEW DAYS.
OH, I'M REALLY SORRY.
IT'S BEEN CRAZY.
TESS HAD A BAD COLD.
THE KITCHEN WAS BEING REPAINTED
SO WE'VE BEEN STAYING AT MY MOM'S.
WELL, ANYWAY, HAPPY BIRTHDAY.
LUKA, THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL.
I PICKED THEM FROM MY GARDEN.
M-M-MY NEIGHBOR'S GARDEN, ACTUALLY.
HOW DID YOU KNOW IT WAS MY BIRTHDAY?
I HAVE MY WAYS.
DR. KOVAC, WE NEED YOU.
G.S.W. COMING IN.
SEE YOU LATER.
OKAY.
( sighs )
YOU'RE LOOKING SHARP, CARTER.
WHERE YOU BEEN?
I... WAS ACTUALLY CHECKING OUT CONDOS IN LINCOLN PARK.
VERY TRENDY.
AND EXPENSIVE.
TOO MANY DAMN YUPPIES IF YOU ASK ME.
YOU'RE A YUPPIE, DAVE.
NO WAY.
YOUNG, URBAN PROFESSIONAL-- THAT'S YOU.
I AM NOT.
HEY, CHIEF, AM I A YUPPIE?
NO, BUT YOU WILL BE WHEN YOU GROW UP.
LOOK, DR. GREENE WON'T BE IN TONIGHT.
I NEED SOMEBODY TO COVER HIS SHIFT AGAIN.
CARTER? MALUCCI?
ALL NIGHT?
YEAH, YOU CAN FLIP FOR IT.
I'LL DO IT.
YOU WILL?
I'M THE SENIOR RESIDENT.
IT'S MY RESPONSIBILITY.
THANK YOU, DR. CARTER.
YOU CAN TAKE A NAP LATER.
MALUCCI WILL COVER FOR YOU.
DR. WEAVER, YOUR E.M.S. MEETING'S BEEN CHANGED TO 10:00.
THIS MORNING? YEAH.
WHERE'S CAROL? OVER THERE.
CAROL.
CAROL!
HEY, CAROL, YOU DIDN'T HEAR ME CALL YOU?
NO, WHAT'S UP?
I NEED THE PARAMEDIC COMPLIANCE DATA
ON ASPIRIN IN CHEST PAIN.
OKAY, I'LL GET TO IT.
I PUT A MEMO IN YOUR BOX LAST WEEK.
YOU DIDN'T SEE IT?
OH, GOD, KERRY, I MUST HAVE FORGOT.
THE MEETING'S IN TWO HOURS.
I KNOW IT'S A LOT, BUT I NEED YOU TO COMPILE THE DATA.
I WILL, I WILL GET TO IT.
YOU'LL DO IT? I WILL DO IT.
I MADE YOU SOME FRENCH TOAST.
YOU WANT THE TV ON?
NO.
OKAY, DAD, LEAN FORWARD.
( groaning )
ARE YOU IN PAIN?
WHEN I TAKE A BREATH.
( groaning )
PROBABLY PLEURISY
FROM THE PNEUMONIA.
WE'LL TRY TORADOL.
HUH?
THIS OUGHT TO MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER.
HUNGRY?
NO.
COME ON, WHY DON'T YOU EAT?
FOR ME, HUH?
JUST TAKE ONE BITE.
PLEASE?
I'LL... EAT.
HIS LUNGS ARE STILL WET.
WHAT DID YOU GIVE HIM?
LASIX, NITRO AND MORPHINE. EXCELLENT.
BUT HIS BLOOD GAS SHOWS HE'S ACIDEMIC AND RETAINING CO2.
HIS PULSE OX IS DROPPING-- 85.
HE'S TIRING OUT.
CONNIE, SET US UP FOR AN INTUBATION.
MR. REMMES, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO PUT A TUBE
DOWN YOUR THROAT, OKAY?
ANYTHING TO HELP ME BREATHE.
THIS ONE'S A LITTLE TOUGH.
HAVE YOU EVER DONE A C-O-P-D-er BEFORE?
NEVER TUBED ANYBODY.
WELL, TIME TO STEP UP TO THE PLATE.
HEY, I HEARD YOU GUYS HAD A PATIENT IN RESPIRATORY DISTRESS.
WE'RE ON TOP OF IT-- I WAS JUST ABOUT
TO TAKE ABBY THROUGH AN INTUBATION.
GOOD, THEN WE CAN TRY THIS NEW AIRWAY CAM.
ABBY, IF YOU DON'T MIND
I'LL SLIP THIS RIGHT AROUND YOUR HEAD
AND AS SHE INTUBATES
WE'LL BE ABLE TO SEE EXACTLY
WHAT SHE SEES ON THE TV AND MAKE ANY ADJUSTMENTS.
COOL.
YOU READY, ABBY?
YEAH.
HI, MOM.
DAVE, WHY DON'T YOU GIVE YOUR PATIENT
20 OF ETOMIDATE AND START BAGGING HIM.
YEAH, RIGHT.
EVERYTHING LOOKS OKAY.
NO BLEEDING?
NOPE.
GOOD, NOW I CAN GO HOME.
YOU VOMITED BLOOD AND FAINTED AT WORK.
THE I.V. NEEDS TO SAY IN A WHILE LONGER.
BUT YOU SAID I COULD LEAVE IF EVERYTHING CHECKED OUT.
YES, BUT YOUR POTASSIUM LEVEL'S LOW.
WE NEED TO REPLENISH IT.
WHERE'D YOU PUT THE LAB SLIP?
THE PRINTER'S DOWN.
I GOT IT OFF THE COMPUTER.
Claire: YOU'VE WASTED ENOUGH OF MY TIME ALREADY.
NURSE, GET MY CLOTHES.
WHOA...
WHAT'S WRONG?
UH, NOTHING.
JUST A LITTLE DIZZY FROM SITTING UP TOO FAST.
YOUR PULSE IS WEAK
WHICH MEANS YOU'RE DEHYDRATED.
YOU CAN GO AFTER THIS FLUID RUNS IN.
ALL RIGHT...
BUT THAT'S IT.
THEN I'M OUT OF HERE.
OKAY.
LYDIA, CAN YOU ASSIST ME IN MAKING SURE
ALL OF CLAIRE'S DISCHARGE PAPERS ARE IN ORDER?
SURE.
HER GAG IS ABSENT
HER TOOTH ENAMEL IS ERODED
SHE'S SEVERELY MALNOURISHED
SHE'S ANORECTIC AND BULIMIC
AND I DON'T WANT HER LEAVING.
WHAT CAN WE DO?
WE'LL GET PSYCH DOWN HERE TO PUT A HOLD ON HER.
Weaver: WHAT HAVE YOU GOT?
HAMMER VERSUS SCALP.
WE'RE GOING UP TO C.T.
HAVE YOU SEEN CAROL?
NOT SINCE EARLY THIS MORNING. WHY?
SHE'S SUPPOSED TO BE WORKING ON MY PARAMEDIC DATA.
DID YOU PAGE HER? TWICE.
IT'S HER BIRTHDAY.
I BET SOME OF THE NURSES TOOK HER
TO DOC MAGOOS FOR BREAKFAST.
I CERTAINLY HOPE NOT.
ALL RIGHT. GO FOR IT, ABBY.
SCISSOR THE MOUTH APART.
ENTER ON THE RIGHT.
SWEEP THE TONGUE TO THE LEFT.
Malucci: SLIDE THAT BAD BOY
ALL THE WAY DOWN. LET'S GO.
HOLD ON. JUST ADVANCE SLOWLY UNTIL YOU SEE THE EPIGLOTTIS.
Abby: I SEE IT.
YEAH, SO CAN WE.
A LITTLE BIT MORE.
NOW LIFT IT UP WITH YOUR TIP.
THIS IS PRETTY COOL, CARTER, I GOT TO ADMIT.
NO, WAIT, LIFT IN THE DIRECTION
OF THE HANDLE.
MAN, YOU COULD HAVE A LOT OF FUN WITH THIS CAMERA, HUH?
I SEE THE VOCAL CORDS.
GOOD, NOW PASS THE TUBE.
GOOD.
THAT WASN'T SO HARD.
IT'S EASY WHEN YOU GOT A GOOD TEACHER.
YOU'RE RIGHT.
DAD, YOU'RE WHEEZING AGAIN.
YOU WANT ANOTHER BREATHING TREATMENT?
NO.
HAVING ANY CHEST PAIN?
NO.
THAT LAST STUFF WORKED PRETTY GOOD.
JUST MIXING UP YOUR ANTIBIOTICS.
( sighs )
DAMN IT.
WHAT?
IT BROKE.
OW!
NOW WHAT?
I CUT MY HAND.
YOU'RE BLEEDING ON THE FLOOR.
YEAH, YEAH, I KNOW.
SHOULDN'T YOU KEEP PRESSURE ON THAT?
I KNOW, DAD.
KEEP YOUR HAND ABOVE YOUR HEART.
THAT'S SUPPOSED TO STOP THE BLEEDING.
YOU NEED STITCHES.
I'M NOT LEAVING YOU HERE ALONE.
YOU'RE THE DOCTOR.
THE CIRCULATION IN YOUR LEG IS POOR, MR. FULTON.
WE NEED AN ARTERIOGRAM TO CHECK
YOUR BLOOD FLOW.
WHEN MY DAD FIRST CAME HERE
THE DOC COULDN'T FEEL A PULSE IN HIS FOOT.
WHEN WAS THAT?
ABOUT A MONTH AGO, RIGHT?
DOCTOR TOOK THE DEAD SKIN OFF HIS TOE
TOLD HIM TO SOAK IT, GAVE HIM SOME OINTMENT.
SHOE DIDN'T FIT RIGHT.
RUBBED MY TOE RAW.
WELL, THE TOE IS GANGRENOUS NOW
AND YOU HAVE AN ULCERATION ON YOUR LEG.
WE WILL HAVE TO OPERATE.
HOW BAD IS IT?
WE'LL PROBABLY HAVE TO AMPUTATE BELOW THE KNEE.
AMPUTATE?
HOW COULD THIS HAPPEN? THAT FIRST DOCTOR GAVE MY DAD SOME PILLS
AND TOLD HIM TO TAKE AN ASPIRIN.
WE NEVER KNEW THIS COULD BE THIS SERIOUS.
DO YOU REMEMBER WHO TREATED YOUR FATHER?
SOME FOREIGN GUY.
KOVAC? YEAH.
DR. KOVAC.
LYDIA, I'M OFF TO MARK'S.
IS IT HIS DAD?
NO, MARK CUT HIS HAND. HE NEEDS SUTURES.
PETER'S COVERING FOR ME.
MAKE SURE PSYCH COMES DOWN HERE TO SEE CLAIRE.
DON'T WORRY. SHE'S NOT GOING ANYWHERE.
I PUT HER ON A SLOW DRIP.
SHE'S GOT A COUPLE MORE HOURS LEFT ON THAT BAG.
THANKS.
YEAH, I'M STILL MASSAGING THE DATA.
I'LL MAKE THE PRESENTATION IN JUNE
WITH THREE MONTHS' WORTH OF FIGURES.
OKAY, THANKS.
CAROL, WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?
DAY CARE. TESS HAS BEEN CRANKY ALL MORNING.
I JUST POSTPONED MY MEETING
'CAUSE I DIDN'T HAVE YOUR REPORT.
AW, I DIDN'T GET A CHANCE TO FINISH IT.
YOU'RE THE PARAMEDICAL LIAISON NURSE.
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO STAY ON TOP OF THE STATS.
I'VE JUST BEEN INCREDIBLY BUSY.
YOU SHOULD'VE HAVE GIVEN THE JOB TO ANOTHER NURSE.
I CAN HANDLE IT. I KNOW YOUR BABIES TAKE A LOT OF TIME.
SO, IF YOU NEED TO CUT BACK ON YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES...
NO, I'M FINE.
ARE YOU SURE? I CAN'T AFFORD
TO HAVE THINGS FALL THROUGH THE CRACKS.
I CAN HANDLE IT.
GOOD.
CAROL?
WHAT?
DELIVERY GUY DROPPED THIS OFF.
I SIGNED FOR IT.
OH, GOD, IT'S, UH, FROM DOUG.
LET'S SEE. WHAT DID HE GIVE YOU?
ANIMAL CRACKERS.
THAT'S A WEIRD BIRTHDAY PRESENT.
NO.
IT'S THIS THING WE USED TO DO.
WHENEVER HE'D GO
TO THE STORE, HE'D COME BACK WITH A BOX OF ANIMAL CRACKERS
AND I'D ALWAYS PUT ONE IN HIS CHRISTMAS STOCKING.
KIND OF LIKE A TRADITION, HUH?
I'LL TAKE THE FOREIGN BODY IN THE EYE.
CARTER'S GOT IT.
THEN I'LL TAKE THE HIP DISLOCATION.
CARTER'S GOT THAT ONE, TOO.
TELL DR. CARTER IF HE WANTS TO SEE
ALL THE PATIENTS
I'LL BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO GO HOME.
HE LEFT YOU MR. BARCLAY IN CHAIRS.
WOUND CHECK. SWELL.
MR. BARCLAY?
FINALLY. I'VE BEEN WAITING OUT HERE FOR THREE HOURS.
THIS THING'S BEEN DRAINING LIKE CRAZY.
MALUCCI, YOUR C.H.F. GUY DROPPED HIS SATS.
SIR, YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GO BACK TO CHAIRS.
WHAT THE HELL'S TAKING SO LONG?!
MY PATIENT JUST STOPPED BREATHING.
DR. CHEN, WOULD YOU TAKE THIS GUY?
YEAH, SURE.
I BURNED MY ARM LAST WEEK
CLEANING OUT THE FURNACE.
IT HURT LIKE A SON OF A BITCH.
WELL, WHY DON'T YOU REMOVE THE GAUZE, LET ME TAKE A LOOK.
HEY, DOC. EXCUSE ME.
KENNY LATTIMER, FOUR.
BEEN SEIZING FOR 20 MINUTES. NO RESPONSE TO TWO OF ATIVAN.
PLEASE HELP HIM.
DON'T WORRY, MR. LATTIMER.
WE'LL TAKE GOOD CARE OF KENNY.
YOSH, PREP THE PEDES E.R. AND DRAW UP ANOTHER TWO OF ATIVAN.
HEY, I WAS HERE FIRST!
ATIVAN'S ON BOARD.
DRAW A C.B.C.
LYTES, ACCUCHECK AND CATH A URINE.
PULSE OX IS DROPPING-- 92.
HAS KENNY EVER HAD SEIZURES BEFORE?
NEVER.
HE'S ALWAYS BEEN PERFECTLY HEALTHY.
COULD HE HAVE INGESTED ANY MEDICINE, POISON?
NO, WE KEEP EVERYTHING LOCKED UP.
HE COMPLAINED OF A SORE THROAT LAST NIGHT, THAT'S ALL.
ANY FEVER THIS MORNING?
JUST A LITTLE.
I TRIED TO GET HIM TO EAT BREAKFAST
BUT HE ONLY WANTED TO SLEEP
AND THEN THE NEXT THING I KNEW, HE WAS SHAKING.
PUSH 600 OF PHENOBARB OVER TEN MINUTES.
YOU WANT TO INTUBATE?
ONLY IF HIS SATS KEEP DROPPING.
HIS BLOOD GLUCOSE IS REALLY LOW-- IT'S UNDER 40.
SEIZURES CAN LOWER THE BLOOD SUGAR.
PUSH 50cc's OF D-25 AND GET WEAVER, NOW.
Benton: DR. KOVAC.
YES?
DO YOU REMEMBER SEEING A PATIENT, CHET FULTON
AFRICAN AMERICAN, EARLY 60s
CAME IN ABOUT A MONTH AGO
WITH VASCULAR INSUFFICIENCY AND AN ULCERATED TOE?
DO YOU HAVE HIS CHART?
YEAH, MR. FULTON'S BACK WITH GANGRENE.
YES, I REMEMBER HIM.
I DEBRIDED THE WOUND AND GAVE HIM TRENTAL.
SORRY HE'S BACK.
WELL, NOW I HAVE TO DO A BELOW THE KNEE AMPUTATION
WHICH PROBABLY COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED
IF HE HAD BEEN SEEN IN VASCULAR CLINIC.
AS YOU CAN SEE IN THE CHART
I MADE THE REFERRAL.
HE'S A HIGH-RISK PATIENT WITH NO INSURANCE.
HE LIVES ALONE. HE NEEDED FOLLOW-UP.
AND I PROVIDED THAT.
I MADE AN APPOINTMENT WITH VASCULAR.
I CAN'T BE RESPONSIBLE FOR HIS MEDICAL CARE OUTSIDE THE E.R.
RIGHT, BUT DID YOU PUT HIM ON THE NURSES' CALLBACK LIST
OR PHONE HIM YOURSELF?
DO YOU CALL BACK EVERY PATIENT
YOU SEE DOWN HERE?
THE ONES AT HIGH RISK, I DO.
REALLY?
OLDER AFRICAN-AMERICAN MEN ARE AT HIGH RISK FOR AMPUTATION
BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT TREATED AGGRESSIVELY. YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT.
I DO.
THEN WHY DIDN'T YOU CALL HIM?
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?
I'M SAYING THERE'S MORE TO EMERGENCY MEDICINE
THAN TREATING AND STREETING PATIENTS.
THAT'S ONE MORE THING YOU DON'T HAVE TO TEACH ME.
HOW LONG'S HE BEEN SEIZING?
Haleh: OVER 30 MINUTES.
LOAD HIM WITH DILANTIN, 300 MILLIGRAMS.
WHAT'S HIS BLOOD SUGAR?
STILL UNDER 40.
PUSH ANOTHER 50 OF D-25.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
HOW CAN THE GLUCOSE STILL BE SO LOW?
COULD BE AN INSULINOMA OR MAYBE A METABOLIC DISORDER.
HALEH, GET ME AN AMMONIA, AN INSULIN LEVEL
AND A URIC ACID.
THE SEIZURE STOPPED.
Weaver: OKAY, START HIM ON A DEXTROSE DRIP.
CHECK SUGAR EVERY 20 MINUTES.
HIS BRAIN CAN'T TOLERATE ANOTHER SEIZURE.
WHY ISN'T HE AWAKE?
IT'S NORMAL FOR HIM TO SLEEP
AFTER SOMETHING LIKE THIS.
BUT HE WILL WAKE UP, RIGHT?
WHY DON'T YOU STAY WITH HIM?
OTHERWISE, HE MIGHT BE FRIGHTENED
WAKING UP IN A STRANGE PLACE.
THANK YOU.
THANKS, DOCTOR.
THANKS.
GET A HEAD C.T. AND A E.E.G.
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?
I DON'T KNOW.
THAT D-25 SHOULD HAVE CORRECTED THE HYPOGLYCEMIA.
SOMETHING ELSE MUST BE GOING ON.
CHECK THE LABS, MAKE A DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
START HUNTING FOR ZEBRAS.
OKAY.
( I.V. alarm beeping )
HEY, CHUNY, IS THIS YOUR PATIENT?
NOPE, HE'S CAROL'S.
CAN YOU CHANGE THE I.V. BAG?
IT'S EMPTY.
NO, I GOT A GUY PUKING ALL OVER EXAM TWO.
CAROL, YOUR PATIENT IN CURTAIN THREE NEEDS A NEW I.V.
OH, YEAH, RIGHT.
HEY, CAROL, IT'S NOT LIKE YOU TO LET AN I.V. RUN DRY.
I'M SORRY.
IS THERE SOMETHING BOTHERING YOU?
I'M FINE.
ARE YOU SURE?
IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH ME
GO AHEAD AND SAY IT.
DON'T GET SO DEFENSIVE.
I'M JUST ASKING WHAT'S GOING ON.
I AM TAKING CARE OF TEN PATIENTS.
I HAVE TWO BABIES UP IN DAY CARE
AND YOU'RE CONSTANTLY ON MY BACK.
STAY ON TOP OF THINGS AND I WON'T
BOTHER YOU AGAIN.
45-YEAR-OLD GUY CROSSING THE "L" TRACKS
TRYING TO BEAT THE TRAIN GOT KNOCKED DOWN
BUT HE DIDN'T GET RUN OVER.
LUCKY GUY.
B.P. IS 80/40, GAVE A LITER OF SALINE
INTUBATED IN THE FIELD.
WHEN IS SOMEBODY GOING TO TAKE A LOOK AT MY ARM?
I CAME ALL THE WAY OVER HERE ON THE BUS!
Carter: JUST TAKE A SEAT.
AND THREE.
YOU GOT A COUPLE RIB FRACTURES HERE.
B.P. 75 PALP.
ALL RIGHT, MALIK, LET'S PREP FOR A CENTRAL LINE.
THIS GUY'S GOING TO NEED SOME FLUID.
ABSENT BREATH SOUNDS. THIS DUDE'S GOT A PNEUMO.
CHEST TUBE TRAY.
I'M PREPPING FOR CARTER.
WHY DOES IT TAKE SO LONG FOR A WOUND CHECK?
'CAUSE THIS GUY'S TRYING TO DIE ON US.
GET OUT OF HERE!
AS SOON AS I POP THIS BABY IN
HIS PRESSURE WILL SHOOT BACK UP.
YOU CAN'T ASSUME THAT. HE COULD BE LOSING BLOOD.
MALIK, STAND BY TO FLUID RESUSCITATE.
Malucci: EVER TELL YOU ABOUT MY FIRST CHEST TUBE?
LOVE TO HEAR IT, BUT SICK PEOPLE ARE WAITING. CIAO.
CLIFF DIVER HIT THE ROCKS. WHAT A MESS.
I'M IN. YOU DONE, DR. CARTER?
NOT YET. PRESSURE'S STILL 75.
SO MUCH FOR YOUR CHEST TUBE, DR. DAVE.
COULD BE BLOOD IN THE BELLY.
MALIK, GET ME AN ULTRASOUND.
THAT GUY JUST STOLE MY RIG!
WHAT GUY?
YOUR WOUND CHECK PATIENT.
THAT SUCKS.
YOU'RE GOOD AT THIS.
THANK YOU.
THE WAY YOU DID THE SUB-Q LAYER
YOU'LL HARDLY NEED TO CLOSE THE SKIN.
THAT'S THE POINT.
David ( slurring ): IS HE GIVING YOU
A HARD TIME OVER THERE?
NO, DAVID.
HE'S BEING A VERY GOOD PATIENT.
OKAY, WE'LL REMOVE THOSE IN FIVE DAYS.
SHOULDN'T LEAVE A SCAR.
THANKS.
KEEP IT DRY FOR TWO DAYS
AND PUT A PLASTIC BAG AROUND YOUR HAND
WHEN YOU TAKE A SHOWER.
I KNOW.
I KNOW YOU KNOW.
( David wheezing )
LOOKS LIKE HE'S HAVING DIFFICULTY BREATHING.
THINK I SHOULD GIVE HIM ANOTHER TREATMENT?
I CAN'T BREATHE
BUT I CAN
STILL HEAR EVERY WORD YOU SAY.
CAN I MAKE YOU SOME LUNCH?
I'M NOT HUNGRY.
BUT STAY, HAVE SOME TEA.
I'D LIKE THAT.
HEARD YOU'VE GOT AN UNSTABLE PATIENT.
BLUNT CHEST TRAUMA, TENSION PNEUMO.
STILL HYPERTENSIVE DESPITE A CHEST TUBE.
PROBABLY CRACKED HIS SPLEEN.
HIS NECK VEINS ARE ELEVATED.
LOW VOLTAGE ON THE E.K.G.
I'M WORRIED ABOUT FLUID AROUND
THE HEART. SHOULD BE WORRIED ABOUT THE BELLY.
LET'S CHECK FOR CARDIAC TAMPONADE.
I'D BE CHECKING THE BELLY.
YOU'RE RIGHT, CARTER.
HE'S GOT A BIG EFFUSION AROUND THE HEART.
GO FOR IT.
GIVE ME A SPINAL NEEDLE AND ALLIGATOR CLIP.
HERE, NOW YOU CAN CHECK THE BELLY.
WATCH FOR INJURY CURRENT.
BELLY'S LOOKING PRETTY CLEAN.
YOU'RE HITTING THE HEART. PULL BACK.
I'VE GOT GOOD RETURN.
OKAY, PULSE IS STRONGER.
NEED ANOTHER SYRINGE?
NO, I THINK I'M OKAY.
WHY DON'T YOU CALL FOR AN I.C.U. BED?
YEAH.
GOOD JOB, CARTER.
DR. WEAVER. YEAH?
I JUST DID A MEDLINE SEARCH ON THE BOY WITH SEIZURES.
AND?
HYPOGLYCEMIA, ELEVATED AMMONIA AND NO KETONES
ARE CONSISTENT WITH M-CAD, A RARE METABOLIC DISORDER.
GET A GENETICS CONSULT, TALK TO THE PARENTS.
GOOD PICK UP.
HOW YOU DOING?
OKAY.
LOOK, UH, I'M SORRY I CAME DOWN SO HARD ON YOU
BUT I DEPEND ON YOU.
YOU WERE RIGHT.
I NEED TO BE MORE ON TOP OF THINGS.
CAROL, YOU'RE THE BEST NURSE HERE
BUT SOMETHING'S GOING ON WITH YOU.
IS THERE ANYTHING I CAN DO TO HELP?
NOT REALLY.
I JUST NEED SOME TIME TO FIGURE A FEW THINGS OUT.
I'VE WORKED WITH YOU FOR FIVE YEARS.
I KNOW YOU.
I HATE MY LIFE.
( voice breaking ): I MEAN, I... I LOVE MY WORK
AND I LOVE MY DAUGHTERS, BUT...
HOW DID I END UP RAISING TWINS BY MYSELF?
IT'S JUST...
YOU KNOW, I THINK YOU NEED SOME TIME.
I THINK THAT YOU HAVE SOME SICK DAYS?
USED 'EM ALL UP.
IF YOU CHECK, I BELIEVE
YOU'LL FIND YOU HAVE SOME EXTRAS
THAT YOU CAN USE WHENEVER YOU LIKE.
THANK YOU, KERRY.
Mrs. Lattimer: YOU SAID KENNY WOULD WAKE UP.
Chen: YOUR SON'S GENETIC DISORDER PREVENTS HIM
FROM BURNING FAT
FOR ENERGY.
WHEN HE GOT SICK
HIS BLOOD SUGAR DROPPED AND THAT CAUSED HIS SEIZURE.
IS HE GOING TO HAVE BRAIN DAMAGE?
WE SHOULD WAIT FOR THE RESULTS OF THE E.E.G.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
KENNY WAS BORN HERE.
WHY DIDN'T SOMEONE TELL US
HE HAD THIS?
UNFORTUNATELY, CHICAGO HOSPITALS DON'T TEST FOR THESE
RARE METABOLIC DISORDERS.
ARE YOU SAYING OTHER HOSPITALS DO?
IN SOME STATES.
IF WE'D HAVE KNOWN
IS THERE ANYTHING WE COULD HAVE DONE?
DR. CHEN, PLEASE
TELL US.
IF YOU HAD GIVEN KENNY SUGAR WATER
WHEN HE FIRST GOT SICK
YOU COULD HAVE PREVENTED THE SEIZURE.
Mr. Lattimer: "SUGAR WATER"?
OH, MY GOD.
HEY, JUST SENT OUR PATIENT UP TO THE O.R.
HOPE YOU DIDN'T CAUSE ANY MYOCARDIAL DAMAGE.
NOT TO WORRY, DAVE.
IT WAS AS EASY AS THREADING A NEEDLE.
Man: Hello? I'm in an ambulance bringing in some sick people.
WHAT UNIT IS THIS?
How the hell should I know?
I was on my way to Mercy for a wound check
when they flagged me down.
WHO IS THIS?
Joe Barclay.
THAT'S YOUR WOUND CHECK GUY.
THIS IS COUNTY GENERAL.
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?
Heading back.
I got people here puking their guts out.
Ate some bad kielbasa.
IS THAT THE JERK THAT STOLE MY RIG?
ARE THE PATIENTS STABLE?
I don't know, man. They're puking.
DON'T LET THEM PUKE ON THE FLOOR.
I JUST CLEANED MY RIG.
I'M GOING TO LET YOU TAKE THIS ONE, DAVE.
YOU'VE ALREADY ESTABLISHED A RELATIONSHIP
WITH THE PATIENT.
CALL ME IF THERE'S ANY CHANGE.
I WILL.
DAVID, I'M LEAVING NOW.
I HAVE TO GET BACK TO THE HOSPITAL.
A DOCTOR'S WORK IS NEVER DONE.
I'M AFRAID SO.
WAIT, I HAVE SOMETHING I WANT TO GIVE YOU.
MARK, GET THAT LITTLE GREEN BOX OUT OF THE TOP DESK DRAWER.
IT'S NOT NECESSARY.
I KNOW.
THESE BELONGED TO MARK'S MOTHER.
I GAVE THEM TO HER ON HER WEDDING DAY.
I WANT YOU TO HAVE THEM.
I CAN'T.
PLEASE.
THEY'RE LOVELY.
THANK YOU.
DON'T JUST STAND THERE.
HELP HER PUT THEM ON.
SHE LOOKS BEAUTIFUL, DOESN'T SHE, MARK?
YEAH, SHE DOES.
Romano: HELLO, JING.
OH, IT'S JING-MEI.
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
YOU SEEM UPSET.
SOMEBODY DIE?
WE SHOULD BE SCREENING BABIES HERE
FOR RARE METABOLIC DISORDERS.
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
I TOOK CARE OF A LITTLE BOY TODAY WHO HAD A SEIZURE
BECAUSE WE DIDN'T GIVE HIM A $25 TEST WHEN HE WAS BORN.
WELL, IF WE TESTED
FOR EVERY GENETIC DISORDER IN THE BOOK
WE'D BE SPENDING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS
TO IDENTIFY A TINY HANDFUL OF KIDS.
OH...
BUT IF I HAD KNOWN WHAT HE HAD
I WOULD'VE TREATED HIM DIFFERENTLY.
I MIGHT'VE BEEN ABLE
TO STOP THE SEIZURE MORE QUICKLY.
DON'T BLAME YOURSELF.
IT'S ALL A QUESTION OF ALLOCATION OF PRECIOUS RESOURCES.
WE HAVE TO DRAW THE LINE SOMEWHERE.
WE SHOULD OFFER THE TESTS.
WELL, WE CAN'T AFFORD IT.
WHY DON'T YOU EXPLAIN THAT TO MY PATIENT'S FAMILY?
THEY'RE IN THE PICU
WAITING TO SEE IF THEIR SON EVER COMES OUT OF A COMA.
THEY WOULDN'T STOP PUKING.
STRONG RADIAL PULSE HERE.
THIS GUY IS STABLE.
BELLY'S SOFT ON THIS ONE.
I GOT A FATHER/ DAUGHTER M.V.A.
CAN YOU GIVE ME A HAND?
THESE GUYS ARE FINE.
START A LITER OF SALINE
AND TITRATE FIVE TO TEN OF COMPAZINE.
COME ON, ABBY, LET'S GO.
COME IN WITH ME.
CAN I GET MY WOUND CHECK?
OH, YEAH, YOU'LL GET YOUR WOUND CHECK.
REAR-ENDED WHILE STOPPED AT A RED LIGHT.
SIX-YEAR-OLD GIRL RESTRAINED IN THE BACK SEAT
COMPLAINS OF NECK PAINS.
I WANT TO STAY WITH MY DADDY.
DR. DAVE WILL TAKE GOOD CARE OF YOU.
DAVE, WORK HER UP.
ABBY AND I WILL TAKE THE DAD.
DRIVER'S A 35-YEAR-OLD MALE, NO SEAT BELT--
KNEE VS. DASHBOARD.
ALSO GOT A FACIAL LAC.
WAS THE WIFE INFORMED?
DIVORCED-- SHE LIVES IN PITTSBURGH.
DAUGHTER WAS HERE FOR TWO WEEKS.
LOOKS LIKE A DISLOCATED KNEE.
MY KNEE HURTS LIKE YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE.
HAD SIX OF M.S.
LET'S GIVE HIM ANOTHER TEN OF MORPHINE.
NO. YOU EVER REDUCE A PATELLA?
WELL, YOU WILL NOW.
DID YOU SEE MY PATIENT?
I'M JUST FINISHING THE NOTE.
THANK YOU.
DON'T THANK ME YET.
I'M REMOVING THE PSYCH HOLD.
YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS.
THIS YOUNG WOMAN'S STARVING HERSELF TO DEATH.
SHE MIGHT BE, BUT I CAN'T COMPEL HER
TO STAY AGAINST HER WILL.
SHE HAS A JOB, SHE'S NOT DELUSIONAL
AND SHE'S NOT AN IMMEDIATE THREAT
TO HERSELF OR ANYBODY ELSE.
SHE COULD GO INTO KIDNEY FAILURE, ARRHYTHMIA...
WHAT DOES IT TAKE FOR HER TO GET TREATMENT?
HER CONSENT.
LOTS OF PEOPLE DO BAD THINGS TO THEMSELVES.
THEY SMOKE, THEY DRINK, THEY EAT FATTY FOODS
AND THEY DRIVE WITHOUT SEAT BELTS
BUT WE DON'T LOCK THEM UP.
SO, WE'RE SUPPOSED TO STAND BY AND DO NOTHING?
CLAIRE HAS THE RIGHT TO MAKE HER OWN DECISIONS
EVEN IF THEY'RE BAD ONES.
WELL, THERE'S GOT TO BE SOMETHING I CAN DO.
IF YOU CAN CONVINCE HER TO STAY
I'LL ADMIT HER TO THE PSYCH WARD.
OTHERWISE, YOU'LL HAVE TO DISCHARGE HER
AFTER YOU'VE BUFFED HER UP.
IS THE WATER TOO WARM, DAD?
NO... NO.
WHERE'S ELIZABETH?
SHE LEFT A COUPLE OF HOURS AGO.
DO...
YOU HAVE TO GO TO WORK?
NO, DAD.
I'M GOING TO STAY RIGHT HERE.
OKAY?
HERE.
LAY BACK.
( moans softly )
HAVING ANY PAIN?
NO.
NO.
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
YEAH.
YOU LOOK TIRED.
WH-WHAT IS THAT SOAP?
IT'S JUST... PLAIN OLD IVORY.
THAT'S WHAT YOUR MOTHER USED.
I REMEMBER.
EVERY NIGHT, WHEN SHE WOULD TUCK ME IN...
SHE'D GIVE ME A KISS
AND I COULD SMELL THE SOAP ON HER FACE.
THIS USED TO BE MY JOB.
WHAT'S THAT?
GIVING YOU A BATH
WHEN YOU WERE A BABY.
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.
YOU'RE A GOOD DOCTOR.
THE DAY YOU BECAME A DOCTOR
( voice cracking ): WAS THE PROUDEST DAY OF MY LIFE.
( breathing restlessly )
SHH...
( whispering ): IT'S OKAY, DAD.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO TALK.
SHH-SHH-SHH...
I LOVE YOU, MARK.
I LOVE YOU, TOO, DAD.
OKAY?
SHH...
SHH...
( Velcro ripping )
SHELL, YOU DOING OKAY?
YEAH. WHEN CAN I GET UP?
WELL, AS SOON AS THEY TAKE A LOOK AT YOUR X RAY.
LILY, SEND OFF A C.B.C., DIP A URINE
AND CHECK A BEDSIDE CRIT.
HEMOCUE'S IN THE OTHER ROOM.
THAT'S TWO OF VERSED.
PRETTY RELAXED.
ALL RIGHT, I'LL KEEP THE HIP FLEXED NOW.
KEEPING THE KNEE IN EXTENSION
YOU'RE GOING TO APPLY GENTLE PRESSURE DIRECTED MEDIALLY.
LIKE THIS?
( pops )
PERFECT.
HOW ARE YOU GUYS DOING IN THERE?
KID'S STABLE.
HE'S CLEARING THE NECK.
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT?
SIX-YEAR-OLD WITH A MINOR M.V.A.
PROBABLY JUST A WHIPLASH.
I TOOK A LATERAL C-SPINE
ABOUT TO DO MY SECONDARY SURVEY.
CAREFUL.
DON'T!
OH, IT'S OKAY, SHELLY.
WE JUST HAVE TO EXAMINE YOU, ALL RIGHT?
WE'LL-WE'LL COVER YOU WITH A SHEET.
WHOA.
WHAT IS IT? SHE'S GOT BRUISES
ON HER THIGHS AND BLOOD IN HER UNDERPANTS.
COULD BE... A URETHRAL INJURY
FROM A PELVIC FRACTURE?
LILY, WE NEED A PLAIN FILM
AND A CYSTOURETHROGRAM, ALL RIGHT?
HOLD ON, HOLD ON.
DOES THIS HURT, SWEETHEART?
NO.
THERE'S NO PELVIC FRACTURE.
YOU'VE GOT SOME BLOOD IN YOUR UNDERPANTS.
DID YOU HURT YOURSELF?
I WANT TO GO HOME.
UM... SHELLY, WE'RE HERE TO HELP YOU.
I JUST NEED TO ASK YOU A FEW QUESTIONS, OKAY?
OKAY.
HAS ANYONE EVER TOUCHED YOU WHERE YOU GO TO THE BATHROOM?
WHAT HAPPENED?
SOMETIMES, MY DADDY PLAYS A GAME WITH ME.
IT'S OKAY. YOU CAN TELL US.
IT HURTS.
DON'T WORRY, HE'S NEVER GOING TO HURT YOU AGAIN.
OKAY?
YOU SICK SON OF A BITCH. WHAT DID YOU DO TO HER?
HEY, EASY!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
WHAT?! HE MOLESTED HIS DAUGHTER.
SHE'S GOT SIGNS OF ABUSE!
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
I NEVER TOUCHED HER.
ALL RIGHT, MR. BURKE, I'M SORRY.
DAVE, OUTSIDE.
ABBY, MALIK, PLEASE KEEP AN EYE ON THINGS.
YOU CANNOT GO OFF LIKE THAT ON A PATIENT.
YEAH, HE RAPED HIS DAUGHTER.
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.
CALL SOCIAL SERVICES AND HAVE CLEO DO A PELVIC.
ALL RIGHT, I'LL ASSIST.
NOT AFTER WHAT HAPPENED.
SHE TRUSTS ME.
I THINK THAT'S A REALLY BAD IDEA, DAVE.
WELL, I'M GOING TO ASSIST.
Kovac: OKAY, YOU'LL FEEL A LITTLE STING.
I HEARD KERRY WAS OUT FOR YOUR BLOOD.
SHE WAS PRETTY UPSET.
I CAN TALK TO HER IF YOU LIKE.
OH, NO, WE WORKED IT OUT.
WELL, YOU'D THINK SHE COULD CUT YOU
A LITTLE SLACK ON YOUR BIRTHDAY.
DO YOU HAVE PLANS TO CELEBRATE?
UH, NO.
I DON'T LIKE TO LEAVE THE GIRLS WITH A BABY-SITTER
WHEN I'VE BEEN AT WORK ALL DAY.
NO PROBLEM.
I CAN COOK YOU A BIRTHDAY DINNER...
EVEN DO THE DISHES.
OKAY.
I BETTER GET THESE THINGS TO THE LAB.
DR. CHEN...
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?
THE DOCTOR UPSTAIRS TOLD ME
THAT KENNY MAY HAVE PERMANENT BRAIN DAMAGE.
I'M SO SORRY.
THIS IS KENNY'S BABY SISTER, EMMA.
THE SITTER DROPPED HER OFF.
SHE'S BEAUTIFUL.
I WANT YOU TO GIVE HER THAT TEST
THAT YOU TALKED ABOUT...
PLEASE.
I CAN'T FORCE HER TO STAY
BUT I WAS HOPING THAT SHE'D LISTEN TO YOU.
I LOVE MY DAUGHTER.
I'D DO ANYTHING TO HELP HER.
I'M SURE YOU WOULD.
SHE'S EXHAUSTED FROM NOT EATING.
MY GOD...
SHE'S SKIN AND BONES.
YOU TOLD THE MOTHER?
I HAD NO CHOICE.
SHE'S OVER 18.
SHE HAS A TERRIBLE DISEASE.
I HAD TO DO SOMETHING.
Malucci: "I WOULD NOT LIKE THEM HERE OR THERE.
I WOULD NOT LIKE THEM ANYWHERE."
"I DO NOT LIKE GREEN EGGS AND HAM.
I DO NOT LIKE THEM, SAM-I-AM."
( clicks )
YOU'RE GOING TO FEEL MY HANDS NOW.
"WOULD YOU LIKE THEM IN A HOUSE?
"WOULD YOU LIKE THEM WITH A MOUSE?
"I DO NOT LIKE THEM IN A HOUSE.
I DO NOT LIKE THEM WITH A MOUSE."
"I DO NOT LIKE THEM HERE OR THERE.
I DO NOT LIKE THEM ANYWHERE."
IT'S ALMOST THROUGH.
SHE'S GOT BLEEDING
FROM COMPLETE TRANSECTION OF HER HYMEN.
CAN WE KEEP READING?
YEAH, YEAH, OF... YEAH.
"I DO NOT LIKE GREEN EGGS AND HAM
I DO NOT LIKE THEM, SAM-I-AM."
( moans softly )
HEY, CARTER, YOU WANT TO ORDER DINNER?
WE'RE GOING TO THE LUCKY MOON.
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
GET ME KUNG PAO CHICKEN
MU SHU PORK AND A SIDE OF EGG ROLLS.
WOW, YOU'RE HUNGRY.
I'M GOING TO SAVE THE MOO SHU FOR LATER.
55-YEAR-OLD WITH CHEST PAIN.
JUST DROPPED HIS PRESSURE TO 80.
HE'S GOT S.T. ELEVATION IN V-1 THROUGH V-4.
HIS LUNGS ARE WET.
I'M GOING TO TUBE HIM.
HALEH, GET ME AN 8-0.
START DOPAMINE.
PULSE OX IS 82.
I'LL BAG HIM.
DO YOU WANT ME TO CALL THE CATH LAB?
YEAH. TELL THEM WE'VE GOT A HOT M.I.
HE'S TACHY AT 130.
DAMN IT.
GET ME SOME SUCTION.
YOU WANT CRICOID PRESSURE?
YEAH.
YOUR KID WITH BEE STINGS IS CRASHING.
OKAY, I'M IN. BAG HIM.
YOU WANT ME TO TAKE IT?
NO, GET THIS GUY'S PRESSURE UP
AND TAKE HIM TO THE CATH LAB.
PRESSURE'S DOWN TO 75 PALP.
SHOULD I INCREASE THE DOPAMINE?
NO, HOLD ON.
THERE'S A PANSYSTOLIC MURMUR I DIDN'T HEAR BEFORE.
MITRAL REGURGE?
NO, HE'S GOT A PARASTERNAL THRILL.
COULD BE SEPTAL PERFORATION.
GIVE ME AN 8 FRENCH CORDIS INTRODUCER.
YOU'RE PUTTING IN A CENTRAL LINE?
YEAH, AND THEN I'LL FLOAT A SWAN.
WE DON'T DO THOSE DOWN HERE.
WE DON'T HAVE SWAN MODULES.
GET ONE FROM THE I.C.U.
IT'S AGAINST POLICY.
I JUST NEED TO SAMPLE A LITTLE BLOOD
FROM THE RIGHT SIDE OF HIS HEART
TO MAKE THE DIAGNOSIS.
COME ON, LET'S GO.
CARTER, WE CAN'T DO THIS.
ALL RIGHT, I'LL DO IT MYSELF.
I'M GETTING DR. KOVAC.
KERRY, DID SOMEONE PAGE ME?
I DID.
MARK'S FATHER PASSED AWAY A LITTLE WHILE AGO.
HOW'S MARK?
HE'S ALL RIGHT.
HE SAID THAT HE WOULD CALL YOU
AS SOON AS THE FUNERAL HOME LEAVES.
I'M GOING OVER THERE AS SOON AS I FINISH UP.
PETER'S STILL ON CALL.
WOULD YOU MIND
ASKING HIM TO COVER?
NOT AT ALL.
DR. CORDAY, WE NEED YOU RIGHT NOW.
Claire: I'M LEAVING.
I WANT THIS I.V. OUT NOW!
CLAIRE, PLEASE DON'T DO THIS.
SHE WON'T LISTEN TO REASON.
CLAIRE, YOU'RE ANORECTIC.
YOU NEED TO BE HOSPITALIZED.
THAT'S NOT WHAT THAT SHRINK TOLD ME.
WE CAN'T FORCE YOU TO STAY
BUT YOU COULD DIE WITHOUT TREATMENT.
TAKE THIS DAMN THING OUT!
ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT, LYDIA, REMOVE THE I.V.
I NEVER SAID THAT YOU COULD CALL MY MOTHER.
I'M AN ADULT.
I CAN DO WHAT I WANT.
YOU'RE RIGHT, YOU'RE RIGHT.
I'M SORRY.
I WAS ONLY TRYING TO SAVE YOU.
I DON'T WANT YOUR HELP.
A FRIEND OF MINE DIED TODAY
FIGHTING FOR HIS LIFE.
YOU WANT TO LEAVE?
FINE, KILL YOURSELF.
IF YOU DON'T GIVE A DAMN, NEITHER DO I.
DISCHARGE HER.
THERE... I'M IN THE R.V.
LILY, DRAW BLOOD FROM THE DISTAL PORT.
BLOOD'S BRIGHT RED.
I KNEW IT.
THIS GUY'S GOT A HOLE IN HIS HEART
LEAKING OXYGENATED BLOOD TO THE RIGHT SIDE.
PRESSURE'S STILL LOW.
START NIPRIDE AND CALL THE O.R.
TELL THEM WE NEED A HEART ROOM.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
I SAID GET HIM TO THE CATH LAB.
I'M ADVANCING TO THE PULMONARY ARTERY.
WE DON'T DO SWANS HERE.
I TOLD HIM THAT.
THIS GUY SHOULD BE GETTING ANGIOPLASTY.
HE WOULD HAVE DIED
IN THE CATH LAB.
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
I USED THE SWAN TO SAMPLE BLOOD
FROM THE RIGHT VENTRICLE.
IT'S BRIGHT RED.
PERFED HIS SEPTUM.
WHAT ABOUT HIS M.I.?
THEY CAN BYPASS HIM WHEN THEY FIX THE RUPTURE.
GRAB THOSE I.V.s.
PUT THEM ON THE POLE.
THE O.R.'s WAITING.
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO WORK TOGETHER.
NEXT TIME YOU TELL ME WHAT YOU ARE DOING.
CAN'T YOU GIVE ME SOMETHING?
JUST AS COUPLE MORE SUTURES
THEN THEY'RE TAKING YOU TO JAIL.
OW! YOU'RE HURTING ME, DAMN IT.
SORRY.
Burke: HEY, MAKE HIM STOP. HE'S KILLING ME.
DR. MALUCCI, YOUR PATIENT'S IN PAIN.
HE NEEDS MORE LIDOCAINE.
I DID AN INFRAORBITAL BLOCK.
YOU MUST HAVE MISSED THE NERVE.
INFILTRATE LOCALLY.
IF I DO THAT, IT WILL DISTORT THE WOUND EDGES.
INFILTRATE SUBCUTANEOUSLY OR I'M GOING TO TAKE OVER.
FINE.
YOU DO IT.
DR. CHEN, WE KEEP MEETING IN SUCH ODD PLACES.
YOU PAGED ME FOR A CONSULT?
UH, YES, BUT FIRST I WANTED YOU TO MEET MRS. LATTIMER.
SHE'S THE MOTHER OF THE LITTLE BOY I TOLD YOU ABOUT.
OH, HEY, HEY, I'M TERRIBLY SORRY ABOUT YOUR SON.
THANK YOU.
I TOLD MRS. LATTIMER THAT WE WOULD TEST HER BABY GIRL.
OH, THAT'S AN EXCELLENT IDEA.
DR. CHEN WAS TELLING ME THAT IF HOSPITALS SCREENED EVERY NEWBORN
HUNDREDS OF LIVES MIGHT BE SAVED.
AND SINCE THE TEST ONLY COST $25...
I'M SORRY, I HAVE A HOT APPY WAITING FOR ME
SO IF YOU CAN SHOW ME WHERE MY CONSULT IS.
OH, THIS IS NOT A SURGICAL CONSULT.
IT'S NOT?
NO.
I'M SPONSORING A PETITION TO HAVE COUNTY GENERAL
OFFER EXPANDED NEWBORN GENETIC TESTING.
I TOLD MRS. LATTIMER
AND SHE WANTED TO MEET YOU.
EVEN THOUGH KENNY DIDN'T GET THE TEST
AT LEAST SOME GOOD WILL COME OUT OF ALL THIS.
MM-HMM.
SO, DR. ROMANO, IF YOU WOULD JUST SIGN
ON THE BOTTOM PAGE.
WELL, LIKE I TELL ALL MY RESIDENTS--
WHAT'S GOOD FOR COUNTY... IS GOOD FOR ME.
KERRY, HAVE YOU SEEN CAROL?
NOT IN A WHILE.
IF YOU DO, PLEASE TELL HER I'M LOOKING FOR HER.
OKAY. THANKS.
DR. CARTER, I HEARD YOU PERFORMED QUITE A HEROIC SAVE.
OH, JUST DOING WHAT I THOUGHT WAS BEST FOR MY PATIENT.
YEAH, WE HAVE ATTENDINGS HERE FOR A REASON--
TO SUPERVISE THE RESIDENTS.
FINE. NO, IT'S NOT FINE.
YOU DON'T PERFORM DANGEROUS PROCEDURES ALONE
IS THAT CLEAR, JOHN?
YEAH.
Olbes ( over radio ): We'll start the second I.V. en route.
E.T.A. is five minutes.
COPY 43. SEE YOU IN FIVE. I'LL BE SETTING UP TRAUMA ONE.
WE GOT MULTIPLE STAB WOUNDS TO THE CHEST COMING IN.
NO, THANKS. YOU INTERESTED?
HOW'S THAT LITTLE GIRL DOING?
THE CUTS WILL HEAL.
I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW.
SEE YOU.
Kovac: THERE YOU ARE.
I WAS LOOKING FOR YOU.
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
I'VE BEEN UP HERE THINKING.
YEAH.
BIRTHDAYS CAN MAKE YOU DO THAT.
IT'S BEEN... QUITE A YEAR.
YEAH. FOR ME, TOO.
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THE NEXT ONE.
LUKA, I'M SORRY.
I DON'T THINK I CAN HAVE DINNER WITH YOU TONIGHT.
DID I DO SOMETHING WRONG?
OH, NO.
NO, IT'S NOT YOU. I...
IT'S ME.
I'M SORRY, I GOT TO GO.
MARK?
HI.
I'M SO SORRY.
CAN I HELP WITH ANYTHING?
NOT REALLY.
I'VE CALLED ALL HIS NAVY PALS IN SAN DIEGO.
I JUST GOT OFF THE PHONE WITH RACHEL.
I'VE GOT SOME FORMS TO FILL OUT.
HIS TAXES...
MOM USED TO DO HIS TAXES, SO THEY'RE KIND OF A MESS
AND HIS HOUSE...
UH, I GOT TO SELL THE HOUSE.
I PROMISED HIM THAT I WOULDN'T SELL THE HOUSE
( voice breaking ): WHEN HE CAME OUT HERE...
( crying ): BUT I DON'T...
I DON'T SEE A REASON TO KEEP IT.
