TO GRAB MY DRY CLEANING BEFORE IT CLOSES.
WE'RE SLOW, I TAKE IT?
WE ARE NOW.
WHAT'S THAT MUSIC?
LOOKS LIKE NAIL POLISH TO ME.
IT'S BUFF, OKAY.
YOU GOT A MANICURE, MALIK?
HEY, MAN, THAT'S WHAT'S THE LADIES LIKE.
THAT'S THE FIRST THING
THEY CHECK OUT IS YOUR HANDS.
I CHECK OUT THEIR BUTT MYSELF.
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?
OH, THAT'S A MYTH.
I TESTED IT.
TESTED WHAT?
IT'S SO NOT WORTH EXPLAINING.
KERRY!
HAPPY VALENTINE'S DAY.
ISN'T THIS A LITTLE LOUD?!
SORRY!
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
OH. HI, CHIEF. YOU ON?

I SEE SOMEONE WENT OVERBOARD WITH THE HEARTS.
WHAT'S WRONG WITH THEM? NOTHING.
WANT SOME PIZZA? NO, THANKS.
ISN'T MARK STILL ON?
OH, HE LEFT AT 8:00.
DOUBLE DATE.
I'M ON TILL 9:00. MIGHTY FINE.
WE SLOWED DOWN.
NO ONE'S WAITING TO BE SEEN.
AND I TOOK OVER THEIR BOARD.
OKAY, EVERYONE.
ANOTHER FIVE MINUTES AND THEN BACK TO WORK.

Abby: I'M SORRY, MRS. MINEAR.
IT WAS A MISTAKE.
IT... WELL, YEAH.
WELL, I WAS EXPECTING SOME MONEY AND IT, UH...
I WAS, I WAS EXPECTING A CHECK TO CLEAR AND IT DIDN'T.
I'M SORRY, BUT I PROMISE...

I THOUGHT HE WAS THE MAN.
YEAH, SO DID MY NEIGHBOR.
OUCH.
LUCA, DO YOU HAVE ANYBODY YOU NEED TO HAND OFF?
OH, YEAH, IF YOU WANT.
ANKLE FILMS ARE BACK ON CUPID.
A SINGING TELEGRAM SLIPPED ON SOME ICE.
I NEED A DOC IN RADIOLOGY TO INJECT AN I.V. CONTRAST.
A PATIENT NAMED RODRIGUEZ.
I THINK THAT'S CARTER'S.
OKAY, FIND CARTER.
I NEED A BATH.
CAN I HAVE A BATH?
I NEED TO LOOK AT YOUR FOOT FIRST.
PABLO, YOU'RE ALIVE, HUH?
OH, YEAH, I'M ALIVE.
YEAH, WE HAVEN'T SEEN YOU IN OVER A YEAR.
THEY PUT ME ON A BUS.
A BUS? WHAT KIND OF A BUS?
A GREEN ONE.
A GREEN BUS. WHERE DID IT TAKE YOU?
OH, I NEED A BATH.
I THINK PABLO GOT DEPORTED.
IT WAS VERY HOT.
HOW DID HE GET BACK HERE?
THAT PART'S A LITTLE FUZZY.
I TOOK A LONG TIME.
I BET. WELCOME BACK, PABLO.
YEAH, WELCOME BACK.
HEY, KERRY, HAPPY VALENTINE'S DAY

WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?
"BARE BUTT BOOTY OIL"?
KID DRANK IT, BUT HE'S NOT SYMPTOMATIC

AIRWAY LOOKS CLEAR.
JOHN, OPEN YOUR EYES.

WHAT'S HE LOOK LIKE?
I DON'T KNOW. I HADN'T SEEN HIM YET.

THIS IS A CRIME SCENE.
HEY. MOVE.
IT'S OKAY, HE'S A DOCTOR.
SUBCLAVIAN'S IN. RUN IN TWO UNITS.
FIRST CRIT'S 31.

HYPOTENSIVE WITH TWO STAB...
IS HE CONSCIOUS?!
NO, BUT HE'S RESPONDING TO FLUID RESUSCITATION.
SOME PSYCH PATIENT-- GOT LUCY, TOO.
ROLL HIM AND LET ME SEE.
OH, MAN!
PRESSURE'S UP TO 90 PALP.
WHY WASN'T HE IN RESTRAINTS?
I DON'T KNOW.
WHERE'S THE FOLEY?
THAT'S NEXT.
PULSE OX IS 83. GIVE IT A MINUTE.
DR. WEAVER, THE POLICE ARE SEALING OFF CURTAIN THREE.
THEY NEED TO TALK TO ANYBODY WHO TOOK CARE

THAT MEANS NO SPINAL INJURY.
HANG THE NEXT TWO UNITS ON THE INFUSER.
HOLD ON. IT'S NOT SET UP.
GET IT SET UP.
I GOT IT.
PROBABLY GOT THE DESCENDING COLON.
PETER, DR. WEAVER NEEDS YOU RIGHT NOW.
SHE HAS TO TRAKE LUCY.
BOOK AN O.R. GET READY TO SEND CARTER UP.
WHERE'S THE FOLEY?
I'M WORKING ON IT.
BETADINE PREP.
STERILE DRAPES.
OKAY, CLEAR THE FIELD OF BLOOD.
HEMOSTAT!

IT SHOULD BE THERE.
THEY'RE NOT HERE.
WELL, TRY THE, UM... TOP SHELF.
( shrieks )
WHAT IS IT?
UH... A KNIFE.
DON'T TOUCH IT.
TOM, WE GOT A WEAPON.
ANY BLOOD?
YEAH. SOME.
IT'S FROM THE LOUNGE.
IT WAS TO CUT THE CAKE.
I-I HAVE TO GO FIND SOME TUBING.
ARE YOU WORKING ON ONE OF THE VICTIMS?
YEAH. I'M TRYING TO.
IS HE GOING TO MAKE IT?
I DON'T KNOW.
IS HE AWAKE?
GOT IT.

DO YOU KNOW WHERE YOU ARE?
MY BACK.
YOU WERE STABBED.
WE'VE GOT YOUR PRESSURE UP.
LUCY?
JOHN, I'M OFFICER BERNINI.
DID YOU SEE THE MAN THAT STABBED YOU?
DO WE NEED TO DO THIS NOW?
IF I SECURE A STATEMENT...
YOU'LL HAVE TO WAIT. I'M SORRY.
WHAT? NOTHING.
LOOKS LIKE HE MISSED YOUR SPINAL CORD.
( loud groan )
BP's 80 PALP.
FOLEY'S IN.
IS THAT LUCY?
YES. SHE'S ALIVE.
DR. KOVAC.
WHAT?
WHAT?
WHAT IS IT?
GET BENTON.
HE NEEDS TO GO UP NOW.
GET READY TO BAG HER.
DR. BENTON, WE NEED YOU.
HOOK UP THE THORASEAL.
I'VE GOT BREATH SOUNDS.
CARTER'S GOT A BAD RENAL LAC.
FOLEY OUTPUT IS BRIGHT RED.
WHAT'S HER PULSE OX?
PRESSURE'S DOWN TO 80 AGAIN.
YOU GOT ANOTHER SURGEON COMING?
GO! GO!
WE'RE OUTSIDE.
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.
YEAH.
DAD, WAIT FOR US INSIDE.
OKAY, REGISTER AROUND THE FRONT OF THE BUILDING.
I'M A SURGEON. I HAVE TO GET THROUGH.
I HAVE TO SEE I.D.
WE DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THIS.
AND YOU HAVE TO MOVE THE VEHICLE.
( frustrated groan )
THERE!
OKAY, GO AHEAD.
DAD, I NEED YOU TO MOVE THE VAN.
OKAY.
WHERE DO I PARK IT?
YOU'RE ASKING ME?
Chen: I WANT YOU TO STAY AWAKE, JOHN
UNTIL YOU GET UP THERE.
YOU WANT F.F.P.?
YEAH, TWO UNITS.
HOW IS HE?
STAB WOUND WITH RENAL LACERATIONS, HYPOTENSIVE.
WE'RE REDLINING HIM TO THE O.R.
A PATIENT DID THIS?
THEY'RE LOOKING FOR HIM.
WHAT'S HIS PRESSURE?
Benton: I'VE GOT IT, ELIZABETH.
KERRY NEEDS YOU. GO, GO.
CARTER, LOOK AT ME, COME ON.
I'M RIGHT HERE. HANG IN THERE.
STAY WITH ME, MAN. STAY WITH ME.
XEROFORM AND ELASTOPLAST.
Kovac: BELLY'S DISTENDED.
PROBABLY AN INTRA- ABDOMINAL BLEED.
WHY WASN'T HE SEDATED?
I DON'T KNOW. GET ULTRASOUND HERE.
WAS HE ON A HOLD? WAS THERE A SITTER?
I DON'T KNOW, KERRY! I NEVER SAW HIM!
WHERE ARE WE? WHAT?
MULTIPLE STAB WOUNDS TO LEFT NECK AND CHEST
BOTH UPPER QUADRANTS OF THE ABDOMEN.
WE DID A CHEST TUBE
CENTRAL LINE AND HAD TO TRAKE.
HOW MUCH BLOOD LOSS?
400 IN THE THORASEAL.
COULD'VE BEEN ANOTHER 2,000
BEFORE WE FOUND HER. Greene: IT LOOKS DEEP.
HOW LONG WAS THE BLADE?
PRESSURE'S DOWN TO 60.
ALL RIGHT, SHE NEEDS VOLUME NOW.
Corday: IT COULD BE TAMPONADE.
OPEN A THORACOTOMY TRAY.
CHECK A C.V.P.
LOST HER PULSE.
WE'RE IN P.E.A.
STARTING COMPRESSIONS.
NECK VEINS ARE UP.
WE NEED TO CRACK HER. PREP HER CHEST.
OKAY, AMP OF EPI.
STERILE GLOVES, PLEASE.
YOU'LL NEED BETTER EXPOSURE.
STAB WOUND IS NEAR THE MIDLINE.
STERNAL SAW, NOW, LILY.
Greene: GO, GO, GO.
ULTRASOUND IS READY.
IN A MINUTE, IN A MINUTE.
TEN BLADE.
STAND BACK.
Malucci: SATS ARE DOWN TO 85.
( whirs )
( whirring )
ALMOST GOT IT.
OKAY.
RIB SPREADER.
SUCTION.
V-FIB.
START INTERNAL COMPRESSIONS.
YOU'RE RIGHT
THERE IS AN EFFUSION.
METZ.
PREP THE INTERNAL PADDLES.
Corday: PERICARDIUM'S OPEN.
WE'VE GOT A MAJOR HEMORRHAGE HERE.
LOOKS LIKE THE PROXIMAL AORTA.
KEEP YOUR FINGER ON IT.
I NEED A 4-0 PROLENE ON AN R.B.-1 NEEDLE NOW.
BELLY'S FULL OF BLOOD.
PROBABLY GOT THE SPLEEN.
GOT TO CROSS CLAMP THE AORTA.
ONE THING AT A TIME.
AUTOTRANSFUSE FROM THE CELL SAVER.
CHARGE THE PADDLES TO 15.
CUT, CUT, CUT.
CLEAR.
WE'RE STILL AT V-FIB.
ANOTHER AMP OF EPI.
CLEAR.
SINUS TACH.
CHECK THE PRESSURE.
Corday: GET A PORTABLE MONITOR.
WE'RE MOVING HER TO THE O.R. NOW.
HANG THE OTHER UNITS.
PULSE OX IS UP TO 92.
90 SYSTOLIC.
LET'S GO!
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!
PULSE OX CABLE.
Greene: IS SHE MAKING URINE?
Malucci: ONLY 50cc's IN THE FOLEY.
IT'S BETTER THAN NOTHING. LET'S GO.
TELL THE O.R. WE HAVE AN OPEN CHEST.
WE'LL NEED A LAPAROTOMY.
STILL WAITING ON THE TYPE SPECIFIC.
HAVE THE BLOOD BANK SEND IT UPSTAIRS.
Kovac: PUTTING HER ON BYPASS?
I DON'T KNOW.
HAVE A PERFUSIONIST STANDING BY.
HOLD THE ELEVATOR.
MALUCCI, DON'T BAG SO FAST.
WE DON'T WANT TO MAKE HER ALKALOTIC.
Kovac: NEED ANYONE ELSE?
I HOPE NOT.
Weaver: WAIT. DON'T FORGET THE DRUG BOX.
GO.
( sighs )
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.
I THINK WE GOT IT IN TIME.
SHE HAS A GOOD CHANCE.
KERRY?
YOU DR. WEAVER?
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO FOUND THEM?
EXCUSE ME?
PROBLEM WITH THE MEDEVAC CHOPPER--
INDUSTRIAL TRAUMA FROM WHITING.
TRY TO DIVERT.
BUT LAKEPOINT'S CLOSED.
WHATEVER.
( breathing heavily )
( retching )
( spits )
( distant siren wailing )
PETER...
I JUST HEARD.
WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED?
I'M NOT QUITE SURE.
TAMMY, THIS IS O-NEG.
I ASKED FOR TYPE SPECIFIC.
HE IS O-NEGATIVE.
Anspaugh: I'LL SCRUB IN.
HANG IN THERE, DR. CARTER.
HOW MANY UNITS IS THAT?
OH, IT'S FIVE BUT, UH, YOU SHOULDN'T BE COUNTING.
MMM, IT'S BAD, ISN'T IT?
WELL, WE'RE HAVING PROBLEMS, UH...
KEEPING YOUR CRIT UP
BUT, UH, I THINK THAT'S FROM THE RENAL LAC.
I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU A COUPLE OF VERSED
TO RELAX YOU A LITTLE
BEFORE I INTUBATE, OKAY?
COULD BE THE AORTA.
OR THE VENA CAVA OR MESENTERIC VESSELS.
OH, GOD.
Benton: CARTER, LISTEN
DON'T WORRY.
I'M GOING TO EXPLORE THE ABDOMEN.
I'M GOING TO CHECK OUT EVERYTHING, OKAY?
I'M GLAD IT'S YOU.
HEY, I'M GETTING YOU THROUGH THIS, MAN.
YOU HEAR ME?
CARTER?
OKAY, READY TO INTUBATE.
LET'S PREP HIM FOR A MIDLINE INCISION.
I WANT TO CUT IN TWO MINUTES.
YOU GOT IT.
Corday: WE REPAIRED A LACERATION TO THE PROXIMAL AORTA.
Benton: WHAT HAPPENED?
SHE TAMPONADED.
WE HAD TO CRACK HER.
Romano: MOVE IT, PETER. I GOT THIS.
WHO'S ON ANESTHESIA?
I GOT HER. GO SCRUB.
PUT HER ON A TABLE SUPINE
AND KEEP HER CHEST COVERED WITH MOIST STERILE LAP PADS.
( sighs )
( water running )
( water running and splashing )
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
YOU NEED A SIX-INCH BUTCHER KNIFE TO CUT A CAKE?
HEY, I DIDN'T BRING IT.
THEY JUST TOLD ME THAT'S WHAT WE USE.
YES, AND WE JUST LEAVE IT OUT?
I DIDN'T.
OKAY, WAS IT AT ADMIT OR IN THE LOUNGE?
SOMEBODY SAID IT WAS IN THE LOUNGE
BUT I COULDN'T FIND IT.
AMIRA, GO UPSTAIRS AND GET SECURITY
TO OPEN UP THE PERSONNEL OFFICE.
I NEED EMERGENCY CONTACT NUMBERS FOR CARTER AND LUCY.
YOU WANT ME TO LOOK...
NO, I WANT YOU TO BRING THEM DOWN. GO.
OKAY, HE PRESENTED WITH A HEADACHE.
WHO?
PAUL SOBRIKI.
MARK, PLEASE TELL ME THAT YOU SAW HIM.
YEAH, I SAW HIM.
LUCY WORKED HIM UP.
CARTER SUPERVISED HIM.
AND WHO SUPERVISED HIM?
THE L.P. CAME BACK NEGATIVE.
IF YOU WANTED TO LEAVE EARLY
YOU COULD HAVE AT LEAST ROUNDED.
KERRY, I RAN THE BOARD WITH DR. KOVAC.
FOR HOW LONG? FOR 30 SECONDS?
HE WAS UP TO SPEED.
HOLD ON, YOU DIDN'T TELL ME HE WAS PSYCHOTIC.
I DIDN'T KNOW HE WAS PSYCHOTIC.
DID HE PRESENT TO YOU?
NO, I DIDN'T SEE HIM.
I THOUGHT WE WERE WAITING FOR A PSYCH CONSULT.
UNLESS HIS STATUS CHANGES.
SOMEONE SHOULD TELL ME.
I WAS MANAGING THE BOARD.
YOU WERE HAVING A PARTY!
COME ON, COME ON. KERRY, KERRY...
WE BOTH THOUGHT THAT LUCY AND CARTER HAD IT COVERED.
THEY DIDN'T, DID THEY?
EXCUSE ME.
WE BOTH KNOW THAT WE USE THE RESIDENTS
TO KEEP US INFORMED.
ARE YOU BLAMING CARTER, MARK?
NO, I'M NOT BLAMING ANYONE. ARE YOU?
EXCUSE ME, I HAVE SAMANTHA SOBRIKI WITH ME.
SHE'S LOOKING FOR HER HUSBAND.
I GOT A MESSAGE
ON MY ANSWERING MACHINE FROM LUCY KNIGHT.
SHE SAID TO COME DOWN
THAT-THAT PAUL'S OKAY
BUT SHE DIDN'T SAY
WHAT WAS WRONG.
YOU'D BETTER COME WITH ME.
McGrath: DR. WEAVER...
THAT CHOPPER'S LANDING RIGHT NOW.
WHAT? THE MEDEVAC FROM WHITING.
ALL RIGHT, KERRY, YOU GO AND CHANGE. I'LL TAKE IT.
RIGHT.
WHAT HAPPENED?
OH, GOOD, YOU'RE HERE.
I NEED YOU, OKAY?
THE AIR SQUAD'S HERE.
WAS THERE A BOMB SCARE OR SOMETHING?
I WISH.
...HUSBAND MAY BE INVOLVED.
NO, I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.
WHERE'S PAUL? I WANT TO SEE HIM.
HE'S NOT HERE.
PAUL WOULDN'T HURT ANYONE.
HE COULDN'T.
HE NEEDS HELP, MRS. SOBRIKI.
THERE'S BEEN SOME KIND OF MISTAKE.
WE BELIEVE HE MAY HAVE SCHIZOPHRENIA.
WHAT?
THE FIRST PSYCHOTIC BREAK CAN HAPPEN IN YOUR 20s.
YOU'RE WRONG, OKAY?
NO, I...
YOU'RE WRONG.
Benton: MORE LAP PADS.
THE KIDNEY WON'T TAMPONADE.
Anspaugh: YOU DIDN'T HAVE TIME
TO GET A THREE-WAY OR AN I.V.P.?
HIS CRIT WAS FALLING.
I DIDN'T WANT TO CHANCE IT.
OH, THE COLON IS LACERATED, ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT, THREE-O SILK AND A G.I. NEEDLE.
THERE'S BLOOD WELLING IN THE HILUM.
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
ISOLATE THE RENAL ARTERY AND GET A CLAMP ON IT.
Bjerke: HE'S HYPOTENSIVE.
HEART RATE'S UP TO 120.
WE GOT TO GET THIS KIDNEY OUT OF HIM
BEFORE WE LOSE HIM.
LET ME FINISH SUTURING HIS COLON
BEFORE WE DO SOMETHING DRASTIC.
I'LL DISSECT OUT THE ARTERIES AND TIE THEM OFF. COME ON.
I SAID WAIT, PETER.
WHY? HE'S LOST TOO MUCH BLOOD.
HIS-HIS HILUM IS TRASHED.
HE'S GETTING SHOCKY.
PRESSURE IS 78 PALP.
ALL RIGHT, PEDICLE CLAMP. COME ON.
Anspaugh: WE HAVE TIME. NO, WE DON'T!
PETER, WILL YOU CALM DOWN AND YOU LISTEN TO ME?!
BEFORE THERE'S NO TURNING BACK
LET'S CHECK THE SOURCE OF THE BLEEDING ONE MORE TIME.
TOO MANY VESSELS ARE INJURED.
SQUEEZE IN ANOTHER UNIT.
LET'S BE SURE.
Corday: THERE'S TOO MUCH BLEEDING.
I CAN'T IDENTIFY THE SOURCE.
Romano: MORE SUCTION.
ABDOMINAL LAP PADS.
I'LL PACK OFF THE LIVER.
B.P.'s 105 OVER 70.
ALL RIGHT, ANGLED POTTS NOW.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
PRINGLE MANEUVER.
HAVE TO CUT DOWN THIS BLOOD LOSS.
MORE SUCTION, DAMN IT.
ROBERT, THE SPLEEN'S STILL BLEEDING.
OKAY, I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.
B.P.'s FALLING, 80/60.
RUN ANOTHER UNIT.
SHE'S LOSING IT AS FAST AS WE CAN GIVE IT.
THEN DO IT QUICKLY.
"A" AND "O" TIMES FOUR.
B.P. 132/82.
PULSE 110.
YOU'RE SURE THERE WASN'T A PROJECTILE--
A BOLT, SOME HARDWARE?
NO, JUST THE OIL.
MUST HAVE BEEN A LOOSE FITTING.
FOREMAN SAID A SMALL STREAM AT THAT PRESSURE
WILL CUT THROUGH YOU LIKE A .22.
MARK?
HEY, DAD. WHAT'S GOING ON?
HO-HOLD ON.
OKAY, GET TRAUMA PANEL, TYPE AND CROSS FOR FOUR
AND AN UPRIGHT CHEST.
I'LL BE THERE IN A MINUTE.
A COUPLE OF OUR STAFF WERE HURT.
OH, I HEARD THAT PART. WHO'S THAT?
UH, I'M JUST COVERING.
UH, EVERYTHING'S A LITTLE OFF BALANCE.
WHERE'S ELIZABETH?
SHE'S UPSTAIRS IN SURGERY.
Abby: DR. GREENE, UH, SORRY.
WE'VE GOT AN M.V.A. COMING IN--
AUTO VERSUS PEDESTRIAN.
E.T.A. FIVE MINUTES.
Greene: GRAB CHEN AND MALUCCI
AND, UH, WEAVER SHOULD BE AROUND.
NOW, WHAT-WHAT DO I DO WITH HER MOTHER?
UH, JUST GIVE ME A HALF HOUR, OKAY?
I'LL DRIVE YOU GUYS HOME.
ARE THEY GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT?
WHO?
YOUR FRIENDS.
I DON'T KNOW, DAD.
Samantha: YOU'RE ACTING
LIKE YOU KNOW HE DID IT.
YOU DON'T KNOW HE DID IT.
YOU'RE RIGHT, WE DON'T KNOW FOR SURE
BUT WE STILL REALLY NEED TO FIND HIM.
HE'S NOT AT THE HOME ADDRESS.
NOBODY'S SEEN HIM AT THE DINER.
IS THERE ANY OTHER PLACE HE MIGHT GO
IF HE NEEDED TO FEEL SAFE?
SO, HE'S A LITTLE DEPRESSED-- IT DOESN'T MAKE HIM CRAZY.
Man: MAYBE NOT, BUT AT THE MOMENT
WE HAVE TO ASSUME HE COULD BE A GREAT DANGER TO HIMSELF
OR OTHER PEOPLE.
THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.
IF HE WAS THAT DANGEROUS
THEN WHY DID THEY LEAVE HIM ALONE?
I UNDERSTAND.
THIS DOESN'T MAKE MUCH SENSE TO ANY OF US
BUT IF PAUL IS IN TROUBLE, HE NEEDS HELP
AND IT'S BETTER IF WE CAN FIND HIM NOW.
SOMETIMES HE GOES TO THE ROOF
WHEN HE WANTS TO BE ALONE.
THE ROOF?
OF OUR APARTMENT BUILDING.
HE DIDN'T DO THIS.
BLEEDING'S UNDER CONTROL.
IF WE CAN JUST KEEP IT THERE.
PEAN CLAMP.
OKAY, WATCH THE PANCREAS.
HOLD ON.
I'LL ENLARGE THE INCISION IN THE POSTERIOR PERITONEUM
AND WATCH OUT FOR THE SPLENIC FLEXURE.
GOT IT.
I'LL CLAMP, YOU CUT.
MM-HMM. METZ.
BASTARD REALLY SLICED THE HELL OUT OF IT.
SENSELESS.
WHY WE HAVE TO CUT UP THIS POOR GIRL LIKE THIS...
WELL, IT'S BETTER THAN THE ALTERNATIVE, ISN'T IT?
Anspaugh: LET THE RENAL ARTERY FLUSH RETROGRADE
BEFORE CLOSING THE DEFECT.
THERE.
THINK WE GOT IT?
WELL, THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY TO FIND OUT.
RELEASE THE CLAMP... LET THE KIDNEY PROFUSE.
OKAY...
GO AHEAD.
NO BLEEDING.
HILUM'S INTACT...
AND THE KIDNEY IS PINKING UP.
ALL RIGHT, WE DID IT.
YOU WERE RIGHT. THANKS.
WELL, HE COULD HAVE LIVED WITHOUT A KIDNEY.
I JUST DIDN'T WANT TO HAVE TO TELL HIM.
Bjerke: PRESSURE'S STILL DOWN.
80/62.
WE CAUGHT UP ON VOLUME?
ALMOST.
THEN WHY IS HE STILL HYPOTENSIVE?
WELL, THERE'S SOME SWELLING IN THE PARA-AORTIC AREA.
THERE'S A HEMATOMA FORMING.
FROM THE LUMBAR ARTERY?
I HOPE SO. IF WE TIE IT OFF
IT COULD PARALYZE HIM.
WELL, IT'S BETTER THAN HIS AORTA.
DISSECT DOWN TO THE ARTERY, PETER.
SOME KIND OF LIFE TO LEAD, HUH?
WELL, I HOPE THIS IS NOT NORMAL.
NO, NO, NO, I DON'T THINK SO.
YOU'VE GOT QUITE A GIRL THERE
IN ELIZABETH.
I WISH I COULD TAKE THE CREDIT.
THE BOARDING SCHOOL RAISED HER.
OH.
( chuckling ): I WAS TEASING.
( laughing ): OH.
HER FATHER PASSED ON?
NO, HE WAS STILL ALIVE THE LAST I HEARD.
OH.
I'M SORRY.
OH, DON'T BE.
IT WASN'T YOUR FAULT.
HAVE YOU HEARD ANYTHING?
THEY'RE BOTH STILL IN THE O.R.
THINK WE SHOULD GO UP THERE?
NAH, I'M SURE THEY'LL CALL WHEN EVERYTHING'S OKAY.
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT?
JOHN DOE, HIT BY A VAN
RUNNING ACROSS MICHIGAN AVENUE.
NO APPARENT HEAD TRAUMA, BUT REPEATING QUESTIONS.
AND THERE'S A CAB WAITING FOR ME.
I THINK WE'RE TALKING LOONEY TUNE.
WHY?
Morales: RUNNING BUCK NAKED
IN THE FREEZING COLD.
GET WEAVER NOW!
Man: YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED
TO BE DOING THIS TO ME.
YOU SURE IT'S HIM?
YEAH, IT'S HIM!
Chen: TRAUMA PANELS, C-SPINE, CHEST AND PELVIS.
HE'S COMBATIVE. HE'S AGITATED.
I'M NOT TAKING ANY CHANCES.
Man: I SAID I WOULDN'T TELL.
GET THAT POLICE DETECTIVE IN HERE.
DIMINISHED BREATH SOUNDS ON THE RIGHT.
ABDOMEN IS SOFT, NON-TENDER.
I WON'T TALK, I WON'T TALK.
I MADE PROMISES TO PEOPLE.
PUPILS FOUR MILLIMETERS
EQUAL AND REACTIVE.
PAUL, DO YOU KNOW WHERE YOU ARE?
WHO TOLD MY NAME?
DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED?
YOU CAN'T TRICK ME. I DON'T KNOW YOU!
McGrath: ABRASIONS ON THE FEET.
NO DEFORMITY.
I'M NOT DEFORMED.
TEMPERATURE'S 95-POINT... NO!
DON'T STICK ME!
GET OFF OF ME, NOW.
LEAVE ME ALONE.
DON'T STICK ME.
YOU WANT SOME HALDOL?
THEY WOULDN'T STOP STICKING ME.
DR WEAVER, DO YOU WANT SOME HALDOL?
DR. WEAVER?
Weaver: YEAH.
TWO LITERS OF WARM SALINE, FIVE OF HALDOL, I.V.
Chen: WHERE YOU GOING?
LOOKS LIKE FLUID IN MORRISON'S POUCH.
Sobriki: YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO DO THIS.
YOU OKAY?
IT'S THE PSYCH PATIENT
HIT BY A CAR.
Greene: WHAT IS IT?
I NEED YOU TO TAKE HIM.
YEAH, OKAY.
I'LL SEND HIM UP TO THE O.R.
B.P. 124/82 AFTER A LITER.
PROBABLY JUST SOME VENOUS OOZING.
CLEO, CAN YOU GO UP WITH HIM?
WHO'S OUR SURGEON?
WHOEVER'S FREE.
HE NEEDS A CHEST TUBE AND HEAD C.T.
Chen: CALM DOWN.
Sobriki: HEY, LET ME GO.
I WON'T LET YOU TOUCH ME.
STOP STICKING ME.
THEY WOULDN'T STOP STICKING ME.
NO HEMOTYMPANUM.
Sobriki: LET ME GO!
Greene: KEEP THAT MASK ON HIM.
DON'T CUT ME.
DON'T CUT ME.
NO.
HELL OF A WAY TO SPEND VALENTINE'S DAY, HUH?
SHE'S SATTING AT 98 ON 30% OXYGEN.
CAN'T ASK FOR BETTER THAN THAT.
GOOD WORK.
HOW'S CARTER?
WELL, IT TOOK A WHILE TO CONTROL THE BLEEDING.
THEY SALVAGED HIS KIDNEY.
NOW THEY'RE WORKING ON A COLOSTOMY.
UNBELIEVABLE.
YEP.
DR. ROMANO, COUNTY SUPERVISOR'S
ON THE PHONE.
HE JUST HEARD WHAT HAPPENED.
TELL HIM I'M IN SURGERY.
I JUST TOLD HIM YOU GOT OUT.
THANK YOU.
APPRECIATE THAT.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
OKAY.
DR. CORDAY, SHE'S WAKING UP.
LUCY?
LUCY, CAN YOU HEAR ME?
DO YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?
THERE WERE SEVERAL STAB WOUNDS
ONE LACERATION TO YOUR PROXIMAL AORTA.
WE HAD TO PERFORM A THORACOTOMY AFTER YOU ARRESTED.
THEY GAVE YOU A TRAKE TO MAINTAIN YOUR AIRWAY.
AND WE BROUGHT YOU TO THE O.R.
YOUR LIVER WAS DAMAGED, BUT WE WERE ABLE TO REPAIR IT.
HOWEVER, WE DID HAVE TO REMOVE YOUR SPLEEN.
I'M SORRY.
LUCY, YOU CAN'T SPEAK.
YOU CAN WHISPER IF I PLUG THE TRAKE.
DO YOU WANT TO TRY THAT?
OKAY.
REMEMBER, ONLY WHISPER.
THANK YOU.
Anspaugh: BRING THE PROXIMAL COLON TO THE SKIN SURFACE.
Benton: 3-0 CHROMIC.
YOU HANGING IN THERE, PETER?
YOU LOOK A LITTLE RAGGED.
I'M FINE.
METZ.
YOU KNOW, ALL IN ALL
I THINK YOUNG DR. CARTER HERE
IS VERY FORTUNATE.
THAT DEPENDS ON HOW YOU LOOK AT IT.
DR. ANSPAUGH, THEY NEED A SURGEON IN O.R. THREE.
WHAT IS IT?
SOME KIND OF PENETRATING TRAUMA.
SOMETHING ABOUT OIL.
WHERE'S DR. CORDAY?
YOU WANT ME TO PAGE HER?
WE'RE BUSY HERE.
WHY DON'T YOU GO TAKE A LOOK. I CAN FINISH.
NO, I'VE COME THIS FAR.
IS THE PATIENT STABLE?
YEAH. WHO'S WITH THE PATIENT?
DR. FINCH.
ASK HER TO STAY
UNTIL CORDAY SHOWS.
THEY NEED ME IN THE O.R.
I'LL BE BACK, LUCY.
HOLD ON.
HER SAT'S DOWN TO 82.
WHAT IS IT? CHEST PAIN?
SUDDEN ONSET?
PUT HER UP TO 100%.
WE NEED TO GO
FOR A SPIRAL C.T. RIGHT NOW.
YES, LUCY, P.E. IS A POSSIBILITY.
Romano: WHAT'S GOING ON?
SUDDEN ONSET. CHEST PAIN DROPPED HER SATS.
WE'RE GOING TO SCAN HER FOR PULMONARY EMBOLISM.
BOLUS 5,000 HEPARIN.
START A DRIP AT 1,000 AN HOUR.
WHOA, HOLD ON, HOLD ON. KEEP GOING. COME HERE.
WAIT TILL AFTER THE SCAN.
I DON'T WANT TO THIN HER BLOOD IF WE DON'T HAVE TO.
I THINK SHE JUST THREW A MASSIVE CLOT IN HER LUNG.
SHE'S HAD MAJOR SURGERY.
WE DON'T WANT HER TO BLEED OUT.
SHE CAN SURVIVE SOME POST-OP BLEEDING.
IF IT IS P.E. AND WE DON'T THIN HER BLOOD, SHE CAN THROW ANOTHER CLOT.
ALL RIGHT. HAVE F.F.P. STANDING BY
AND WE WON'T HEPARINIZE FOR MORE THAN TWO HOURS.
I WON'T NEED THAT LONG.
WERE YOU THE ONE WORKING ON MY HUSBAND?
YOUR HUSBAND WAS HIT BY A CAR.
COLLAPSED LUNG, BUT WE FIXED IT.
NO HEAD TRAUMA AND HE'S SEEING THE PSYCHIATRIST NOW.
CAN I SEE HIM?
YOU MIGHT WANT TO WAIT A MINUTE.
WE GAVE HIM A DRUG TO CALM HIM DOWN.
NO, I REALLY NEED TO SEE HIM.
THERE. RIGHT PULMONARY ARTERY.
GET HER TO ANGIOGRAPHY FOR A FILTER.
I'LL MEET YOU THERE.
GET THE ROOM READY.
CHEST AND ABDOMINAL DRESSINGS ARE SOAKED THROUGH.
WATCH HER B.P. AND SEND OFF A HEMATOCRIT.
OKAY, IT'S JUST A LITTLE OOZING FROM THE INCISION.
THAT HAPPENS WITH HEPARIN.
YOU BLOOD PRESSURE'S FINE.
THERE'S NO MAJOR HEMORRHAGE.
LUCY, THE C.T. SHOWS A PULMONARY EMBOLISM.
DON'T WORRY, WE'RE TAKING YOU TO ANGIOGRAPHY,
WE'LL PUT IN A GREENFIELD FILTER.
WE'LL REVERSE THE HEPARIN.
HOWEVER, YOU MIGHT NEED TO HAVE ANOTHER TRANSFUSION.
LUCY, ARE YOU WITH ME?
I'LL GET YOU THROUGH THIS, ALL RIGHT?
ALL RIGHT.
WHOO.
YOU WANT ANYTHING?
UH, JUST COFFEE.
HEY. TWO COFFEES, PLEASE.
HEY.
HI.
I GUESS YOU DIDN'T WANT
TO GO HOME EITHER, HUH?
YEAH. SIT DOWN.
WE THOUGHT IT WAS BETTER THAN WAITING UPSTAIRS.
PRETTY SCARY, HUH?
YEAH, PRETTY SCARY.
I WAS COMPLAINING ABOUT MY DAY.
B.P.'s 112/78. PULSE 102.
A.C. 14, TIDAL VOLUME 600, 100% FI02.
ANOTHER TWO OF VERSED.
IT'S JUST TO RELAX YOU A BIT
DURING THE PROCEDURE.
YOU WANT TO STAY AWAKE?
OKAY. OKAY.
I'M GOING TO NUMB THE INGUINAL AREA WITH LIDOCAINE
AND INTRODUCE A CATHETER INTO THE FEMORAL VEIN.
I'LL PREP. GET GOWNED.
SPUN CRIT IS 32.
GOOD. GO.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK, LUCY.
DON'T WORRY, MS. KNIGHT.
WE PUT FAR TOO MUCH
TIME AND ENERGY INTO YOUR TRAINING
TO LOSE YOU NOW.
GREENFIELD FILTERS ARE A SNAP.
I'VE DONE ABOUT A HUNDRED OF THEM.
I'LL TALK YOU THROUGH IT, IF YOU LIKE.
Kit: B.P.'s DOWN TO 60, PULSE OX 72.
LUCY?!
LUCY?!
NO CAROTID PULSE.
DAMN IT, SHE'S THROWN ANOTHER CLOT.
START CHEST COMPRESSIONS.
YOU! GET IN HERE AND BAG HER!
LIZZIE, I NEED YOU NOW.
GET ME A STAPLE REMOVER.
COME ON, COME ON. RIGHT NOW.
POUR SOME BETADINE ON THE CHEST.
YOU'RE GOING TO OPEN HER RIGHT HERE?
SHE WON'T MAKE IT TO THE O.R.
CALL THE UNIT. TELL THEM WE NEED TWO MORE NURSES.
Corday: WHAT HAPPENED? SHE'S IN P.E.A.
STANDBY WITH WIRE CUTTERS. WIRE CUTTERS?
WE WIRED THE DAMN BREASTBONE TOGETHER.
DR. CORDAY'S TIED UP.
WHAT IS SHE DOING?
SHE WENT DOWN TO C.T.
ALL RIGHT, CAN YOU TAKE IT?
PETER, I'M SUTURING.
WELL, I'VE GOT TO RUN THE BOWEL AGAIN.
THAT MAN NEEDS AN EX-LAP. NOW, GO.
I'LL PAGE YOU IF ANYTHING CHANGES.
VITALS?
B.P.'s 125/85, PULSE 92.
CRIT?

THAT'S NORMAL. OKAY, PREP FOR AN EX-LAP.
CLEO, STAY HERE UNTIL THE SURGEON COMES.
YOU'RE NOT STAYING?
I'M STILL OPERATING ON CARTER.
START INTERNAL COMPRESSIONS AS SOON AS YOU CAN.
THE RIGHT VENTRICLE IS DILATED.
SIDE-BITING CLAMP. COME ON, COME ON.
YOU WANT A FOGARTY?
NO, JUST A YANKAUER.
SCALPEL.
TRY AND SUCK OUT WHATEVER WE CAN.
SUCTION.
OKAY, THAT'S THE RIGHT SIDE.
WE'VE GOT A FEW CLOTS HERE.
GOOD. MAYBE SHE'LL GET SOME OXYGEN.
PRESSURE'S DROPPING.
WHERE THE HELL ARE THEY?
DOWN TO 80 PALP.
PROBABLY TORE A MESENTERIC ARTERY.
GET BENTON.
LOST THE PULSE.
STARTING COMPRESSIONS.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
THORACOTOMY TRAY.
HOLD ON. HE ONLY NEEDS A LAPAROTOMY.
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO THAT. DO YOU?
YOU CAN'T OPERATE UP HERE.
WAIT FOR THE SURGEON.
HE CAN TAKE OVER WHEN HE GETS HERE.
SOMEBODY GET ME A SCALPEL, AND GET BENTON UP HERE NOW.
ONE MORE 4-0 PROLENE.
HOW'S HER PULSE OX?
68 ON 100%.
STILL NOT OXYGENATING.
I DON'T KNOW, LIZZIE.

WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?
SAVING HIS LIFE. STATINSKY.
YOU CRACKED HIS CHEST?
HE NEEDED A LAPAROTOMY.
YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN HERE.
YOU SHOULD HAVE CALLED ME SOONER. GOWN.
AORTA'S CROSS-CLAMPED. PRESSURE'S COMING UP.
WHAT THE HELL WERE YOU THINKING?
A MINUTE AGO THERE WAS NO PRESSURE. NOW, THERE IS.
STEP BACK, DR. FINCH, I'VE GOT IT FROM HERE.
PETER, HE WAS ABOUT TO ARREST.
STEP THE HELL BACK NOW. TEN-BLADE.
PULSE IS DOWN TO 90.
ALL RIGHT, LAP PAD AND BOVIE. LET'S MOVE, PEOPLE.
PETER, I'M SORRY, CARTER...
IRRIGATE THE CHEST WITH THREE LITERS OF WARM SALINE.
COME ON.
CLEAR.

PUSH AN AMP OF ATROPINE.
WHEN WAS THE LAST EPI?
FOUR MINUTES AGO.
PUSH ANOTHER SEVEN MILLIGRAMS NOW.
CLEAR.
OKAY, THAT'S IT.
WE'VE DONE EVERYTHING WE CAN.
HOLDING COMPRESSIONS.
OH, DAMN IT.
SON OF A BITCH.
NO.
NO, NO. LET'S GIVE A MINUTE
FOR THE LAST EPI TO CIRCULATE.
COME ON, CHARGE TO 30. LET'S GO.
COME ON, LIZZIE, LET'S GO!
ROBERT...
CALL IT.
TIME OF DEATH, 2:56
Sobriki: WHEN CAN I GO HOME?
I DON'T KNOW.
I WANT TO GO HOME.
I N... I NEED TO FEED MY DOG.
PAUL, WE HAVE SOMEONE HERE TO SEE YOU.
PAUL.
SAM.
YOU OKAY?
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
I WANT TO GO HOME.
PAUL, WHAT HAPPENED?
THEY TOOK MY CLOTHES
AND THEY TOOK MY SHOES.
WHO TOOK YOUR CLOTHES, PAUL?
THEM.
WHO'S THEM?
THEY HAD A... A BLUE CAKE.
IS THAT WHERE YOU GOT THE KNIFE?
THEY WERE GOING TO OPEN ME.
PAUL, WHERE DID YOU GET THE KNIFE?
THEY WERE GOING TO TAKE MY ORGANS.
WHAT ORGANS?
MY INTERNAL ORGANS!
DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?
I HAD TO PROTECT THEM.
DON'T TRY TO TELL ME I DON'T KNOW BECAUSE I KNOW!
THEY WERE TRYING TO TAKE THEM
AND I HAD...
I HAD TO STOP THEM!
Deraad: IS HE READY?
YEAH.
YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE HIM UPSTAIRS?
Paul: CAN I... CAN I PLEASE GO HOME NOW?
I NEED TO FEED MY DOG.
Deraad: IF THERE'S ANYTHING
THAT I CAN DO FOR YOU AT ALL, LET ME KNOW.
IF THERE'S ANYTHING YOU NEED FROM ANY OF MY PEOPLE
AND YOU FEEL THE SLIGHTEST BIT OF RESISTANCE
LET ME KNOW.
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE
OUR OWN INTERNAL INVESTIGATION GOING ON.
I WANT TO GET TO THE BOTTOM...
I'LL MEET YOU IN RECOVERY.
IS CARTER OUT OF THE O.R.?
YEAH. HE'S...
HE'S EXTUBATED, IN RECOVERY.
VITALS ARE STABLE.
( sighs in relief )
PETER...
NO, NO, NO, LISTEN, UH... YOU WERE RIGHT.
I PUT YOU IN A TOUGH POSITION.
YOU DID WHAT YOU HAD TO DO.
WHAT'S WRONG?
THERE WAS A COMPLICATION WITH LUCY.
NO, NOT VANESSA VANESSA.
THE ONE AND ONLY.
YOU KNOW HER?
OH, I SAW HER WHEN I WAS IN MEDICAL SCHOOL.
AND SHE COMES IN WITH ABDOMINAL PAIN.
CARTER ORDERS A PELVIC.
TELLS LUCY THE PATIENT
WOULD FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE WITH A WOMAN.
OH, MAN!
WH... WHO'S VANESSA?
Haleh: LUCY IS ALL OFFICIAL.
SHE'S POLITE.
SHE GETS HER TRAY ALL IN ORDER
PUTS ON HER GLOVES, PULLS BACK THE CURTAIN...
CARTER'S OUTSIDE WAITING.
UH, WAITING FOR WHAT?
THE SCREAM.
I DON'T GET IT.
CARTER SENT HER IN
TO DO A PELVIC ON A DRAG QUEEN.
HE DID NOT.
SWEAR TO GOD.
THAT'S TERRIBLE.
HOW COULD SHE NOT KNOW?
Chen: OH, YOU GOT TO HAND IT TO VANESSA.
HE'S GOT A BETTER FIGURE THAN I DO.
( laughter )
WHAT IS IT?
UH, LUCY.
Peter: ALL RIGHT, LET ME KNOW WHEN THE VIBRATION STOPS.
WHAT ABOUT THE PANCREAS?
IT'S TOTALLY INTACT.
HE JUST GOT THE DESCENDING COLON.
HOW LONG WILL I HAVE THE COLOSTOMY FOR?
ABOUT A MONTH.
WE'LL DO A TAKE-DOWN.
NOW.
GOOD.
SENSATION'S INTACT.
YOU WERE LUCKY, CARTER.
I KNOW.
THANK YOU.
YOU'RE WELCOME. ALL RIGHT.
I'VE GOT TO TEST YOUR MOTOR STRENGTH.
LIFT YOUR LEG.
HOW IS LUCY DOING?
COME ON, MAN, LIFT, LIFT.
( grunting )
THAT HURTS.
I KNOW.
ALL RIGHT, NOW DON'T LET ME
PUSH IT DOWN, OKAY? HOLD IT.
HOLD IT.
UM-UH.
UM-UH.
GOOD, GOOD.
( groaning lightly )
MY BACK IS KILLING ME.
YEAH, I KNOW.
HEMATOMA AROUND THE LUMBAR PLEXUS.
I'LL GIVE YOU SOME MORPHINE.
I WANT YOU UP AND WALKING IN 12 HOURS, OKAY?
LUCY'S DEAD, ISN'T SHE?
( door opening )
OH. YOU'RE HOME.
IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?
NO.
YOU WANT TO TELL ME ABOUT IT?
NOT PARTICULARLY.
I'LL MAKE BREAKFAST.
Hathaway: WE STILL NEED A PRESSURE TRANSDUCER
FOR TRAUMA ONE, AND GET TWO UNITS
OF O-NEG DOWN HERE.
WE'RE OUT OF ANCEF.
WELL, CALL THE PHARMACY.
MARK...
I JUST HEARD.
HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?
WE, UH, TALK ABOUT IT LATER?
YEAH. SURE.
SOMETHING COMING IN.
MULTIVICTIM TRAUMA.
ASSEMBLY LINE ACCIDENT.
I TOLD THEM WE COULD TAKE TWO MAJORS, SIX MINORS.
E.T.A.?
THEY'RE ROLLING UP, BUT I JUST REALIZED
WE'RE SHORT A DOC AND A MED STUDENT.
HEY, ABBY, ARE YOU ON?
NO. WE'RE SHORT.
CAN YOU COVER?
UH, SURE.
GREAT. I NEED SOMEONE
TO COVER TRIAGE.
Woman: 42-YEAR-OLD MALE.
CRUSH INJURY TO THE RIGHT ARM.
GOT IT STUCK IN A CONVEYOR BELT.
GAVE HIM MORPHINE AND TWO LITERS IN THE FIELD.
A LITTLE SHOCKY. 90/60.
Hathaway: NEURO-CIRC INTACT?
NO. COULDN'T GET A RADIAL OR BRACHIAL PULSE.
MULTIPLE FRACTURES.
OKAY. CALL ORTHO AND VASCULAR.
TYPE AND CROSS FOR FOUR.
GET HIM INTO TRAUMA TWO.
Romano: I HAD TO CLOSE HER CHEST.
THANK YOU.
THE NURSES CAN DO THAT.
I KNOW.
