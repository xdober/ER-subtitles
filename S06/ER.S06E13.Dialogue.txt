( cha-cha music playing )
DAD, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
I THOUGHT I'D WEED THROUGH
YOUR MOTHER'S RECORD COLLECTION.
YOU MEAN THE ONE WE SCHLEPPED ALL THE WAY BACK
FROM SAN DIEGO ALONG WITH THAT OLD TURNTABLE
SO NOW YOU CAN THROW IT OUT?
SHE DID GO THROUGH
SOME STRANGE MUSICAL PHASES, BLESS HER HEART.
UH... THE DANCE PHASE-- CHA-CHA-CHA.
TANGO, AND, UH, THE LOUNGE LIZARD PHASE.
YOU KNOW, TOM JONES.
I LIKE A GOOD SHOW TUNE MYSELF.
REMEMBER OKLAHOMA?
OKLAHOMA? HOW COULD I NOT?
SHE PLAYED IT FOR ME WHEN I WAS A KID A THOUSAND TIMES.
WELL, THEN I GUESS YOU WON'T MIND ONE MORE.
AS LONG AS IT MEANS NO MORE CHA-CHA-CHA.
I GOT TO SHAVE.
GO AHEAD. DON'T WANT TO BE LATE.
I THOUGHT SURGEONS WERE SUPPOSED TO HAVE
HORRIBLE HOURS-- UP VERY EARLY.
WE DO. I WAS UP VERY LATE.
I SEE YOUR FATHER'S BEEN HERE.
WHAT?
CROWN ESSENTIAL BOUQUET.
OH... OVER A YEAR AGO.
GOD, I DON'T THINK I'VE EVEN USED IT.
WELL... I MUST BE OFF.
WHAT TIME'S YOUR ANGIOPLASTY?
WHAT?
YOU MENTIONED
YOU WERE DOING A LASER ANGIOPLASTY.
I THOUGHT PERHAPS I WOULD COME AND OBSERVE.
WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO DO THAT?
WELL... MY WORK WITH LASERS IS SO...
ESOTERIC?
ROMANTIC.
WANDERING THROUGH THE ATMOSPHERE
WATCHING THE STARS TWINKLE.
I THOUGHT PERHAPS I'D COME AND SEE THE PRACTICAL APPROACH. HMM!
I DON'T THINK IT'S EVEN ALLOWED.
WELL, I'M SURE AS ASSOCIATE CHIEF OF SURGERY
YOU COULD MAKE ARRANGEMENTS.
ANYWAY, I'LL CALL AND CHECK
OR PERHAPS I'LL JUST DROP BY.
WAIT, MOTHER!
MOTHER, I DON'T THINK THAT'S...
( door closes )
SUCH A GOOD IDEA!
* Chicks and ducks and geese better scurry *
* When I take you out in the surrey... *
HEY, MARK, I WAS HOPING TO GET BY A PHARMACY TODAY
TO PICK UP SOME REFILLS ON THOSE PRESCRIPTIONS.
DAD, I TOLD YOU I'M NOT GOING TO GIVE YOU ANY SCRIPTS.
I-I JUST NEED THE COMBIVENT AND VANCERIL.
I'VE STILL GOT PLENTY OF THE THEO-DUR.
DAD, YOU HAVE EMPHYSEMA.
I HAVEN'T NEEDED MY OXYGEN FOR OVER TWO MONTHS.
AND YOU HAVEN'T SEEN A DOCTOR IN OVER SIX
AND YOU NEED TO SEE A PULMONOLOGIST HERE IN CHICAGO.
DOCTORS... ASK A MILLION QUESTIONS
WHEN ALL YOU NEED'S THE MEDICINE.
IT'S NOT GOOD MEDICINE...
FOR ONE FAMILY MEMBER
TO LOOK AFTER ANOTHER.
SO WHAT THE HELL GOOD IS IT
TO HAVE A SON FOR A DOCTOR WHEN HE CAN'T
WRITE YOU A PRESCRIPTION?
IT'S NOT THAT I CAN'T, DAD.
NO, NO... IT'S JUST THAT YOU WON'T.
* You can keep your rig
* If you're thinking that I'd care to swap *
* For that shiny little surrey
( Greene joins in ): * With the fringe on the top.
COULD YOU GIVE THESE CHARTS TO DR. WEAVER?
SHE'S OFF TODAY. YOU'RE TALL. HOLD THIS.
WHAT'S THIS?
HEARTS. VALENTINE'S DAY?
WHEN YOU GIVE PEOPLE FLOWERS, CANDIES
CARDS TELLING THEM HOW MUCH YOU LOVE THEM.
HAPPY VALENTINE'S DAY!
OH, THANK YOU, YOSH. THAT IS SO SWEET.
YOU SEE? DON'T THEY HAVE VALENTINE'S DAY IN CROATIA?
YES, WE DO.
WE EVEN HAVE THESE LITTLE HEARTS. "BE MINE."
I DON'T RECOMMEND YOU EATING THAT.
"DEAR ONE."
I GOT TO GET TO RADIOLOGY.
"CUTTY PIE."
THAT'S "CUTIE PIE."
OH, THANK YOU.
I'M ABBY LOCKHART, MRS. CONNELLY.
WE'RE GOING TO HELP YOU.
COULD YOU FIND THAT YOUNG DOCTOR?
HE TOOK CARE OF MY HUSBAND BARRY AFTER THE FIRE.
OH, WHAT WAS HIS NAME?
MALUCCI?
NO.
UH, CARTER?
YES, THAT'S IT-- DR. CARTER.
WE'LL TRY TO FIND HIM FOR YOU.
DO YOU HAVE A COUGH, MRS. CONNELLY?
NO.
PULSE IS THREADY.
ANY PAIN IN YOUR BELLY?
NO, NOT TOO MUCH.
ANY ACHING?
OH, I'M 81 YEARS OLD, DEAR.
I ACHE ALL OVER.
ONE, TWO, THREE.
( groaning )
ANY PAIN WHEN YOU URINATE?
NO, BUT I SEEM TO GO ALL THE TIME.
OKAY, WELL, WE'RE GOING TO RUN SOME TESTS.
( groans )
B.P. IS STILL LOW-- 80/50.
AND I'LL SEE IF I CAN FIND DR. CARTER FOR YOU.
OH, THANK YOU.
IT'S PROBABLY UROSEPSIS.
LET'S, UH, START HER ON A LITER OF SALINE
AND SEND OUT A C.B.C., A CHEM 7 PANEL
BLOOD CULTURES, U.A. AND A URINE CULTURE.
WHAT...?
HOW ABOUT ANTIBIOTICS?
UM, DIP A URINE TO CONFIRM THE DIAGNOSIS
AND I'LL SEE WHAT CARTER WANTS TO START HER ON.
Corday: MARK!
HI.
WE HAVE TO STOP MEETING LIKE THIS.
JUST TELL ME WE'RE GOING OUT FOR DINNER TONIGHT ALONE.
VALENTINE'S DAY? I WOULDN'T MISS IT.
FUN MORNING WITH YOUR MOTHER?
OH, SHE'S ACTUALLY THREATENING
TO COME VISIT ME AT WORK.
OH, GOOD, I'LL FINALLY GET TO MEET HER.
YEAH, DON'T HOLD YOUR BREATH.
THIS IS THE WOMAN WHO DIDN'T EVEN
PHONE ME WHEN SHE GOT INTO TOWN.
SO REMIND ME AGAIN
WHY IT IS YOU INVITED HER TO STAY WITH YOU?
DON'T GO THERE OR I'LL HAVE
TO THROW YOU INTO THAT SNOWBANK.
COULD YOU REMIND ME AGAIN...?
WHOA!
( laughing )
I CAN'T BELIEVE... YOU ACTUALLY DID.
YOU ASKED FOR IT! YOU ASKED FOR IT!
( playful screaming )
YEAH. PAUL SOBRIKI?
( playful screaming continues )
WATCH OUT.
STOP IT! STOP IT!
TRUCE.
YOU PROMISE?
I PROMISE.
YOU PROMISE?
I PROMISE.
SCOUT'S HONOR?
SCOUT'S HONOR. I'M DONE.
PROMISE?
YEAH, YEAH.
( both laughing )
JUST THE SNOWBALLS, I GUESS, HUH?
SORRY.
SO YOU'VE GOT A BAD HEADACHE. UH-HUH.
AND HAVE YOU HAD THEM BEFORE? I TAKE ASPIRIN.
( Greene and Corday continue arguing playfully )
WHY DON'T WE...? WHERE EXACTLY IS THE PAIN?
IT'S AROUND MY RIGHT EYE.
ARE YOU NAUSEATED? YEAH.
AND DOES LIGHT SOMETIMES BOTHER YOUR EYES? YEAH.
WELL, WHY DON'T WE FIND YOU A ROOM AND GET YOU CHECKED OUT?
Chen: DID YOU HIT YOUR HEAD?
Malucci: LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNESS?
LET HIM ANSWER MY QUESTION.
HE'S MY PATIENT. YOU WEREN'T AROUND.
YOUR FACE LOOKS FLUSHED.
THIS COLLAR'S PRETTY TIGHT.
GOOD MORNING, ONE AND ALL.
WHO'S RUNNING THIS?
I AM. I AM.
DR. CHEN, WHY DON'T
YOU GIVE ME THE BULLET?
GEORGE HUDSON, 55, REAR-ENDED AT A RED LIGHT.
COMPLAINS OF NECK PAIN AND MILD HEADACHE.
MR. HUDSON, I'M DR. GREENE.
ACTUALLY, IT'S DR. HUDSON.
HAS ANYBODY ASKED DR. HUDSON
WHAT HIS SPECIALTY IS?
Hudson: FAMILY MEDICINE.
I'M FROM PHILADELPHIA.
I'M JUST HERE A COUPLE DAYS TAKING A C.M.E. COURSE.
I SEE I'VE LANDED MYSELF A COUPLE OF EAGER RESIDENTS.
THAT YOU HAVE.
THEY'RE ASKING THE RIGHT QUESTIONS.
I'M GLAD TO HEAR IT.
BUT THEY DON'T EXACTLY WAIT TO HEAR THE ANSWERS.
MY APOLOGIES. THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
LET THEM CONTINUE.
YOU SURE YOU DON'T MIND?
NO, IT'S KIND OF AMUSING.
I WAS A HOUSE OFFICER ONCE MYSELF.
DR. CHEN, DR. MALUCCI, CONTINUE YOUR EVALUATION.
I'LL BE BACK TO GO OVER YOUR WORKUP.
SCREAM IF YOU NEED ME.
( laughing )
Carter: JUNE CONNELLY?
YOU SAW HER HUSBAND A FEW MONTHS AGO.
OH, WELL, I PROBABLY SAW A COUPLE HUNDRED PATIENTS SINCE THEN.
CARTER, DO YOU HAVE A MINUTE?
GOING TO SEE A PATIENT.
THIS WON'T TAKE LONG.
I'LL BE THERE.
I HAVE A 23-YEAR-OLD LAW STUDENT WITH
TWO DAYS OF RIGHT PERIORBITAL THROBBING HEADACHE
ASSOCIATED WITH NAUSEA AND PHOTOPHOBIA.
NO FEVER, NO STIFF NECK, NO HISTORY OF MIGRAINES
BUT THIS ONE SEEMS CLASSIC.
I'M THINKING A SIX OF IMITREX, SUB-Q?
YUP, SOUNDS GOOD.
YOU DON'T WANT TO EXAMINE HIM?
NO, I TRUST YOU.
LET ME KNOW HOW HE DOES.
THERE. IS THAT A LITTLE MORE COMFORTABLE?
YES, THANK YOU, DEAR.
Carter: MRS. CONNELLY.
YES?
OH, HERE YOU ARE.
YOU PROBABLY DON'T REMEMBER ME.
YES, I DO.
HOW ARE YOU FEELING?
WELL, NOT TOO BAD.
THEY'RE TAKING VERY GOOD CARE OF ME.
I'M SURE THEY ARE. YOU'RE IN VERY GOOD HANDS.
PRESSURE'S UP TO 85 SYSTOLIC.
DIPPED FOUR-PLUS POSITIVE FOR NITRATES AND LEUKOCYTES.
WHICH ANTIBIOTIC DO YOU WANT?
I WAS THINKING AMP AND GENT?
TRY 500 MILLIGRAMS OF LEVAQUIN I.V. PIGGYBACK.
THAT'S ONCE A DAY DOSING, A LITTLE LESS NEPHROTOXIC.
COULD I TALK TO YOU FOR A SECOND?
MM-HMM.
MRS. CONNELLY. OH, YES.
I'M GOING TO STOP BACK AND SEE YOU LATER, OKAY?
OH, YES, THANK YOU. YOU'RE VERY WELCOME.
BYE. BYE.
HER PRESSURE'S DANGEROUSLY LOW.
YEAH, SHE'S SEPTIC.
SHE HAS BACTERIA IN HER BLOODSTREAM.
SO WE NEED TO GET HER PRESSURE UP
USING FLUIDS AND INOTROPIC SUPPORT?
ARE YOU SURE THAT SHE WANTS ALL THAT?
WELL, SHE CAME TO THE HOSPITAL.
WE SHOULD DO EVERYTHING WE CAN.
WELL, WE SHOULD DO EVERYTHING THAT SHE WANTS US TO DO.
THAT MAY NOT INCLUDE MACHINES AND TUBES.
WELL, WHEN I WORKED IN O.B.
DOING EVERYTHING WAS PRETTY MUCH AUTOMATIC.
THIS ISN'T O.B.
TALK TO HER.
CARTER, YOU FOLLOWING LUCY'S PATIENT?
KID WITH THE MIGRAINE?
YEAH, SHE PRESENTED HIM.
IF YOU'RE GOING TO SUPERVISE, DO IT MORE CLOSELY.
WHAT'S GOING ON?
I WAS COMING TO GET YOU.
WHAT'S HIS NAME?
PAUL SOBRIKI.
HOW YOU FEELING, PAUL?
MY WIFE DOESN'T LIKE THE DINER, EITHER, AND I...
HE SUDDENLY STARTED BABBLING.
Malik: NOW HE'S PUKING.
HE'S ALTERED. WHY DIDN'T YOU COME AND GET ME?
I WAS ON MY WAY.
( Sobriki continues rambling )
THIS COULD BE ENCEPHALITIS OR MENINGITIS.
LUCY, YOU SHOULD HAVE TOLD ME THIS WHEN YOU PRESENTED HIM.
HE SEEMED FINE AND I WAS COMING TO GET YOU.
ALL RIGHT, MALIK, GIVE HIM TWO OF ATIVAN, I.V. PUSH.
LUCY, CHECK HIS ELECTROLYTES
CALCIUM, THYROID PANEL AND TOX SCREEN.
I'M GOING TO GO GET AN L.P. KIT.
GOT YOUR PAGE. WHAT'VE WE GOT?
INSULINOMA.
GRETEL WAS HAVING SEIZURES.
GRETEL? THE PATIENT?
I THOUGHT IT WAS NEUROLOGICAL
BUT THE WORKUP WAS NEGATIVE
EXCEPT FOR LOW BLOOD GLUCOSE.
WHICH SUGGESTED AN INSULIN-PRODUCING ADENOMA.
C.T. OF THE ABDOMEN SHOWS A NODULE IN THE PANCREAS.
I HOPE TO GOD IT'S NOT MALIGNANT.
THAT'S VERY CARING OF YOU, ROBERT.
I AM CAPABLE OF THAT, LIZZIE, ON OCCASION-- THIS BEING ONE OF THEM.
LET'S GO. I WANT TO SEE HER BEFORE THEY PUT HER UNDER.
I HAVEN'T EVEN...
YOU CAN FINISH UP LATER. COME ON, LET'S GO.
SHE'S READY FOR YOU, DR. ROMANO.
THERE, THERE, GRETEL. THERE, THERE.
THERE, THERE. GOOD GIRL.
ROBERT, THIS IS A DOG.
CORRECTION, LIZZIE, THIS IS MY DOG.
ATIVAN PUT HIM RIGHT OUT.
SHH... DRAW UP THE LIDOCAINE.
ONE AND FOUR FOR CELL COUNTS, PROTEIN AND GLUCOSE IN TWO
AND GRAM STAIN AND CULTURE IN THREE.
Malik: YOU GOT IT.
CHANGE OVER TO A...
27-GAUGE NEEDLE.
I ALWAYS DO.
VERY GOOD.
OKAY, I'M READY.
( loud groaning )
HOLD HIM! WHAT DO I DO? WHAT DO I DO?
WHAT ARE YOU PUTTING INTO ME? STOP!
PAUL, RELAX, IT'S OKAY, JUST CALM DOWN.
CALM DOWN, IT'S ALL RIGHT.
YOU'RE STICKING ME IN MY BACK!
MALIK, GIVE HIM ANOTHER TWO OF ATIVAN. LUCY, KEEP GOING.
NO, IT'LL BE A TRAUMATIC TAP.
WE'LL GET BLOOD IN THE SPINAL FLUID.
IT WON'T GET ANY EASIER.
( Paul groaning )
OKAY, I FEEL SOME RESISTANCE.
JUST KEEP ADVANCING.
( crying and groaning )
I'M NOT GETTING ANY FLUID.
DID YOU FEEL A POP?
NO.
KEEP GOING.
I CAN'T.
YES, YOU CAN.
STOP, PLEASE!
YOU'RE HURTING ME!
PLEASE STOP!
ALL RIGHT, CHECK THE STYLET.
ALL RIGHT, WE GOT IT.
PAUL, PAUL, JUST RELAX.
JUST RELAX.
JUST RELAX.
HEY, CRYSTAL CLEAR. GOOD JOB.
GUESS I HAVE MY BREEDS MIXED UP.
I ALWAYS THOUGHT THEY WERE WIRY LITTLE RUNTS.
MORE LIKE THAT AUSTRALIAN SILKY THING.
NOPE. ALEX, THE BOUVIER IS ROBUST
SQUARELY BUILT, WELL MUSCLED.
A HARDY DOG, THEN, YOU COULD SAY, DR. ROMANO.
EXCEPT FOR THE PANCREAS.
LIZZIE, ALEX, HOW'S GRETEL'S B.P.?
UH, I DON'T KNOW.
WE DON'T HAVE A DOG CUFF.
THEN START AN ARTERIAL LINE
AND HOOK HER TO A MONITOR.
AN ARTERIAL LINE.
JUST PRETEND YOU'RE IN DOG LAB.
THAT'S WHAT I'M DOING.
LIZZIE...
I'M SORRY. I JUST DON'T THINK IT'S PROPER
TO BE OPERATING ON YOUR DOG.
I'M CHIEF OF STAFF.
IS THAT PROPER ENOUGH FOR YOU?
BESIDES, WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE ME DO?
LEAVE HER TO SOME POODLE SURGEON?
CURVED CRILE TO CLAMP OFF THAT BLEEDER.
DR. HUDSON HAS OAT CELL CARCINOMA?
YEAH. WE ASKED HIM ABOUT PREVIOUS HOSPITALIZATIONS.
HAD SIX CYCLES OF CHEMOTHERAPY.
BEEN IN REMISSION 15 MONTHS.
NOW PRESENTS WITH A MEDIASTINAL MASS
WHICH IS WHY HE'S FLUSHED.
IT'S SUPERIOR VENA CAVA SYNDROME.
THE PROGNOSIS FOR WHICH IS...
A 25% ONE-YEAR SURVIVAL.
WHICH IS EXACTLY WHY WE SHOULD BLAST HIM
WITH RADIATION THERAPY TO SHRINK THE TUMOR
BEFORE HE GETS ELEVATED INTRACRANIAL PRESSURE.
BUT RECENT LITERATURE SHOWS THAT CHEMOTHERAPY
CAN REDUCE THE TUMOR IN TWO TO THREE DAYS.
I THINK WE SHOULD TREAT HIM WITH PLATINUM AND V.P.-16.
WHICH DOES DR. HUDSON WANT?
DID YOU EVEN ASK HIM?
( talking simultaneously )
ALL RIGHT, STOP IT, BOTH OF YOU.
LISTEN, I'M GOING TO CHECK IN ON ANOTHER PATIENT
AND THEN I'M GOING TO GO SEE DR. HUDSON
AND I'M GOING TO PRESENT HIM WITH HIS OPTIONS.
WHAT ARE WE
GOING TO DO?
YOU ARE GOING TO WATCH ME
AND SAY NOTHING.
HOW ARE YOU FEELING, MRS. CONNELLY?
OH, PRETTY DARN GOOD HERE.
PRESSURE'S 100/70.
LET'S SEE, THE FLUIDS WE'RE GIVING YOU
ARE MAKING YOU FEEL BETTER.
OH, NO. I THINK IT'S THIS YOUNG MAN HERE
WHO IS MAKING ME FEEL BETTER.
HE GAVE ME A VALENTINE'S DAY CARD.
OH, THAT WAS VERY... THOUGHTFUL OF YOSH.
CAN WE GET YOU ANYTHING?
UM... WELL, I AM A LITTLE THIRSTY.
OKAY.
I'LL GET SOME ICE CHIPS.
OOH, I-I'M A LITTLE BIT CHILLY.
MAYBE YOU COULD HELP GET MY SWEATER. SWEATER?
SURE.
IT'S DOWN THERE.
( sighs )
I DIDN'T EXPECT A CARD THIS YEAR...
WHAT WITH BARRY GONE.
I'M SORRY ABOUT YOUR HUSBAND.
WELL, HE-HE WAS AWFULLY SWEET
ABOUT THESE LITTLE CELEBRATIONS
AND ANNIVERSARIES AND THINGS.
HE ALWAYS REMEMBERED.
SOME OF MY LADY FRIENDS
HAD TO REMIND THEIR HUSBANDS.
I HAD TO REMIND MINE HE WAS MARRIED.
OH, NO. TH-THAT'S NOT GOOD.
NO. IT DEFINITELY WASN'T.
WELL... D-DID YOU, UH, SEE THIS PIN?
BARRY GAVE THAT TO ME LAST YEAR.
I DIDN'T BOTHER TO TELL HIM
THAT HE'D GIVEN ME THE EXACT SAME PIN
THE YEAR BEFORE.
WELL, THAT WAS VERY KIND OF YOU.
OH...
IT'S, UH, IT'S LOVELY, ISN'T IT?
YES, IT IS.
YES.
"BE STILL, MY HEART."
THAT'S WHAT BARRY WOULD SAY.
( sighs )
AND I...
I STILL AM.
I TRIED CALLING YOUR WIFE AGAIN
BUT I GOT THE MACHINE.
YEAH. WELL, WHEN SHE GOES SHOPPING WITH HER FRIEND...
I THINK SHE'S GETTING ME SOMETHING FOR VALENTINE'S DAY.
PAUL, YOUR SPINAL TAP WAS NEGATIVE.
WHAT? YOU STUCK ME FOR NOTHING?
WE HAD TO RULE OUT MENINGITIS.
SURE.
OKAY, UM, I HAVE TO GO BACK TO THE DINER.
WHAT DINER?
THAT'S WHERE I STUDY.
I LEFT MY BOOKS THERE.
DO OTHER STUDENTS STUDY THERE?
SOMETIMES, BUT USUALLY THEY GO
TO THE LIBRARY BECAUSE WE HAD THOSE MUGGINGS
A COUPLE WEEKS AGO.
YEAH. I THINK I READ ABOUT THAT.
YEAH. IT COULD HAPPEN AGAIN.
SOMEONE TRIED TO MUG YOU?
COULD HAVE.
IT'S A LONG WAY FROM WHERE I PARK
AND THERE'RE A LOT OF BUSHES THAT THEY COULD HIDE.
I TELL YOU, I'D LIKE... I'D LIKE TO GO SOON.
WE STILL HAVE TO DO A CATSCAN OF YOUR HEAD.
THAT'S AN X RAY, RIGHT?
ISN'T THAT BAD?
THEY SHOOT RADIATION THROUGH YOU...
IT'S A LOW DOSE.
IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO DO ANY HARM.
( door opens )
LUCY, C.T.'s READY.
OKAY. THANKS, MALIK.
WE'LL BE RIGHT THERE.
I DID A HERNIA ON A GORILLA ONCE.
MED SCHOOL.
DEAR GOD.
FUNNY YOU SHOULD MENTION THAT.
GRETEL'S BROTHER HAD A HERNIA.
LET ME GUESS: HANSEL?
OH, HO, I'M SURE YOU ALL FIND IT QUITE AMUSING
THAT I WOULD CARE SO MUCH ABOUT A DOG.
THERE'S SO MUCH ABOUT YOU THAT WE DON'T KNOW, ROBERT.
( alarm blares )
WHAT'S GOING ON?
SHE'S TACHYCARDIC.
I THINK SHE'S HAVING A SEIZURE.
SHE'S LOST HER I.V.
Romano: IT'S MAKING HER HYPOGLYCEMIC.
I CAN'T GET THE LINE IN.
GIVE ME AN AMP OF 50% GLUCOSE, NOW!
GET OUT OF THE WAY!
E.T. TUBE'S COME OUT.
SHE'S HYPOXIC.
WELL, TUBE HER AGAIN, DAMN IT!
Corday: SHE'S IN V-FIB.
SHIRLEY, GET ME THE PADDLES.
STAND BACK, ROBERT.
HOLD ON.
I SAID STAND BACK.
CLEAR!
SUPERIOR VENA CAVA SYNDROME.
THAT GIVES ME, WHAT?
A YEAR?
RADIATION THERAPY IS THE STANDARD OF CARE.
OH, CHEMOTHERAPY'S AN OPTION.
BUT IT COULD TAKE TWO OR THREE DAYS
TO RESOLVE YOUR SYMPTOMS.
I'M WORRIED THAT THE HEADACHE YOU'RE EXPERIENCING
COULD INDICATE ELEVATED INTRACRANIAL PRESSURE.
I THINK IT'S MORE LIKELY A PRODUCT OF LISTENING
TO YOUR RESIDENTS ARGUE.
THAT WAS A JOKE.
WE CAN BEGIN THE RADIATION THERAPY RIGHT AWAY.
I HAD A PATIENT WITH S.V.C. SYNDROME.
WENT WITH RADIATION
AND DEVELOPED A TERRIBLE ESOPHAGITIS.
PAIN, BLEEDING
COULDN'T EAT FOR TWO MONTHS.
WELL, IF I'VE ONLY GOT A YEAR
I AT LEAST WANT TO BE ABLE TO EAT.
I'LL GO WITH THE CHEMOTHERAPY, DR. GREENE.
HE HAD TOLD THE WAITRESS AT THE DINER
HE WAS COMING HERE.
IS THAT WHERE YOU STUDY?
NO. WE'RE IN A GROUP THAT MEETS AT THE LIBRARY
BUT THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS, I DON'T KNOW...
WELL, DID SOMETHING HAPPEN?
HE'S JUST GOTTEN SO WEIRD.
I'D SWEAR HE'S WEARING THE SAME CLOTHES ALL THE TIME.
AND WHAT ABOUT HIS GRADES?
WE WENT TO COLLEGE TOGETHER, TOO, AND HE DID REALLY WELL
BUT HE'S BEEN CUTTING CLASSES RIGHT AND LEFT SINCE SEPTEMBER.
SO, DO YOU SOCIALIZE WITH HIM AND HIS WIFE?
NOT SO MUCH ANYMORE.
HE KEEPS PICKING FIGHTS WITH ME ABOUT NOTHING.
HE KEEPS ACCUSING ME OF STEALING HIS PARKING PLACE.
STUPID STUFF LIKE THAT.
IS... IS IT SOMETHING SERIOUS?
WE DON'T KNOW ENOUGH YET.
SHOULD I GO IN AND SEE HIM?
LET HIM SLEEP.
YOU CAN SEE HIM LATER.
YOSH, WHAT IS IT?
PRESSURE'S DOWN TO 75.
I PAGED DR. CARTER.
MRS. CONNELLY?
MM...
MRS. CONNELLY!
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?
ABBY, WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?
CARTER... NOT NOW, LUCY.
PAUL SOBRIKI, HE DOESN'T HAVE A C.N.S. INFECTION.
I THINK IT MIGHT BE PSYCHIATRIC.
ALL RIGHT, I SAID NOT NOW, OKAY?
WHAT HAPPENED?
HER PRESSURE DROPPED TO 75 SYSTOLIC.
I STARTED HER ON DOPAMINE, 10 MIKES PER KILO PER MINUTE.
SHE'S STILL NOT MAKING URINE.
DOPAMINE? I THOUGHT YOU SAID
SHE DIDN'T WANT ANY HEROIC MEASURES.
SHE'S IN SEPTIC SHOCK.
I HAD TO GET HER PRESSURE UP.
DOPAMINE'S A RESUSCITATION DRUG.
SHE SAID NO TUBES OR MACHINES.
DOPAMINE'S OKAY.
WHAT IF IT'S NOT ENOUGH?
I'M GIVING HER MORE FLUIDS.
SHE'S ON HER THIRD LITER OF SALINE.
YOU'RE GOING TO PUT HER INTO CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE.
FLOOD HER LUNGS.
THEN WHAT? ARE YOU GOING TO INTUBATE?
ARE YOU GOING
TO INTUBATE?
I'LL STOP THE FLUIDS IF I HAVE TO.
SHE'LL HAVE TO BE ADMITTED TO THE I.C.U.
PRESSURE'S UP TO 90 ON 10 MIKES OF DOPAMINE.
SHE'S STARTING TO MAKE SOME URINE.
GOOD, GOOD, GOOD!
IT'S WORKING.
YEAH. MAYBE.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU WANT...
STOP FOLLOWING ME.
THAT'S ENOUGH. WHAT'S GOING ON?
HE'S MESSING WITH ME.
IS THIS YOUR PATIENT?
IT'S LUCY'S PATIENT.
RIGHT, YOU'RE SUPERVISING.
HE FOLLOWED ME DOWN HERE.
NO, I DIDN'T, I WAS CONCERNED
WHEN I HEARD HE WAS HERE.
WHAT'S HE DOING UP?
I DON'T KNOW. I WANTED A DRINK OF WATER.
OKAY, WE'LL GET YOU ONE.
DR. GREENE.
CHEN AND MALUCCI NEED YOU.
DR. HUDSON'S GOING SOUTH.
GO AHEAD, I'LL TAKE CARE OF THIS.
MALIK, CAN YOU GET PAUL BACK INTO HIS BED?
I DON'T WANT HIM TO COME.
HE'S NOT COMING, DON'T WORRY.
YOU ALL RIGHT?
YEAH.
BUT I GOT TO GET BACK TO SCHOOL.
YOU'LL TELL THAT OTHER DOCTOR?
YEAH, SURE.
Greene: DR. HUDSON?
Chen: HE'S ALTERED, UNAROUSABLE.
DR. HUDSON?
ELEVATED I.C.P.
CONNIE, GET RADIATION ONCOLOGY FELLOW
DOWN HERE RIGHT AWAY.
I'LL CALL THEM.
GIVE HIM RADIATION? HE WANTED CHEMOTHERAPY.
HE'S NOT GOING TO MAKE IT TO CHEMO.
20 OF ETOMIDATE, 100 OF SUX, WE NEED TO INTUBATE.
I'LL DO IT. I'LL DO IT.
WHY DON'T I DO IT?
FEELING BETTER, PAUL?
KIND OF TIRED.
LUCY?
BE RIGHT BACK.
WHAT IS GOING ON WITH YOUR PATIENT?
I WAS TRYING TO TELL YOU...
DR. GREENE HAD TO PULL HIM OUT OF A FIGHT.
DR. CARTER, ABBY'S LOOKING FOR YOU.
THANKS. HE MIGHT BE SCHIZOPHRENIC.
HE MEETS THE D.S.M. FOUR CRITERIA...
YOU PAGE A PSYCH CONSULT?
I WAS WAITING TO PRESENT HIM TO YOU.
PAGE THEM, GET THEM DOWN HERE, HAND THIS GUY OFF.
YOU GOT MEDICAL PATIENTS WAITING.
IT'S SO HARD TO BREATHE.
Carter: HOW'S SHE DOING?
Takata: PRESSURE'S DOWN TO 85/55 ON MAXIMUM DOPAMINE.
SHE'S GOT RALES ALL THE WAY UP TO THE APICES.
PULMONARY EDEMA FROM ALL THE FLUID--
YOU FLOODED HER LUNGS.
SHE WAS HYPOTENSIVE.
STILL IS.
HER B.P.'s TOO LOW
FOR NITROGLYCERIN OR MORPHINE.
YOU COULD TRY 40 OF LASIX.
PULSE OX IS DOWN TO 79 ON 100% OXYGEN.
I'M GOING TO INTUBATE.
NO.
SHE HAS AN INFECTION WE CAN TREAT.
SHE ONLY NEEDS TO BE INTUBATED
FOR A DAY OR TWO UNTIL IT CLEARS UP.
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.
SHE'S AN ELDERLY WOMAN
WITH MULTIPLE ORGAN FAILURE.
YOU MAY NEVER BE ABLE TO EXTUBATE.
AND THEN WHAT?
SHE SPENDS THE NEXT TWO MONTHS UP IN THE I.C.U.
HOOKED UP TO EVERY MACHINE KNOWN TO MAN?
YEAH, I KNOW, BUT I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE...
ABBY, IT'S NOT ABOUT WHAT YOU WANT.
WHAT HAPPENED? WHY'D SHE STOP BREATHING?
IT'S CALLED CHEYNE-STOKES RESPIRATION.
IT'S ASSOCIATED WITH HEART FAILURE.
( gasping lightly )
SHH...
YOU CHANGE YOUR SHIRT?
YEAH, I SAW FOUR SIX-YEAR-OLDS.
I THINK MAYBE THEY ATE TOO MANY
OF THOSE LITTLE HEARTS YOU WARNED ME ABOUT.
ALL OVER ME EVERYWHERE.
WELCOME TO THE E.R. ON VALENTINE'S DAY.
LUKA, CAROL
MULTIPLE TRAUMA COMING IN. FIVE MINUTES OUT.
PREP THE TRAUMA ROOM.
I'LL MEET YOU THERE.
WATCH OUT FOR THE REBOUND PHENOMENON
WITH THE GLUCOSE.
DON'T YOU WORRY.
WE'LL MONITOR HER CLOSELY.
DOES GRETEL HAVE INSURANCE?
I THINK WE'VE HAD ENOUGH JOKES FOR ONE DAY, ELIZABETH.
I WASN'T JOKING.
I UNDERSTAND CERTAIN VETS OFFER...
OH, MY GOD.
OH, ELIZABETH, THERE YOU ARE.
I'VE VISITED NEARLY
EVERY DEPARTMENT LOOKING FOR...
GOOD HEAVENS.
MOTHER, THIS IS DR. ROBERT ROMANO.
UM, ROBERT
THIS IS MY MOTHER ISABELLE CORDAY.
SHE'S VISITING FROM LONDON. BRIEFLY.
LIZZIE NEVER MENTIONED A THING.
IT'S A PLEASURE.
LIKEWISE.
THIS, I TAKE IT, IS NOT THE LASER ANGIOPLASTY.
NO, NO, THIS IS GRETEL
WHO HAS BEEN SUFFERING FROM AN INSULINOMA.
BUT THANKS TO A BRILLIANT ASSIST BY YOUR DAUGHTER
SHE'S GOING TO BE JUST FINE.
YES, WELL, I KNOW HOW HARD ELIZABETH TRAINED.
MOTHER, PERHAPS WE...
HOW ARE YOU ENJOYING YOUR TRIP TO CHICAGO?
I'M HERE FOR A SERIES OF LECTURES:
ADAPTIVE OPTICS, WAVE/PARTICLE DUALITY.
I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU'D WANT TO TAX YOUR MIND
WITH ALL THAT GOBBLEDYGOOK.
WE HAVE A WONDERFUL CITY, GREAT SHOPPING.
I'M GIVING THE LECTURES.
WELL, I SHOULD PROBABLY GET GRETEL SETTLED IN RECOVERY.
VERY NICE MEETING YOU.
AND YOU.
PLEASE DON'T ASK ABOUT THE DOG.
WOULDN'T DREAM OF IT.
WAS IT AN OLD ENGLISH?
( pager beeps ) BOUVIER.
UH, I'M BEING PAGED TO THE E.R.
I DON'T THINK I'VE SEEN THAT YET.
GOOD. GOOD.
DID I HEAR MULTIPLE TRAUMA?
YEAH, M.V.A. MOM, DAD, TWO KIDS.
HELP ME WITH THIS ONE.
38-YEAR-OLD WOMAN, FRONT SEAT PASSENGER
IN HIGH-VELOCITY M.V.A.
EJECTED 20 FEET FROM VEHICLE.
PULSELESS AND APNEIC.
TUBED HER, TWO LITERS OF SALINE EN ROUTE.
ROBBY EDELSTEIN, 11, REAR-SEAT PASSENGER, RESTRAINED
COMPLAINS OF LEFT WRIST PAIN.
ALERT AND ORIENTED, NO L.O.C.
B.P. IS 110/68, PULSE 110.

WHAT IS IT?
MULTIPLE TRAUMA, M.V.A.
PETER, THIS IS MY MOTHER.
HEY, HOW'RE DOING? HOW DO YOU DO?
YOU'D BETTER STAY HERE. YES, OF COURSE.
AREN'T THEY BRINGING MY DAD?
I'M SURE THEY ARE, ROBBY.
WHERE DID THEY TAKE MOMMY?
THEY'RE HELPING HER, DON'T WORRY.
LET'S GO HELP THE TWO OF YOU.
Hathaway: LET'S GO, LET'S GO!
ON MY COUNT. ONE, TWO, THREE...
DRIVER NEEDED EXTRICATION.
WAS THAT THE HUSBAND? I THINK SO.
HOLD COMPRESSIONS. HEART RATE AT 40.
THERE'S NO PULSE IN THERE. SHE'S IN P.E.A.
PULSE OX 82, SHE'S PRETTY DUSKY.
RESUME COMPRESSIONS.
SET UP FOR BILATERAL CHEST TUBES.
YOUR WRIST SORE?
A LITTLE.
CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED?
A CAR HIT US. IT WAS GOING REALLY FAST.
ROBBY, LET'S MAKE SURE YOU'RE OKAY.
COME BACK.
I WAS SITTING BEHIND MOMMY
AND I HIT MY FACE ON A BROKEN WINDOW.
WE'LL GET THOSE SCRAPES CLEANED RIGHT UP.
HIT YOUR HEAD OR PASS OUT?
NO.
WHAT ABOUT YOU, JULIA?
CAN I GO SEE MY MOM?
GOT A 41-YEAR-OLD MAN, RESTRAINED DRIVER
WITH SIGNIFICANT PASSENGER-SPACE INTRUSION..
FIRE DEPARTMENT HAD TO EXTRICATE HIM.
LOST HIS PULSE ABOUT A MINUTE OUT
STARTED COMPRESSIONS
NO TIME TO TUBE HIM.
Benton: HERE WE GO, ONE, TWO
THREE.
ANYTHING?
LOOKS LIKE TENSION PNEUMO ON THE LEFT.
LET'S GET A 14 GAUGE NEEDLE.
BETADINE.
I'LL INTUBATE. 8.0 E.T. TUBE.
WHY DON'T YOU SIT DOWN SO I CAN EXAMINE YOU.
NO, THANK YOU.
OW.
IT'S PROBABLY JUST A SPRAIN.
AND HOW ABOUT YOU? IS THIS SORE?
AREN'T THEY GOING TO LET US SEE DAD?
THEY'LL LET US KNOW, HONEY.
I'LL CLEAN UP THESE ABRASIONS WITH SALINE
AND PUT ON SOME ANTIBIOTIC OINTMENT.
THANKS. LET'S GET
A LEFT WRIST FILM FOR ROBBY
AND KEEP HIM IN A SPLINT.
AND ORDER A RIGHT KNEE FILM FOR JULIA.
MY KNEE'S OKAY.
I WANT TO GO SEE MY MOM.
1200cc's OUT THE CHEST TUBE.
RUN IN TWO UNITS OF O-NEG AND SET ME UP ON THE LEFT.
PULSE OX IS DOWN TO 73.
WHAT'S ON THE MONITOR?
V-FIB. CHARGE THE PADDLES TO 200.
STAND BY WITH EPI.
AND CLEAR.
CHARGE TO 300.
WHAT'S YOUR PLAN?
TWO CHEST TUBES AND A PERICARDIOCENTESIS.
CLEAR.
GOOD RUSH OF AIR. HOLD ON COMPRESSIONS.
I'VE GOT A PULSE.
LET'S TRY FOR A PRESSURE.
LILY, CHEST TUBE TRAY.
LET'S PREP THE LEFT SIDE.
GET SOME STERILE GLOVES, LET'S MOVE.
SYSTOLIC 60 PALP. THAT'S A START.
KEEP THE O-NEG COMING.
LET'S GET FOUR UNITS OF TYPE SPECIFIC.
TEN BLADE.
CALL FOR A VENT.
32 FRENCH.
HOW ARE THEY DOING?
DOESN'T LOOK SO GOOD.
Kovac: CLEAR.
JUST KEEP YOUR ELBOW AT A RIGHT ANGLE LIKE THIS.
THANKS.
OW.
THAT HURTS?
A LITTLE.
Corday: LET'S START HIM ON 100%
A.C. OF 14, 800 TIDAL VOLUME.
WHOA, WHOA, HE'S BLEEDING OUT.
I'VE LOST THE PULSE!
Benton: START COMPRESSIONS AGAIN. JULIA.
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
WE'VE STILL GOT TO FIX YOU UP.
WHY DON'T YOU COME BACK WITH ME?
60cc's OUT.
ANOTHER LITER OUT THE CHEST.
YOU WANT TO KEEP AUTOTRANSFUSING?
NO.
HOLD COMPRESSIONS.
( monitor flatlines )
ASYSTOLE.
THAT'S IT.
TIME OF DEATH, 15:35.
PLEASE BE SURE SHE'S CLEANED UP.
HOW'S HE DOING?
HE'S BLEEDING OUT THROUGH HIS CHEST.
HIS WIFE'S DEAD.
SHOULD WE PREP FOR A THORACOTOMY?
IT'S A FULL ARREST FROM BLUNT TRAUMA
THORACOTOMY WON'T HELP.
ISN'T THERE SOMETHING WE CAN TRY?
HE PROBABLY TORE HIS AORTA.
WE CAN'T SAVE HIM, YOU CAN STOP COMPRESSIONS.
ASYSTOLE.
TIME OF DEATH, 15:37.
WHAT SHOULD WE DO ABOUT THE CHILDREN?
I'LL TELL THEM.
I'LL GO WITH YOU.
LILY, CAN YOU MAKE SURE...
YEAH.
BOTH THEIR PARENTS ARE DEAD.
OH, GOD. UH...
WELL, WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO?
WE NEED TO LET THEM KNOW.
CLEO, THAT LITTLE ASTHMA BOY
NEAL HARTFORD, HIS STATS ARE DROPPING AND HE'S
STARTING TO HAVE RETRACTIONS.
THANKS, LYDIA.
IT'S OKAY.
ROBBY AND JULIA.
THANKS.
HELLO, ROBBY, JULIA.
I'M DR. KOVAC AND THIS IS NURSE HATHAWAY.
I'LL WAIT OUTSIDE.
NO. PLEASE STAY.
WE NEED TO TALK TO YOU FOR A MINUTE
ABOUT YOUR MOM AND DAD.
AS YOU KNOW, THE ACCIDENT WAS PRETTY BAD.
THE CAR WAS GOING REALLY FAST.
YEAH.
WE AND THE OTHER DOCTORS WORKED REALLY HARD
TO HELP YOUR PARENTS
BUT THEIR INJURIES WERE VERY, VERY SERIOUS.
AND DESPITE EVERYTHING WE TRIED TO DO
WE WERE NOT ABLE TO SAVE THEM...
AND THEY DIED.
BUT I KNOW THEY WOULD BE SO RELIEVED
TO KNOW THAT YOU'RE BOTH OKAY.
I WANT TO SEE THEM.
OKAY. THEN I'LL TELL YOU WHAT TO EXPECT WHEN WE GO IN THE ROOM.
TO HELP THEM BREATHE
WE PUT A TUBE IN THEIR MOUTH
AND THAT WILL STILL BE THERE.
YOU WILL SEE OTHER TUBES UNDER THE COLLARBONE
AND IN THE ARM THAT WE USED
TO GIVE THEM MEDICINE.
AND THEY HAD A LOT
OF SCRAPES AND BRUISES FROM THE ACCIDENT.
OKAY.
OKAY, IT'S ALL RIGHT.
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
( whimpers ): MOM.
( phone ringing )
YOU'RE EARLY.
I DIDN'T WANT TO MISS THE VALENTINE'S DAY PARTIES.
E.R.? SEEING AS HOW YOU MISSED THE DECORATING.
LUCK OF THE SCHEDULE.
AT LEAST SHE'S WILLING TO ANSWER THE PHONES.
DR. HUDSON'S STARTING TO MAKE PURPOSEFUL MOVEMENTS.
THAT'S A GOOD SIGN.
DOCTORS CHEN AND MALUCCI ARE WITH HIM.
DOING NOTHING, I HOPE.
DR. GREENE, HE'S STARTING TO MAKE...
I KNOW, PURPOSEFUL MOVEMENTS.
DR. HUDSON, COULD YOU TAKE A DEEP BREATH IN
AND THEN EXHALE?
DR. MALUCCI?
GOOD N.I.F. AND TIDAL VOLUME.
OKAY. DR. HUDSON, WE CAN EXTUBATE YOU
IF YOU'RE READY.
ALL RIGHT, TAKE ANOTHER DEEP BREATH IN...
AND EXHALE.
( coughing )
VERY GOOD.
WHAT HAPPENED?
DR. CHEN?
YOU HAD PAPILLEDEMA
AND ELEVATED INTRACRANIAL PRESSURE.
WE DID RADIATION.
THEY'LL TAKE YOU UPSTAIRS AND TAKE YOU FROM THERE.
I GUESS I OWE YOU MY THANKS
FOR GOING AGAINST MY WISHES.
IT DID SET A BAD EXAMPLE FOR MY RESIDENTS
BUT, YOU'RE WELCOME.
SO, LOOKS LIKE RADIATION WAS THE RIGHT CALL AFTER ALL.
CHEMOTHERAPY WOULD'VE WORKED
IF HE HADN'T HAD INCREASED I.C.P.
DR. CHEN, DR. MALUCCI, YOU KNOW WHY I ONLY HAD ONE CHILD?
BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT TO LISTEN TO TWO THEM
ARGUING IN THE BACK SEAT OF THE CAR.
I KNOW YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT SHE LOOKS LIKE
BUT I DON'T SUPPOSE YOU'VE SEEN MY MOTHER?
I DO KNOW WHAT SHE LOOKS LIKE.
I MET HER, WE HAD A NICE LITTLE CHAT.
SHE'S DELIGHTFUL.
AND WE'RE ALL GOING OUT TO DINNER TONIGHT.
WE?
YEAH-- YOU, ME, YOUR MOTHER AND MY FATHER.
HOW DID THAT HAPPEN? I'M NOT SURE.
SHE KIND OF HAS A CERTAIN WAY ABOUT HER.
BUT I'M GOING IN A FEW MINUTES TO PICK UP MY DAD.
I THINK SHE'S OVER AT DOC McGOO'S HAVING A COFFEE.
MOTHER!
I THOUGHT I'D LOST YOU.
NO. BY NOW I KNOW THIS PLACE LIKE THE BACK OF MY HAND.
I MET YOUR MARK.
YEAH, SO I UNDERSTAND.
AND?
HE HAS A WAY ABOUT HIM, DOESN'T HE?
ARRANGING THIS DINNER TONIGHT.
HE SEEMS TO WANT ME TO MEET HIS FATHER.
( laughing ): DON'T BE SILLY.
OH, THAT'S ALL RIGHT. I DON'T MIND.
BY THE WAY, ELIZABETH, I HAD NO IDEA.
ABOUT WHAT?
ABOUT WHAT YOU DO, I HAD NO IDEA.
THIS COFFEE IS A BIT WEAK.
YOU CAN HAVE SOME MORE AFTER DINNER.
OH, I'M SURE BY THEN, I'LL BE ON TO THE GIN.
PAUL, WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN HERE?
I-I WANTED A CUP COFFEE
AND THE NURSE GUY WASN'T AROUND...
LET'S GET YOU BACK TO YOUR ROOM.
YOU'RE HAVING A PARTY HERE.
YEAH, FOR VALENTINE'S DAY. LET'S GO.
SHOULDN'T IT BE BIGGER?
SHOULDN'T IT BE RED?
COME ON, DAD, THEY ARE WAITING.
I DON'T LIKE BEING SET UP, MARK.
YOU'RE NOT BEING SET UP.
IT IS FREEZING OUT HERE.
I IMAGINE THIS WAS ELIZABETH'S IDEA.
NOT THAT I DON'T LIKE HER.
DAD, IT'S JUST DINNER.
MARK, THIS IS NOT MY FIRST BARBECUE.
FOR GOD'S SAKES, YOUR MOTHER HASN'T BEEN GONE
BUT FOR FIVE MONTHS.
OKAY, FINE. YOU STAY HERE.
I'M GOING IN.
SHE'S A BRIT, TOO, HUH?
YEAH, DAD, SHE'S BRITISH.
WE SHOULD'VE HAD THEM OVER TO OUR HOUSE.
WE COULD HAVE PLAYED THAT TOM JONES ALBUM.
WOULD YOU RATHER JUST GO HOME?
LUCY?
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK. WHAT HAPPENED TO PSYCH?
I CALLED THEM TWICE, THEY'RE BACKED UP.
I DON'T WANT TO BE ON YOUR CASE
BUT YOU'VE GOT TO PICK UP SOME OTHER PATIENTS.
I JUST FOUND HIM IN THE LOUNGE...
HAVE YOU SUTURED THE LEG LAC YET?
I'VE GOT THE CHART RIGHT HERE...
GOOD. LET MALIK STAY WITH THIS GUY.
MALIK... JUST FORGET IT, CARTER.
YOU KNOW, MY FATHER'S CONVINCED THAT THIS WAS YOUR IDEA.
MY MOTHER THINKS IT WAS YOURS.
I TELL YOU, SHE WAS STRADDLING THE PATIENT, PUMPING ON HIS CHEST.
THAT'S NOTHING.
MARK SAVED THIS CHOPPER PILOT DOWN IN SAN DIEGO LAST YEAR.
KID HAD A TENSION PNEUMATIC SOMETHING.
SHOVED A TUBE RIGHT INSIDE OF HIS CHEST.
I SAW ELIZABETH PUT A TUBE RIGHT DOWN A MAN'S THROAT.
I SHOULD THINK THAT'S MORE DIFFICULT
THAN PUTTING IT INTO HIS CHEST.
HOW'S IT GOING?
BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A WHOLE CORPS OF NAVY PILOTS...
ELIZABETH WAS TRYING TO SAVE AN ENTIRE FAMILY.
SO, YOU'RE GETTING ON WELL?
OH, ABSOLUTELY.
COULDN'T BE BETTER.
* MY KIND OF TOWN... WHAT THE HELL?
IT'S ONE OF THOSE PLACES WHERE PEOPLE SING ALONG.
YOU MEAN, LIKE A KARAOKE THING?
WELL, UH, NOT REALLY.
IT'S TOO BAD THEY COULDN'T GET SOMEONE GOOD.
( laughing )
SHE SEEMS TO BE DOING WELL.
YEAH, ALREADY CHASING RABBITS IN HER SLEEP.
YEAH, YEAH.
SO TELL ME, SHIRLEY
DOES EVERYONE THINK I'M COMPLETELY NUTS?
OF COURSE NOT, DR. ROMANO.
ONLY THOSE OF US WHO WERE IN THE SURGERY.
YEAH.
WELL, YOU KNOW, I LIVE ALONE.
WHEN I COME HOME, IT'S JUST GRETEL.
RIGHT? RIGHT? RIGHT?
PERHAPS IF YOU SHOWED THE SAME COMPASSION FOR PEOPLE
THAT YOU SHOW FOR...
NEVER MIND.
SHE'S N.P.O., DR. ROMANO.
NO FOOD TILL SHE'S PASSED GAS.
YEAH, YEAH, GIVE ME A BREAK, SHE'S A DOG.
HAS SHE PASSED GAS?
DR. ROMANO, THE BISCUIT?
THANK YOU.
YOU'RE WELCOME.
COME HERE, GRETEL.
( up-tempo piano plays )
* A WAY OUT HERE, THEY GOT A NAME *
* FOR WIND AND RAIN AND FIRE
* THE RAIN IS TESS, THE FIRE IS JOE *
* AND THEY CALL THE WIND MARIAH... *
HE HAS A REALLY LOVELY VOICE.
CAN YOU SING, MARK?
NOPE.
I THINK IT'S RATHER BRAVE.
* ...MARIAH MAKES THE MOUNTAIN SOUND LIKE... *
WHEN I WAS A KID, HE USED TO DO THIS KIND OF THING
JUST TO EMBARRASS ME.
PARENTS DON'T TRY TO EMBARRASS THEIR CHILDREN.
IT'S TOO EASY TO DO BY ACCIDENT.
* MARIAH...
HE IS PRETTY FEARLESS.
* BLOW MY LOVE TO ME.
( heart monitor beeping )
SHE'S NOT IN ANY PAIN.
I KNOW.
AND I KNOW YOU WERE RIGHT.
SHE WAS RIGHT.
LET ME KNOW IF YOU NEED ANYTHING.
THANKS.
( long, steady tone )
ASYSTOLE.
TIME OF DEATH 19:19.
BE STILL, MY HEART.
( slow piano plays )
* WE MET AT 9:00
* WE MET AT 8:00
* I WAS ON TIME
* NO, YOU WERE LATE...
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT YOUR MOTHER KNOWS
ALL THE WORDS TO THIS.
ARE YOU KIDDING?
WE WATCHED THIS MOVIE A HUNDRED TIMES
WHEN I WAS A GIRL.
YOU LIKED IT THAT MUCH?
OH, NO, NO. SHE SAW IT AS AN OBJECT LESSON:
WOMEN SHOULDN'T DEFINE THEMSELVES THROUGH MEN.
SORRY?
WELL, GIGI WAS IN LOVE WITH GASTON.
BUT GASTON ONLY WANTED HER TO BE HIS COURTESAN.
NOW, AT FIRST SHE AGREED, AND HER GREAT AUNT
AND HER GRANDMOTHER GAVE HER LESSONS.
BUT THEN GIGI WAS UNHAPPY
SO SHE TOLD GASTON...
ELIZABETH, PLEASE, STOP.
I DON'T THINK I CAN HANDLE
THIS EVENING GETTING ANY MORE BIZARRE.
ALL RIGHT, THEN.
OOH.
YOU KNOW, THERE'S WARMER PLACES TO BE ALONE.
THERE'S A FURNACE ROOM IN THE BASEMENT.
AND, UH, THE INCUBATORS IN THE N.I.C.U.
I'D LIKE TO SEE YOU IN AN INCUBATOR IN THE N.I.C.U.
I'D BE HAPPY TO TRY.
WELL...
YOU... YOU KNOW, ALL THOSE YEARS AS AN O.B. NURSE...
98% OF WHAT YOU SEE IS JUST PURE JOY.
YOU KNOW, IT'S THE HAPPIEST DAY OF MOST PEOPLE'S LIVES.
AND, UM, THE TRAGEDY IS HORRIBLE
BECAUSE IT'S A LIFE CUT SHORT
AND IT'S A MOM WITH A BABY.
TRUE.
TODAY WAS THE FIRST DAY I SAW AN OLD PERSON DIE
AND I GUESS I'M JUST NOT USED TO IT.
WELL, YOU WANT THE GOOD NEWS OR THE BAD NEWS?
GIVE ME THE BAD.
YOU NEVER GET USED TO IT.
THE GOOD NEWS IS, YOU NEVER GET USED TO IT.
AT LEAST, I HAVEN'T.
SO, YOU MAY HAVE COME UP HERE TO BE ALONE
BUT... YOU'RE NOT.
SO THEY'RE HAVING A VALENTINE'S DAY PARTY.
YOU THINK THEY STARTED WITHOUT US?
I CERTAINLY HOPE NOT.
HEADS WILL ROLL.
( loud rock music plays )
SO, THIS IS YOUR VALENTINE'S DAY PARTY?
DON'T ASK ME, MAN. IT'S MY FIRST ONE.
I THINK WE HAVE A BIGGER KNIFE IN THE LOUNGE.
COULDN'T FIND IT.
Abby: WOW, IT'S A LOT MORE FUN THAN O.B.
YEAH, WE LIKE TO PARTY DOWN HERE IN THE E.R.
OH, LUCY, DIDN'T SUTURE THAT LEG LAC YET?
THAT GUY'S BEEN HERE FOR FOUR HOURS.
WHERE IS SHE?
STILL WAITING ON PSYCH CONSULT.
HER PATIENT'S IN CURTAIN THREE.
I WASN'T SURE YOU'D MAKE IT.
YEAH, WELL, WHO CAN RESIST BLUE CAKE?
YEP.
THE PATIENTS DON'T MIND THIS MUSIC?
WHAT?! WHAT?!
( loud rock music continues to play )
OW...
( whimpering )
SOMEBODY!
( gasping )
( grunting )
( Carter stammering )
LU... LUCY.
LUCY...
