DISCHARGED THE RULE-OUT M.I., LAST ENZYMES WERE NORMAL
AND, UH, ADMITTED THE PNEUMONIA TO MEDICINE.
SOUNDS GOOD. MORNING, LADIES.
I UNDERSTAND WE HAVE A DOUBLE TRAUMA COMING IN.
THOUGHT YOU COULD USE SOME HELP.
TWO MINORS-- WE CAN HANDLE IT.
WHILE I'M FLIPPING BURGERS, MIGHT AS WELL FLIP THESE TWO.
EXCUSE ME? RAY KROC, STARTED McDONALD'S--
ONCE A YEAR HE'D GET BEHIND THE COUNTER
MAKE THE SHAKES, FRY THE FRIES--
GET BACK IN THE TRENCHES
WHERE THE LITTLE PEOPLE WORK.
AH, SO TODAY YOU'RE WORKING IN THE TRENCHES.
WITH US, THE LITTLE PEOPLE.
I WANT TO MAKE SURE THE SHIP IS SHIPSHAPE.
( men yelling )
YOU STARTED IT!
HEY! CUT IT OUT!
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!
LET'S BREAK THIS UP.
THAT IS ENOUGH!
HEY, HEY!
GET AWAY FROM ME!
THAT'S ENOUGH!
GET YOUR HANDS OFF OF ME, YOU DUMB-ASS PUNK!
DUMB-ASS PUNK?
RANDI, WHAT'S OPEN? CURTAIN TWO.
I'LL SUE YOUR ASS! KISS MY ASS!
YOU RAN INTO ME.
YOU CUT ME OFF.
THAT'S CRAZY!
THAT'S ENOUGH!
SETTLE DOWN, BUD.
WHO YOU CALLING BUD, HUH?
Weaver: HEY, THAT'S ENOUGH!
GET OFF ME, MAN!
YOU-- THAT'S WHO, BUD.
WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED HERE?
ROAD RAGE LED TO AN M.V.A.
WHICH LED TO A FIST FIGHT.
TERRY WATERS, 46, MULTIPLE ABRASIONS
BAD LAC TO LEFT FOREARM. B.P.'s 120/80.
RANDALL JAMES, 25, ALSO MULTIPLE ABRASIONS
HEAD LAC, B.P. 110/70.
CHEN, GRAB SOME SOFT RESTRAINTS.
I DIDN'T START IT.
YOU TRIED TO SIDE-SWIPE ME.
Weaver: OKAY, WE NEED TO TREAT YOU.
THANKS FOR REAR-ENDING ME, YOU MORON.
THAT'S IT!
HEY!
Weaver: CALL SECURITY!
HOLD IT! YOU'RE THE MORON!
YOU SON OF A BITCH!
( man groaning )
HEY!
OH, MY GOD!
AAH! GET HIM!
DOWN ON THE BED, MR. WATERS!
OH, MAN, THIS IS NASTY.
( gasping ): DO SOMETHING.
HEY, JUST SETTLE DOWN.
SETTLE DOWN.
SO, ROBERT, IS THIS WHAT YOU MEAN
BY FLIPPING BURGERS? VERY FUNNY.
SEEMS TO BE UNDER CONTROL.
IF YOU DON'T NEED ANY OF THE LITTLE PEOPLE...
THANK YOU, KERRY. I'M SURE I CAN HANDLE IT FROM HERE.
SHALL I JUST, YOU KNOW, MAYBE YANK IT OUT?
NO, NO, NO-- WE'VE GOT TO CHECK FOR DAMAGE
TO THE FACIAL NERVE.
NOT TO MENTION DAMAGE TO MY PEN.
James: I'VE BEEN STABBED
AND YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT A PEN?
OH, SHUT UP.
PUT IT BACK ON, DAD.
I DON'T NEED IT.
MAKES ME WANT TO SNEEZE.
AND I DON'T NEED YOU WAITING AROUND.
I DON'T WANT TO WORRY ABOUT YOU TAKING IT OFF.
WELL, YOU BETTER GET USED TO IT
BECAUSE I'VE MADE UP MY MIND.
I'M NOT GOING TO BE DOING MY DYING
IN YOUR CRAMPED, THIN-WALLED, SECOND-FLOOR WALK-UP.
MAYBE WE OUGHT TO THINK ABOUT MOVING.
STOP, MARK. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.
EVEN IF I STAY IN CHICAGO, I WANT TO GET MY OWN PLACE.
HOW'S THAT GOING TO WORK?
WELL... I'LL GET SOMEBODY TO HELP IF I NEED IT.
NO. YOU'LL JUST IGNORE IT
LIKE YOU'VE BEEN DOING FOR THE LAST YEAR.
I KNOW YOU, DAD. NO, YOU DON'T.
YOU MIGHT KNOW THIS DISEASE
BUT YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT I WANT.
I DON'T WANT TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION RIGHT NOW.
THEN DON'T.
Kovac: CHEST X RAY IS CLEAR,
LABS ARE NORMAL, HEMATOCRIT OF 32.
WHAT'S MY POTASSIUM?
4.2. IT'S FINE.
FIGURED IT WOULD BE.
JUST HAD THAT DIALYSIS YESTERDAY.
SO, WHAT IS IT, A MAN OR A WOMAN?
I BELIEVE IT'S A MAN.
WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM?
I DON'T KNOW.
MUST HAVE BEEN AN ACCIDENT, RIGHT?
ISN'T THAT USUALLY THE DEAL?
YEAH, I THINK IT WAS. IN MINNEAPOLIS.
OH, YEAH, THEY'RE FLYING THE KIDNEY IN FROM THERE.
DR. CORDAY HAS GONE TO PROCURE THE ORGAN.
YEAH, THEY PUT IT IN A COOLER AND THAT WHOLE THING.
MAN, I DIDN'T EVER THINK
I WOULD MAKE IT TO THE TOP OF THE LIST.
YOU WERE LUCKY.
IF I WAS LUCKY, I WOULDN'T NEED THE KIDNEY.
YES, BUT SEEING AS YOU DO...
YEAH, YEAH. I'M HUNGRY.
I'M AFRAID YOU CAN'T EAT OR DRINK ANYTHING.
I'VE CLEARED YOU FOR THE SURGERY.
WE JUST HAVE TO WAIT TILL THE KIDNEY GETS HERE.
I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE.
THAT KID REALLY WAS THE ONE THAT STARTED IT
AND THEN HE RAMMED INTO MY DAMN CAR.
I KNOW, DAD, YOU SAID THAT ALREADY.
AW, DAMN IT!
UH, MR. WATERS, IT'S ALL RIGHT.
NO, IT'S NOT ALL RIGHT.
I HATE BEING CLUMSY.
HEY, IT'S NO BIG DEAL.
LET'S JUST FINISH YOUR SUTURES, HUH?
NO. YOU NEED TO HOLD STILL.
I THINK I KNOW THAT, OKAY?
DAD...
I'M SORRY. IT'S JUST BEEN A CRAPPY DAY.
LISTEN, CAN I GET SOME MORE WATER?
YEAH, SURE.
I'LL GO.
I'M, UH, JUST GOING TO HIT THE LADIES' ROOM.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK, OKAY?
IS HE ALL RIGHT?
I THINK HE'S UPSET BY WHAT'S HAPPENED.
I'VE NEVER SEEN HIM LIKE THIS BEFORE--
RUNNING INTO SOME CAR, AND HE STABBED SOMEBODY WITH A PEN?
HAS HE ALWAYS HAD A TEMPER?
NO, NEVER, BUT THIS WEEK
SINCE I'VE BEEN VISITING, HE JUST SEEMS OFF.
HE LOSES HIS BALANCE SOMETIMES, LASHES OUT AT PEOPLE.
HAS HE EVER HAD SEIZURES OR BAD HEADACHES?
NOT THAT I KNOW OF.
IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH HIM?
WELL, I WANT TO RUN SOME TESTS
AND GET A HEAD C.T.-- THEN WE'LL KNOW MORE.
UM, OH, LADIES' ROOM IS JUST DOWN THERE.
THANKS.
Cleo: HE'S BEEN TAKING CODEINE
FOR HIS BACK PAIN.
NOW HE HAS INCREASING ABDOMINAL PAIN
WITH A POSITIVE SURGICAL HISTORY FOR AN APPY.
I'M CONCERNED ABOUT A BOWEL OBSTRUCTION.
Fletcher: HAS MY KIDNEY
GOTTEN HERE YET?
I DON'T KNOW. I'M SORRY.
WELL, I'M STILL HUNGRY-- I COULD'VE EATEN.
GOOD BOWEL SOUNDS.
ANY FEVER?
NO.
VOMITING?
NOPE.
NO GUARDING OR REBOUND.
DID YOU GET AN ABDOMINAL SERIES?
YEAH. JUST CAME BACK.
EXCUSE US FOR A MINUTE, PLEASE.
MMM.
OKAY...
NOPE. NO OBSTRUCTION-- JUST A LOT OF STOOL.
SO HE'S CONSTIPATED FROM THE CODEINE.
MM-HMM. I WOULD HAVE HIM CUT BACK ON HIS PAIN MEDS
AND GIVE HIM A LAXATIVE.
ALSO... HAVE THE PHARMACY GIVE HIM BISACODYL--
TEN MIGS A DAY.
SORRY-- THOUGHT IT WAS SERIOUS.
WELL... TO HIM, IT IS.
Woman: SHE'S HAD TROUBLE BREATHING
FOR THE PAST TWO DAYS. ANY FEVER?
YES, UP TO 102 WITH LOTS OF SECRETIONS.
I SUCTIONED HER, BUT SHE GOT WORSE.
SHE WAS DIAGNOSED WITH SANFILIPPO'S SYNDROME
WHEN SHE WAS TWO.
SHE HAS A SEIZURE DISORDER, G-TUBE, PIC LINE.
SHE'S ON O2 AT HOME AND BIPAP AT NIGHT.
Hathaway: CAN ANGIE TALK?
NO, SHE'S SEVERELY RETARDED.
SHE RECENTLY LOST HER HEARING.
SHE CAN'T EVEN FEED HERSELF.
Weaver: WHAT MEDICATIONS IS SHE ON?
OH, LASIX, ALBUTEROL, ROBINUL, VALIUM
PHENOBARB, CISAPRIDE, BACTRIM.
OKAY, SHE HAS RALES BILATERALLY--
IT'S PROBABLY PNEUMONIA.
SHE WAS IN
A MONTH AGO WITH PSEUDOMONAS.
TEMP'S 102.
WANT ME TO CULTURE HER PIC LINE?
YEAH. ORDER A PORTABLE CHEST
C.B.C., LYTES, SPUTUM AND PERIPHERAL CULTURES.
OH, THE DOCTORS USUALLY GIVE HER CEFTAZ
AND MUCOMIST WHEN SHE COMES IN WITH PNEUMONIA.
WE'LL DO THE SAME.
I'M GOING TO RUN BACK HOME
AND GET HER SOME DOLLS AND THINGS.
I THINK IT MAKES HER FEEL BETTER.
DON'T WORRY, MRS. DWYER.
WE'LL TAKE GOOD CARE OF HER.
OH, UM, IS IT POSSIBLE TO GET A TV AND A VCR?
SHE LOVES TO WATCH THE MUPPETS.
SURE. WE'LL BRING ONE IN.
THANK YOU.
Cleo: WHAT HAVE WE GOT?
EDDIE BERNERO, 12, TWO DAYS OF FLU.
HIS DAD FOUND HIM IN BED THIS MORNING, BARELY RESPONSIVE.
WHERE IS DAD? COMING IN HIS OWN CAR.
B.P. 90 PALP, PULSE 120, RESPS 28.
NOT MUCH RESPONSE.
COULD BE ENCEPHALITIS OR MENINGITIS.
HE'S BEEN IN BEFORE.
THEN PULL THE OLD CHART.
THE NURSE SIGNED US OUT.
YOU SAID I HAVE TO TAKE SOME KIND OF MEDICINE.
RIGHT. GO AHEAD. I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.
YOSH, COULD YOU HELP THEM TRANSFER THAT BOY?
IS THE GRUNWALD PRESCRIPTION BACK FROM THE PHARMACY?
YEAH, IT'S RIGHT HERE.
OKAY, THERE YOU GO.
ONCE A DAY TILL THE CONSTIPATION RESOLVES.
HE'S ALL YOURS. THANKS, PAM.
OKAY, LET'S GET A C.B.C., LYTES AND DIP A URINE.
HE'S TACHY AT 150.
PRESSURE'S DROPPING, 70 PALP.
HE COULD BE SEPTIC, GOING INTO SHOCK.
MUCOUS MEMBRANES ARE AS DRY AS A BONE.
HE'S SEVERELY DEHYDRATED.
URINE'S POSITIVE FOR GLUCOSE, NO KETONES.
WHERE'S THE OLD CHART?
DOES THIS KID HAVE TYPE TWO DIABETES?
UH, IT SAYS HE WAS IN HERE FIVE MONTHS AGO FOR GASTROENTERITIS.
DO YOU HAVE A BLOOD GLUCOSE? ALMOST.
OKAY, LET'S BOLUS HIM WITH NORMAL SALINE
10cc's PER KILOGRAM.
BLOOD GLUCOSE IS OVER 400.
WHAT? ARE YOU SURE?
I CHECKED IT TWICE.
HE'S IN A HYPEROSMOLAR COMA.
LET'S START ANOTHER I.V.
REGULAR INSULIN.
.1 UNIT PER KILO PER HOUR.
LET'S GET THE BICARB
AND POTASSIUM LEVELS.
THIS KID'S BEEN SICK FOR A WHILE.
WHAT WAS HIS BLOOD GLUCOSE
ON HIS LAST ADMISSION?
THEY DIDN'T DO ONE.
YOU'RE KIDDING.
DID THEY DIP A URINE?
NOPE, DOESN'T LOOK LIKE IT.
WHO THE HELL TOOK CARE OF THIS KID?
CARTER.
WELL, PAGE HIM. GET HIM UP HERE NOW.
BLOODY FLIGHT TOOK FOREVER.
UNFORTUNATELY, WE HAVE SOME TIME.
HAD TO RULE OUT THE FIRST RECIPIENT.
WHAT? I THOUGHT YOU CLEARED HIM.
I DID, BUT HE DEVELOPED UNSTABLE ANGINA.
HE'S NOT A SURGICAL CANDIDATE.
HAVE YOU TALKED TO UNOS?
YES. THEY HAVE ANOTHER CHICAGO PERSON ON THE LIST.
SHE'S ON HER WAY.
OKAY, WELL, LET'S HOPE SHE GETS HERE
WHILE THE KIDNEY'S STILL VIABLE.
ANY FAMILY? DAD'S ON HIS WAY, AND WE'LL SEND HIM UP.
ALSO, RECHECK HIS POTASSIUM AND BICARB LEVELS IN TWO HOURS.
CLEO, WHAT'S UP?
EDDIE BERNERO, ON HIS WAY TO THE P.I.C.U--
THAT'S WHAT.
LET ME REFRESH YOUR MEMORY--
HE WAS YOUR PATIENT FIVE MONTHS AGO.
SORRY. I DON'T REMEMBER HIM.
YEAH, NEITHER DID I-- IT TOOK ME A FEW MINUTES.
YOU CALLED ME IN ON THE CASE--
COUCH POTATO KID, TYPE TWO DIABETES
FATHER WAS HAVING SOME KIND OF INSURANCE PROBLEM
SO I GUESS YOU DOCTORED THE CHART.
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
HE COULD'VE DIED OF CEREBRAL EDEMA OR AN INFARCTION
BECAUSE I REHYDRATED HIM
WITHOUT KNOWING HE HAD DIABETES.
LET ME TAKE A LOOK AT THE CHART.
HIS ELECTROLYTES WERE SO OUT OF WHACK
HE COULD HAVE DIED.
WHAT THE HELL WERE YOU THINKING?
CARTER, YOUR HEADACHE PATIENT'S HAVING A SEIZURE.
OKAY. IF ANYBODY STARTS ASKING QUESTIONS
DON'T EXPECT ME TO LIE FOR YOU.
Marquez: HEY, CARTER.
NICE HAIR.
CAN YOU GET ME EDDIE BERNERO'S CHART?
WE JUST SENT IT UP TO P.I.C.U.
I KNOW. I SAID JUST GET IT.
HENRY IS SO EXCITED.
WOULDN'T YOU KNOW THIS WOULD BE THE DAY
HE HAD TO GO TO ST. LOUIS?
HE'S ON HIS WAY BACK?
OH, YEAH.
I THINK HE COULD FLY UNDER HIS OWN POWER.
OH, I DID HEMODIALYSIS FOR FOUR YEARS
THREE TIME A WEEK, BUT THREE YEARS AGO
I SWITCHED TO C.A.P.D.
HOW OFTEN ARE THE INFUSIONS?
UH, FOUR TIMES A DAY.
HENRY SAYS IT'S LIKE GETTING MY OIL CHANGED.
A LOT.
BUT IT GIVES YOU MORE FREEDOM.
OH, YEAH. IT IS SO GREAT NOT TO HAVE
TO GO INTO THAT HOSPITAL EVERY OTHER DAY.
AND WITH THE TRANSPLANT, I'LL BE ABLE TO...
HAVE YOU HAD ANY PERITONITIS?
UH, A FEW TIMES
BUT NOT FOR AT LEAST SIX MONTHS.
OKAY.
EVERYTHING LOOKS GOOD, MRS. BASSETT.
WE'LL WAIT FOR YOUR LABS
AND THEN GET YOU UP TO THE O.R.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
YEP. I HAVEN'T HAD THAT MUCH
TO DO WITH IT, BUT YOU'RE WELCOME.
Weaver: MRS. DWYER.
ANGIE, I'M BACK.
YOU'RE GOING TO BE OKAY, SWEETIE.
NURSE HATHAWAY EXPLAIN THE SITUATION?
YES.
YOU HAVE TO START ANOTHER I.V.
YES. WE'VE BEEN TRYING
BUT ANGIE IS A VERY TOUGH STICK.
I KNOW. SHE HAS A LOT OF SCARRING
FROM PREVIOUS I.V.'s.
THAT'S WHY WE THOUGHT
IT WOULD BE BETTER TO PUT IN A CENTRAL LINE.
IT'S REALLY THE BEST WAY TO GIVE HER FLUIDS AND ANTIBIOTICS.
YES, I UNDERSTAND.
GREAT.
COULD YOU SIGN THIS CONSENT FORM?
OH, I CAN'T DO THAT.
OH, MRS. DWYER, IT'S A VERY SAFE PROCEDURE.
I'M NOT ANGIE'S REAL MOM.
I'M HER FOSTER MOM.
SHE'S BEEN IN OUR CARE FOR ALMOST FOUR YEARS.
WE WANTED TO ADOPT
BUT WE COULDN'T AFFORD THE MEDICAL EXPENSES.
WHAT ABOUT HER BIRTH PARENTS?
WELL, THEY ABANDONED HER.
UM, SHE HAS A LEGAL GUARDIAN
THROUGH, UH, D.C.F.S.
OKAY, CAROL, SEE IF YOU CAN
TRACK DOWN ADELE NEUMAN.
ISN'T THERE ANYTHING ELSE
YOU CAN DO?
WE WILL KEEP TRYING FOR ANOTHER I.V., ALL RIGHT?
OKAY, SWEETIE, HERE WE GO.
MR. BERNERO.
DR. CARTER, RIGHT?
HOW'S HE DOING, KIT?
MUCH BETTER.
BLOOD GLUCOSE IS DOWN TO 380.
HOW ARE HIS LYTES?
POTASSIUM'S NORMALIZING.
HE'LL BE HERE A COUPLE OF DAYS
BUT I THINK HE'S OUT OF THE WOODS.
DO YOU HAVE A MINUTE?
OF COURSE.
WHAT HAPPENED, MR. BERNERO?
WELL, UH, EDDIE'S GETTING MORE EXERCISE
AND WE'RE WORKING ON THE DIET ISSUES.
WHAT HAPPENED, MR. BERNERO?
YOU UNDERSTOOD I HAD AN INSURANCE PROBLEM.
YOU UNDERSTOOD THAT YOUR SON HAD
A VERY SERIOUS CONDITION.
YEAH, I CUT YOU SOME SLACK
BUT YOU AGREED TO MONITOR HIS FOOD
HIS EXERCISE AND HIS MEDICATION.
YOU KNOW HOW KIDS ARE.
YEAH, WHICH IS WHY THEY HAVE PARENTS
TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THEM.
THE INSURANCE IS WORKED OUT.
EDDIE'S COMPLETELY COVERED.
AT WHAT EXPENSE? HIS LIFE?
YOU KNOW, HE ALMOST DIED THIS MORNING.
YOU NEVER LED ME TO BELIEVE IT COULD GET THIS BAD.
EDDIE'S BEEN DOING JUST FINE
AND THEN SUDDENLY, THIS MORNING...
OH, GREAT.
GREAT, SO YOU'VE GOT NO CULPABILITY HERE AT ALL
IS THAT RIGHT, MR. BERNERO?
YOU WERE HIS DOCTOR.
YOU THOUGHT HE'D GET THROUGH A FEW MONTHS
WITH NO PROBLEMS.
I REMEMBER, THAT'S WHAT YOU SAID.
NOW IF YOU DIDN'T KNOW THIS COULD HAPPEN
HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO?
NO, THIS IS NOT AN EMERGENCY
BUT THE CHILD IS GOING TO NEED I.V. ACCESS.
YES, WE ARE AWARE OF HOW OFTEN
SHE'S BEEN HOSPITALIZED, BUT THAT HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH THIS.
HER VEINS ARE SCLEROSED. I CAN'T GET A THING.
NEITHER CAN I. THIS IS RIDICULOUS.
HERE. GIVE ME THE PHONE. COME ON.
STEVEN GALBRAITH.
HEY, MR. GALBRAITH. HI.
THIS IS KERRY WEAVER
AND I'M CHIEF OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE.
ANGIE'S PIC LINE IS INFECTED.
YOU SHOULD KNOW WHAT A PIC LINE IS.
YOU'RE HER GUARDIAN.
YES, I KNOW THAT SHE HAS AN INCURABLE DISEASE
BUT SHE'S TREATABLE AT THIS TIME...
NO, IT'S NOT A MATTER OF LIFE OR DEATH YET, BUT IT COULD BE...
MR. GALBRAITH, HAVE YOU EVER SEEN ANGIE?
HAVE YOU SEEN HER?
BECAUSE I'M LOOKING AT HER RIGHT NOW AND I'M SEEING
AN EMINENTLY TREATABLE GIRL WHO WOULD...
WELL, THANK YOU.
THANK YOU FOR NOTHING.
HE SAID NO.
SHE SHOULD BE GIVEN PAIN MEDS
AND MADE AS COMFORTABLE AS POSSIBLE.
THERE IT IS...
A HEARTBEAT.
YOU'RE DEFINITELY PREGNANT.
I THINK YOU'RE ABOUT EIGHT WEEKS ALONG.
I WISH HENRY WOULD GET HERE.
YOU'VE BEEN TRYING
TO GET PREGNANT?
FOR ALMOST TWO YEARS WITH NO LUCK, UNTIL NOW.
THIS TAKES ME OUT OF THE RUNNING, DOESN'T IT?
AFTER THE TRANSPLANT
YOU NEED TO TAKE IMMUNOSUPPRESSIVE DRUGS
AND THEY ARE VERY, VERY POWERFUL
AND IT'S LIKELY THEY WOULD CAUSE
BIRTH DEFECTS OR A MISCARRIAGE.
AND IF YOU CHOOSE NOT TO HAVE THE CHILD
THEN WE CAN GO AHEAD WITH THE SURGERY.
I'M SORRY TO PRESSURE YOU, MRS. BASSETT
BUT WE HAVE ONLY SO MUCH TIME FOR THE KIDNEY.
WE CAN'T WAIT FOR YOUR HUSBAND.
HOW COULD THIS HAPPEN?
I'VE WAITED SO LONG FOR BOTH.
MRS. BASSETT.
I WANT TO KEEP THE BABY.
OKAY.
DAVID, HAVE YOU BEEN TO AN APPOINTMENT?
YEAH, SAME OLD, SAME OLD.
SAY, WHERE'S A SNACK BAR AROUND HERE?
I'D LIKE TO GRAB A BITE BEFORE I HEAD HOME.
OH, IF YOU DON'T MIND SOME COMPANY
I'LL GO WITH YOU.
NO, LET'S GO.
Greene: HIS DAUGHTER SAYS HIS BEHAVIOR'S BEEN UNUSUAL?
ERRATIC. SOMETIMES VOLATILE.
USED TO BE A PRETTY EASYGOING GUY.
I WAS THINKING MAYBE SOME KIND OF MASS OR LESION.
NO SIGNS OF THAT.
ANY NEW STRESS AT HOME OR AT WORK?
UM, HE CLAIMS NO.
OKAY. SO, WE'VE GOT UNCONTROLLED MOVEMENTS
LOSS OF BALANCE AND PERSONALITY SHIFT.
DID YOU GET A FAMILY HISTORY?
YEAH. HIS MOM'S LIVING
BUT HE DOESN'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT HIS DAD.
HE DIED WHEN WATERS WAS 14.
SO THAT'D MAKE HIM EARLY MID-40s.
PROBABLY.
WHAT'D HE DIE OF?
SUICIDE, APPARENTLY.
WE NEED TO GO TALK TO HIM.
I JUST WISH YOU COULD TALK SOME SENSE INTO MARK.
WELL, HE'S WORRIED ABOUT YOU.
I KNOW HE IS, BUT HE ALSO THINKS
THAT HE CAN CONTROL WHAT'S HAPPENING TO ME.
HELL, I WISH HE COULD.
WE ALL KNOW HE CAN'T.
I KNOW IT'S A CLICHE TO SAY YOU DON'T WANT
TO BE A BURDEN TO YOUR CHILDREN
BUT AT MY AGE, I DON'T MIND BEING A CLICHE.
I DON'T WANT HIM
TO HAVE TO DEAL WITH EVERYTHING.
WELL, HE'S GOING TO, ONE WAY OR ANOTHER.
CAN YOU IMAGINE YOUR MOTHER ALLOWING YOU
TO TAKE CARE OF HER?
SHE'D SOONER PUSH OFF IN A CANOE
AND HEAD OUT TO SEA.
WELL, I DON'T NEED TO GO TO THAT EXTREME.
I DO WANT TO CHECK OUT THAT
UH, WHAT DO YOU CALL IT? NOT QUITE A NURSING HOME...
A HOSPICE?
THAT'S IT.
A HOSPICE.
IF I STAY IN CHICAGO
AT LEAST THAT'LL MAKE MARK HAPPY.
DAVID, I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYTHING ABOUT THIS
THAT'S GOING TO MAKE MARK HAPPY.
HUNTINGTON'S DISEASE?
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE THINKING.
I'VE NEVER EVEN HEARD OF IT.
WELL, IT'S A PROGRESSIVE NEUROLOGICAL DISORDER.
IT CAUSES LOSS OF BALANCE, MOOD CHANGES
AND JERKING MOVEMENTS OF THE BODY.
AND PROGRESSIVE DEMENTIA.
YOU MEAN, LIKE ALZHEIMER'S?
WELL, THERE ARE SIMILARITIES.
OKAY. UM, NOW WE KNOW WHAT IT IS
WHAT DO I DO?
I'M AFRAID THERE'S NO CURE.
WELL, HOW BAD IS IT GOING TO GET?
YOU'LL NEED TO DISCUSS THIS WITH A GENETICIST.
YOU'RE TELLING ME THAT I'M GOING TO LOSE CONTROL
OF EVERYTHING PHYSICALLY AND MENTALLY
AND THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO ABOUT IT?
THEY'RE ALWAYS DEVELOPING NEW TREATMENTS
BUT AT THE MOMENT, NO.
I'M 46 YEARS OLD.
HOW COULD I GET SUCH A THING?
IT'S GENETIC, MR. WATERS.
YOU INHERITED IT.
IT GENERALLY MANIFESTS ITSELF IN YOUR EARLY 40s.
IT COULD BE THE REASON WHY YOUR FATHER COMMITTED SUICIDE.
THAT MEANS I COULD HAVE PASSED THIS ON TO JO?
THERE IS A 50-50 CHANCE.
HYPEROSMOLAR COMA.
NO EVIDENCE OF D.K.A.
THIS KID'S GOT TYPE TWO DIABETES.
I'D SAY.
HIS BLOOD GLUCOSE CAME BACK FROM THE LAB AT 980.
HOW FAR DID YOU GET?
TWO LITERS OF SALINE, TEN UNITS OF I.V. INSULIN.
HE'S STILL ALTERED, UP IN THE P.I.C.U.
AND HE WAS SEEN HERE FIVE MONTHS AGO
FOR GASTROENTERITIS?
APPARENTLY.
IF HIS GLUCOSE WAS 980 TODAY
IT MUST HAVE BEEN HIGH FIVE MONTHS AGO.
YOU WOULD THINK SO.
SO WHY DIDN'T ANYONE PICK UP THE DIABETES THEN?
I REALLY COULDN'T SAY. EXCUSE ME.
DR. GREENE, COULD YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THIS ELBOW FILM?
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?
BIG ANTERIOR FAT PAD, BUT I DON'T SEE A FRACTURE.
ARE YOU THE ATTENDING?
YEAH.
DR. TILMAN, CENTURY MANAGED CARE.
I'M ADMITTING EDDIE BERNERO.
OH, THE DIABETIC COMA?
YEAH. I WAS WONDERING WHY
NO ONE PICKED UP ON HIS DIABETES
WHEN YOU GUYS SAW HIM IN NOVEMBER.
YOU HAVE THE OLD CHART?
YEAH, HERE'S A COPY.
CLEO, WHAT WAS THE GLUCOSE?
980.
NO, NOT TODAY. BACK IN NOVEMBER.
IT SHOULD BE IN THE CHART.
NO URINE DIP?
NOT THAT I SAW.
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO LOOK INTO THIS.
I'LL GIVE YOU A CALL.
THANKS. DR. FINCH.
LOOKS OKAY.
ANTERIOR FAT PAD CAN BE NORMAL.
THANKS.
WAS THERE SOMETHING
YOU DIDN'T WANT TO SAY IN FRONT OF HIM?
ABOUT WHAT?
DIABETIC KID.
HE WAS CARTER'S PATIENT.
MARK.
SHOULDN'T YOU BE IN SURGERY?
WE CAN'T SEEM TO GIVE THIS KIDNEY AWAY.
WE'RE GOING THROUGH POTENTIAL RECIPIENTS LIKE...
CRAP THROUGH A GOOSE?
YEAH. THAT WORKS.
THE MORGAN CENTER WILL BE CALLING YOU.
HOSPICE OR REHAB?
HOSPICE. WHAT PATIENT?
YOUR FATHER ASKED ME ABOUT IT.
HE'S LEANING TOWARDS PALLIATIVE CARE.
YOU CALLED THE PLACE?
HE ASKED ME TO.
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
I THINK THERE'S A SPOT OPEN.
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?
MARK, HE ASKED ME TO HELP HIM.
WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE ME DO?
TELL HIM TO TALK TO ME.
HE'S A GROWN MAN.
WITH A STUBBORN STREAK A MILE LONG.
THE ONLY OTHER OPTION IS YOUR APARTMENT.
I'M AWARE OF MY OPTIONS.
WITH YOU LOOKING AFTER HIM.
I'LL GET A NURSE'S AIDE DURING THE DAY.
I'LL DO THE REST.
YOU TALKED TO HIM ABOUT THIS?
I'M HANDLING IT, OKAY?
OR AT LEAST I WAS.
MARK, I DIDN'T MEAN TO INTERFERE.
THEN DON'T.
IS THIS WHAT'S BEST FOR YOUR FATHER
OR WHAT'S BEST FOR YOU?
ELIZABETH, STAY OUT OF IT, PLEASE.
FINE.
I CAN SEND HER UP NOW.
YEAH. THANKS.
THEY CAN SQUEEZE YOU IN.
I CAN'T SEE MY OWN OB/GYN?
NO. THERE'S TOO MANY POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS
WITH YOUR RENAL FAILURE.
UH, DR. KOVAC. YEAH.
THIS IS STEVE MALDONADO, THE TRANSPLANT CANDIDATE.
RIGHT.
ARE YOU THE SURGEON?
NO, BUT WE'LL GET YOU STARTED DOWN HERE.
I WAS GOING TO THE MOVIES
AND I LEFT MY PAGER AT HOME
AND I WENT HOME TO GET IT AND IT WENT OFF.
I HAD IT ON FOR MAYBE 30 SECONDS.
THE NURSES NEED TO DRAW YOUR LABS.
OH, OKAY. THIS WAY.
GOOD LUCK.
YEAH, THANKS.
YOU ALL RIGHT?
IF I COULD HAVE BOTH, I WOULD BE.
BUT I DO WANT THE BABY.
ASK FOR CHRISTINE COLLINS.
SUITE 4020.
OKAY. BYE.
BYE.
OKAY, MR. WATERS.
THE GENETICIST IS DR. KEVIN CASEY.
I'VE MADE AN APPOINTMENT FOR YOU
FOR NEXT FRIDAY AT 11:00
TO GO OVER THE RESULTS.
I'VE JUST BEEN ORDERED TO APPEAR IN COURT FRIDAY AFTERNOON.
THE INCIDENT THIS MORNING.
I CAN MAKE A DAY OUT OF IT.
WELL, UNCONTROLLED TEMPER IS A SYMPTOM OF HUNTINGTON'S.
THEY MIGHT NOT HOLD YOU RESPONSIBLE.
THAT'S A PRETTY LOUSY EXCUSE.
HOW IS JO DOING?
SHE'S MEETING GLEN OUT IN THE LOBBY RIGHT NOW.
IT'S HER FIANCE.
DOES SHE, UH, WANT TO HAVE THE TEST?
I DIDN'T TELL HER.
MR. WATERS, YOU HAVE TO.
I MEAN, IF SHE HAS THE HUNTINGTON'S GENE
SHE WILL EVENTUALLY GET THE DISEASE.
LISTEN, MY FATHER DIDN'T TELL ME
AND I'M GLAD HE DIDN'T.
WELL, SHE HAS A RIGHT TO KNOW.
IF THERE'S NOTHING SHE CAN DO ABOUT IT
THEN WHAT'S THE GOOD IN HER KNOWING?
BUT IF SHE KNOWS, SHE CAN DO SOMETHING.
SHE CAN MAKE DIFFERENT CHOICES.
SHE MIGHT NOT WANT TO WORK.
SHE MIGHT NOT WANT TO HAVE CHILDREN.
SHE MIGHT NOT GET MARRIED.
MIGHT NOT HAVE A LIFE.
SHE HAS TO KNOW THAT SHE CAN PASS THIS DISEASE
ON TO HER CHILDREN.
WHY? SO SHE CAN DECIDE
NOT TO HAVE ANY?
I LOVE MY DAUGHTER
AND I CAN'T IMAGINE MY LIFE WITHOUT HER.
SHE'S HAD A GOOD LIFE UP UNTIL NOW.
A HAPPY LIFE.
I'M GOING TO KEEP IT THAT WAY FOR AS LONG AS I CAN.
IF YOU SIGN AN EMERGENCY CONSENT
I CAN OVERTURN THE GUARDIAN'S DECISION.
DOESN'T D.C.F.S. HAVE TO APPOINT ME?
YEAH, I ALREADY CLEARED IT WITH ADELE.
I DON'T KNOW, KERRY.
THE GIRL'S GOING TO DIE OF PNEUMONIA SOONER OR LATER.
HER MOTHER WANTS IT.
HER FOSTER MOTHER.
SHE'S HAD ANGIE FOR FOUR YEARS.
SHE MIGHT AS WELL BE HER MOTHER.
THE ONLY REASON SHE HASN'T ADOPTED HER
IS SHE CAN'T AFFORD THE MEDICAL BILLS.
BUT THE STATE CAN?
HOW MANY HUNDRED OF THOUSANDS HAVE BEEN SPENT SO FAR?
MARK.
ALL RIGHT, I'LL SIGN.
THANK YOU.
LET ME KNOW HOW SHE RESPONDS.
I WILL.
CAN I HELP YOU, ROBERT?
MY NIECE USED TO WATCH SESAME STREET.
OUTGREW IT WHEN SHE WAS ABOUT EIGHT.
THOSE ARE THE MUPPETS.
IS THERE SOMETHING THAT YOU NEED?
I CAME IN HERE LOOKING FOR JEVITY AND A DUBHOFF TUBE.
BY THE WAY, WE NEED TO DISCUSS YOUR SUPPLY MANAGEMENT.
AND I FIND THIS GIRL'S FOSTER PARENT
CONSPIRING WITH D.C.F.S. AND APPARENTLY WITH YOU
TO CIRCUMVENT THE STATE AUTHORITY
AND PERFORM AN INVASIVE PROCEDURE ON A GIRL
WHO HAS BEEN A GORK MOST OF HER LIFE
AND HAS NO CHANCE OF RECOVERY.
DID I UNDERSTAND THIS CORRECTLY?
YOU'RE OVERSTATING IT.
AM I?
YES. SHE HAS A POTENTIALLY LIFE-THREATENING INFECTION.
ALL SHE NEEDS IS A CENTRAL LINE
AND HER SO-CALLED GUARDIAN HAS NEVER SEEN HER.
WELL, I'VE SEEN HER.
WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION
TO PROVIDE APPROPRIATE CARE.
I'M EXERCISING A SAFEGUARD
THAT'S BUILT INTO THE SYSTEM.
YOU'RE LETTING YOUR SYMPATHY FOR THE FOSTER MOTHER
OVERRIDE YOUR CLINICAL JUDGMENT.
I DISAGREE, BUT THANK YOU FOR YOUR INPUT.
THIS GIRL IS NOT TO GET A CENTRAL LINE.
SHE'S MY PATIENT.
FEEL FREE TO HYDRATE HER
THROUGH HER G-TUBE AND KEEP HER COMFORTABLE.
I ALREADY HAVE MY SECOND OPINION.
I'M THE FINAL OPINION.
I'M NOT GETTING IN A PISSING MATCH
WITH THE STATE WELFARE DEPARTMENT.
IT'S ONE BUREAUCRAT.
AND HE IS RIGHT, IT'S HOPELESS
AND EXORBITANTLY EXPENSIVE.
STOP FLOGGING HER.
I'VE COME TO EXPECT
A HIGHER LEVEL OF PROFESSIONALISM FROM YOU.
I'M SUPPORTING WHAT I SEE IS A PARENTAL DECISION.
ANGIE IS ESSENTIALLY THE WOMAN'S DAUGHTER.
SHE'S HER PET.
LOOK AT THIS GIRL.
WHAT KIND OF QUALITY OF LIFE YOU THINK SHE HAS?
ROBERT.
KERRY, I'M SERIOUS.
NO CENTRAL LINE.
HAS HE ALWAYS HAD ASTHMA?
YEAH, SINCE HE WAS ABOUT THREE.
I'M OKAY, MOM.
YOU ARE NOT OKAY, TROY.
I WAS SITTING IN THE AUDIENCE WATCHING
AND COULD SEE HIS WHEEZING GETTING WORSE.
BREATHE.
SHE CAME UP AND PULLED ME OFF THE STAGE.
THAT'S NO FUN, IS IT?
I DON'T EVER WANT TO GO BACK TO SCHOOL.
CLEO, WE GOT A BOUNCE BACK FROM THIS MORNING.
PARAMEDICS BROUGHT HIM IN.
COLLAPSED AT HOME, LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNESS.
WHO?
PATIENT NAMED GRUNWALD.
GRUNWALD?
HE WAS CONSTIPATED.
EXCUSE ME.
PULSE IS DOWN TO 50. HE'S UNRESPONSIVE.
GIVE ME A MILLIGRAM OF ATROPINE.
LET'S RUN IN A LITER OF SALINE.
SEE IF WE CAN GET A B.P.
WHAT HAPPENED?
HE WAS GETTING OFF THE TOILET, JUST FELL OVER.
GET FIRST DAY LABS, CARDIAC ENZYMES.
PRESSURE'S 60 PALP.
MIX UP THE DOPAMINE. YOUR PATIENT?
YEAH, ABDOMINAL PAIN.
IT WASN'T A SURGICAL BELLY.
WE GOT S-T ELEVATIONS
IN THE INFERIOR LEADS. HEART DISEASE?
NO. RIGHT?
YOU SAID HE DIDN'T HAVE CARDIAC PROBLEMS.
HIS HEART IS FINE.
IS HE ON ANY MEDICATIONS?
CODEINE, AND WHAT SHE GAVE HIM.
WHAT WAS THAT? A LAXATIVE.
UH...
BISO-- BISOPRO....
BISOPROLOL?
YES.
NO, NO.
WE GAVE HIM BISACODYL.
OH, WHICH ONE WAS IT?
THIS IS BISOPROLOL
BUT IT'S NOT WHAT WE GAVE HIM.
HAL, WAKE UP.
COULD YOU HAVE HER WAIT OUTSIDE, PLEASE?
MA'AM, COULD YOU COME WITH ME?
NO, NO! I SHOULD STAY HERE!
WE NEED TO WORK ON YOUR HUSBAND, MRS. GRUNWALD.
LET'S CALL THE CATH LAB.
MARY, BOLUS 5,000 UNITS OF HEPARIN.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
YOU GAVE HIM A BETA-BLOCKER
AT TWICE THE STARTING DOSAGE.
YOU DROPPED HIS HEART RATE
HIS PULSE AND YOU GAVE HIM AN M.I.
B.P.'s IMPROVING, 80 SYSTOLIC.
ALL RIGHT, UP THE DOPAMINE.
STAND BY WITH A NITRO DRIP.
I DIDN'T WRITE THE PRESCRIPTION.
I HANDED IT TO HIM, I DIDN'T WRITE IT. WHO DID?
DR. KOVAC, THE LABS ARE BACK
ON THE TRANSPLANT RECIPIENT.
GOOD. GET READY TO MOVE HIM.
NO, NO, YOU'LL WANT TO LOOK AT THIS.
YOU'RE KIDDING?
NOPE.
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO SAY?
THAT IT'S OKAY TO TELL THE DAUGHTER?
I THINK IT'S DEBATABLE.
NO, HIS CHOICE IS DEBATABLE
NOT YOUR OBLIGATION.
I HAVE INFORMATION
THAT COULD DRASTICALLY AFFECT THIS WOMAN'S LIFE
AND I'M HIDING IT.
I FEEL I HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO HER.
BUT SHE IS NOT YOUR PATIENT, HE IS.
ALL YOU CAN DO IS TRY AND CONVINCE HIM.
I DID TRY.
YEAH, WELL, YOU CAN'T TELL THE DAUGHTER.
YOUR RENAL FAILURE WAS CAUSED BY RHABDOMYOLYSIS?
YEAH, FROM MUSCLE BREAKDOWN.
AND WHAT CAUSED THAT?
I DON'T KNOW.
I THINK YOU DO.
I WAS IN A CAR ACCIDENT A FEW YEARS AGO.
IT CRUSHED MY LEG.
THEY THINK THAT COULD HAVE DONE IT.
NOT USING DRUGS?
NO.
YOU TESTED POSITIVE FOR COCAINE.
I'M SORRY.
I DIDN'T REALIZE I WAS THIS HIGH ON THE LIST.
I DON'T DO IT ALL THE TIME.
I WENT TO A PARTY
AND I WAS DEPRESSED...
THE DAMN DIALYSIS.
YOU BETTER GET USED TO IT.
YOU'RE NOT GIVING ME THE TRANSPLANT?
THE COCAINE DESTROYED YOUR KIDNEYS
AND YOU ARE STILL USING.
WHY WOULD WE GIVE YOU ANOTHER ONE?
I'M NOT GOING TO DO IT AFTER THE OPERATION.
YOU SHOULD HAVE TOLD ME.
YOU WASTED MY TIME.
PLEASE, COME ON.
I'M NOT AN ADDICT.
I NEED THIS KIDNEY.
THE ORGAN IS ONLY VIABLE FOR A LIMITED TIME.
I HAVE LESS THAN AN HOUR TO GET A REAL CANDIDATE IN HERE.
YOU MEAN SOMEONE WHO DESERVES IT.
YES.
DR. CHEN...
YES?
THIS IS GLEN, MY FIANCE.
OH, HOW DO YOU DO?
GOOD, THANKS.
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT DAD.
GLEN THINKS HE MIGHT BE SUFFERING FROM DEPRESSION.
YOU KNOW, THE MOOD SWINGS AND STUFF.
Glen: MIGHT BE THE WEDDING.
WE'RE GETTING MARRIED IN A MONTH.
HE WANTED TO PAY FOR IT.
BUT IT COST A LOT OF MONEY AND...
YEAH, THAT WOULD BE TOUGH.
I KNOW, AND JO IS HIS ONLY DAUGHTER.
I'M GOING TO MOVE THE CAR, OKAY, HONEY?
NICE TO MEET YOU, DR. CHEN.
MM-HMM.
SO YOU THINK THAT'S WHAT IT IS, DEPRESSION?
UH, WELL, IT'S HARD TO SAY.
ARE YOU READY TO GO, DAD?
YEAH, I AM, I AM.
THANK YOU, DR. CHEN.
THANKS FOR EVERYTHING.
YOU'RE WELCOME.
KERRY, I THOUGHT ROMANO SAID NO
TO A CENTRAL LINE.
HE DID.
YOU'RE DOING IT ANYWAY?
I HAVE EMERGENCY CONSENT FROM ANOTHER PHYSICIAN.
THAT'S ALL I NEED.
I GOT THIS, CAROL.
YOU'LL NEED OP-SITE.
I SAID I'VE GOT IT.
BUT, KERRY...
IT'S MY DECISION.
IT DOESN'T INVOLVE YOU.
OKAY.
LOOKS LIKE A "P" TO ME-- BISOPROLOL.
IT'S A "C." WHY WOULD I ORDER A BETA-BLOCKER?
WHAT'S THAT SAY, CARTER?
WELL, I-I CAN SEE HOW THE PHARMACY
COULD HAVE READ IT WRONG
BUT THEY REALLY SHOULD HAVE CALLED.
SURE.
BLAME THEM, YOU COWARD.
IT COULD HAVE BEEN READ BOTH WAYS.
HEY, YOU, COME HERE.
I NEED AN IMPARTIAL OBSERVER.
COME ON, THAT'S A FAX COPY.
YOU CAN'T EVEN...
IS THAT A "C" OR A "P"?
IT LOOKS LIKE A "Q."
SOMEONE ELSE WHO CAN'T READ IT.
I PRESCRIBED BISACODYL.
THAT'S WHAT I ORDERED, THAT'S WHAT I WROTE.
THEN WHY IS THIS PATIENT UNDERGOING AN ANGIOPLASTY
FOR A LIFE-THREATENING MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION?
YOU HEARD ME SAY "BISACODYL"?
YEAH.
DID YOU EVEN BOTHER TO READ THE PHARMACY LABEL
BEFORE YOU HANDED IT OUT?
THERE WAS A TRAUMA COMING IN.
OH, A TRAUMA CAME IN. OH, WELL, THEN
THAT MAKES EVERYTHING OKAY.
WHEN TRAUMAS COME IN
WE CAN JUST HAND OUT WHATEVER MEDS
HAPPEN TO BE LAYING AROUND.
DR. ROMANO... WHAT DOES THIS
HAVE TO DO WITH YOU?
NOTHING. SO, SHUT UP.
CAN I GO?
THE GROWING INCOMPETENCE HERE IS FRIGHTENING.
IT'S A WONDER WE HAVEN'T BEEN SHUT DOWN.
IT WAS AN HONEST MISTAKE.
NO, IT WAS TAG- TEAM NEGLIGENCE.
OKAY. YOU ARE BOTH PROHIBITED FROM WRITING PRESCRIPTIONS
UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE.
HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED TO TREAT PATIENTS?
I'M SURE DR. CARTER
OR ANOTHER COLLEAGUE WILL WRITE THEM FOR YOU.
HOW LONG?
UNTIL YOUR PENMANSHIP IMPROVES, AND UNTIL
YOU LEARN HOW TO READ.
I KNOW HOW TO READ.
THEN DO IT!
THANK YOU, CARTER.
THANK YOU, CARTER.
SO YOU JUST GAVE HIM A BOTTLE OF PILLS
WITHOUT EVEN LOOKING AT IT?
PETER, WHAT YOU WROTE WASN'T LEGIBLE.
I SHOULDN'T BE WRITING YOUR SCRIPTS ANYWAY.
I DIDN'T ASK YOU TO.
HE WAS YOUR PATIENT.
YOU ALWAYS CHECK THE LABEL
BEFORE YOU GIVE DRUGS.
THEY TEACH YOU THAT ON THE FIRST DAY, CLEO.
YOU CALLED UNOS?
I NEEDED TO GET THE NEXT PERSON ON THE LIST.
A MRS. NUSSBAUM.
SHE IS COMING IN FROM UPSTATE INDIANA
AND SHE'LL BE HERE IN 40 MINUTES.
WELL, THAT'LL PUSH ME PAST THE 12-HOUR MARK.
THE NEW KIDNEY MIGHT FAIL.
I THOUGHT WE WERE AT TEN HOURS.
LUKA, WE NEED TO DO A WORK UP, GET PRE-OP LABS.
SHE MAY HAVE EATEN A HEAVY MEAL
IN WHICH CASE, WE NEED TO WAIT TO ANESTHETIZE.
LET'S ASSESS HER WHEN SHE GETS HERE, ALL RIGHT?
SHE'S ALREADY ON HER WAY.
YOU SHOULD HAVE TALKED TO ME BEFORE YOU CALLED.
WE WERE IN A HURRY AND WE HAD TO MOVE ON.
LOOK, YOU MAY NOT LIKE THIS GUY
BUT WE HAVE A MATCH IN-HOUSE WHO'S READY FOR SURGERY.
COME ON, YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS.
I'D RATHER PUT A HEALTHY KIDNEY
IN A QUESTIONABLE CANDIDATE THAN NO KIDNEY IN ANYONE.
THE GUY KNOWS HE'S ON THE UNOS LIST
KNOWS HE CAN BE CALLED AT ANY MOMENT
AND HE'S SNORTING COCAINE?
HE'S NOT GOING TO STOP USING BECAUSE HE GETS THE TRANSPLANT.
HE'LL BURN HIS WAY THROUGH ANOTHER ORGAN.
WE'VE BEEN THROUGH THREE PEOPLE.
YOUR MRS. NUSSBAUM MIGHT NOT GET HERE IN TIME
OR MIGHT NOT QUALIFY FOR SOME REASON.
THEN THE KIDNEY WILL GO TO WASTE.
THEN LET IT GO TO WASTE.
I'D RATHER TAKE THE RISK THAN GIVE IT TO HIM.
IT'S NOT YOUR RISK TO TAKE.
THE GUY MADE HIS CHOICE.
GIVE THE NEXT PERSON A CHANCE TO GET HERE.
30 MINUTES.
THEN I'M TAKING UP MR. MALDONADO.
I'M NOT RELEASING HIM.
I DON'T NEED YOU TO.
SHE LIKES THIS ONE, I GUESS, HUH?
IT'S HER FAVORITE.
MOST DOCTORS THINK
SHE'S JUST RESPONDING TO THE LIGHT CHANGES
BUT I NOTICE A DIFFERENCE.
AT LEAST, I THINK I DO.
DR. WEAVER PUT IN A CENTRAL LINE.
I KNOW YOU THINK IT'S TOO MUCH...
BUT...
I'M NOT READY TO GIVE HER UP YET.
I UNDERSTAND.
EXCUSE ME.
THANK YOU.
YOU'RE WELCOME.
STREP THROAT IN CURTAIN TWO
READY TO BE DISCHARGED.
DID HE GET PENICILLIN?
YUP.
CURTAIN THREE...
WERE MY INSTRUCTIONS IN ANY WAY... UNCLEAR?
NO, I-I THINK YOU MADE YOUR POSITION KNOWN.
AND YOU DECIDED TO IGNORE IT?
I TOOK IT UNDER ADVISEMENT.
I SEE. OKAY, WELL, THEN, YOU'RE SUSPENDED.
SIGN OUT YOUR PATIENTS AND GO HOME.
ROBERT, LET'S NOT...
RIGHT NOW, KERRY. RIGHT NOW.
SUSPENDED.
EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY
AND UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE.
( chuckles ruefully )
( slams chart loudly )
CARTER, YOU GOING HOME?
YEAH. I REALLY WISH I WEREN'T, THOUGH.
MY GRANDPARENTS ARE THROWING
ONE OF THEIR DINNER PARTIES.
WELL, YOU HAVE TO GO?
I'M STAYING THERE
SO ATTENDANCE IS KIND OF COMPULSORY.
I HAVE A QUESTION FOR YOU.
SHOOT.
12-YEAR-OLD PRESENTS WITH ABDOMINAL PAIN, DIARRHEA
LOW-GRADE FEVER, NO ILL CONTACTS.
WHAT DO YOU DO?
ANY VOMITING?
NO.
PROBABLY GASTROENTERITIS
BUT THAT SOUNDS LIKE A TRICK QUESTION TO ME.
SO I'D PROBABLY ORDER A C.B.C. AND DIP A URINE
TO RULE OUT A U.T.I.
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT YOU'D DO.
DID I PICK UP ANYTHING ABNORMAL?
NOTHING ON THE C.B.C. AND, UH, I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT THE URINE BECAUSE... YOU DIDN'T ORDER ONE.
EDDIE BERNERO.
YOU SAW HIM LAST FALL.
CAME BACK TODAY WITH...
TYPE TWO DIABETES.
HYPEROSMOLAR COMA.
CLEO TOLD ME.
IS HE GOING TO BE OKAY?
SHOULD BE.
WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE IF WE'D CAUGHT IT EARLIER.
YEAH.
KID MUST NOT HAVE LOOKED THAT SICK.
WHAT DID I SAY, STOMACH FLU?
YEP.
YEAH, I REALLY WISH I COULD REMEMBER HIM.
I FEEL BAD.
MUST'VE MISDIAGNOSED.
HE DIDN'T HAVE ANY INSURANCE.
WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO DO?
WELL, THEY'RE OKAY.
THEY HAVE IT NOW.
OH, GOOD.
IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE YOU WANT TO TELL ME, CARTER?
NO.
I MADE A MISTAKE. I'M SORRY.
HAVE A NICE PARTY.
THANKS.
( knocking )
HEY.
YES, PETER?
I DIDN'T LIKE HOW WE LEFT THINGS.
YOU MEAN, YOU SCREAMING AT ME.
YOU MIND IF I COME IN?
SUIT YOURSELF.
GOT ONE MORE SET.
( Peter chuckles )
YOU ALWAYS WORK OUT IN YOUR LIVING ROOM?
BEATS THE GARAGE.
UH, LISTEN, I, UM...
( clearing throat )
I WAS ANGRY THAT I GOT DRAGGED
INTO ALL OF THIS.
IT WASN'T EVEN A SURGICAL PATIENT.
CLEO, I KNOW IT GETS CRAZY DOWN THERE.
I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT, UH...
YOU KNOW, I DON'T BLAME YOU.
OH, YOU DON'T?
NO, I DON'T.
YOU WANT ME TO GIVE YOU A HAND?
NO.
COME HERE.
AM I FORGIVEN?
PETER, THAT WAS THE LAMEST APOLOGY I'VE EVER HEARD.
I GOT TO HIT THE SHOWER.
YOU COMING?
HMM?
What's next on the wood-working agenda?
Next project, I'm going to build an airplane.
An airplane?
An airplane.
Out of wood?
No, out of cotton fiber.
DAD!
You think it'll be ready by March?
I don't think so.
Well, thanks for letting us...
I'M WEARING IT.
I JUST DIDN'T WANT TO DRAG IT TO THE CAN.
I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING.
YOU WERE ABOUT TO.
YOUR BACK-UP OXYGEN'S LOW.
I DIDN'T NOTICE.
I'LL GO TO THE HOSPITAL AND GET YOUR ANOTHER ONE.
IT SHOULD GET ME THROUGH THE NIGHT.
I WON'T TAKE ANY CHANCES.
WHATEVER YOU SAY.
I MADE SOME MACARONI AND CHEESE.
THERE'S SOME EXTRA ON THE... ON THE COUNTER.
THANKS.
SAY, I SAW ELIZABETH TODAY.
YEAH, SHE TOLD ME.
DID SHE SAY ANYTHING ABOUT THAT-THAT, THAT PLACE?
UH, THE HOSPICE?
YEAH, I CHECKED IT OUT.
THERE WEREN'T ANY SPOTS AVAILABLE.
WELL, WHEN WILL THEY HAVE ONE AVAILABLE?
I DON'T KNOW.
THEY DIDN'T SAY.
THERE'S A LONG WAITING LIST.
WAITING LIST?
WHAT-WHAT'S THE POINT OF THAT?
I DON'T KNOW.
LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE STUCK WITH ME FOR A WHILE.
YEAH.
LUKA!
HUH?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
I THINK THE GREASE FROM THE MEAT
DRIPPED ONTO THE COALS AND CAUGHT ON FIRE.
YEAH. THAT'S WHAT THE WATER BOTTLE'S FOR.
YOU DIDN'T TELL ME THAT.
HERE, WHAT'S LEFT OF IT.
THANKS.
OH, IT REALLY COOLED OFF OUT HERE, HUH?
MM-HMM.
THE GIRLS ASLEEP?
ONE OF THEM.
THE OTHER ONE'S STILL FUSSING.
LET ME GUESS-- KATE.
YOU HAD A 50-50 SHOT.
NO, SHE IS THE TROUBLEMAKER.
YEAH.
DO YOU THINK THESE ARE TOO THICK?
THEY MIGHT BE RARE INSIDE.
WELL, DON'T WORRY.
IF YOU BLOW IT, I THINK I HAVE
A STEAK AND KIDNEY PIE IN THE FREEZER.
KIDNEY, HUH?
VERY FUNNY.
YOU KNOW, THE NURSES WERE ABOUT TO TAKE A POLL.
WE THOUGHT YOU'D ACTUALLY HAVE TO TAKE IT HOME WITH YOU.
I MIGHT AS WELL HAVE.
OH, YOU PROBABLY SCARED THE GUY INTO REHAB.
WHAT'S WRONG?
WOW, IS THAT SNOW?
OH, MAN.
HELLO!
IT'S APRIL!
WE CAN FINISH COOKING INSIDE.
NO. I CAME HERE TO BARBECUE.
YOU WANT TO FREEZE?
COME ON, IT'S A LITTLE SNOW.
I'M GOING TO GET YOU A SWEATER.
I DON'T THINK YOUR SWEATERS WILL FIT ME.
I'LL FIND SOMETHING.
