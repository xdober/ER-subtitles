Man: GOT A 41-YEAR-OLD MALE.
STATUS, POST GRAND MAL SEIZURE.
ANY HISTORY?
FOUND AN OLD BOTTLE OF DILANTIN.
HE'S POST ICTAL.
WHAT'S OPEN?
UH, CURTAIN THREE, I THINK.
COMING THROUGH. CAN I HELP YOU?
Jeanie: HE'S SEIZING AGAIN. UH, NO.
Kovac: DRAW TEN OF ATIVAN. GIVE TWO NOW.
WE NEED A DILANTIN LEVEL.
THEN GIVE HALF A LOADING DOSE
SEVEN PER KILO, AND SEE IF...
YOU MESS WITH MY I.V.? LOOK AT IT.
THAT'S HOW IT WAS WHEN I PICKED IT UP.
IF THE BAG IS EMPTY
YOU ASK THEM TO CHANGE IT.
IT'S CLOTTED OFF.
I HAVE TO START A NEW ONE.
THAT'S A SHAME.
DID YOU SEE MY WALLET?
THEY TOOK MY WALLET.
MR. PARKER, STOP WORRYING.
IT'S LOCKED UP.
Weaver: FOUR UNITS OF PACKED CELLS
CHEST FILM AND PELVIS.
WHERE'S BENTON? HE'S ON HIS WAY.
WE NEED HIM.
WE NEED A FOLEY AND AN N.G.
LET'S GO.
Marquez: OKAY, LIFT YOUR TONGUE.
ALL RIGHT, THAT SHOULD HELP YOU WITH THE PAIN, OKAY.
WHAT TIME ARE YOU OFF?
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
IT'S ALMOST MIDNIGHT.
WHAT TIME ARE YOU OFF?
NOW.
I'M GOING NOW.
OKAY.
THANK YOU, MRS. ANDERSON.
ALL RIGHT. I PUT THE NICE TABLECLOTH IN THE WASHER
AND YOU SHOULD TUMBLE DRY ON LOW.
YEAH.
AND IF YOU NEED ANYTHING, YOU'LL CALL ME
BECAUSE MY NUMBER'S RIGHT THERE ON THE FRIDGE.
UH-HUH. I WILL.
AND MARK, I'M REALLY SORRY.
SHE WAS A LOVELY WOMAN.
I KNOW.
OKAY, GOOD NIGHT.
GOOD NIGHT.
( loud rasping )
YOU'RE NOT AFRAID ABOUT WAKING UP THE NEIGHBORS?
HAROLD'S DEAF AS A POST.
THEY ALL LEAVE?
YEAH.
GOOD.
WHAT ARE YOU MAKING?
I PROMISED YOUR MOTHER I'D BUILD HER
A LINEN CHEST.
OKAY.
GOOD NIGHT.
THAT WAS A GOOD SPEECH YOU GAVE TODAY.
THOSE THINGS YOU SAID ABOUT YOUR MOTHER.
I HAD GOOD MATERIAL.
YEAH.
COLOR GUARD WAS NICE, DAD.
YOU OKAY?
DEPENDS WHAT "OKAY" MEANS.
WANT ME TO STICK AROUND A LITTLE LONGER?
A FEW DAYS?
RACHEL LOVES SAN DIEGO.
DAD?
DOESN'T SEEM REAL, MARK.
I BURIED MY WIFE TODAY.
( groans )
FUN STUFF, HUH?
YEAH. SO, YOU GET A GOOD LOOK AT THE BASTARDS?
SKATERS. THEY ALL LOOK THE SAME.
DR. MALUCCI.
IT'S DR. DAVE TO YOU, LUCY.
NO NEW FRACTURES.
GEEZ, RICK, IT LOOKS LIKE
YOU BANGED UP YOUR CHIN BEFORE.
THEY DON'T LIKE THE WAY I DRESS.
LAST TIME, THEY SLAMMED MY HEAD IN A CAR DOOR.
LIKE THEY'RE THE HEIGHT OF FASHION.
HASN'T YOUR PRINCIPAL DONE ANYTHING ABOUT THIS?
WHERE DID YOU GO TO SCHOOL?
OKAY, BUDDY, I'LL LET THAT GET NUMB
COME BACK AND STITCH YOU UP, RIGHT?
Lucy: UH, MR. ZITO, THE C.O.P.D.er, IS RETAINING.
CAN I DECREASE HIS O2?
SURE, WHY NOT?
TWO LITERS?
THAT SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING.
HEY, DAVE. EXCUSE ME.
DID YOU CALL PLASTICS ON THAT LAP?
UH, NAH, I GOT IT.
IT IT'S THROUGH AND THROUGH
AND CROSSES THE VERMILION BORDER
WE USUALLY, UH, CALL PLASTICS.
WELL, HE ALREADY HAS A SCAR
FROM THE FIRST TIME IT HAPPENED.
THAT'S ALL THE MORE REASON.
RANDI'S GOT THE ON-CALL LIST.
TWO LITERS, OKAY?
WHAT? HOW MUCH SHOULD I DECREASE HIS O2?
OOH, I DON'T KNOW. CRANK IT DOWN.
IF HE TURNS BLUE, CRANK IT BACK UP.
YOU'RE KIDDING, RIGHT?
NO. PURPLE AIN'T GOOD.
JUST KEEP HIS PULSE OX ABOVE 90, OKAY?
OKAY.
HEY, IT'S JACKIE JOYNER.
HEY, JACKIE. NICE SPANDEX.
GET A LIFE.
THAT'S GOOD.
SHE'S HOT FOR ME.
YEAH. YOU'VE BEEN HERE THREE DAYS
SHE'S HOT FOR YOU.
DOESN'T TAKE LONG, BRO.
LOOKS LIKE YOUR DRUNK IS BACK.
OH, DUDE, WHAT HAPPENED?
I DISCHARGED YOU TWO HOURS AGO.
YOU GOT TO KNOW WHEN TO HOLD THEM.
HE WAS PASSED OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF WABASH.
WHEN DID HE HAVE THE TIME?
YOU HAVEN'T MET VODKA JOE?
SOME DAYS, HE'S IN TWO OR THREE TIMES.
YOU GOT TO KNOW WHEN TO FOLD THEM.
I SHOULD HAVE LEFT HIS I.V. IN.
NICE OF YOU TO BRING HIM BACK, OFFICER.
JUST DOING MY DUTY.
YOU GO TO KNOW WHEN TO WALK AWAY.
EXACTLY. YOU-YOU GOT THIS?
I GOT IT. THANK YOU SO MUCH.
HEY, SWEETHEART, YOU WANT TO MEET UP WITH A GAMBLER?
HEY, HEY, WATCH IT, COWBOY.
THAT'S MY FIANCEE.
REGGIE. WHAT?
FIANCEE. YOU GUYS ENGAGED?
NOT EXACTLY. PRETTY MUCH.
KNOW WHEN TO RUN.
Romano: I WANT TO COMMEND
THE SURGICAL SERVICE ON THEIR TIMELY RESPONSE
AND CLINICAL COMPETENCE.
WE HAD EXCELLENT OUTCOMES
WITH NO SIGNIFICANT DELAYS IN CARE.
CAN YOU COVER FOR ME THIS MORNING?
THERE WAS ONE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT DEATH.
I HAVE OUTPATIENT CLINIC.
YEAH, BUT IT'S IMPORTANT.
...PHYSICIAN PERFORMANCE.
DO YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO ADD
DR. BENTON?
NO.
THEN, PLEASE GIVE US THE COURTESY OF YOUR FULL ATTENTION.
AS A FINAL NOTE
YOU SHOULD ALL OFFER DR. CORDAY YOUR CONGRATULATIONS
SINCE MOST OF YOU WILL BE WORKING WITH HER
IN HER NEW POSITION AS ASSOCIATE CHIEF OF SURGERY.
ALL DEPARTMENTAL CONCERNS CAN BE FUNNELED THROUGH HER OFFICE
INCLUDING O.R. SCHEDULES, RESEARCH FUNDING
UH, COMMITTEE ASSIGNMENTS, ETC., ETC.
UH, THANK YOU, AND HAVE A GOOD DAY.
MELANOMA?
IT STARTED AS A SMALL MOLE
ON HER BACK BUT IT WAS STAGE FOUR--
METASTASIZED ALL OVER.
LIVER, LUNGS... THEN HER BRAIN.
SHE FAILED CHEMO?
SIX CYCLES
THEN IMMUNOTHERAPY.
PULSE OX 89 ON TWO LITERS.
POSSIBLE PLEURAL INFUSION.
THERE'S FLUID IN HER LUNGS.
LAST TIME IT WAS THIS BAD
THEY HAD TO DRAIN IT.
SHE HAD A SEIZURE RECENTLY?
NO. WHY?
IT MIGHT EXPLAIN HER ALTERED MENTAL STATUS.
SHE'S BEEN OUT OF IT
FOR THE LAST MONTH.
HER ONCOLOGIST TELLS US
IT'S THE BRAIN METS OR THE LIVER FAILURE.
I SEE.
LET'S GET CHEST X RAYS
C.B.C., P.T./P.T.T.
YOU SHOULD KNOW SOMETHING.
SHE DOESN'T WANT TO GO BACK TO I.C.U.
SHE HAS A "DO NOT RESUSCITATE" ORDER?
I JUST BROUGHT HER IN
BECAUSE HER BREATHING AND PAIN SEEMED WORSE
AND I THOUGHT YOU COULD MAKE HER COMFORTABLE.
THAT WE CAN DO.
OH, MARK, WHEN DID YOU GET BACK?
LATE LAST NIGHT.
THE PLANE WAS DELAYED FOUR HOURS OUT OF SAN DIEGO.
HOW DID IT GO?
ALL RIGHT, I GUESS.
ROUGH, HUH?
WOW, YOU GREW IN A WEEK.
THANKS, MARK.
DR. CARTER.
HEY, DR. GREENE.
I'M SORRY ABOUT YOUR MOM.
THANKS. WHAT DO YOU GOT?
20-YEAR-OLD GIRL.
END-STAGE MELANOMA.
MARK, CAN WE HAVE COFFEE LATER?
YOU ON ALL DAY?
YEAH, JUST STARTED.
SHE'S D.N.R.
FATHER BROUGHT HER IN BECAUSE SHE'S ALTERED
AND IN PAIN.
WHAT DOES THIS ALL MEAN?
WHAT? OH, THAT'S DR. WEAVER'S NEW CHARTING SYSTEM.
WHAT WAS WRONG WITH THE OLD ONE?
IT'S ACTUALLY KIND OF COOL.
THERE'S A SEPARATE FORM FOR EVERY COMPLAINT.
MULTIPLE-CHOICE MEDICINE.
YEAH, SORT OF.
SO, ANYWAY I WAS THINKING
ABOUT DOING A THORACENTESIS
OR TAPPING HER BELLY.
DID YOU GET A CHEST X RAY?
YEAH, SHOOTING NOW.
WELL, I'D PULL UP THE OLD ONES FOR COMPARISON.
MARK, WELCOME BACK.
THANKS, KERRY.
NICE NEW CHECK LIST.
OH, YEAH. IT'S GREAT.
THE "T" SYSTEM.
I'LL TRAIN YOU ON IT LATER, OKAY.
CAN'T WAIT.
LIZZIE
20 MINUTES.
IT TOOK YOU 20 MINUTES TO COME
AND SEE ME.
I'M SHOCKED.
I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE FIVE, TEN TOPS.
WHAT'S ALL THIS ABOUT, ROBERT.
WHAT, NO "THANK YOU, I'M HONORED."
NO "I HOPE I DON'T DISAPPOINT"?
EVERYONE THINKS YOU'RE SERIOUS.
THAT'S BECAUSE I AM SERIOUS.
YOU KNOW ME. I'M BOUND
TO RUFFLE A FEW FEATHERS IN THIS NEW JOB.
I NEED YOU TO SMOOTH THINGS OVER.
I HAVE TO HIT THE HEAD.
IF YOU WANTED TO OFFER ME A POSITION
WHY DIDN'T YOU ASK ME PRIVATELY?
WHERE'S THE FUN IN THAT?
BESIDES, I KNEW YOU'D TAKE IT.
I HAVEN'T TAKEN IT.
OH, IS THAT A NO?
I DIDN'T THINK SO.
MUCH AS YOU MAY VIEW ME AS A LOATHSOME TOAD
I KNOW YOU'RE PRAGMATIC
AND MORE PREDICTABLY
YOUR AMBITIOUS NATURE WILL PREVAIL.
YOU'LL LEAPFROG FIVE OR SIX YEARS.
THAT'S NOT THE POINT.
NO, THE POINT IS
I'M HANDING THIS TO YOU.
A FAST-TRACK CAREER
INDEPENDENCE IN THE O.R.
THE FREEDOM TO MAKE YOUR OWN SCHEDULE
WITH THE MINOR ANNOYANCE OF REPORTING TO ME.
I DON'T VIEW YOU AS A LOATHSOME TOAD, ROBERT.
I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW HAPPY I AM TO HEAR THAT, ELIZABETH.
THERE'S A SMILE.
OH, HE'S A CUTIE, HUH?
YOU'RE GOING TO BREAK SOME HEARTS, AREN'T YOU?
IT'S TIME FOR HIS COCKTAIL.
ANY SIDE EFFECTS?
NO, HE'S A TROOPER.
THE PNEUMONIA'S CLEARED UP.
HE'S EATING SOLIDS.
NORMAL WHITE COUNT?
YEAH, 10,000.
ALL DONE.
SUCH A GOOD BOY.
I'M GOING TO MISS YOU.
IS HE BEING DISCHARGED?
UH-HUH. D.C.F.S. WILL BE HERE SOON.
SO THEY FOUND A FOSTER FAMILY?
HE'S GOING TO AN EMERGENCY
INTAKE CENTER.
HE NEEDS FOSTER CARE, ONE-ON-ONE NURTURING.
INTAKE IS TEMPORARY.
I'M SURE THEY'LL FIND SOMEONE.
SOMEONE WHO'LL WANT TO ADOPT AN HIV BABY?
THAT MOTHER IS NOT GOING TO PULL THROUGH.
THAT MOTHER DIED YESTERDAY.
T.M.s ARE CLEAR.
YOU TALK FUNNY.
Woman: HUNTER!
THANK YOU. SAY "AH."
AH.
THAT'S BECAUSE HE'S FROM FAR AWAY.
HOW FAR?
SO FAR THAT IT'S DARK THERE ALREADY.
THROAT'S RED, ALL RIGHT.
PROBABLY AN UPPER RESPIRATORY INFECTION.
SO HE'LL NEED ANTIBIOTICS?
NO, USUALLY IT'S VIRAL.
GIVE HIM LOTS OF FLUIDS.
OKAY.
I'LL COME BACK SOON, OKAY?
WE SHOULD DO A RAPID STREP TO BE SURE.
YOU GOT IT.
SO WHERE ARE YOU FROM?
CROATIA.
OH, WOW.
HERE'S A PRESCRIPTION IF IT'S POSITIVE.
GREAT. YOU FORGOT TYLENOL.
THE DOCS GIVE US A STANDING ORDER FOR FEVER.
YES, BUT FEVERS HAVE A PURPOSE.
YEAH, THEY TELL US WHEN SOMEONE'S SICK.
AND IT'S THE BODY'S NATURAL WAY
TO FIGHT INFECTION.
THAT'S GOOD, NO?
I SUPPOSE.
SO... WHY STOP IT?
MAKE THE KID FEEL BETTER?
OKAY.
GOT A L.O.L. IN THREE DUMPED BY ROSEWOOD.
NEEDS A NURSE.
NOT MUCH I CAN DO FOR HER.
HEY, HOW YOU DOING?
I TOLD THE MEDIATOR
I'M NOT TRYING TO TAKE REESE FROM CARLA.
BUT I CAN'T LET CARLA TAKE REESE FROM ME.
DO YOU THINK SHE'S DOING
THIS TO HURT YOU?
SHE DOESN'T SEEM TO CARE.
DO YOU CARE ABOUT HER SITUATION?
WHAT IS IT?
I JUST NEVER TALKED TO A THERAPIST BEFORE.
DR. BENTON, I'M NOT HERE TO PSYCHOANALYZE YOU.
I ONLY NEED TO ASSESS
THE FAMILY DYNAMIC FOR THE COURT.
WELL, IT'S SIMPLE.
CARLA AND I
BOTH LOVE OUR SON
BUT SHE'S TRYING TO TAKE HIM AWAY
SO HER NEW HUSBAND CAN PURSUE HIS CAREER.
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT HIM?
ROGER?
YES.
HE'S A DECENT GUY.
GOOD TO YOUR SON?
YEAH, SURE. LOVES HIM?
WHY ARE WE TALKING ABOUT ROGER?
THIS IS ABOUT ME, REESE AND CARLA.
LIKE IT OR NOT
HE FACTORS INTO THIS.
HOW DO YOU THINK YOU'D DEAL WITH IT
IF CARLA WAS ABLE TO TAKE REESE OUT OF THE COUNTRY?
THAT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.
IF IT DID?
THE TWO MOST RECENT CHEST FILMS
ON JUNE 28 AND JULY 17.
I'LL TAKE THE FOLDER.
HEY, CONGRATULATIONS.
NICE TO KNOW YOU'RE IN THE LOOP.
SO IT'S TRUE.
SORRY, CARTER, I HAVE A PATIENT.
AYE, AYE, CHIEF!
PLEASE.
Man: HERE YOU GO.
VANESSA?
I'M SORRY.
I DIDN'T MEAN TO DISTURB YOU.
Â¿DONDE ESTOY?
YOU'RE IN THE HOSPITAL.
THE NURSING HOME SENT YOU OVER.
SI, SI, ME ACUERDO.
ONE OF THE NURSES BROUGHT THIS BY.
SHE SAID YOU DON'T USUALLY LET IT OUT OF YOUR SIGHT.
MAGGIE.
I THINK SO.
AY... TAN LINDA.
WISH I HAD THE DISCIPLINE TO KEEP A JOURNAL.
OH, IT'S NOT MINE.
PAUL KEPT IT.
I JUST LIKE IT NEAR ME.
IS THAT THE SACRED HEART?
YOU'RE CATHOLIC.
EASTERN ORTHODOX...
SORT OF.
I HOPE IT WORKS OUT FOR YOU.
I'M SORRY?
IN THE END, IT DOESN'T HELP MUCH.
IT DIDN'T HELP PAUL.
HARD TO BELIEVE IN A GOD
THAT DOES THAT TO A MAN LIKE HIM.
( sighs )
TOO BAD.
HEAVEN SOUNDS GOOD RIGHT NOW.
WOULD YOU LIKE TO TALK TO A PRIEST?
OH, GOD, NO.
WE HAVE THEM ON CALL.
OH, DON'T TROUBLE YOURSELF.
IT'S REALLY NO BOTHER.
OH, REALLY, DON'T.
BOB...
HI. HI.
DID YOU GET MY PAGE?
I'M SORRY, I'M SWAMPED.
WHAT'S UP?
YOU'RE DISCHARGING THE ORTEGA BABY TO INTAKE?
YEAH, I COULDN'T FIND ANYBODY.
I'LL TAKE HIM.
WHAT?
I'LL TAKE HIM, HOME. I'LL TAKE HIM.
YOU'RE A LICENSED FOSTER PARENT?
NO, BUT I CAN BECOME ONE.
THAT'S NICE OF YOU, BUT I'M AFRAID NOT VERY REALISTIC.
WHY NOT?
YOU HAVE TO BE SCREENED
HAVE A FEW MONTHS TRAINING...
WELL, I-I CAN DO ALL OF THAT
AND TAKE CARE OF HIM IN THE MEANTIME.
IT HAS TO BE BETTER THAN INTAKE.
( sighs )
HE NEEDS A MOTHER.
DO YOU HAVE ANY OTHER CHILDREN?
NO. I CAN FOCUS ON HIM.
SUPPORT SYSTEM?
I CAN DO IT.
I DON'T KNOW-- IT'S NOT POLICY.
MAYBE IT'LL BE A GOOD SHORT-TERM SOLUTION
UNTIL I CAN FIND A LICENSED FOSTER PARENT.
OR UNTIL I GET LICENSED.
LET ME LOOK INTO IT.
NO PROMISES.
OKAY.
( chuckles )
HEY.
MMM...
HEY, REESE.
HOW YOU DOING?
HEY, CARLA.
PETER.
MS. SIMMONS.
I'M DEBRA WEXLER.
HI.
WHENEVER YOU'RE READY.
UH...
GO AHEAD, IT'S PRETTY PAINLESS.
( sighs )
GO AHEAD, REESE.
GO TO MOMMY.
GO AHEAD. GO. GO ON.
( crying )
OH, I KNOW, I KNOW.
IT'S OKAY.
HEY, MAN, IT'S OKAY.
HEY, REESE, HEY... SEE YOU LATER, HUH?
SEE YOU LATER.
I LOVE YOU.
I KNOW. I LOVE YOU.
( crying continues )
LOCULATED FLUID AROUND THE LUNGS AND LOTS OF METS.
IS THIS GOING TO HELP?
BELLY WAS PRETTY TENSE.
IT'S GOING TO RELIEVE SOME ABDOMINAL PAIN
AND TAKE PRESSURE OFF THE DIAPHRAGM
BUT SHE'S STILL GOING TO HAVE TROUBLE BREATHING.
THIS IS THREE LITERS.
OKAY.
I'LL TAKE THIS TO THE LAB.
YOU HAVE A PAY PHONE AROUND HERE?
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO CALL HER MOTHER.
SURE. I'LL TAKE YOU.
OKAY, SWEETIE.
BE RIGHT BACK.
OKAY?
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
OKAY.
YOU DIDN'T CALL.
OH, HI.
I'M SORRY.
I GOT IN LATE.
YOU OKAY?
YEAH.
HOW'S YOUR DAD?
WE'LL SEE.
HE WAS SHAKEN UP, BUT... I DON'T KNOW...
NUMB.
I MEAN, MOM WAS OKAY
AND, THEN, BOOM-- HEART ATTACK.
IT'S GOING TO TAKE A WHILE
FOR IT TO SINK IN FOR HIM, I GUESS.
AND YOU?
I DON'T KNOW.
I DID HEAR A VICIOUS RUMOR ABOUT YOU.
REALLY?
WHICH ONE?
WELL, IT WAS ACTUALLY, UH, MORE OF AN ANNOUNCEMENT.
OH. IT WAS AS MUCH A SHOCK TO ME AS ANYONE.
WHAT IS HE UP TO?
OH, YOU KNOW ROBERT.
HE ALWAYS HAS TO BE DRAMATIC.
YEAH, BUT WHY'D HE PICK YOU?
I DON'T KNOW.
PERHAPS HE THINKS I'M A TALENTED SURGEON.
THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT.
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO TAKE IT, ARE YOU?
I WAS CONSIDERING IT, YES.
OKAY.
WHAT?
NOTHING.
SO, I'M GOING TO HAVE TO DEAL WITH ROMANO.
WELL, HE'S A SMALL PRICE TO PAY FOR SUCH AN ADVANCEMENT.
IT'S BETTER THAN ANYTHING I COULD GET AT RUSH.
IF YOU SAY SO.
OH, STOP IT.
IF YOU FEEL A NEED TO EXPRESS AN OPINION
AT LEAST ARTICULATE IT.
FINE, OKAY?
YOU CAN'T TRUST THAT GUY.
HE'S SCREWED YOU IN THE PAST.
HE'S NOT GOING TO HESITATE TO DO IT AGAIN
BUT I THINK YOU KNOW THAT.
YES, AND IT'S MY PROBLEM, ISN'T IT?
I THINK IT WILL BE.
RICK, SOUP AND MILKSHAKES FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS.
STITCHES COME OUT IN FIVE.
WHEN CAN I GET THIS PIERCED?
YOU GOING TO PUT THAT THING BACK IN?
SCREW THAT-- I'M NOT GOING TO LET THOSE LOSERS WIN.
GOOD FOR YOU, BRO.
I'LL SEE YOU NEXT TIME, THEN.
FINALLY GOT HOLD OF PLASTICS, HUH?
NICE JOB, HUH?
DID YOU EVEN CALL THEM, DAVE?
YEAH, I CALLED THEM.
THEY TRIED TO RECRUIT ME.
HEY, I NEED TWO MILLIGRAMS OF MORPHINE FOR MRS. BRAGA.
BRAGA...
YOUR L.O.L.
OH, YEAH, SURE.
DON'T YOU WANT TO SEE HER?
NO, I TRUST YOU.
IS THAT ROACH COACH OUT THERE ALL DAY?
YEAH. YEAH.
HI. I SENT UP SOME PERITONEAL FLUID.
PATIENT NAMED "STEHLY"-- S-T-E-H-L-Y...
MEDICAL RECORD NUMBER 4-5-2-9-8-6.
( blowing )
( whispering ): HEY.
OKAY, THANK YOU.
HI.
HOW ARE YOU?
HOW ARE YOU?
I'M FAMISHED.
I WAS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD
SO I THOUGHT I'D STOP BY...
SEE IF YOU WANTED TO GET SOME LUNCH.
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD?
YEAH, I HAD A MEETING IN THE HANCOCK BUILDING.
AH.
SO, CAN YOU SLIP AWAY?
I DON'T KNOW. UM...
( door bangs open )
HEY, WHOSE RIG IS THAT?
YO, WHOSE RIG IS THAT?!
WHAT ARE YOU SCREAMING ABOUT?
WHERE ARE THE PARAMEDICS WHO DRIVE THAT RIG?
TRY THE CAFETERIA. WHY?
Carter: DAVE, WHAT'S GOING ON? CAFETERIA.
CALL 911-- CONSTRUCTION ACCIDENT DOWN THE STREET.
WELL, HANG ON A SECOND!
HOLD ON!
OH, YOU'RE BUSY.
TONIGHT?
TONIGHT'S A GIVEN.
Carter: WHAT ARE YOU DOING, DAVE?
I GOT TO HELP THIS GUY
HIS FRIEND IS TRAPPED.
WHAT HAPPENED?
WORKING THE CRANE, DROPPED AN H-BEAM
AND WE CAN'T GET HIM OUT.
HE RAN HERE FOR HELP.
JUST A BLOCK AND A HALF AWAY.
IS HE CONSCIOUS?
NO. IS HE BREATHING?
I DON'T KNOW.
ARE YOU COMING?
HOLD ON.
COUNTY TO DISPATCH
WE HAVE REPORTS OF A CONSTRUCTION-SITE ACCIDENT
ON THE 1200 BLOCK OF CLAYBURN.
WE NEED YOU THERE, CODE THREE.
COME ON, MAN, LET'S GO.
WE DON'T HAVE TIME.
COME ON!
DOCS RESPONDING.
IF HE'S BREATHING, WE DON'T TOUCH HIM.
YES, MOM.
IT'S RIGHT THERE.
HOW'D IT HAPPEN?
OH, GOD!
THE CHOKER MUST HAVE SLIPPED.
IT SWUNG RIGHT INTO HIM.
COMING THROUGH.
COME ON, DOCTORS-- WATCH OUT.
CAREFUL-- DON'T WANT TO BURN HIM.
ALMOST GOT IT!
ANYBODY CALL 911?
Man: AIN'T YOU
THE 911 GUYS?!
NAH, YOU GET THE REAL DEAL, MY FRIEND.
KEVIN, GO BACK TO THE TRAILER
AND MAKE SURE GORDY CALLED! SIR?
SIR, CAN YOU TELL ME YOUR NAME?
WHAT'S HIS NAME?
UH, JOE, JOE SANDERS.
Carter: MR. SANDERS!
RADIAL PULSE--
WEAK AND THREADY.
MR. SANDERS!
HE'S DUSKY.
HIS LEG IS TOTALLY CRUSHED.
I DON'T SEE HIS CHEST MOVING.
TUBE HIM, NOW.
WE GOT TO GET IN THERE FIRST.
YOU REACH HIM?
YEAH, BUT I CAN'T SEE.
WELL, THEN, WE GOT TO DO IT WITHOUT THE SCOPE.
YOU EVER DONE A BLIND INTUBATION?
NO, BUT WE GOT TO DO SOMETHING.
ALL RIGHT, I'LL DO IT.
OH, COME ON, MAN, LET ME DO IT.
THIS ISN'T A TEACHING CASE.
FIND A WINDOW; BE MY EYES.
ALL RIGHT, I'LL TALK YOU THROUGH IT.
ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT, WHERE AM I?
Malucci: MOVE TO THE LEFT.
NO, WRONG WAY, WRONG WAY.
MY LEFT OR YOUR LEFT?
MY LEFT, YOUR RIGHT.
OKAY.
THAT'S HIS SHOULDERS. MOVE UP.
UH-HUH.
THAT'S HIS EAR.
THERE YOU GO, THERE YOU GO.
MOVE UP. THERE YOU GO.
THERE YOU GO. OPEN IT.
BINGO.
YOU GOT IT?
HOLD ON.
HAVE YOU DONE THIS BEFORE?
Carter: ONCE...
ON A CADAVER.
ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT, UH, THERE'S THE EPIGLOTTIS.
I'M IN THE VULECULA.
THERE.
ALL RIGHT.
PUT IT DOWN THE RIGHT PIPE.
( chuckling ): YEAH.
( sirens approaching )
I HEAR OUR E.M.S. BOYS.
TOO LITTLE TOO LATE.
ALL RIGHT, I'M IN!
( gasping breaths )
AMY... YOU NEED TO KEEP THAT MASK ON, OKAY?
AMY...
I CAN'T... BREATHE.
AMY, MY NAME IS DR. GREENE.
YOU'RE IN THE HOSPITAL.
YOUR FATHER BROUGHT YOU HERE.
OKAY?
NOW, I NEED YOU TO KEEP THAT MASK ON.
OKAY?
HELP ME.
( gasping )
AMY...
I CAN GIVE YOU SOME MORPHINE
TO MAKE YOU MORE COMFORTABLE.
( mumbles )
WHAT?
I DON'T WANT TO DIE TODAY.
( gasping )
DO YOU WANT ME TO PUT YOU ON A VENTILATOR
TO HELP YOU BREATHE?
IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT?
THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE YOU'LL NEVER COME OFF OF IT.
I DON'T... WANT... TO DIE.
( gasping )
LYDIA.
I NEED RAPID INDUCTION.
15 MILLIGRAMS ETOMIDATE.
100 OF SUX.
YOU'RE GOING TO INTUBATE?
YES.
WELL, SHE'S A D.N.R.
NOT ANYMORE.
LET'S GO.
SHE WAS ON A VENT FOR OVER TWO WEEKS.
SHE HAD A STENT FOR HER LIVER
AND NEEDED OVER EIGHT UNITS OF BLOOD.
NOW SHE'S HAD ENOUGH.
LISTEN, I UNDERSTAND YOUR FEELINGS
BUT THIS IS WHAT SHE WANTED.
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT SHE WANTS.
SHE SIGNED A D.N.R. THREE MONTHS AGO.
COMING THROUGH! WATCH YOURSELF!
ALTERED MENTAL STATUS, ABRASIONS TO THE ABDOMEN
CRUSH INJURY WITH DEFORMITY TO THE LEFT LEG.
HE'S ON HIS WAY. WHERE'S DR. BENTON?
THIS IS A FEMUR FRACTURE.
WHY DIDN'T YOU USE A SAGER SPLINT?
THERE WAS DEBATE ABOUT THAT.
WE NEEDED TO GET HIM HERE.
YOU WERE IN THE FIELD?
OH, YEAH. SUPER DOCS HAD HIM INTUBATED.
HE WASN'T BREATHING.
ON MY COUNT-- ONE, TWO, THREE.
Benton: WHAT DO WE GOT, PEOPLE?
CRANE OPERATOR VERSUS H-BEAM-- PLOWED RIGHT INTO HIM.
MULTIPLE BLUNT TRAUMA, CRUSHED LEFT FEMUR, HYPOTENSIVE.
WHY WASN'T HE PUT IN TRACTION?
B.P. WAS CRASHING.
YUP. GO. YOU GOT IT FROM HERE, PETER?
YOU'VE KNOWN HER FOR 20 MINUTES. I'M HER FATHER.
HOW MANY TIMES DO I NEED TO TELL YOU THIS?
SHE DOES NOT WANT THIS. WE DECIDED.
EXCUSE ME. I'M DR. WEAVER
CHIEF OF THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT.
I'VE GOT IT, KERRY.
ARE YOU HIS SUPERVISOR?
WHAT SEEMS TO BE THE PROBLEM?
MY DAUGHTER IS DYING OF CANCER
AND SHE HAS A "DO NOT RESUSCITATE" ORDER
AND WHEN I LEFT THE ROOM, HE PUT HER ON A VENTILATOR
AND NOW HE WON'T TAKE HER OFF.
SHE ASKED ME TO.
SHE WOULDN'T DO THAT.
DO YOU HAVE THE PAPERS WITH YOU?
I CAN GET THEM.
MAYBE YOU SHOULD.
NOW THAT YOUR DAUGHTER'S INTUBATED
IT GETS A LITTLE COMPLICATED.
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
I'M NOT SURE THAT WE SHOULD EXTUBATE HER
UNTIL SHE'S BREATHING ON HER OWN.
Hathaway: B.P.'s 90/60, PULSE 110.
HE'S BLEEDING. PERITONEAL LAVAGE. LET'S GO.
HOLD ON, LET THE DOCTORS TAKE IT FROM HERE, OKAY?
YEAH, I AM A DOCTOR. ONLY THINKS HE'S A PARAMEDIC.
DAVID MALUCCI, NEW SECOND-YEAR RESIDENT.
DR. DAVE.
OKAY, GOOD BREATH SOUNDS.
SO, D.P.L., LET'S GO.
HOLD ON, DR. DAVE.
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GET A TRAUMA PANEL
LATERAL C-SPINE, CHEST AND PELVIS
LEFT FEMUR, LET'S GO.
WHO IS THIS GUY?
SURGICAL TRAUMA FELLOW.
CALL HIM DR. PETE.
YOU WANT O-NEG?
GET FOUR UNITS, A PRESSURE DRESSING ON THIS
TRACTION; SET ME UP FOR D.P.L.
IS THERE AN ECHO IN HERE?
DIDN'T I JUST SAY THAT?
WHAT? GET OUT OF HERE.
I SAID OUT. GET OUT.
WHAT DID I DO? WAIT. I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
COME ON, DAVE. LET'S GO.
COME ON, I'M NOT LEAVING. THIS IS OUR PATIENT.
TO BE THE HERO, DROP THEM OFF AT THE DOOR.
CARTER, NOW! SHUT UP.
HEY, HEY, HEY.
( clattering )
OKAY. LET'S GET A NEW KIT. YOU OKAY, CAROL?
YEAH, FINE.
THAT'S OKAY. COME ON, LET'S GO.
I'M GOING TO CALL MY LAWYER.
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU DID THIS.
MARK, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
MY JOB, KERRY. IT'S NOT YOUR PROBLEM.
IT IS MY PROBLEM.
I'M HEAD OF THE DEPARTMENT.
BY TITLE, REMEMBER? YOU SAID SO YOURSELF.
IF YOU EVER STEAL MY GEAR AGAIN
I'M GOING TO KICK YOUR ASS.
YEAH, RIGHT, HE WASN'T BREATHING.
ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY RELAX.
WE DIDN'T KNOW WHERE THE HELL YOU WERE.
AND IT SOUNDED IMPORTANT.
WHAT IF WE WERE CALLED TO ANOTHER SITE
AND DIDN'T HAVE OUR EQUIPMENT?
WHY DON'T YOU GO RIP IT OUT OF HIS THROAT?
BREAK IT UP. THIS IS NOT THE APPROPRIATE TIME OR PLACE.
YOU WANT TO TAKE IT OUTSIDE?
OH, YEAH, I'LL TAKE IT OUTSIDE.
NOBODY IS TAKING ANYTHING ANYWHERE.
ZADRO, GO BACK TO WORK.
WHAT'S THE POINT? I GOT DOCTORS TO DO IT FOR ME.
GO BACK TO WORK. GET OUT OF HERE.
YOU TWO, HOLD ON.
HOLD ON. GET BACK HERE.
CAN WE TELL YOU WHAT HAPPENED?
I HEARD WHAT HAPPENED.
DO YOU HAVE A BRAIN BETWEEN YOU?
DR. WEAVER, WE CALLED...
NO, NO! I TALK, YOU LISTEN.
YOU WORK IN THIS HOSPITAL
NOT ON THE STREET.
YOU ARE NOT TRAINED FOR IT.
YOU ARE NOT COVERED FOR IT
AND YOU HAVE PATIENTS HERE WHO NEED YOUR ATTENTION.
ONE OF THEM MIGHT'VE CODED OR WE MIGHT HAVE BEEN HIT
WITH TWO OR THREE OTHER TRAUMAS
WHILE YOU WERE OFF PLAYING PARAMEDIC.
WERE YOU?
DON'T EVEN START WITH ME, DR. MALUCCI.
I'M ONLY CUTTING YOU THIS MUCH SLACK BECAUSE YOU'RE NEW HERE
AND YOU, CARTER, YOU SHOULD KNOW BETTER.
YOU'RE EMERGENCY RESIDENTS, NOT PARAMEDICS.
IS THAT UNDERSTOOD?
IS IT UNDERSTOOD?!
THAT WAS GREAT, DAVE.
THANKS, I APPRECIATE THAT.
Kit: WE DOCUMENT ALL CONSENTS IN THE CHART.
IS THERE A PROBLEM?
YOU DIDN'T TELL ME YOU TESTED THE BABY FOR HIV.
I TOLD YOU HE WAS POSITIVE.
I THOUGHT WE WERE ASSUMING.
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU TESTED HIM WITHOUT THE MOTHER'S CONSENT.
THE MOTHER WAS COMATOSE.
WE HAD TO GET HIM STARTED ON THE ANTIVIRAL DRUGS.
WELL, WHO AUTHORIZED IT?
I DID.
I WAS LOOKING OUT FOR THE BABY.
WE GAINED TEN DAYS OF TREATMENT.
YOU BROKE THE LAW.
WILL THIS AFFECT YOUR DECISION ABOUT FOSTER CARE?
I'LL HAVE TO EXPLAIN THIS.
WILL IT?
NO, YOU OBVIOUSLY CARE ABOUT THE CHILD.
BUT...
IT'S NOT GOING TO WORK.
WHY NOT?
THE DIRECTOR WON'T APPROVE IT.
DID YOU ASK HIM?
I'M SORRY, JEANIE.
I SAID I'D LOOK INTO IT.
I DID.
IS IT BECAUSE I'M BLACK?
WHAT?
I'M BLACK, THE BABY'S HISPANIC.
WHAT DO YOU TAKE ME FOR?
I'M NOT REALLY SURE, 'CAUSE YOU'D RATHER PUT HIM IN A FACILITY
EVEN AFTER I TOLD YOU I WOULD TAKE HIM.
YOU'RE NOT QUALIFIED.
IT'S AS SIMPLE AS THAT.
IS IT BECAUSE OF MY HIV STATUS?
IT DOESN'T HELP.
LOOK, I'M HEALTHY.
THERE'S NO REASON TO THINK
THAT I WON'T CONTINUE TO BE HEALTHY.
WHAT ABOUT WHEN THE CHILD IS FIVE?
WHEN HE'S TEN? CAN YOU SAY THAT THEN?
CAN ANYONE SAY THAT?
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO TELL YOU NO ANY OTHER WAY.
I KNOW HIS NEEDS.
I WOULD BE...
IT'S NO, MISS BOULET.
THE ANSWER IS NO.
Benton: LAVAGE IS NEGATIVE.
HE LOST A FEW LITERS FROM THE POPLITEAL ARTERY.
WHAT'S THE TIBIA LOOK LIKE?
COMMINUTED FRACTURE IN 20 PIECES.
AH, IT'S A MESS.
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHERE DO YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING?
SHIRLEY CLEARED O.R. ONE.
YEAH, WELL, THANKS FOR BUFFING HIM UP, PETER
BUT LIZZIE CAN TAKE IT FROM HERE.
YEAH, BUT HE'S A TRAUMA PATIENT.
AND THIS TRAUMA FELLOWSHIP OF YOURS
IS THROUGH THE E.R., CORRECT?
YEAH, SO?
SO, THAT'S AN O.R. THAT'S FOR SURGEONS.
YEAH, BUT I'VE BEEN OPERATING THE LAST THREE WEEKS
AS A TRAUMA FELLOW.
I KNOW, BUT NOW, AS CHIEF OF STAFF
I HAVE TO BE CONCERNED WITH CREDENTIALS.
YOU CHOSE THIS, NOT ME.
ELIZABETH, I LEAVE IT UP TO YOU.
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES IS THAT MAN TO GO INTO THAT OPERATING ROOM.
CALL SECURITY IF YOU HAVE TO
AND ENJOY YOUR FIRST SOLO SURGERY.
SOLO?
YES, AN ASSOCIATE CHIEF CAN OPERATE BY HERSELF.
DR. BENTON.
PETER...
HEY, ARE YOU OKAY?
UH, THIS CASE...
A DYING GIRL...
DAD'S CALLED A LAWYER...
WEAVER...
FORGET IT.
MARK... MAYBE YOU SHOULD TAKE A FEW DAYS OFF.
I JUST HAD A WEEK OFF.
THAT WASN'T A VACATION, MARK.
LOSING A PARENT IS AS STRESSFUL AS IT GETS.
I HAVE TO GET BACK TO WORK.
( woman speaking Spanish )
WHY ISN'T HE HERE?
VANESSA?
VA VENIR?
I'M SORRY.
VA VENIR?
IS WHO COMING?
THE PADRE.
THE PRIEST?
WHY ISN'T HE HERE?
( speaking Spanish )
NO, YOU TOLD ME NOT TO.
I DON'T WANT TO GO ALONE.
POR FAVOR, DONDE ESTA?
OKAY, OKAY, HE'LL BE HERE.
JEANIE, I DIDN'T KNOW THAT YOU WERE CONSIDERING BECOMING A FOSTER PARENT.
ROBERT MARTIN CALLED ME THIS AFTERNOON ASKING FOR A REFERRAL.
I THINK THAT WOULD BE GREAT.
YEAH, UNFORTUNATELY, IT'S NOT GOING TO WORK OUT.
WHY NOT?
I DIDN'T GET A CLEAR ANSWER.
I THINK THERE'S TOO MANY THINGS STACKED AGAINST ME.
IS THERE ANYTHING I CAN DO?
NO, THANKS, KERRY.
SOME THINGS AREN'T MEANT TO BE.
I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW.
Greene: NEXT TIME, WAIT TILL THEY STOP SWINGING AT THE PINATA
BEFORE YOU DIVE FOR THE CANDY, OKAY?
EXCUSE ME.
MARK, UH, MR. STEHLY'S MAKING A LOT OF NOISE.
I'M GOING TO NEED A DETAILED RECORD
REGARDING THE CARE OF HIS DAUGHTER.
NEW CHARTING SYSTEM SHOULD HELP.
THIS IS SERIOUS, MARK.
DO YOU UNDERSTAND THE POSITION YOU'VE PUT US IN?
I FOLLOWED THE STANDARD OF CARE BASED UPON MY PATIENT'S WISHES.
SHE'S OVER 18.
SHE SIGNED A D.N.R. AND GAVE HER FATHER POWER OF ATTORNEY.
SHE STILL HAS RIGHTS.
AMY STEHLY'S THROWING P.V.C.s.
TEN TO 12. HOW MANY?
YOU GIVE HER LIDOCAINE?
NOT YET. JUST WANT
TO MAKE SURE SHE'S NO LONGER D.N.R.
NO. YES.
SO, WHAT DO I DO IF SHE CODES?
RESUSCITATE HER.
NO, CARTER, DON'T.
KERRY, SHE'S MY PATIENT.
I CAN'T ALLOW YOU TO IGNORE A STANDING D.N.R.
SHE REVOKED HER D.N.R.
SHE CAN'T. YES, SHE CAN.
NOT WITH ALTERED MENTAL STATUS.
DID YOU SEE HER C.T.?
THAT GIRL HAS METS ALL OVER HER BRAIN.
SHE'S ON MORPHINE, PROBABLY HYPOXIC.
I TALKED TO HER, KERRY.
SHE WAS CLEAR, CONSCIOUS AND ALERT.
WELL, I DIDN'T SEE THAT.
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO TRUST ME.
I'M NOT SURE
YOU'RE IN THE STATE OF MIND RIGHT NOW TO BE OBJECTIVE.
PERHAPS I SHOULD TAKE OVER ON THIS ONE? KERRY...
I'VE GOT IT COVERED.
MARK, I'M TAKING THIS PATIENT.
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO FIRE ME FIRST.
SO WHAT DO I DO IF SHE CODES?
NOTHING, CARTER, YOU DO NOTHING.
IF SHE CODES, CALL ME, CARTER.
IS THIS LIST RIGHT? I'VE PAGED FATHER ERPS TWICE.
I THINK HE'S ON SABBATICAL IN BRAZIL.
THERE'S A JUNIOR JESUIT SUBBING FOR HIM.
WELL, WHERE'S HIS NUMBER?
IT'S AROUND HERE SOMEWHERE.
FIND IT, RANDI.
THE LADY DOESN'T HAVE MUCH TIME.
LUCY, WHERE'S MALUCCI?
HE PREFERS DR. DAVE.
WHATEVER. WHERE IS HE?
TRY THE COAST GUARD.
MAYBE HE'S DOING SEARCH AND RESCUE.
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?
THIS WOMAN'S B.P. IS DOWN TO 60 PALP.
HER KIDNEYS HAVE SHUT DOWN. SHE NEEDS DOPAMINE.
I GOT IT.
REALLY? YEAH.
THANK YOU.
HAVE YOU SEEN MARK?
HE WAS JUST HERE.
IS HE STILL ON?
I THINK SO.
HEY, ELIZABETH--
I HEAR YOU LAID UP TODAY IN THE O.R.
"LAID UP"?
YEAH. GOLF TERM-- PLAYED IT SAFE.
LIVED TO CUT ANOTHER DAY.
THAT'S NOT A CRITICISM.
WE ALL GET MORE CONSERVATIVE
WHEN WE'RE IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT.
WELCOME TO THE BIG LEAGUES.
LISTEN, ROBERT--
ABOUT PETER...
PETER, PETER, PETER.
DON'T YOU EVER GET TIRED OF THAT SUBJECT?
HE ACCEPTED THIS FELLOWSHIP
THINKING HE'D OPERATE ON HIS TRAUMA PATIENTS.
I KNOW.
HE'S A BOARD ELIGIBLE...
I KNOW.
I'M JUST MESSING WITH HIM.
SO YOU'LL LET HIM OPERATE?
MMM, FOR YOU, LIZZIE... ANYTHING.
BUT ONLY ON TRAUMA, NOT ELECTIVE CASES
AND NO GENERAL SURGERY.
NATURALLY.
YOU POLICE HIM. I DON'T WANT TO DEAL WITH IT.
FINE.
SO, IS THAT AN OFFICIAL
ACCEPTANCE OF MY OFFER?
I SUPPOSE IT IS, YES.
WISE CHOICE.
I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW.
OH, UH... HERE'S A TERMINATION LIST.
WE NEED TO CUT LOOSE SOME DEAD WEIGHT
AND IT'LL SOUND BETTER COMING FROM YOU.
DR. CORDAY.
UH, CARTER, HAVE YOU SEEN MARK?
UH, HE'S AROUND HERE SOMEPLACE.
I THINK YOU SAW A PATIENT OF MINE IN RADIOLOGY TODAY.
NICHOLAS?
YOUR PATIENT?
YEAH, CAME IN A COUPLE WEEKS AGO.
FENDER BENDER.
SAID SHE HAD SOME MINOR CERVICAL TENDERNESS.
DID I MISS SOMETHING?
NO, IT WAS NOTHING TO DO WITH AN ACCIDENT.
SHE CAME FOR A SECOND OPINION.
AH.
ON, UH... ON WHAT?
INFILTRATING DUCT CELL CARCINOMA.
BREAST CANCER.
SO, SHE'S, UM... LOOKING AT SURGERY?
HAS TO HAVE A MASTECTOMY.
MMM.
Haleh: CARTER!

HE MIGHT CARDIOVERT. LET'S OPEN UP THE PADS.
Kerry: NO NEED, HALEH.
SHE'S A D.N.R.
DR. WEAVER...
IT'S ALL RIGHT, JOHN.
I UNDERSTAND
THAT YOU'RE IN AN AWKWARD POSITION.
YOU'RE GOING TO LET HER ARREST.
I'LL TAKE IT FROM HERE.
HOW ABOUT A CHEMICAL CODE?
NO. THIS WOMAN IS NOT TO BE RESUSCITATED.
JUST AN AMP OF LIDOCAINE.
JOHN, SHE HAS NO CHANCE OF A MEANINGFUL RECOVERY.
SHE WANTED THIS.
HER FAMILY WANTS IT.
DON'T TOUCH HER.
Vanessa: TENGO MIEDO, PADRE.
Kovac: I KNOW.
ESTABA ENOJADA CON EL.

MARK, I...
HEY THERE.
HI.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.
WHAT'S WRONG?
I'VE BEEN THINKING.
AH... OH.
NO, LISTEN--
THAT DAY WHEN YOU PROPOSED TO ME
MOST OF ME JUST WANTED TO SCREAM YES
AND RUN TO THE COURTHOUSE AND DO IT RIGHT THEN.
MOST OF YOU.
BUT THE REST OF ME WAS SCARED.
I... I KNEW THAT I LOVED YOU
BUT I'D JUST BEEN WITH THIS LITTLE BABY
WHO NEEDED A MOTHER
AND I KNEW INSTANTLY THAT I WANTED TO BE THAT MOTHER.
I DIDN'T WANT TO SAY YES FOR THE WRONG REASON.
I SEE.
BUT THEY TOLD ME TODAY THAT I CAN'T HAVE HIM.
BABY, I'M SORRY.
NO, IT'S OKAY. IT'S OKAY.
BECAUSE I KNOW THAT I REALLY DO
WANT TO MARRY YOU.
I KNOW THAT NOW.
WHOA.
YOU STILL WANT TO MARRY ME?
( laughing ): YES.
OKAY.
ISN'T IT A SIN TO FAKE A SACRAMENT?
IT WAS A BLESSING.
ANYONE CAN GIVE A BLESSING.
NOT POSING AS A PRIEST.
IT WAS HER FAITH.
THAT'S WHAT'S IMPORTANT, RIGHT?
SO HOW DID YOU KNOW WHAT TO SAY?
I FAKED IT.
A LITTLE BIT OF LATIN, A LITTLE BIT OF CROATIAN.
YOU FAKED IT WELL.
OOH.
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
YEAH. YEAH.
IT'S JUST THEY'RE ACTIVE, MOVING AROUND DOWN THERE.
MAY I?
WHAT?
YOU KNOW.
DON'T YOU?
YES.
YOU SHOULD JUST LEAVE NOW.
ELAINE...
PETER...
PETER!
DID YOU HIRE A PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR?
WHAT?
SOME GUY TALKED TO DAFINA
AND ASKED HER IF I'VE EVER DONE DRUGS.
CARLA, THE ONLY PERSON I HIRED WAS MY LAWYER.
DID HE GET THIS GUY TO START ASKING QUESTIONS ABOUT ME?
NO!
I... I'VE...
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW.
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?
WHY AM I DOING THIS?
THE RESTRAINING ORDERS AND LAWYERS...
CARLA, I ONLY HAVE ONE SON.
ROGER CAN GET ANOTHER DAMN JOB.
THIS IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR US, PETER.
WHAT ABOUT REESE? EVER THINK ABOUT THAT?
YOU WANT TO TAKE HIM AWAY FROM HIS FATHER?
YOU MAY NOT EVEN BE HIS FATHER.
WHAT?!
HE MIGHT NOT BE YOURS.
THERE WAS SOMEBODY ELSE.
IT WAS JUST CASUAL.
AND THEN THERE WAS YOU.
I DID IT FOR REESE.
HE NEEDED A FATHER AND ROGER CAN BE THAT FOR HIM NOW...
REESE IS MY SON, CARLA!
REESE IS MY SON.
