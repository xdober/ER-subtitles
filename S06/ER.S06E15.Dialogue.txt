SO, IS HE STANDING ON THE FROZEN LAKE
OR WILL HE BE SITTING
IN ONE OF THOSE LITTLE HUTS?
IT BEATS ME.
WHAT KIND OF FISH DO THEY CATCH?
BEATS ME.
YO, MORNING.
Greene: I CAN'T BELIEVE HE RIDES THAT THING IN THE WINTER.
DAMN. MALUCCI. WHAT?
CASE CONFERENCE WITH ROMANO.
MALUCCI ADMITTED THE PATIENT
AND I'VE LEFT MY NOTES IN MY APARTMENT.
OH, THAT WILL TEACH YOU, SLEEPING AT MY PLACE.
YEAH. I'LL SEE YOU LATER.
OH.
YOU SHOULD GET A U-LOCK.
A PAIR OF BOLT CUTTERS
AND SOMEBODY'S GOING TO LEAVE YOU
WITH A BROKEN CHAIN AND NO RIDE.
THANKS, MOM.
TIRED OF SCOLDING ME FOR NOT WEARING A HELMET?
DR. DAVE, I'D NEVER WANT TO GET BETWEEN YOU
AND YOUR PERSONAL PATH TO BRAIN DEATH.
ABDOMINAL PAIN, POSSIBLE ISCHEMIC BOWEL
JUST WENT TO C.T.
AND NEEDS A SURGICAL CONSULTANT.
GOT THOSE X RAYS BACK FROM MR. WYATT.
GOOD. MARK, COULD YOU FINISH UP WITH LUKA, PLEASE?
SURE. WHAT'S LEFT?
EXAM TWO, MR. KECHEVSKY.
RULE-OUT M.I.
AND IF SOMEBODY COULD CALL ME WITH THE ENZYME RESULTS
I WOULD LIKE THE FOLLOW-UP.
ABBY, CAN YOU HANDLE THAT?
OF COURSE.
OKAY. SO, THAT'S IT?
YEP. ALL RIGHT.
( phone rings )
E.R.
YEAH. HANG ON A SECOND.
ABBY, IT'S FOR YOU.
IT'S MY JOB TO ANSWER THE PHONES.
JUST TRYING TO HELP.
AND I APPRECIATE IT.
ABBY LOCKHART.
YES, I DID CALL, THREE DAYS AGO.
LOOK, WHATEVER, I JUST--
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THE LATE PAYMENTS.
WHAT?
WELL, YOU'LL JUST HAVE TO SELL THEM.
LOOK, I REALLY DON'T CARE HOW YOU DO IT.
JUST MAKE THE PAYMENTS, I...
JUST MAKE THE PAYMENTS.
BYE.
( sighs )
THAT WAS MY SOON-TO-BE EX-HUSBAND.
SOUNDS BAD.
YEAH, HE'S TAKING A FLYER ON SOME TEXT STOCKS
WITH MY LOAN MONEY.
OW. WELL, MAYBE THEY'LL GO UP.
I'LL NEVER SEE THE CASH.
OKAY, I'M LEAVING BEFORE I FALL OVER.
TILL NEXT TIME, LADIES.
BYE.
MEN.
ELIZABETH?
MORNING. I FORGOT SOME NOTES FOR A MEETING.
YOU LOOK TIRED.
WERE YOU WATCHING CHARLIE ROSE AGAIN?
NOT EXACTLY.
UH... MORNING, ELIZABETH.
DAVID CAME OVER FOR BREAKFAST.
IN BOXERS AND SLIPPERS?
MY SLIPPERS.
UM... HOPE YOU DON'T MIND.
I THOUGHT YOU WERE ICE FISHING.
WELL...
DIDN'T MAKE IT.
I CAN SEE THAT.
( laughing )
GOOD-BYE, ELIZABETH.
SEE YOU.
CAN I FRESHEN YOUR CUP?
GOOD LORD, MOTHER
I PRACTICALLY DRANK THE WHOLE POT
WHILE THE TWO OF YOU WERE SAYING GOOD-BYE.
( chuckles )
SO, ARE YOU AMUSED?
BEMUSED?
IRRITATED? SHOCKED? CHAGRINED?
THAT'S A START.
I SUPPOSE YOU THINK AT MY AGE, I SHOULDN'T...
MOTHER. MOTHER, PLEASE.
DO YOU REALLY THINK WHAT THE TWO OF YOU ARE DOING
IS A GOOD IDEA?
I'M A LITTLE OLDER, BUT I'M NOT DEAD.
HIS WIFE IS-- RECENTLY.
THEN BLOODY WELL GOOD FOR HIM FOR GETTING ON...
MOTHER!
IS IT SO DIFFICULT TO IMAGINE
THAT TWO PEOPLE COULD BE ATTRACTED TO EACH OTHER
AND ACTUALLY ACT ON IT?
WERE YOU USING, YOU KNOW, PROTECTION?
THERE ARE DISEASES.
YOU THINK HE'S DISEASED?
THAT'S NOT THE POINT.
AND YOU REALLY WANT TO DISCUSS THIS?
NO. NO!
NO.
HE'S MY BOYFRIEND'S FATHER.
OH...
YOU ALWAYS CARED TOO MUCH
ABOUT WHAT OTHER PEOPLE THINK, EVEN AS A LITTLE GIRL.
I DID NOT.
YES, YOU DID.
WELL, HOW WOULD YOU KNOW?
DID THE NANNY TELL YOU?
YES, ELIZABETH, YOU WERE SO NEGLECTED.
DON'T PRETEND TO KNOW ME WHEN YOU DON'T.
I KNOW YOU A LOT BETTER THAN YOU THINK.
I'M JUST TRYING TO SAY
THIS COULD GET VERY COMPLICATED.
WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS SO AFRAID RELATIONSHIPS WILL GO WRONG?
WELL, PERHAPS BECAUSE OURS HASN'T EXACTLY GONE RIGHT.
I HAVE TO GET TO WORK.
HEY, NO FAIR DOING PAPERWORK
WHEN THERE ARE PATIENTS TO SEE.
I'M NOT EVEN ON YET, DAVE.
OH, I GET IT.
JUST MAKING THE REST OF US LOOK BAD?
I'M DOING CHART REVIEWS FOR CARTER AND LUCY'S PATIENTS.
SORRY. NEED MY HELP?
I'VE GOT IT.
HEY, ABBY, I GOT A COUPLE OF CASES FOR YOU.
FOREIGN BODY UP THE NOSE AND HEMORRHOIDS.
BE RIGHT THERE.
UM, AND THE C.P.K. WAS NORMAL.
GOOD. GOOD. DISCHARGE HIM, ABBY.
YEAH, HE SHOULD FOLLOW UP WITH CARDIOLOGY.
NO, I HAVE THE NIGHT SHIFT ALL WEEK... YEAH.
YEAH, I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW.
OKAY. BYE-BYE.
LAURA!
HEY, STOP! STOP!
( whimpering )
IT HURTS!
I KNOW IT HURTS.
I'M A DOCTOR AND I'M GOING TO HELP YOU, ALL RIGHT?
OKAY. LOOK AT ME, PLEASE.
TRY TO BREATHE, SLOW AND EASY, OKAY?
NOW, TELL ME YOUR NAME AND WHERE IT HURTS, HUH?
( yells )
LAURA. MY LEG...
OKAY, TRY TO KEEP YOUR HEAD STILL.
I DIDN'T THINK THAT YOU REMOVED NOSE PIERCINGS.
I GOT A NEW STUD.
I THOUGHT I'D PUT IT IN THE OLD HOLE.
OKAY, JUST INJECT 2cc's OF AIR INTO THE FOLEY
AND PULL IT BACK GENTLY.
( small tinkle )
( sneezes )
BLESS YOU.
HEY, THANKS.
YOU'RE WELCOME.
CAN I GO NOW?
IN A MINUTE.
UM, HEMORRHOIDS NEXT?
DO THE INITIAL WORK-UP, THEN FIND ME OR MARK.
OKAY.
HI.
YOU'RE NOT PLANNING TO USE THAT ON ME?
WE'LL SEE.
I'M ABBY.
RON PERTH.
LISTEN, I FEEL KIND OF STUPID COMING IN.
I MEAN, I DIDN'T EXPECT TO FEEL GREAT
BUT I'M CONCERNED.
I'M STILL BLEEDING
FROM THE, YOU KNOW, HEMORRHOIDS.
UH, WHAT, THEY WERE BANDED JUST LAST WEEK?
YEAH.
YOU LOOK KIND OF PALE.
HOW MUCH BLEEDING?
IT'S NOT THAT MUCH.
LISTEN, I'M SUPPOSED TO FLY BACK TO DENVER AT 5:00.
IT'S MY GIRLFRIEND'S BIRTHDAY.
I WAS HOPING THAT YOU COULD
GIVE ME A CREAM OR SOMETHING TO SHRINK IT DOWN.
SORRY.
I WAS PLANNING TO TAKE HER DANCING.
YOU MIGHT WANT TO MAKE IT A CANDLELIT DINNER.
YOU NEED A HAND?
YEAH. COULD YOU ORDER A C.B.C., CHEM SEVEN AND COAGS
AND PREP FOR ANOSCOPY.
MM-HMM.
IS THAT WHAT I THINK IT IS?
I'LL BE GENTLE.
OH, MAN.
WHERE'S MY MOM?! SOMEBODY GET MY MOM!
SHE'LL BE HERE, LAURA.
YOUR SISTER WENT TO GET HER.
LAURA, I NEED
TO CUT OPEN YOUR PANTS
SO I CAN LOOK AT YOUR LEG, OKAY?
OH, MY GOD! IS SHE OKAY?!
IT'S OKAY. I'M DR. KOVAC.
I ALREADY CALLED 911.
LAURA...
HEY, BE CAREFUL.
HER LEFT LEG IS BROKEN, AND MAYBE A RIB, TOO.
MOM, IT HURTS!
I KNOW, BABY, IT'S OKAY.
CAN'T YOU DO SOMETHING?
CAN YOU GO TELL THAT LADY
WE NEED HER BROOM.
I'LL GET IT.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
I'M GOING TO SPLINT HER LEG.
I NEED TO CHECK TO SEE IF THERE IS ANY DAMAGE TO THE ARTERY.
WE...
WE HEARD YOU CAN'T TELL ANYBODY ANYTHING WE SAY TO YOU.
WELL, THAT DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU TELL ME.
IT'S, UH...
IT'S ABOUT...
SEX?
WELL, IF THERE'S NO ABUSE INVOLVED
AND THE GUYS ARE UNDER 18
THEN EVERYTHING YOU TELL ME HAS TO REMAIN CONFIDENTIAL.
SO YOU COULDN'T TELL OUR PARENTS?
NO, I COULDN'T. YOU PROMISE?
GO AHEAD. WHAT IS IT?
LOOK, I CAN'T HELP YOU
IF YOU DON'T TELL ME WHAT IT IS.
WELL, UM, WE'RE AFRAID WE MIGHT'VE CAUGHT SOMETHING.
WELL, WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU MIGHT'VE CAUGHT?
WE HEARD SOME SYPHILIS WAS GOING AROUND SCHOOL.
I SEE.
WHY DON'T YOU GIRLS COME WITH ME, OKAY?
OKAY.
MY CHEST HURTS! WHAT IS IT?
I'M WORRIED SHE'S BLEEDING INTERNALLY.
OH, NO. DO SOMETHING.
I MEAN, WHERE'S THE AMBULANCE?
IT'LL BE HERE.
NO, LET'S JUST, LET'S DRIVE HER.
SIR?!
YOU, THE PLUMBER!
YEAH.
I'M DR. KOVAC, I NEED YOUR HELP.
CAN YOU MAKE ROOM FOR THIS GIRL?
YOU WANT TO PUT HER IN THE VAN?
YEAH. SHE NEEDS TO GET TO THE HOSPITAL RIGHT NOW.
IT'S URGENT.
OKAY, LET'S GO. OKAY, THANKS.
IN HIS UNDERWEAR? MY FATHER?
I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT, EITHER.
WHAT DID YOU SAY?
WHAT COULD I SAY?
I TRIED TO TALK TO HER ABOUT IT AFTER HE LEFT
BUT IT JUST TURNED INTO AN ARGUMENT.
I DIDN'T FIND IT THAT AMUSING.
WELL, IT BEATS ICE FISHING.
WELL, DON'T YOU FIND IT A LITTLE BIZARRE?
WELL, THEY'RE ADULTS. THAT'S NOT SUCH A BAD THING.
SO WHAT, THEY'RE GOING TO KEEP ON DOING IT?
WHERE, YOUR PLACE OR MINE?
HE'S COMING IN TO SEE THE PULMONOLOGIST THIS AFTERNOON.
I'LL TALK TO HIM, OKAY?
YEAH, THANKS.
( Laura moaning )
I CAN'T BREATHE. OKAY, HANG ON.
HER BROKEN RIB COULD'VE PUNCTURED THE LUNG.
LOOK TO THE RIGHT, LAURA.
NOW TO THE LEFT.
LAURA? LAURA?
OH, MY GOD!
NO BREATH SOUNDS. WHAT'S HAPPENING?!
SHE HAS A TENSION PNEUMOTHORAX.
AN AIR LEAK HAS COLLAPSED HER LUNG
AND THE PRESSURE IS KEEPING HER HEART
FROM BEATING.
I HAVE TO PUT THIS NEEDLE IN HER CHEST
TO RELIEVE THE PRESSURE.
OH...
OH, MY GOD! DAMN IT!
WAIT, WHY IS SHE BLEEDING?!
I MIGHT'VE NICKED AN ARTERY WHEN WE HIT THAT BUMP.
AN ARTERY?
HERE, KEEP PRESSURE WHERE THE BLOOD'S COMING OUT.
OH, GOD.
IS SOMETHING WRONG BACK THERE?
THESE PADS ARE SOAKED.
JUST KEEP PRESSING THEM, OKAY.
COME ON, DAMN IT.
YEAH, THIS IS KOVAC.
YEAH, I'M COMING IN WITH A MAJOR TRAUMA.
CLEAR A ROOM, AND GET FOUR UNITS OF O-NEG.
YEAH.
GO FASTER!
WE NEED TO BE THERE NOW!
AUTOMOBILE VERSUS TEN-YEAR-OLD GIRL.
BLUNT TRAUMA TO THE RIGHT LOWER CHEST
AND FRACTURED LEFT FEMUR.
HANG ON, HONEY!
WE NEED TO SET UP FOR A CHEST TUBE RIGHT AWAY.
YOU NEED ANY MORE HELP?
Kovac: NO. GOT IT, THANK YOU.
SHE WAS STABLE, BUT THEN I LOST HER PULSE
WITH DECREASED BREATH SOUNDS ON THE RIGHT.
SOME IMPROVEMENT WITH NEEDLE THORACOSTOMY
BUT I MAY HAVE NICKED HER INTERCOSTAL.
WHAT HAPPENED?
THE VAN HIT A BUMP WHEN THE NEEDLE WAS INSIDE.
WHY DIDN'T YOU WAIT FOR THE PARAMEDICS?
I WAITED SEVEN MINUTES, BUT I THOUGHT I MIGHT LOSE HER
IF I DIDN'T GET HERE RIGHT AWAY.
Greene: THE PARAMEDICS CALLED IN.
THEY ARRIVED TWO MINUTES AFTER YOU LEFT.
I'M SORRY, MA'AM. YOU'LL HAVE TO WAIT OUTSIDE.
GET A TRAUMA PANEL, U.A., TYPE AND CROSS FOR FOUR.
TWO LARGE-BORE I.V.s, SQUEEZE IN A SALINE.
PREP THE CHEST.
B.P.'s 80 PALP, PULSE 110.
I WANT MY MOM! WHERE'S MY MOM?
SHE'S JUST OUTSIDE. HOW ARE YOU DOING?
MOM!
WE'LL GIVE YOU SOMETHING FOR THE PAIN, HUH?
ONE PERCENT LIDOCAINE.
TEN BLADE.
I NEED ULTRASOUND.
28 FRENCH, LET'S MOVE.
Greene: LUKA, YOU'VE BEEN OFF FOR AN HOUR.
WE GOT IT FROM HERE.
I'LL STAY.
GET X RAY UP HERE FOR A PORTABLE CHEST.
PULSE OX 92 ON TEN LITERS.
WE NEED TO INTUBATE. 6h...
Benton: I'M IN. HOOK ME UP.
WHOA. CHESTFUL OF BLOOD.
PRESSURE IS DOWN TO 70.
LOOKS LIKE HE DID HIT THE ARTERY.
Greene: LYDIA, CALL THE O.R. HAVE THEM HOLD A ROOM.
IT LOOKS LIKE IT WAS MORE THAN A NICK.
WE GOT MORE THAN A LITER OUT.
PRESSURE'S DOWN TO 50.
LAURA... LAURA...
SHE'S UNRESPONSIVE.
CHEST TUBE OUTPUT IS 1200cc's.
ALL RIGHT, LET'S PREP FOR A RIGHT-SIDED THORACOTOMY.
NOT MUCH LONGER NOW, ANDREA.
IS TERRI OKAY?
SHE'S FINE. SHE'S SITTING OVER IN CHAIRS.
THERE'S CERVICAL BLEEDING
AND THICK AND WHITE DYSPLASIA
WITH PAPULES.
IS THAT SYPHILIS-- DYSPLASIA?
THERE'S NO SIGN OF SYPHILIS
BUT WE HAVE TO WAIT FOR THE BLOOD TEST TO BE SURE.
YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND GET DRESSED.
SO I CAN GO?
NO. YOUR HIV TEST WON'T TAKE LONG.
I'D LIKE YOU TO WAIT.
WELL, AM I ALL RIGHT?
LET'S WAIT AND SEE WHAT THE TEST SAYS.
Weaver: THE OTHER GIRL LOOKS OKAY
BUT GET PATHOLOGY TO DO A STAT PAP SMEAR ON THIS ONE.
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GET YOU DRESSED.
WELL, MR. PERTH...
RON, PLEASE.
RON. YOUR BLOOD COUNT'S NORMAL.
THAT'S GOOD, RIGHT?
RIGHT. UH, ALTHOUGH SOMETIMES IT TAKES A WHILE
FOR A CRIT TO SHOW A BLOOD LOSS.
YEAH, BUT I FEEL OKAY.
YEAH, BUT I'D HATE TO HAVE YOU ON THAT PLANE
AND START TO BLEED OUT AT 35,000 FEET.
YOU WANT TO DO ANOTHER TEST.
YEAH.
I'M GOING TO DRAW SOME BLOOD
WHICH IS THEN TAGGED WITH A RADIONUCLEOTIDE
WHICH I THEN RE-INJECT BY I.V.
AND THEN A SCAN LETS ME TRACE FOR BLEEDING.
YEAH, OKAY, AS LONG AS I WON'T GLOW IN THE DARK.
NAH. QUICK AND PAINLESS, I PROMISE.
SO, HONESTLY, IS IT REALLY THE THOUGHT THAT COUNTS?
UH, ABOUT WHAT?
OH, UH, FOR MY GIRLFRIEND'S BIRTHDAY.
I WAS THINKING OF JEWELRY.
BUT IF I GO THERE, I'VE GOT TO GO BIG, RIGHT?
I DON'T KNOW.
THE BEST PRESENT MY HUSBAND EVER GAVE ME
WAS A SURPRISE PICNIC THAT HE PACKED HIMSELF.
AH, ROMANTIC.
OR CHEAP.
( chuckling )
HELLO.
HI.
UH, DR. WEAVER, MR. PERTH.
HOW'S HE DOING?
RULE-OUT G.I. BLEED.
I'M DRAWING SOME BLOOD FOR A NUCLEAR MEDICINE SCAN.
WELL, WE DON'T DO THIS VERY OFTEN DOWN HERE.
C.B.C. AND LYTES COME BACK?
YEAH. THEY WERE NORMAL.
ABBY, CAN I TALK TO YOU FOR A MINUTE?
SURE.
OKAY, THE BELLY'S BENIGN, THERE'S NO EVIDENCE OF A BLEED
SO WHY ORDER SUCH AN EXPENSIVE TEST?
HE JUST DOESN'T LOOK WELL TO ME.
HIS SKIN IS PALE, HIS EYES ARE DULL...
YEAH, THAT'S HARDLY DIAGNOSTIC OF A BLEED.
I REALLY DON'T THINK THIS SCAN IS NECESSARY.
YOU SHOULD DISCHARGE HIM.
IS THERE A PROBLEM?
NO.
I JUST HAVE TO... GET THIS TO THE LAB.
MORE SUCTION. GOT IT.
ARE YOU GOING TO STICK TIE THE BLEEDER?
NO, TOO CLOSE TO THE BONE.
LET ME GET O-SILK ON A KEITH NEEDLE.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
KENNEDY MANEUVER.
TRANSMURAL HEMOSTATIC SUTURE.
HANG ANOTHER. Marquez: SECOND UNIT'S IN.
AUTOTRANSFUSE FROM THE CELL SAVER.
OKAY, TAKE THE SUPERIOR AND THE INFERIOR
AND TIE THEM TIGHT ON THE OUTSIDE.
DRY AS A BONE. NICE.
Takata: NEW SEIZURE IN TWO.
ALL RIGHT, I SHOULD GET THIS.
YOU OKAY, PETER? MM-HMM.
CHECK THE B.P.
ANOTHER CRIT?
YEAH. FINE.
LUKA, LET'S GO TALK TO THE MOTHER.
ALL RIGHT.
Marquez: PRESSURE'S CRASHING!
BUT THE CHEST IS DRY.
ULTRASOUND. CHECK THE BELLY AGAIN.
SHE DROPPED HER PRESSURE.
SHE MUST STILL BE BLEEDING.
YOU'RE RIGHT-- HER BELLY'S
FULL OF BLOOD. IT'S THE LIVER.
SHE BLEW THE CAPSULE.
WE SHOULD'VE CHECKED THE BELLY.
HANG TWO UNITS! LET'S GET HER UP TO THE O.R.!
LET'S MOVE NOW!
WHAT IS IT?
WE'RE TAKING HER TO SURGERY.
THIS IS HER MOTHER.
Benton: COME WITH US. COME ON.
DR. KOVAC, YOU'VE DONE ENOUGH.
WHY DON'T YOU LET US TAKE IT FROM HERE?
I WANT TO STAY WITH HER. SHE'S MY PATIENT.
NO, NO, NO. NOT ANYMORE.
WHY DON'T YOU GO HOME, GET SOME SLEEP?
YOU THINK I'M GOING TO SLEEP?
LUKA!
THAT'S HILARIOUS. OH, MY GOD!
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT. THAT'S GREAT.
OH, WAIT, WE GOT TO GO. BYE.
SORRY. WE WERE JUST TALKING TO SOME FRIENDS.
TERRI, I NEED TO TALK TO ANDREA PRIVATELY.
IS SHE ALL RIGHT?
UH, COULD YOU JUST GO WAIT IN CHAIRS, PLEASE?
HEY, IT'S OKAY.
THANKS.
ANDREA, WE GOT YOUR TEST RESULTS.
THEY FOUND SOME ABNORMAL CELLS IN YOUR PAP SMEAR.
YOU MIGHT HAVE CERVICAL CANCER.
WE NEED TO DO A BIOPSY, JUST TO MAKE SURE.
CANCER?
WAS IT CAUSED BY HAVING SEX?
WELL, YOU GET IT FROM AN INFECTED PARTNER.
IT'S CALLED H.P.V.--
HUMAN PAPILLOMA VIRUS.
BUT NOT EVERYBODY WITH H.P.V....
NO, YOU CAN'T TELL MY PARENTS.
ANDREA, IF YOU HAVE THIS
YOU NEED TO BE ADMITTED TO THE HOSPITAL.
ANYWAY, THEY'RE IN EUROPE
AND YOU SAID EVERYTHING I TOLD YOU WAS CONFIDENTIAL.
IF YOU'RE NOT TREATED, YOU COULD GET VERY SICK.
WE ALSO HAVE TO INFORM YOUR PARTNER.
ANDREA.
I DON'T KNOW WHO IT IS.
I MEAN WHICH ONE.
WELL, HOW MANY HAVE YOU HAD?
I'M NOT SURE.
WE... WE HAVE THESE PARTIES...
PETER, I WANT TO SCRUB IN.
WHY NOT? NO.
YOU'RE NOT A SURGEON.
I'M NOT ASKING TO OPERATE.
I'LL FIND YOU WHEN I'M FINISHED.
OKAY, CHUNY, I GOT IT FROM HERE.
SHE'LL BE ALL RIGHT.
COMING BACK DOWN TO THE E.R.?
IN A MINUTE.
COME WITH ME.
I'LL SHOW YOU WHERE YOU CAN WAIT.
THEN THERE WAS MRS. SALTZMAN IN FOR SHOULDER PAIN
AND YOU SENT HER FOR AN M.R.I.
AND YOU WERE RIGHT-- C56 HERNIATED DISC.
AND, UH, MR. BLANDELEAU, CHEST PAIN.
RULED-IN FOR AN M.I., HAD ANGIOPLASTY
AND, UH, HE'S DOING OKAY.
THAT'S IT.
THANKS.
NO PROBLEM.
ARE YOU DOING LUCY'S CASES, TOO?
TOLD WEAVER I DIDN'T MIND.
HOW WAS THE MEMORIAL SERVICE?
OKAY.
IT WAS NICE...
AND A LITTLE WEIRD.
HOW'S EVERYTHING ELSE DOWNSTAIRS?
( sighing ): HEY, SAME OLD THING.
HOW ARE YOU DOING?
I'M DOING FINE.
I KNOW EVERYBODY WHO WORKS HERE.
PEOPLE DROP BY ALL DAY.
( chuckling ): I BET.
EVEN MY GRANDMOTHER CAME BY.
I THOUGHT YOU DIDN'T TALK TO HER ANYMORE.
THERE'S NOTHING LIKE A NEAR-FATAL STAB WOUND
TO PUT A DIFFERENT SPIN ON THINGS.
HEY, I'M GOING TO BE BACK TO WORK IN A COUPLE WEEKS,
GET RID OF THIS BAG.
MAYBE TAKE UP SKYDIVING.
HMM, YOU DO THAT.
( both chuckling )
GET OUT OF HERE.
I NEED MY REST.
ALL RIGHT, UM...
YOU NEED HELP BACK ON THE BED?
NO, I'M GOOD. WELL...
CATCH YOU TOMORROW.
YEP.
OH, UH, JOHN, UH...
ARE YOU OKAY?
YEAH, FINE.
LISTEN, TAKE IT EASY, OKAY?
YEAH, THANKS, DEB.
DAD.
YOU'RE LATE.
THREE MINUTES. APPOINTMENT WAS 11:45.
WELL, I DIDN'T KNOW
HOW LONG IT WOULD TAKE YOU TO DRIVE BACK
AND I WAS WORRIED YOU MIGHT HAVE FALLEN THROUGH THE ICE.
YEAH, VERY FUNNY, MARK.
LIKE YOU DON'T KNOW.
JUST HAVING A LITTLE FUN...
WHICH IS APPARENTLY WHAT YOU WERE DOING.
( chuckling )
I DON'T THINK ELIZABETH WAS TOO AMUSED.
I'D SAY THAT'S PRETTY ACCURATE.
I SUPPOSE IT'S WRONG BEING IN HER PLACE AND ALL.
AW, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
WE'LL GO TO A HOTEL TONIGHT.
WHAT?!
IT'LL BE EASIER FOR EVERYONE.
SO IT'S KIND OF AN ONGOING THING.
WHAT DO YOU THINK--
THIS IS A ONE-NIGHT STAND?
I DON'T KNOW.
WHAT FLOOR IS THIS PULMONOLOGIST ON?
FIFTH FLOOR.
I LIKE HER, MARK.
SHE MAKES ME HAPPY.
NOW, I'M SORRY IF THAT MAKES YOU UNHAPPY...
I DIDN'T SAY THAT, DAD.
BUT SHE'LL BE BACK IN LONDON IN A COUPLE OF WEEKS
AND I'LL BE BACK ON YOUR SOFA BED.
THEN WE CAN BOTH BE UNHAPPY.
HOW MANY HAS SHE SLEPT WITH?
I DON'T KNOW.
BOTH GIRLS HAVE BEEN GOING TO SEX PARTIES.
OH, MY GOD. AT THEIR AGE?
I PROMISED I WOULDN'T TELL HER FOLKS
AND LEGALLY I CAN'T.
W-W-WAIT. SHE'S A MINOR AND SHE NEEDS SURGERY.
WELL, MAYBE I CAN TALK HER INTO LETTING ME TELL HER PARENTS.
CAROL, I UNDERSTAND YOU DON'T WANT TO BREAK CONFIDENTIALITY
BUT THIS IS A PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUE NOW.
AT LEAST ONE OF THOSE BOYS IS SPREADING H.P.V.
AND THE GIRLS AT THOSE PARTIES
ALL NEED TO HAVE PELVIC EXAMS AND PAP SMEARS.
SO WHATEVER SHE SAYS
YOU ALSO NEED TO CALL THE SCHOOL.
HEY, MALIK, HAVE YOU SEEN A GIRL IN A SCHOOL UNIFORM?
I SAW TWO OF THEM.
THEY WENT OUT THAT DOOR.
DAMN IT!
EXCUSE ME?
UH... YEAH.
MY NAME IS BARBARA KNIGHT.
I'M LOOKING FOR DR. GREENE.
UH, HE WAS HERE JUST A MINUTE AGO.
OR MAYBE DR. WEAVER?
AND SHE WAS HERE A MINUTE AGO, TOO
BUT IT LOOKS LIKE RIGHT NOW, I'M ALL YOU GOT.
ACTUALLY, I JUST NEED TO FIND YOUR LOUNGE AREA.
CAN I HELP YOU?
WE DON'T USUALLY LET PEOPLE WAIT IN THE LOUNGE AREA.
NO. NO, I JUST NEED TO CHECK MY DAUGHTER'S LOCKER.
UM, UH, SORRY. YOUR NAME...?
BARBARA KNIGHT.
I'M LUCY'S MOTHER.
I DON'T HAVE THE COMBINATION.
OH, IT'S OKAY.
THE MED SCHOOL GAVE IT TO ME.
AH, GOOD.
UH-OH.
LET ME JUST...
THANK YOU.
I'VE CHECKED
INTO THE RITZ-CARLTON
SO I WON'T BE NEEDING THAT.
MOTHER, THIS IS COMPLETELY UNNECESSARY.
THEY HAVE A LOVELY VIEW OF THE LAKE.
IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME, I HAVE A MEETING.
OH, STOP IT.
JUST BEING PRACTICAL, DEAR.
AT OUR AGES, THERE'S NO REASON
FOR MOTHERS AND DAUGHTERS TO BE LIVING TOGETHER.
YOU SAY THAT
AS IF WE EVER REALLY LIVED TOGETHER.
I LOVE YOU, ELIZABETH
BUT I SWEAR, AT TIMES, YOU CAN BE INSUFFERABLE.
ME?
I CAN BE INSUFFERABLE?
WHAT EXACTLY DO YOU BLAME ME FOR?
I DON'T BLAME YOU FOR ANYTHING.
THEN STOP ACTING AS IF YOU DO.
SO I WASN'T THE CONVENTIONAL MOTHER.
HOW MUCH TIME DID YOUR FATHER OFFER YOU?
THIS ISN'T ABOUT DAD.
NO. IT'S ABOUT WHAT I COULDN'T PROVIDE.
FATHERS ARE RARELY BLAMED
FOR WORKING TOO MUCH
WHEREAS MOTHERS ARE BLAMED
IF THEY CHOOSE TO WORK AT ALL.
SHOULD YOU GET MARRIED SOMETIME AND HAVE A CHILD
WILL YOU GIVE UP YOUR WORK?
I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.
THEN I'M SORRY I SET YOU SUCH A TERRIBLE EXAMPLE.
( footsteps descending )
TECHNICIUM? YEAH?
DIDN'T SHOW ANY SIGNS OF BLEEDING, DID IT?
NO.
AND WHY DID YOU ORDER A SCAN
THAT I SAID WAS UNNECESSARY?
IT'S JUST A FEELING THAT I HAVE.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS.
MAYBE IT'S A NURSING INSTINCT OR SOMETHING
BUT THE GUY DOES NOT LOOK WELL.
IT'S THE MIDDLE OF WINTER.
NOBODY LOOKS WELL.
MEDICAL STUDENTS DON'T ORDER TESTS
WHEN THEY'RE TOLD NOT TO.
IT'S A WASTE OF YOUR TIME AND HIS MONEY.
CUT HIM LOOSE.
ABBY, IF BENTON CALLS DOWN
CAN YOU GET ME?
I'M GOING ACROSS THE STREET
TO GRAB SOMETHING TO EAT, OKAY?
I THOUGHT YOU WEREN'T ON.
NO, I-I'M... I'M NOT.
ABBY, CALL THE POLICE.
WHAT?
HEY, HOLD ON, MAN.
I'M NOT DONE YET.
CALL THEM NOW!
GET OUT OF MY WAY!
YOU'RE NOT LEAVING!
LEAVE ME ALONE!
WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU?!
GET OFF OF ME!
YOU JUST LEFT HER THERE.
YOU HIT HER AND THEN LEFT.
MALIK, CALL SECURITY.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT!
I SAW YOU, AND I CAN IDENTIFY YOU.
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.
AND YOU JUST DROVE OFF, HIT AND RUN?
I WAS SCARED, OKAY?
SO WAS THAT LITTLE GIRL!
I PANICKED, ALL RIGHT?
I HAD A COUPLE OF D.U.I.s
BUT I WASN'T DRINKING TODAY, OKAY?
IT ALL HAPPENED SO FAST, I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.
BUT YOU KNEW ENOUGH TO RUN AWAY, HUH?
DID YOU... DID YOU BRING HER HERE?
IS SHE ALL RIGHT?
YOU DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT TO ASK.
I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE I WAS JUST BEING A HYPOCHONDRIAC
THINKING SOMETHING WAS WRONG.
NO, YOU WERE RIGHT TO COME IN
AND YOU'D BE RIGHT TO COME BACK.
WELL, THANKS.
I'LL KEEP AN EYE ON IT.
I MEAN, SAY, FOR EXAMPLE
IN 15 OR 20 MINUTES
IF YOU'RE FEELING FEVERISH
OR SICK TO YOUR STOMACH
YOU MIGHT WANT TO GET THAT CHECKED OUT.
YEAH, BUT YOU JUST SAW ME.
WELL, IT MIGHT NOT BE ME WHO SEES YOU
BUT SOMEBODY WOULD HAVE TO SEE YOU
AND I'M SURE THEY'D WANT
TO EXAMINE YOU THOROUGHLY.
ARE YOU SAYING I'M NOT OKAY?
I'M JUST SAYING THAT
IT'S BEEN AN AWFULLY BAD FLU SEASON.
YOU WANT TO TAKE A BREAK?
NO, I'M OKAY.
THAT'S ENOUGH FOR TODAY.
JUST HANG ON A SECOND.
YOU DID GREAT. I'LL GET THE CHAIR.
I SAID I CAN DO IT!
I JUST WANT TO GET BACK TO MY ROOM.
DR. CARTER?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
YOU NARKED US OUT. ANDREA, I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.
GET AWAY! YOU PROMISED, YOU BITCH!
YOU NEED TO COME BACK IN.
YOU SAID THERE WERE RULES
AND THAT YOU COULDN'T BREAK THEM.
I KNOW WHAT I SAID, BUT I CAN'T.
YOU LIED TO ME. TO BOTH OF US.
LOOK, IT IS A LOT MORE
COMPLICATED THAN THAT.
YOUR HEALTH IS IN DANGER
AND OTHER GIRLS COULD GET INFECTED, TOO.
NOW EVERYONE'S GOING TO KNOW EVERYTHING.
ANDREA? ANDREA!
SO, UH, WE'LL HAVE TO RESCHEDULE
THE BOWEL RESECTION FOR 4:30.
YEP.
HELLO.
SORRY. DIDN'T MEAN TO SURPRISE YOU...
CERTAINLY NOT TWICE IN ONE DAY.
YOU'RE HERE FOR YOUR APPOINTMENT.
UH, I THINK IT'S ON THE FIFTH FLOOR.
I'VE ALREADY BEEN.
I GOT POKED AND PRODDED AND X-RAYED OUT THE WAZOO.
DAMN DOCTORS.
NO OFFENSE. NONE TAKEN.
AND I'M SORRY IF MY PRESENCE OFFENDED YOU THIS MORNING.
OH... I WAS JUST, UH...
WELL, YOU SAID IT.
SURPRISED.
I DIDN'T MEAN TO MAKE TROUBLE BETWEEN YOU AND YOUR MOTHER.
OH, NO, NONE THAT WASN'T THERE ALREADY.
AND WHY IS THAT?
I MEAN, WHY IS THERE TROUBLE?
MOTHERS AND DAUGHTERS, I SUPPOSE.
OH, WELL, YOU DON'T GET TO OWN THE WHOLE RANCH ON THAT ONE.
LET'S SAVE A LITTLE CORNER FOR FATHERS AND SONS.
( laughs )
ALTHOUGH I WILL ADMIT
MOTHERS AND DAUGHTERS ARE WORSE.
BUT THAT'S JUST A WOMAN THING.
YOU KNOW, THE ONLY PROBLEM WITH CHILDREN IS
THEY GROW UP TO BE ADULTS.
YES, WE DO EVENTUALLY HAVE OPINIONS OF OUR OWN.
I KNOW, BUT DO YOU HAVE TO EXPRESS THEM?
IT'S A LEARNED RESPONSE.
I'LL GIVE YOU THAT.
I SUGGEST THAT THE FOUR OF US GO OUT TONIGHT.
YOU KNOW, SORT OF... BURY THE HATCHET.
MARK THINKS IT'S A GREAT IDEA.
HE DOESN'T.
HE WILL.
( laughing )
ABBY DIDN'T DISCHARGE HIM? SHE DID, BUT HE BOUNCED BACK
WITH COMPLAINT OF FEVER AND ABDOMINAL PAIN.
B.P.'s FALLING, 80/60.
HANG A UNIT ON THE RAPID INFUSER.
Weaver: WHAT HAPPENED? G.I. BLEED.
I BEGAN A RECTAL, HE STARTED GUSHING.
PROBABLY A BLEEDING TIC.
TYPE AND CROSS FOUR UNITS
AND CALL THE O.R.
YEP, I ALREADY DID.
I'M IN.
'KAY, HOOK HIM UP.
THANK GOD HE CAME BACK IN.
CHICAGO WASN'T EVEN HER FIRST CHOICE.
SHE WAS HOPING FOR SOMETHING IN SAN FRANCISCO.
IT TOOK HER WHEN SHE WAS ABOUT EIGHT.
ONE RIDE ON A CABLE CAR AND IT WAS HER CITY
ALTHOUGH SHE GREW TO LOVE THIS ONE.
YOU DON'T NEED TO HEAR ALL THIS.
NO, IT'S FINE.
I REALLY JUST WANTED TO STOP BY AND THANK YOU.
LUCY ALWAYS TALKED ABOUT YOU WHEN SHE CALLED--
ABOUT HOW SHE WAS FIRST ASSIGNED TO YOU AND EVERYTHING.
SHE HAD A LOT OF RESPECT FOR YOU
AND I KNOW THAT YOU MUST HAVE TAUGHT HER A LOT.
( clears throat )
WELL, SHE WORKED WITH ALL THE RESIDENTS, NOT JUST ME.
I KNOW, BUT YOU'RE THE ONE SHE USED TO MENTION.
BUT SHE... SHE LOVED HER WORK.
SH... SHE WAS BETTER THAN I EVER GAVE HER CREDIT FOR.
UM... CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING?
YES.
WHEN YOU WERE...
WELL, WHEN THAT MAN STABBED YOU
WHAT DID YOU THINK?
NO.
I MEAN, WHAT DID IT FEEL LIKE?
WELL, UM...
IT HAPPENED REALLY FAST
AND I DIDN'T REALLY KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON
BUT I DIDN'T FEEL A THING.
NO PAIN?
MM-MM. NO PAIN.
HEY, STEVE, DID YOU GET THAT VENOGRAM?
I ORDERED IT TWO HOURS AGO.
I HAD A C.T. GUIDED BIOPSY.
ARE YOU GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET IT?
AFTER MY EMBOLIZATION.
SO DOES THAT MEAN SOME TIME TOMORROW AFTERNOON?
WITH THAT ATTITUDE.
HEY, DID YOU READ
A CHEST C.T. ON A DAVID GREENE TODAY?
WHO?
MY FATHER-- HE CAME IN FOR A SCAN.
I DON'T KNOW. CHECK THE PILE.
THAT'S A BIG STACK.
WELL, WHILE YOU'RE AT IT, MAYBE YOU CAN HELP ME OUT
AND READ A FEW PLAIN FILMS.
OH, YEAH, OR MAYBE YOU COULD JUST WORK A FEW MORE HOURS.
DON'T START.
YOU E.R. GUYS COME IN AND WANT WET READS YESTERDAY.
HERE WE GO.
I.C.U. ORDERS PORTABLES
FOR EVERY DAMN FEEDING TUBE PLACEMENT.
YOU GUYS THINK YOU HAVE HIGH VOLUME IN THE E.R.?
I GET HIGH VOLUME FROM THE HOSPITAL.
HEY, MARK, YOU OKAY?
THAT'S YOUR DAD?
YEAH.
WOW, UH...
I'M SORRY.
HE DIDN'T TELL YOU WHERE WE'RE GOING?
JUST AN ADDRESS.
IT'S THE "WEAR JEANS" PART THAT SCARES ME.
NOT TO MENTION, I DON'T THINK MY MOTHER OWNS A PAIR OF JEANS
AND I DON'T KNOW IF I WANT TO SEE HER.
RIGHT.
I WISH YOU WERE OFF SO WE COULD FACE THEM TOGETHER.
YEAH.
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT, MARK?
WHAT?
YOU'VE LIMITED YOURSELF TO ONE-WORD RESPONSES.
OH, YOU KNOW, I'M SORRY.
I JUST... I GOT TO FINISH SOME CASES.
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO MEET YOU THERE.
ALL RIGHT.
I'LL SEE YOU.
WHAT DID THE SCHOOL SAY?
OH, THEY SAID THEY'D FOLLOW THROUGH
BUT THE GIRLS SAW ME THERE.
I SUPPOSE THEY DIDN'T LISTEN THIS TIME.
NO, THEY RAN AWAY.
CAROL, YOU DID THE RIGHT THING.
I'M STILL GOING TO CALL ANDREA LATER.
ABBY?
YOUR HEMORRHOID PATIENT, MR. PERTH, IS IN THE O.R.
THEY'RE DOING A LAPAROTOMY.
I HEARD HE WENT UP.
IS HE GOING TO BE OKAY?
HE SHOULD.
HE'S GOT A BLEEDING DIVERTICULUM.
IT'S PRETTY LUCKY THAT HE CHECKED HIMSELF BACK IN.
YEAH? I'M GOING TO GO CHECK ON HIM LATER.
GOOD. YOU WERE RIGHT.
THERE WAS SOMETHING ELSE WRONG WITH HIM.
JUST A GUT FEELING.
HE COULD HAVE BLED TO DEATH
IF HE HADN'T COME BACK.
WELL, IT'S A GOOD THING THAT HE FELT FLUISH.
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HE SAID-- "FLUISH."
MRS. WILLIAMS
LAURA CAME OUT OF SURGERY VERY WELL.
( sighing in relief )
THE NURSE WILL TAKE YOU NOW
TO SEE HER, IF YOU LIKE.
YES.
THANK YOU.
BOTH OF YOU.
I WAS, UH, OUT OF LINE BEFORE.
I'M SORRY.
YEAH, COME ON, I UNDERSTAND.
DID YOU REPAIR HER HEPATIC VEIN?
ATRIAL-CAVAL SHUNT.
IT'LL BE A LONG RECOVERY, BUT SHE SHOULD BE FINE.
YOU SAVED HER LIFE.
YEAH, I'M NOT SO SURE.
YOU HAD TO OPEN HER CHEST IN THE E.R.
TO FIX MY MISTAKE.
YEAH, BUT WE WOULD HAVE HAD TO DO THAT ANYWAY.
THE LIVER LACERATION WAS A LIFE-THREATENING INJURY.
LOOK, IF YOU HAD WAITED FOR THE AMBULANCE
SHE MIGHT NOT HAVE MADE IT.
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO KNOW.
LISTEN TO ME.
YOU MADE A CALL.
TOOK A LOT OF GUTS.
Malucci: WHAT DO WE GOT?
ANDREA PARKS--
FOUND DOWN ON THE BATHROOM FLOOR--
PRESUMED OVERDOSE... NO SUICIDE NOTE
BUT A LOT OF BOTTLES IN THE CABINET.
Malucci: ANY NARCOTICS?
NO, SHE'S LETHARGIC, BUT AROUSABLE.
B.P.'s 110/65, PULSE 80.
HOW LONG SINCE SHE TOOK THE PILLS?
PROBABLY AN HOUR OR TWO.
HER FRIEND FOUND HER. WHERE IS SHE?
ON THE WAY. WHAT KIND OF DRUGS DID YOU TAKE?
Weaver: MALUCCI... LEAVE ME ALONE!
POLYDRUG INGESTION.
ANDREA, WHAT'D YOU TAKE?
Malucci: YOU KNOW HER? SHUT UP!
SHE CAME IN THIS MORNING-- NEWLY DIAGNOSED CERVICAL CANCER.
C.B.C., CHEM PANEL, BLOOD AND URINE TOX SCREEN.
ON MY COUNT-- ONE, TWO, THREE.
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO PUMP HER STOMACH.
I'LL GET AN EWALD.
TAKE IT EASY, CAROL.
SHE MAY NOT NEED LAVAGE. HEY, DID YOU GET
THE PILL BOTTLES?
YEAH, THEY FELL OFF THAT GURNEY.
WELL, GO AND FIND THEM.
CAROL, MAYBE YOU SHOULD STEP OUT.
DID YOU SEND AN ASPIRIN LEVEL?
ARE YOU RUNNING THIS? PULSE OX IS 96
ON TWO LITERS.
I'LL RUN AN E.K.G.
IT COULD BE TRICYCLICS.
SO, TONIGHT'S THE JAZZ CLUB.
YEAH, IT'S A PRETTY GOOD SPOT.
GOOD GROUP IS PLAYING.
CLEO KNOWS IT, TOO.
UH-HUH.
( chuckles )
WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?
( chuckling ): NOTHING.
YOU'RE RIGHT ON SCHEDULE.
ALL RIGHT, CARTER, GIVE IT TO ME.
WELL, FIRST
IT WAS PROBABLY COFFEE IN THE CAFETERIA
AND THEN DINNER
IN A NICE BUT WELL-LIT RESTAURANT.
NOTHING TOO OBVIOUS.
THEN MAYBE A SPORTING EVENT, AND TONIGHT'S THE JAZZ CLUB.
WE ALL KNOW WHAT HAPPENS AFTER THE JAZZ CLUB.
WHEN DID YOU LOSE THE FILTER BETWEEN YOUR BRAIN AND MOUTH?
I THINK YOU MIGHT HAVE TAKEN IT OUT
IN THE O.R. LAST WEEK.
HERE, LET ME HELP.
I GOT IT. I GOT IT.
DAMN IT!
CARTER, CARTER, CARTER...
CARTER, CARTER, CARTER, IT'S ALL RIGHT.
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
YOU OKAY?
I LIED TO LUCY'S MOTHER TODAY.
I TOLD HER THAT IT WASN'T PAINFUL
TO HAVE AN EIGHT-INCH KNIFE SHOVED INTO YOUR GUT.
( clears throat )
ANDREA!
ANDREA! SHE'S TACHY AT 120.
TERRI, HOLD ON. DO YOU KNOW WHAT SHE TOOK?
NO, SHE WAS JUST LYING ON THE FLOOR.
WAS IT SOMETHING FROM YOUR MEDICINE CABINET?
IT WAS MY PARENTS' BATHROOM.
DO YOU KNOW WHAT WAS THERE?
I DON'T KNOW.
LOTS OF STUFF-- TYLENOL, ASPIRIN...
ANY PRESCRIPTION MEDICATIONS?
MY DAD SOMETIMES TAKES PILLS FOR HIS BACK.
Hathaway: DO YOU KNOW THE NAME OF THEM?
UH, DIAZE... DIAZE...
DIAZEPAM?
YEAH, THAT SOUNDS RIGHT. SATS DOWN TO 81.
SHE'S BARELY RESPONSIVE.
OKAY, LOST HER GAG REFLEX.
LET'S INTUBATE.
NOT YET-- I CAN BAG HER.
SHE COULD VOMIT AND ASPIRATE.
WERE THERE ANY ANTIDEPRESSANTS?
NO.
Weaver: ARE YOU SURE? YEAH.
HISTORY OF SEIZURES?
NO. NO. PUSH FLUMAZENIL...
.2 MILLIGRAMS.
HERE'S THE TUBE-- INTUBATE. SLOW DOWN.
GIVE THE FLUMAZENIL A CHANCE.
WE HAVE TO PROTECT HER AIRWAY.
ALL RIGHT, GOOD.
IT WORKED.
W-WH-WHAT AM I DOING HERE?
Hathaway: TERRI FOUND YOU.
DO YOU REMEMBER TAKING THE PILLS?
WHAT?
Weaver: YOU'RE GOING
TO BE OKAY, ANDREA.
( crying ): GOD, ANDREA, WHAT DID YOU DO?
LET'S GIVE HER CHARCOAL NOW.
( sighing ): OH...
OH...
WELL...
IT'S AN INTERESTING GAME.
DON'T WORRY, YOU'LL GET IT.
A MARTINI WOULD HELP.
DO THEY HAVE THOSE HERE?
WELL, THAT SHOULD DO THE TRICK--
LOOSEN YOU UP A BIT.
YOU WANT ANYTHING?
NO, THANKS.
WHAT'S KEEPING MARK, ANYWAY?
HE'LL BE HERE...
I HOPE.
DO YOU KNOW HOW TO KEEP SCORE?
NOT A CLUE.
BUT YOU'RE LEARNING THESE AMERICAN GAMES?
ONE BY ONE.
AT LEAST, I'M TRYING.
I THINK THAT'S RATHER ADVENTUROUS OF YOU.
THAT MEETING
I WAS RUNNING OFF TO EARLIER...
I MISSED IT.
MUST BE THE FIRST TIME THAT'S HAPPENED.
YES, I THINK IT WAS.
I WAS APPALLED AT MYSELF.
JUST COULDN'T BE BOTHERED TO GO.
WENT AND SAT BY THE LAKE INSTEAD.
I'LL BET THAT WAS FREEZING.
THE ONLY THING COLDER
THAN SITTING BY THAT LAKE WAS
THE CONVERSATION WE HAD THIS AFTERNOON.
ELIZABETH...
I KNOW I'M NOT THE MOTHER YOU WISH YOU'D HAD...
( sighs )
THAT'S NOT EXACTLY TRUE.
AND I KEEP HOPING THAT SOMEHOW...
YOU'LL FORGIVE ME FOR THAT.
THE PROBLEM IS YOU NEVER WANTED FORGIVENESS.
( sighs )
THERE'S THE RUB.
( chuckles )
MARK'S FATHER THINKS
CHILDREN SHOULDN'T EXPRESS THEIR OPINIONS.
YES?
WELL, HE'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.
( laughing )
I'LL TAKE OVER, CONNIE.
SURE. THANKS.
HOW ARE YOU DOING?
OKAY.
ANDREA, I HAD TO TELL THE SCHOOL
SO THE OTHER STUDENTS COULD GET TESTED
BUT I HAVEN'T TOLD YOUR PARENTS OR TERRI'S.
YOU HAVEN'T?
I WAS HOPING YOU WOULD.
IF SOMETHING HAPPENED TO ONE OF THEM
WOULDN'T YOU WANT TO KNOW?
OW!
( laughing ): OH, MY GOD.
NOW, THAT WAS UGLY.
DO I GET PENALIZED FOR THAT?
THERE'S JUST A LITTLE DENT THERE.
WE CAN ALWAYS MOVE TO ANOTHER LANE.
Corday: THERE'S NO LITTLE DENT.
I'M KIDDING.
HEY. HEY, HEY, MARK.
HEY, WHAT KEPT YOU?
UH, NOTHING-- IT WAS JUST...
HI, ISABELLE.
SIT DOWN. HAVE A DRINK.
I THINK MY BALL'S STUCK.
THAT'S 'CAUSE YOU BROKE IT.
OH, STOP IT.
PRESS THE BUTTON.
WE'LL WORK YOU IN ON THE NEXT ONE, MARK.
NO PROBLEM.
BUT IT'S NOT GOING TO BE THE BOYS AGAINST THE GIRLS, OKAY?
IT WOULDN'T BE FAIR.
NEITHER ONE OF THEM IS ANY GOOD AT ALL.
( laughing )
BY THE WAY, I'LL BE BACK ON THE SOFA.
ISABELLE'S GOING BACK TO ELIZABETH'S TONIGHT.
IT'S SORT OF A MOTHER/DAUGHTER FEST.
SURE.
GRAB A BALL.
ALL RIGHT.
NO, ELIZABETH
YOU'RE TOO FAR TO THE RIGHT.
YEAH, BUT LAST TIME, IT FELL TO THE LEFT.
YOU SEE THOSE MARKS ON THE FLOOR OUT THERE?
THE ARROWS?
YEAH, AIM TO THE ONE JUST ON THE RIGHT OF CENTER
AND PULL YOUR... PULL THE BALL ALL THE WAY BACK
AND-AND DON'T DROP IT.
I MEAN, LET IT ROLL ON THE FLOOR...
AND KEEP YOUR WRIST STRAIGHT.
OKAY, THAT'S AN AWFUL LOT TO REMEMBER.
HERE, LET ME... LET ME SHOW YOU.
I NEVER KNEW HE WAS A SURGICAL INTERN.
YEAH. WELL, NO, HE WAS GOOD.
HE WAS SMART, YOU KNOW?
HE WASN'T REALLY CUT OUT FOR IT.
HE USED TO SPEND
ALL OF HIS TIME TALKING TO THE PATIENTS.
USED TO DRIVE ME CRAZY.
MORGENSTERN-- YOU DON'T KNOW HIM--
BUT, UH, ONE TIME, HE MADE CARTER
HOLD A RETRACTOR FOR FOUR HOURS.
CARTER... NEVER BROKE A SWEAT
NEVER DROPPED IT, NO.
HE'S GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT, PETER.
YEAH, I KNOW.
TICKETS.
OH.
YOU SURE YOU WANT TO GO IN THERE?
OH, YEAH.
WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO TALK.
LET'S GO GET SOME COFFEE.
COME ON.
YOU'RE GOING TO DISAPPOINT CARTER.
WHAT?
NOTHING.
WHAT?
NOTHING.
WHAT? NOTHING.
( humming )
THAT WAS FUN TONIGHT.
( chuckling ): YEAH, IT WAS.
DAD, I NEED TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT SOMETHING.
SURE.
I SAW YOUR SCAN TODAY...
AND YOU HAVE LUNG CANCER WHICH HAS SPREAD TO YOUR LIVER.
YEAH.
THAT'S WHAT THE DOCTORS IN SAN DIEGO SAID, TOO.
HOW LONG HAVE YOU KNOWN?
FOR A WHILE.
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?
YOU REMEMBER OLD REAR ADMIRAL NORRIS?
YEAH, HOW COULD I... HOW COULD I FORGET HIM?
HE WAS MISSING A THUMB.
HE USED TO SCARE ME TO DEATH AS A KID.
HE HAD CANCER.
EVERY TIME I LAID EYES ON HIM, ALL I COULD THINK WAS
"POOR OLD BASTARD.
HE'S GOT CANCER."
HELL, HE LIVED ANOTHER 12 YEARS.
BUT STILL, EVERY TIME I SAW HIM...
I DIDN'T WANT IT TO DEFINE ME, MARK.
I DIDN'T WANT TO SEE IT IN PEOPLE'S EYES.
I DIDN'T WANT TO SEE IT AT ALL...
AND...
I'M SCARED.
