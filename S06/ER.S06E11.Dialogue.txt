...that's been bringing some snow
to the Southern Plains and rain to Texas
and it's heading toward the Northeast.
You see the trough here, that's allowing some cold air
to come down tonight.
And then the snow, the moisture intermingling
with snows in the western part of Kansas.
But this low, as it moves toward the Northeast
is going to pull up some Gulf of Mexico moisture.
DAD?
HEY, MARK, YOU'RE UP EARLY.
MIGHT SNOW LATER-- 50% CHANCE.
DAD, IT'S A LITTLE LOUD.
YOU OUGHT TO HAVE A DOOR TO THAT BEDROOM OF YOURS.
I DON'T WANT A DOOR.
I CAN BUILD YOU ONE.
DAD, I DON'T WANT A DOOR.
CAN YOU TURN THAT THING DOWN?
( phone rings )
HELLO?
YEAH. I'M SORRY.
MY DAD'S VISITING.
YEAH. NO, WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN.
WHO THE HELL'S CALLING AT THIS HOUR?
MY NEIGHBOR-- YOU WOKE HER, TOO.
IT'S NO WONDER.
THE WALLS IN THIS BUILDING
ARE PAPER THIN.
BY THE WAY, WE'RE OUT OF COFFEE.
SO I SEE.
THERE WAS ONLY A LITTLE DIBBLE-DABBLE LEFT.
BARELY ABLE TO GET A CUP OUT OF IT MYSELF.
I THINK I'LL JUST GET DRESSED
AND GO TO WORK.
THIS EARLY?
YEAH, THIS EARLY.
I LIKE THAT WEATHER CHANNEL.
THERE'S NO SENSE
IN TRYING TO WATCH IT IN SAN DIEGO.
CLEAR AND SUNNY, CLEAR AND SUNNY.
CHANCE OF A CLOUD, MOSTLY SUNNY.
HEY, CHUNY.
CAROL! WELCOME BACK.
THANKS.
HOW ARE THE TWINS?
THEY'RE DOING GREAT.
I DON'T KNOW HOW I'LL DO.
THIS IS MY FIRST DAY WITHOUT THEM.
SEEMS PRETTY QUIET, THOUGH.
ACTUALLY, UH... NO.
OH, GREAT. BACK TO WORK.
SEE YOU IN A MINUTE.
I'M RIGHT BEHIND YOU.
VITO CAMPORSERO, 29, ACROBAT.
REHEARSING ON A TRAPEZE, SLIPPED OFF THE PLATFORM.
HOW FAR DID HE FALL?
ABOUT FIVE FEET, BUT HE WAS UP 50.
HE CAUGHT HIS ARMPIT ON A CABLE.
THAT'S WHAT SAVED HIM.
( speaking Italian )
CAROL, WELCOME BACK.
THANKS.
DEEP LACERATION TO THE LEFT AXILLA.
THREE-LITER BLOOD LOSS.
B.P.'s LOW, 60 PALP.
OKAY, READY... STEADY...
LIFT.
GET FOUR UNITS OF O-NEG.
I'M MARK, YOU MUST BE THE NEW NURSE.
HEY, MARK. IT'S GOOD TO BE BACK.
WE DON'T HAVE WATER.
DOES ANYBODY KNOW ABOUT THIS?
NO.
I JUST GOT ON.
I'LL CHECK IT. LUCA, YOU ALL RIGHT?
ALL SET, THANKS.
PRESSURE IS CRASHING.
CAROL, PREP FOR A SUBCLAVIAN.
TWO LITERS ON THE RAPID INFUSER.
ARE YOU HURT?
NO, I'M NOT, IT'S VITO'S BLOOD.
DOMINIC CARRIED HIM DOWN THE LADDER.
PULSE IS 124, SATTING AT 94.
CAROL, THE BETADINE.
OH, YEAH, I GOT IT.
IT'S OKAY IF YOU'RE A LITTLE RUSTY.
I'M FINE, THANK YOU.
FLYING CAMPORSEROS.
I DIDN'T KNOW THE CIRCUS WAS IN TOWN.
LACERATION OF THE AXILLARY ARTERY.
HE'S SHOCKY.
I'M DR. ROMANO.
HELLO.
DOCTOR, PLEASE HELP MY BROTHER.
CHECK THE CRIT FIRST.
I HAVEN'T BEEN GONE THAT LONG.
OKAY, ABSENT WRIST PULSES.
LET'S HAVE A LOOK.
OH... WHOA!
EASY, EASY.
YOU'RE HURTING HIM!
GIVE HIM SOME MORPHINE.
HIS PRESSURE'S TOO LOW.
STOP IT, PLEASE.
ALMOST DONE. HOLD ON.
YOU CAN HOLD ON LONGER.
( speaking Italian )
PLEASE STEP BACK A LITTLE BIT.
( all talking at once )
OKAY, PLEASE. STOP IT.
( speaking Italian )
UNO, DUE, TRE...
HEY, WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?
LET GO OF ME!
WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING?
PUT FOUR LITERS AT EVERY SINK.
WHAT'S GOING ON?
A WATER MAIN BROKE.
IT COULD BE A WHILE.
YOU'RE NOT ON TILL TONIGHT.
I KNOW.
VALERIE PAGE CALLED ME AT HOME.
THE GIRL YOU ORDERED THE L-VAD FOR?
THEY FOUND A MATCH.
SHE'S ON HER WAY IN FOR A HEART TRANSPLANT.
THAT IS GREAT.
CARTER, THEY SAID THEY'RE GETTING STACKED UP AT CHAIRS.
I'M SORRY. I'M ON THE CODE TEAM TODAY
AND I JUST GOT PAGED FOR A RESPIRATORY ARREST
IN THE CAFETERIA THAT WAS A FALSE ALARM.
OKAY, WHAT HAVE WE GOT?
YOUR AMOEBIC DYSENTERY PATIENT JUST USED THE TOILET.
SO?
NO WATER, WE CAN'T FLUSH.
OH... WELL, SORRY, I'VE GOT ANOTHER CASE.
PUT THE "OUT OF ORDER" SIGN ON THE DOOR.
CALL HOUSEKEEPING.
AMIRA, CAN YOU SEE IF WE CAN GET
A COUPLE OF PORTABLE TOILETS FOR THE AMBULANCE BAY
AND SOME AIR FRESHENER.
YOU HAVE A LOT OF CALAMITIES
AT THE CIRCUS, HUH?
NO, NOT USUALLY, BUT PENG, SHE'S AFRAID
SHE WON'T BE ABLE TO PERFORM TONIGHT.
NO, NO. THE LACERATION IS NOT BAD.
TELL HER SHE'LL BE FINE.
( speaking Chinese )
THANK YOU.
HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?
ONE OF THE PLATFORMS, SHE BROKE.
A PIECE OF WOOD FELL RIGHT ON TOP OF HER.
YES, BUT IF THE WOOD FELL FROM ABOVE
HOW DID IT HIT THE BOTTOM OF HER FOOT?
( speaking Chinese )
LOOK AT THIS, YOU SEE?
Luca: WOW!
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I THINK I'LL GO SEE THAT CIRCUS OF YOURS.
HERE'S ONE OF THEM.
GET HIM OUT OF HERE.
Woman: MY MOTHER'S
HAD PARKINSON'S ALMOST 15 YEARS.
HMM... HAS HER CONDITION RECENTLY CHANGED?
WELL, IN THE PAST COUPLE OF DAYS
SHE'S BEEN SO WEAK
THAT SHE CAN'T USE HER WALKER.
I'M WORRIED SHE HAD A STROKE.
MM...
OH, NO, NO. LET US HELP.
NO, I DON'T MIND. I DO IT EVERY DAY.
GOOD FOR MY... HEALTH, RIGHT, MOM?
TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH, I'M A BURDEN.
LOUISE HAS TO LIFT ME ONTO THE TOILET
AND SPONGE-BATHE ME.
OH, COME ON, MOM, STOP IT.
SHE GETS DIZZY
WHEN SHE SITS UP.
COULD IT BE HER HEART?
WELL, WE'LL CHECK.
MAYBE...
MAYBE THE PARKINSON'S IS GETTING WORSE.
I DON'T FEEL WORSE.
YOU MIGHT NOT, MRS. DUFFY
BUT I'M GOING TO EXAMINE YOU, RUN SOME TESTS
AND FIND OUT WHAT'S GOING ON.
( sighing )
YOU OKAY?
OH, YEAH, I'M FINE.
YOU GOT AN I.V. CEFOTAXIME ORDER READY FOR EXAM TWO?
I'LL GET TO IT WHEN I CAN.
BEEN IN THE RACK AN HOUR.
I JUST CHECKED, WAS IT IN THE WRONG SLOT?
DOESN'T MATTER. LADY'S GOT PNEUMONIA.
AND THIS GENTLEMAN HAS CHEST PAIN
AND I CAN ONLY DO ONE THING AT A TIME.
MARK, I'M MOVING AS FAST AS I CAN.
I KNOW YOU ARE, CAROL.
I KNOW IT'S YOUR FIRST DAY BACK.
YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE A LITTLE WHILE
TO GET BACK INTO THE FLOW.
I DON'T THINK
ANY PATIENTS HAVE SUFFERED
FROM MY BEING "A LITTLE RUSTY"
AS DR. KOVAC PUTS IT.
I DIDN'T MEAN TO IMPLY THAT.
HEY, WHY WASN'T I PAGED FOR THE WATER CRISIS?
WE HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN
FOR INTERNAL DISASTER.
I'M ON THE COMMITTEE
THAT DEVELOPED THE PROTOCOL.
WELL, THERE ISN'T A CRISIS, KERRY.
WE'VE GOT TWO PORTABLE TOILETS COMING IN.
WE HAVE PLENTY OF BOTTLED WATER.
EVERYTHING SEEMS TO BE UNDER CONTROL.
YES, EXCEPT THAT THE O.R.
CAN'T STERILIZE THEIR INSTRUMENTS.
THEY'VE CANCELED ALL ELECTIVE SURGERY
AND I'VE CLOSED US TO TRAUMA.
THAT SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD IDEA.
IF THE PATIENTS CAN'T MAKE IT OUTSIDE
OR IF THEY DON'T WANT TO FREEZE THEIR BUTTS OFF
WE CAN USE WATER
FROM THE PHYSICAL THERAPY POOL.
A TWO-GALLON DUMP GIVES YOU A SOLID FLUSH.
OH!
CAREFUL, KERRY.
THANKS FOR THE INFORMATION. THAT'S GOOD TO KNOW.
HI!
HI.
I WAS JUST ABOUT TO HAVE SOME PANCAKES
WHEN MY PAGER WENT OFF.
JUST ABOUT JUMPED OUT OF MY SEAT.
THEY SAID I HAD ONE HOUR TO GET HERE.
I THINK THIS IS NEWS
WORTH MISSING BREAKFAST FOR.
I'M SO GLAD YOU CALLED ME.
I PACKED SO FAST I FORGOT MY SLIPPERS.
WE'LL GET YOU A NEW PAIR
TO GO WITH YOUR NEW HEART.
KEEPING YOU UP, CAROL?
OH, GOD.
HAVE YOU SEEN THE OLD RECORDS ON MY SYNCOPE PATIENT?
YEAH, FILE ROOM'S BRINGING THEM UP.
DID YOU FAX HIS E.K.G. TO HIS P.M.D.?
YES.
HE SAID HE'D CALL AFTER HE GOT IT.
MAYBE HE'S BUSY.
AH, HERE'S THE PROBLEM-- PAPER JAM.
FAX IT AGAIN, WILL YOU, CAROL?
ANYONE SEEN THE X RAYS ON THAT ANKLE IN EXAM FOUR?
DON'T HOLD YOUR BREATH.
RADIOLOGY CAN'T PROCESS THE FILM WITHOUT WATER.
DON'T KNOW HOW LONG IT'S GOING TO BE.
GREAT.
THIS WATER SHORTAGE KEEPS UP
SOME OF US MIGHT GET OUT
IN TIME TO GRAB SOMETHING TO EAT.
SOUNDS LIKE FUN.
YEAH?
HAVE A GOOD TIME.
MICHAEL MUELLER, 28, HAD A SEIZURE WHILE DRIVING.
CRASHED INTO A WALL, HIS AIRBAGS DEPLOYED.
HE'S POST-ICTAL, GOOD B.P., TACHY AT 120.
WE WERE GOING TO HOCKEY PRACTICE AND HE STARTED TO SHAKE.
CURT OBARR, FRONT SEAT PASSENGER.
HE WAS UP AND WALKING WITH A FOREHEAD LAC.
DO YOU KNOW IF MICHAEL'S HAD SEIZURES BEFORE?
NOT THAT I KNOW OF.
OKAY, EVERYBODY
NICE AND EASY, ON MY COUNT.
ONE... TWO... THREE.
LET'S GET A TRAUMA PANEL, C-SPINE, CHEST AND HEAD C.T.
THEY CAN'T DEVELOP X RAYS.
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GET THE FLUOROSCAN.
SINUS TACH 130.
B.P.'s 124/78.
OKAY, PUPILS ARE EQUAL.
DO YOU KNOW IF HE'S HAD ANY MEDICAL PROBLEMS?
HE USES ONE OF THOSE ASTHMA INHALERS.
UH-HUH.
OLD BRUISES-- YOU GUYS PLAY PRETTY ROUGH?
HE GOT CHECKED LAST WEEK.
HE HIT HIS HEAD?
I DON'T THINK SO.
TEMP'S NORMAL, 98.8.
WHOA! LET'S ROLL HIM.
ADD A THEOPHYLLINE LEVEL.
WHAT'S THAT?
ASTHMA MEDICATION.
YOU TAKE TOO MUCH, THIS CAN HAPPEN.
LOUISE?
HEY, EVERYTHING LOOKS OKAY.
HEAD C.T., E.K.G., AND THE BLOOD TESTS
ARE ALL ESSENTIALLY NORMAL.
THEN WHY CAN'T SHE WALK?
WELL, MOST LIKELY IT'S THE PARKINSON'S.
BUT I'M SURE HER NEUROLOGIST CAN ADJUST HER MEDICATION
AS AN OUTPATIENT.
COULD WE TALK OUTSIDE?
OH, YEAH, SURE.
OF COURSE.
AND YOU'RE, UM... NOT GOING TO ADMIT HER?
NOT WHEN THERE'S NO REASON TO.
LOOK...
PLEASE, I LOVE MY MOTHER, BUT I CAN'T TAKE HER HOME
AND CARE FOR HER WHEN SHE CAN'T WALK.
I MEAN, I'M JUST TOO EXHAUSTED.
WELL, MAYBE YOU NEED A HOME AIDE.
BUT I CAN'T AFFORD A HOME AIDE.
I MEAN, SHE NEEDS TO BE IN THE HOSPITAL
FOR A FEW DAYS
SO YOU CAN ADJUST HER MEDS AND GET A LITTLE STRONGER.
UNFORTUNATELY...
WE CAN'T ADMIT HER FOR THAT.
I'M ASKING YOU.
PLEASE.
I'M JUST SO TIRED RIGHT NOW.
IT'S BEEN SUCH A DIFFICULT FEW WEEKS.
IF SHE COULD JUST STAY FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS.
WELL, I...
I WISH I COULD HELP YOU, BUT UNFORTUNATELY
THE HOSPITAL DOESN'T ALLOW FOR THAT KIND OF ADMISSION.
I'M REALLY SORRY.
OKAY.
THANKS.
THESE ARE...
RIDICULOUS... WOULD BE ONE WORD?
THAT WOULD BE ONE WORD, YES.
THE BEST THE GIFT SHOP HAD TO OFFER.
THEN I'LL TAKE THEM, THANK YOU.
YOU'RE WELCOME.
I GOT A HOLD OF YOUR MOM AND SHE IS ON HER WAY HERE.
AND YOUR DAD IS...
NOT AROUND, NEVER HAS BEEN.
I KNOW THAT STORY.
HELLO.
HI, DR. WEAVER.
VALERIE, HOW ARE YOU DOING?
THE PROVERBIAL "COULDN'T BE BETTER."
GOOD.
LUCY, DO YOU HAVE A MOMENT?
SURE.
EXCUSE US.
BE RIGHT BACK.
UM... I'VE LOOKED OVER THE CHART
AND VALERIE HAS A FEVER.
A TEMPERATURE OF 100.9.
IT'S PRETTY LOW-GRADE, THAT COULD JUST BE A COLD.
SHE NEEDS TO GO ON HIGH DOSE IMMUNO-SUPPRESSIVE AGENTS
SO SHE WON'T REJECT THE NEW HEART.
WITH A WEAKENED IMMUNE SYSTEM, EVEN A COLD COULD BE FATAL.
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?
WE NEED TO NOTIFY THE TRANSPLANT COORDINATOR.
WE MAY HAVE TO DECLINE THE HEART.
IS THERE ANYTHING WE CAN DO?
IT'LL BE THEIR DECISION
BUT IN ALL LIKELIHOOD, I THINK
THAT'S WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.
SHE WAS SO CLOSE.
WANT ME TO TELL HER?
NO, I'LL TELL HER.
OKAY.
Greene: SHOOTING.
DEFINITELY GOT A FRACTURE ON YOUR HAND
JUST BELOW THE PINKIE.
MOVE YOUR HAND BACK.
IT'S GOING TO NEED A CAST.
I GUESS I'M LUCKY.
IT COULD HAVE BEEN WORSE.
HOW'S CURT?
HE'S FINE.
FOREHEAD'S BEING SUTURED UP
AND ACTUALLY I'M MORE CONCERNED ABOUT YOU.
I FEEL FINE.
YOUR SEIZURE WAS CAUSED
BY AN OVERDOSE OF THEOPHYLLINE.
AN OVERDOSE?
WERE YOU TRYING TO HURT YOURSELF?
NO. MY ASTHMA FLARES UP WHENEVER I'M STRESSED OUT
SO I TOOK A FEW EXTRA PILLS.
STRESSED AT WORK? AT HOME?
I'M A LANDSCAPER.
JANUARY'S A TOUGH TIME.
WORK STOPS, THE BILLS DON'T.
WHY THE THIRD DEGREE?
UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, I HAVE TO ASK ABOUT DEPRESSION.
TRUST ME. IF I WANTED TO KILL MYSELF
I'D FIND A BETTER WAY.
ALL FIXED UP.
DO YOU KNOW WHAT WAS WRONG?
YEAH, I TOOK TOO MUCH ASTHMA MEDICINE.
BUSTED UP MY HAND.
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO FIND SOMEBODY NEW
TO PLAY LEFT WING.
HE GOING TO BE OKAY?
YEAH, SHOULD BE.
HEY.
HOW'S THE CAR?
IT'S TOTALED, BUT DON'T WORRY, YOU'RE INSURED.
IS IT ALL RIGHT TO USE ONE OF THESE THINGS IN HERE?
SURE.
I'LL JUST GET A RENTAL.
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU PASSED GAS?
ABOUT AN HOUR AGO.
NO FEVER OR VOMITING.
WELL, PETER, I AGREE WITH YOUR ASSESSMENT.
MR. HOYT, YOU ARE FULL OF STOOL.
DR. BENTON WILL SEE THAT YOU GET AN ENEMA.
EXCUSE ME, DOCTOR... NOT NOW, WE'RE BUSY.
UNLESS SOMEBODY'S DYING, COME BACK LATER.
OKAY, PETER, WHO'S NEXT?
SPLENECTOMY FROM LAST WEEK-- MR. JABOUR.
VALERIE PAGE IS HERE FOR A HEART TRANSPLANT.
OLD NEWS-- THE TRANSPLANT SERVICE ALREADY CALLED ME.
I MAKE IT MY BUSINESS TO STAY INFORMED.
THEN YOU KNOW SHE HAS A FEVER.
I WASN'T AWARE OF THAT.
HAVE YOU CALLED THE TRANSPLANT COORDINATOR?
NOT YET.
PETER, CALL THE COORDINATOR.
LET HER KNOW WE'LL PASS ON THAT HEART.
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO EXAMINE HER?
YOU CAN'T OPERATE IF THERE'S A FEVER.
BUT HER WHITE COUNT, CHEST X RAY AND URINE ARE NORMAL.
I GIVE YOU A GOLD STAR FOR EFFORT
BUT A FEVER STILL SPELLS INFECTION.
RIGHT, I THINK IT'S A DRIVELINE INFECTION OF HER L-VAD.
I RESEARCHED ARTICLES FROM PITTSBURGH AND STANFORD.
THE TREATMENT IS GIVE ANTIBIOTICS
REMOVE THE DEVICE, THEN GIVE THE NEW HEART.
PETER, GO WORK HER UP.
I'LL TALK TO THE TRANSPLANT SERVICE.
MS. KNIGHT, YOU ARE LIKE
A CRAZED ENERGIZER BUNNY ON THIS ONE--
YOU JUST KEEP GOING AND GOING AND GOING...
THANK YOU.
...AND GOING AND GOING...
CAROL, WE'RE OUT OF I. AND D. KITS IN EXAMINE TWO.
I'LL CHECK THE SUTURE ROOM.
NO, I-I DON'T NEED ONE.
I JUST, I JUST WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW.
OH, I'M... I'M SORRY, KERRY.
BIG TRAUMA CAME IN.
I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO CHECK ALL MY ROOMS.
HEY, NO, I'M NOT CRITICIZING YOU.
I'LL GET TO IT AS SOON AS I CAN.
YEAH, I KNOW YOU WILL.
MUST FEEL STRANGE COMING BACK
AFTER BEING OFF FOR SIX WEEKS.
NOT REALLY. IF YOU NEED TO TAKE AN EXTRA BREAK...
WHY WOULD I NEED A BREAK?
YOU MIGHT NOT BE GETTING ENOUGH SLEEP.
OH, I'M GETTING PLENTY OF SLEEP.
THANKS, KERRY.
( both speaking Spanish )
DR. MALUCCI, IS THERE A PROBLEM?
UH, YEAH, CHIEF, THERE IS.
CHECK THIS OUT.
DOLISON.
MM-HMM. HER HUSBAND'S BEEN POPPING THESE PUPPIES
FOR THREE WEEKS, NOW HE'S VOMITING BLOOD.
I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH THIS MEDICATION.
THEY'RE FROM MEXICO-- COMBO PAINKILLER AND STEROID.
ANYONE CAN BUY THEM.
UNBELIEVABLE.
BE SURE I.C.U. GETS HIM ON A STEROID TAPER.
OKAY.
CLEO?
YEAH?
ALL RIGHT, SO, WHEN I SAID I WAS, YOU KNOW
TRYING TO GET OUT OF HERE EARLY... UH-HUH.
AND GOING TO GRAB A BITE TO EAT...
YEAH, I WISH I COULD GET OUT EARLY.
MM-HMM. SO, WHAT IF WE MADE IT LATER?
I NEVER KNOW WHEN I CAN GET OUT.
DON'T WAIT ON ME. UH-HUH.
CAROL?
( crying )
YOU ALL RIGHT?
OH, I'M FINE.
YOU DON'T LOOK FINE.
( crying ): NO, REALLY...
I AM REALLY FINE.
FIRST DAY BACK MUST BE TOUGH.
WHY DON'T YOU JUST LEAVE?
NO, I'M JUST GOING TO SIT HERE
AND I'M GOING TO HAVE... A GOOD CRY
AND THEN I'M GOING TO FEEL BETTER.
THAT'S WHAT I DO AT HOME.
( sniffling )
YOU SEE, I AM... I'M BETTER ALREADY.
( laughs )
( blows nose )
THANKS, ELIZABETH.
CAROL, ARE YOU OKAY?
( sobbing ): OH, I'M FINE.
IT'S HER FIRST DAY BACK.
SHE'S A LITTLE OVERWHELMED.
I DON'T BLAME HER.
BETWEEN THE DIAPERS AND THE DISHES?
THE FEEDINGS, LAUNDRY.
THEN COMING HERE FOR A 12-HOUR SHIFT.
Corday: I DON'T KNOW HOW SHE'S GOING TO DO IT.
TRYING TO STAY FOCUSED WITH THE PATIENTS.
ALL SHE WANTS TO THINK ABOUT ARE HER BABIES.
CAROL... IF THERE'S ANYTHING WE CAN DO.
( voice breaks ): OKAY.
( sobbing )
( blowing nose )
I'M REALLY CONFUSED.
YOU WERE ALL SET TO CANCEL THE TRANSPLANT
AND NOW YOU SAY I CAN HAVE THE HEART.
WITH THE DRIVELINE INFECTION
YOU NEED A DAY OR TWO OF ANTIBIOTICS
BEFORE YOU CAN GET THE TRANSPLANT.
SO I LOSE THE HEART AFTER ALL.
NOT NECESSARILY.
YOU HAVE A VERY LOW FEVER
AND WE THINK THAT WE CAN CLEAR UP THE INFECTION
WITH A FEW DOSES OF ANTIBIOTICS
AND STILL DO THE TRANSPLANT.
WHAT IF THE ANTIBIOTICS DON'T WORK?
WORST CASE?
YEAH, WORST CASE.
AFTER SURGERY, YOU COULD DEVELOP
A LIFE-THREATENING INFECTION.
( sighs )
WHAT WOULD YOU DO?
IT'S YOUR DECISION, VALERIE.
I KNOW, BUT WOULD YOU HAVE THE SURGERY?
THE RISK IS SMALL...
AND YOU'VE WAITED A LONG TIME.
I WOULD GO FOR IT.
HOW LONG HAVE YOU AND CURT BEEN TOGETHER?
A WHILE.
EVERYTHING OKAY?
YEAH.
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE TWO OF YOU FIGHT?
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK WE FIGHT?
WELL, EVERYBODY HAS ARGUMENTS.
YOU GOT BRUISES, STRESSED OUT
YOU O.D.'d ON YOUR MEDICATION.
I'M JUST TRYING TO PUT IT ALL TOGETHER.
IT'S NOT UNCOMMON FOR...
( clears throat )
FIGHTS TO TURN PHYSICAL.
PEOPLE DON'T MEAN FOR IT TO HAPPEN
IT JUST DOES.
NO, NO, I-I KNOW THEY DON'T.
SOMETHING JUST SETS IT OFF.
THAT EVER HAPPEN TO YOU?
FORGOT TO PICK UP THE DRY CLEANING.
HE, UH...
HE HIT ME, AND...
HE SAID HE WAS SORRY
AND HE PROMISED HE'D NEVER DO IT AGAIN.
HAS HE?
SO THERE HAVE BEEN OTHER TIMES.
YEAH.
I'D LIKE YOU TO TALK TO A SOCIAL WORKER.
THEY HAVE EXPERIENCE AT DEALING WITH THESE THINGS.
OKAY?
I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T KNOW.
DR. CORDAY?
LINDSAY.
HOW ARE YOU?
I'M ALL RIGHT.
UM... IT WAS MY SISTER'S FUNERAL YESTERDAY.
I JUST... I WANTED TO THANK YOU.
YOU REALLY DON'T HAVE TO.
THE POLICE SAID THAT, UM...
THAT HE FINALLY TOLD YOU WHERE HE...
LEFT JENNY.
YES.
UM, I'M TRYING TO FORGET HIM.
I-I JUST HEAR HIS VOICE ALL THE TIME
AND... IT'S VERY GENTLE
BUT IT'S JUST SAYING THESE AWFUL THINGS.
NOW YOU LISTEN TO ME.
THAT'S WHAT HE WANTED--
TO MAKE YOU SUFFER.
BUT YOU DON'T LET HIM WIN.
HE'S NOTHING.
HE CAN'T HURT YOU ANYMORE.
( softly ): I KNOW.
I KNOW.
IT'S OKAY.
HOW LONG IS THE OPERATION?
FOUR, FIVE HOURS.
DO THEY LET MED STUDENTS WATCH?
ONLY IF THEY'RE ON THE TRANSPLANT SERVICE.
SO THAT MEANS THAT YOU CAN'T STAY.
NAH, I'M GOING TO TALK THEM INTO MAKING AN EXCEPTION.
THANKS.
YEAH.
OH, WILL YOU DO ME A FAVOR? SURE.
I FORGOT TO FEED SPOONY.
SPOONY? IT'S MY CAT.
WILL YOU TELL MY MOM?
YES.
I'M GOING TO GO CHANGE.
I'LL SEE YOU.
CAN I HAVE A MOMENT WITH HIM?
I KNEW YOU'D COME.
DID YOU? MM-HMM.
WHEN I WOKE UP
AND FOUND YOU HADN'T DONE WHAT YOU'D SAID YOU'D DO...
I WAS GLAD.
THE FACT THAT YOU WERE A COWARD
NEVER EVEN OCCURRED TO ME.
YOUR CONSCIENCE IS BOTHERING YOU
ISN'T IT?
IT IS, ACTUALLY.
WHY, BECAUSE YOU NEARLY KILLED ME?
OR BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T HAVE THE GUTS TO?
BECAUSE I ENJOYED THE POWER I HAD OVER YOU:
WHEN I COULD HAVE LET YOU BLEED TO DEATH AT THE CRASH
WHEN YOUR HEART STOPPED WHILE I WAS OPERATING
WHEN THE MORPHINE TOOK YOU UNDER.
I HELD YOUR EVERY BREATH IN MY HANDS
AND I SO WANTED TO REPAY SOME OF THE PAIN YOU CAUSED.
BUT THEN I LOOKED AT YOUR SAD LITTLE BODY
AND I SAW WHAT A PATHETIC MAN YOU ARE.
AND I REALIZED, I DIDN'T WANT POWER OVER YOU AT ALL.
AND MY JOB, FOR BETTER OR WORSE
WAS SIMPLY TO PUT YOU BACK TOGETHER.
SEE, I DON'T GIVE A DAMN IF YOU GO TO THE CHAIR
OR IF YOU SPEND THE REST OF YOUR LIFE IN PRISON.
MY JOB'S DONE.
YOU WERE MY PATIENT, YOU WERE SICK.
YOU'RE BETTER.
GOOD-BYE, MR. ROLLINS.
YOU CAN TAKE HIM NOW.
COME BACK HERE.
I HAVEN'T FINISHED WITH YOU YET!
YOU GET BACK HERE, CORDAY!
CORDAY!
YOU GET BACK HERE
ANY CHEST PAIN OR SHORTNESS OF BREATH?
I MAY BE A LITTLE LIGHTHEADED.
OH, MY GOD, WHAT HAPPENED?
THE PARKING LOT ATTENDANT'S IDEA OF A CODE BLUE.
WHAT? SHE SLIPPED ON THE ICE.
I WAS HELPING MOM INTO THE CAR.
MY WHEELCHAIR FELL OVER.
DID YOU HIT YOUR HEAD OR LOSE CONSCIOUSNESS?
LOUISE, DID SHE LOSE CONSCIOUSNESS?
I DON'T THINK SO, BUT I FELL FIRST
SO I DON'T KNOW.
PUT HER ON A MONITOR.
YOU WANT THIS ONE, DR. CHEN?
I JUST DISCHARGED HER.
OH, WELL, I'M A FIRM BELIEVER OF CONTINUITY OF CARE.
NO HEAD TRAUMA, CHECK HIP AND PELVIS. BYE.
I'M SO SORRY, MOM.
I'M ALL RIGHT.
THE B.P. IS 170/95.
IS THAT BAD?
IT'S A LITTLE HIGH.
WHY DON'T WE GET A C.B.C
CHEM PANEL, CARDIAC ENZYMES, E.K.G. AND POSTURAL VITALS.
I'M FINE. I'M JUST SO... SO TIRED.
WHAT WAS, UH, SHE HERE FOR?
WEAKNESS, EXACERBATION OF PARKINSON'S.
SHE HASN'T BEEN ABLE TO WALK FOR THREE DAYS.
IT'S GETTING HARDER FOR ME TO TAKE CARE OF HER.
HER HEAD C.T. WAS NORMAL.
I SEE.
RIGHT ATRIAL CANULATION IS COMPLETE.
UMBILICAL TAPE.
HOW LONG DOES THE L-VAD STAY ON?
UNTIL WE GO ON BYPASS.
RIGHT.
THE AORTIC CANULA IS LOOKING GOOD.
HERE WE GO.
KILL THE AIR PUMP.
CLAMP THE AORTIC GRAFT, PETER.
OKAY, AND... GOT IT.
OPEN THE VENOUS LINE.
ANYONE LOOKING FOR A HEART?
YOU'RE EARLY, SHIRLEY, MAKING ME LOOK BAD.
SORRY, DR. HANOVER.
TAKE IT UP WITH THE F.A.A.
IS IT TOO EARLY?
NO, NO, NO, IT CAN WAIT ON ICE FOR A WHILE.
WOW, THAT'S HER NEW HEART.
YEAH.
SURE IS.
HE DENIED EVERYTHING.
CLAIMED THE BOYFRIEND NEVER EVEN TOUCHED HIM.
I THOUGHT HE WAS READY TO TALK.
IT'S NOT UNCOMMON FOR VICTIMS TO CHANGE THEIR MINDS.
HE PROBABLY LOVES THE GUY AND WANTS TO PROTECT HIM.
SURE, HE'S AFRAID.
WILL YOU BE AROUND ALL DAY?
YEAH. THINKING ABOUT MAKING ANOTHER RUN AT HIM?
MAYBE.
WELL, GIVE ME A CALL.
OKAY, THANKS.
CAROL, HOW ARE YOU FEELING?
FOUR HOURS AND 43 MINUTES TO GO.
YOU KNOW, COUNTING THE MINUTES IS NOT A GOOD SIGN.
CAN SOMEONE TAKE THIS INGROWN TOENAIL?
SHE'S BEEN WHINING FOR OVER AN HOUR.
REAL BITCH.
CAROL.
THE WOMAN IS EXHAUSTED.
I KNOW THAT, JOHN.
SO SHE NEEDS A BREAK, A COUPLE OF DAYS.
I CAN'T. HOW'S THE PARKING LOT?
THEY LIVED.
YOU CAN'T OR YOU WON'T?
BOTH.
JUST SAY YOU'RE RULING OUT A STROKE.
I CAN'T LIE ABOUT A DIAGNOSIS.
SOMETIMES WE MAKE WHAT'S CALLED A "JUDGMENT CALL."
IF THE RULES NEED TO BE BENT
A LITTLE BIT, WE BEND THEM.
I BENT THEM LAST WEEK, REMEMBER
AND I GOT INTO A LOT OF TROUBLE.
IF YOU'RE AFRAID OF GETTING YELLED AT
MAYBE YOU'RE IN THE WRONG DEPARTMENT.
LISTEN, EVERYBODY DOES SOFT ADMITS.
IT'S JUST PART OF THE DRILL.
LOOK, I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE SAYING
BUT I'M NOT ADMITTING HER.
SHE'S MY PATIENT, IT'S MY CALL.
OKAY.
OKAY, YOU'RE RIGHT.
YEAH?
NOT ABOUT THE PATIENT.
I DON'T AGREE WITH YOU
BUT YOU GOT TO DO WHATEVER YOU THINK IS BEST.
WELL... THANKS FOR YOUR INPUT.
ANY TIME.
HEY, AMIRA, I NEED A TELEMETRY BED FOR LOUISE DUFFY.
WAIT, YOU'RE ADMITTING THE DAUGHTER?
YEAH.
HER HYPERTENSION'S OUT OF CONTROL.
I WANT TO RULE OUT AN M.I.
YOU'RE KIDDING, RIGHT?
SHE'S SYNCOPAL.
SHE MIGHT HAVE UNSTABLE ANGINA.
SHE SLIPPED ON SOME ICE.
YOU SAID SO YOURSELF.
WELL, IT'S MY PATIENT. IT'S MY CALL.
AND WHERE'S THE MOTHER SUPPOSED TO GO?
THAT'S YOUR PATIENT.
THAT'S YOUR CALL.
YOU MUST HAVE MISUNDERSTOOD.
A BUNCH OF US GOT INTO A FIGHT AT THE HOCKEY RINK.
MICHAEL, WE BOTH KNOW YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE SAFE
UNTIL YOU GET OUT OF THIS RELATIONSHIP.
I'LL JUST WEAR MORE PADS NEXT TIME.
MOST DOMESTIC HOMICIDES
HAVE A HISTORY OF PHYSICAL ABUSE.
WHAT, ARE YOU TRYING TO SCARE ME?
YES. YOU NEED TO GET AWAY FROM HIM.
OKAY, I GOT THE RENTAL.
WE'RE ALL SET.
YOU OKAY?
YEAH, FINE.
IS HE READY TO GO?
WE NEED TO GET A C.T. SCAN.
WHAT FOR?
PREVIOUS HEAD TRAUMA.
I TOLD HIM WE PLAY A LOT OF HOCKEY.
I WANT TO CLEAR HIM MEDICALLY BEFORE HE PLAYS AGAIN.
I'D LIKE TO TAKE HIM HOME.
MICHAEL, I THINK YOU SHOULD STAY.
I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND THE RISK THAT'S INVOLVED.
HE UNDERSTANDS THEM.
I'M NOT SO SURE.
WHY DON'T WE LET DR. GREENE JUST...?
SHUT UP.
IF YOU NEED HIM TO SIGN SOMETHING
HE'LL SIGN IT...

YEAH.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO.
IT'S YOUR DECISION.
THANKS. UH, I FEEL BETTER NOW, REALLY.
WE SHOULD GET HOME.

I'VE BEEN WAITING A HALF HOUR FOR A TRANSLATOR.
SORRY.
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?
FATHER-DAUGHTER COMBO, PRESENT WITH APLASTIC ANEMIA.
BOTH OF THEM?

YEAH, WHY?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
I'VE GOT A HUNCH.
HOLA.

ESTUVIMOS ACATARRADOS.

DETRAS DE LA LAVADERIA
EN LA CALLE HALSTEAD.
GRACIAS.
WHAT ARE THEY SAYING?
LAST MONTH, THEY GOT A BUNCH OF SHOTS FOR THEIR COLDS.
DID YOU GET THE NAME OF THE DOCTOR?
NO DOCTOR. THEY WENT TO A PHARMACY.
WHAT KIND OF PHARMACIST GIVES A SHOT?
THE BAD KIND. IT'S A BACKROOM CLINIC.
THEY SMUGGLE DRUGS UP FROM MEXICO.
OH, GOD.
MM-HMM. PLENTY OF STUFF
THAT COULD GIVE YOU APLASTIC ANEMIA.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
THEY GAVE ME THE ADDRESS.
HOLD ON. WE SHOULD CALL THE POLICE.

YEAH, I'M GOOD.
NO, I'LL PULL THE CAR AROUND.
WATER'S ALL HOOKED UP.
OH, FINALLY.
SOMEBODY'S GOT TO SIGN THIS.
DR. GREENE, WOULD YOU MIND SIGNING FOR THE WATER?
SURE, WHY NOT.
DOES THIS MEAN THE WATER'S TURNED BACK ON?
NOT YET. GOT TO CHECK THE PRESSURE.
I'LL BE IN THE AMBULANCE BAY.
HEY, DR. GREENE, CAN WE PAGE AN INDIVIDUAL BEEPER
ON THE CODE TEAM?
IF YOU KNOW THE NUMBER.
ISUPREL'S DOWN TO FOUR MIKES PER MINUTE
LESS THAN 50ccs FROM THE MEDIASTINAL TUBE.
WOW. WHAT?

DR. BENTON, HER GAZE IS DEVIATED TO THE RIGHT.
VALERIE, SQUEEZE MY HAND.
OH, MY GOD.
WE'RE GOING TO C.T. CALL RADIOLOGY.
LUCY, UNHOOK HER.
LET'S BAG HER, LET'S GO.

THAT'S VERY FUNNY.
I COULD HAVE KILLED MYSELF.
OH... IT'S PAYBACK TIME, JUST TAKE IT LIKE A MAN.
PAYBACK FOR WHAT?
FOR BLACKMAILING ME.
I ADMITTED MRS. DUFFY.
REALLY?
YOU'RE SURPRISED.
YOU THINK I'M SO HEARTLESS
I'D SHIP AN OLD LADY TO A NURSING HOME AGAINST HER WILL?
I THOUGHT YOU WERE HEARTLESS
TO DISCHARGE HER THE FIRST TIME.
OH, JOHN, IF I WERE REALLY HEARTLESS
I WOULDN'T BOTHER TO TELL YOU THAT
YOU'VE GOT TOILET PAPER STUCK TO YOUR SHOE.
( laughing )
WHAT WAS THAT?
SOMEBODY HELP!
WHAT HAPPENED?!
HE WAS TRYING TO PUT OUR STUFF IN THE TRUNK.
WE SHOULD MOVE HIM.
NO, NOT UNTIL WE GET A BACKBOARD AND A C-COLLAR.
YEAH, LOOKS LIKE A FLAIL CHEST.
MALIK, GET AN AIRWAY KIT, AND GET DR. GREENE.
YOU GOT IT!
AND TELL THE DRIVER TO TURN THIS WATER OFF!
I THOUGHT I HAD IT IN FIRST GEAR.
OH, MY GOD, CURT, I'M SO SORRY.
HE'S NOT MOVING MUCH AIR.
CURT, I'M SORRY!
DON'T WORRY, BUD, WE GOT IT.
JUST STAND BACK.
THIS GUY'S GOING TO NEED A COUPLE OF CHEST TUBES.
OKAY, I'LL INTUBATE. EIGHT-O TUBE.

I'M LOSING THE PULSE!
OKAY, SET UP THE RAPID INFUSER AND PREP FOR A THORACOTOMY.
DECREASED BREATH SOUNDS BILATERALLY.
PREP BOTH SIDES OF THE CHEST.
HE JUST BACKED INTO HIM?
YEAH.
ACTUALLY PINNED HIM UP AGAINST THE WATER TROUGH.
TACHY AT 128. PRESSURE'S DOWN TO 70.
LET ME HAVE THE TEN BLADE.
SET UP TWO THORASEALS AND TWO SUCTION LINES.
OKAY, I'M IN.
BAG HIM.
32 FRENCH. LET'S GO. LET'S GO.
CURVED KELLY.
PULSE OX DROPPING TO 82.
OKAY, MINE'S IN.
HOOK IT UP.
CHEST TUBE.
THORASEAL'S NOT BUBBLING.
PRESSURE'S DOWN TO 60.
HOLD ON. THERE'S NO SUCTION.
ALL RIGHT, TRY THE OTHER ONE.
NOPE.
WHAT'S GOING ON?
WALL SUCTION'S GENERATED BY THE FLOW OF WATER.
NO WATER, NO SUCTION.
CHUNY, GO GET THE PORTABLE SUCTION FROM CENTRAL.
RUN!
I'M IN.
PULSE OX, 75.
SYSTOLIC'S 50.
WE NEED TO RE-EXPAND HIS LUNGS.
WE'RE WAITING ON SUCTION.
WHAT ABOUT, UH, WHAT ABOUT THAT VACUUM CLEANER?
WHAT? YEAH, THE GUY WAS USING IT AT ADMIT.
LYDIA. GOT IT.
WE'LL NEED SOMETHING TO MAKE A SEAL.
SOMETHING LIKE CLAY.
MEROCEL SPONGES.
WE'LL NEED ABOUT 20 OF THEM.
HE'S BRADYING DOWN.
AMP OF ATROPINE.

DR. ROMANO...
JUST A SECOND, MS. KNIGHT.
WHAT DID YOU FIND?
FOUND A HUGE CLOT IN THE LEFT M.C.A.
COULDN'T OPEN IT UP.
ANY SPONTANEOUS RESPIRATION?
NO, NO. NO BRAIN STEM ACTIVITY.
YEAH. THANKS, PETER.
IT WAS A STROKE.
YES.
THEY TRIED STREPTOKINASE
COULDN'T OPEN UP THE VESSEL.
CAN SHE RECOVER?
THE TRUTH?
SHE'S IN A PERMANENT VEGETATIVE STATE.
IT WAS THE L-VAD, WASN'T IT?
WE DON'T KNOW THAT FOR SURE. THREW A CLOT TO HER BRAIN.
DON'T BLAME YOURSELF.
THIS IS NOT YOUR FAULT.
I'M THE ONE WHO PUT THE THING IN, REMEMBER?
WE MAKE THESE MEDICAL DECISIONS ALL THE TIME.
NOTHING'S RISK-FREE.
I BETTER GO TALK TO HER MOTHER.
YEAH... NO, HOLD ON.
UH, UNOS HAS IDENTIFIED
A POTENTIAL RECIPIENT IN MILWAUKEE.
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
A DOMINO HEART PROCEDURE.
WE TAKE OUT VALERIE'S NEW HEART
AND GIVE IT TO SOMEONE ELSE WHO NEEDS IT.
YOU NEED TO GET CONSENT FROM THE FAMILY.
BUT SHE'LL...
SHE IS ALREADY DEAD, MS. KNIGHT.
WHERE'S HE GOING?
FOUR EAST. I.C.U.
RIGHT, THANKS.
IS HE GOING TO BE OKAY?
WE'LL SEE.
YOU WANT TO TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED?
HE ASKED ME TO POP THE TRUNK SO HE COULD PUT THE BAGS IN.
I WAS TRYING TO PULL FORWARD TO GIVE HIM ROOM.
I THOUGHT I HAD IT IN FIRST.
YOU WENT BACKWARDS.
I'M NOT USED TO DRIVING A STICK.
THOUGHT THEY HAD TO ADMIT ME FOR HYPOTHERMIA.
DO YOU WANT TO USE THIS?
I'M OKAY.
COOL TRAUMA.
YEAH, IT'S NOT SO BAD WHEN TWO DOCTORS WORK TOGETHER.
ASSIST THE PATIENT, COME UP WITH A PLAN OF ACTION.
JOHN, ARE YOU STILL ANGRY ABOUT THE WAY I HANDLED LOUISE
AND MRS. DUFFY?
NO.
THEN YOU'RE MAD ABOUT THE PRACTICAL JOKE.
NO, I LIKE A GOOD JOKE NOW AND AGAIN.
YOU KNOW, I'M JUST DISAPPOINTED
THAT YOU COULDN'T COME RIGHT OUT AND ADMIT
THAT YOU MADE A MISTAKE.
THAT YOUR WAY OF DEALING WITH IT
WAS TO DEVISE SOME SILLY GAG.
YOU'RE RIGHT.
YOU KNOW, DEB, THINGS ARE GOING TO GO
A LOT EASIER FOR YOU AROUND HERE
IF YOU JUST DEAL WITH THINGS HONESTLY.
JOHN... THANK YOU.
OH, AND, UM, NO MORE PRACTICAL JOKES.
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.
SHE SAID YES.
HEY, LUCY.
I'M SORRY.
DR. CHEN, I GOT X RAYS ON THAT BELLY PAIN IN ONE.
FINALLY.
WATER'S BEEN BACK FOR ALMOST AN HOUR.
WHAT TAKES THEM SO LONG?
OH, MY GOD.
WHAT?
MY PATIENT ATE NAILS.
CHUNY, CALL O.R.
AND GET SURGERY DOWN HERE RIGHT NOW.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
SO, YOU MADE IT THROUGH THE DAY, HUH?
JUST ABOUT.
CAROL, GOOD TO HAVE YOU BACK.
THANKS.
YOU'RE LUCKY TO BE ALIVE, YOU KNOW THAT?
HEY, MALUCCI, WHAT DID YOU DO?
UH, NOTHING, CHIEF.
IT WAS JUST A SUCKER PUNCH BAR FIGHT.
ANY BROKEN BONES?
SHORT A FEW BRAIN CELLS, BUT OTHERWISE OKAY.
GUARD WITH YOUR LEFT NEXT TIME.
RIGHT. THANKS, CHIEF.
SO, ANYWAY, I GO IN, I TELL THEM I HAVE A SORE THROAT.
GUY DOESN'T EVEN LOOK IN MY MOUTH.
DIPYRONE.
F.D.A. BANNED THIS 20 YEARS AGO.
IT GETS BETTER. THEN HE BRINGS OUT A VIAL AND A SYRINGE
WANTS TO GIVE ME A SHOT.
CHLORAMPHENICOL.
YOU DIDN'T.
WHAT DO YOU THINK? I'M STUPID.
I GRABBED THE VIAL AND I RAN.
THAT'S PRETTY MUCH WHEN THINGS
GOT A LITTLE VIOLENT.
HOPE IT WAS WORTH IT.
I GOT EVIDENCE NOW.
THEY'RE GOING DOWN.
EXCUSE ME, CLEO, YOU GOT A MINUTE?
SURE.
HOLD THAT.
SO, YOU, UH, YOU GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET OFF?
YEAH, LOOKS LIKE IT.
YOU WANT TO GO GRAB SOME DINNER?
WHERE YOU GUYS GOING?
ACTUALLY, IT'S JUST YOU AND ME.
WHAT HAPPENED TO EVERYBODY ELSE?
THAT'S WHAT I WAS TRYING TO EXPLAIN.
PETER, YOU ASKING ME OUT?
YEAH.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
HE'S PRETTY SHAKEN UP.
YEAH.
HE HAD A SEIZURE?
THAT'S RIGHT.
WELL, THEY REVOKE YOUR DRIVER'S LICENSE FOR SEIZURES.
YOU CLEARED HIM TO DRIVE?
HE DOESN'T HAVE EPILEPSY.
TOO MUCH ASTHMA MEDICINE.
BUT HE DIDN'T HAVE ANY IN HIS SYSTEM WHEN HE LEFT.
OKAY, ANYTHING ELSE I SHOULD KNOW?
NO, THAT'S IT.
OKAY, THANKS.
HEY, EVERYTHING OKAY?
POLICE SEEM SATISFIED WITH YOUR STORY.
GUESS YOU GOT WHAT YOU WANTED.
HOW'S THAT?
I'LL BE SAFE AT HOME TONIGHT.
SOCIAL WORKER'S GOING TO BE AROUND.
WHY DON'T THE THREE OF US TALK?
NO. NO, I'M ALL RIGHT NOW.
DR. GREENE, YOUR POPS IS ON LINE TWO.
HE LOCKED HIMSELF OUT OF YOUR APARTMENT.
OKAY, MALIK.
THANKS, DR. GREENE.
I APPRECIATE YOUR ENCOURAGEMENT.
LUCY, YOU LOOK LIKE YOU'RE FREEZING.
WHAT?
IT STARTED SNOWING
AND YOU LOOK LIKE YOU'RE VERY, VERY COLD.
I AM.
NO, NO, THAT'S OKAY.
NO, COME ON.
I'M EUROPEAN.
WE LIKE TO BE GALLANT.
THANKS.
SO, ARE YOU OFF?
I'VE GOT TWO TICKETS FOR THE CIRCUS.
NO, ACTUALLY, I'M JUST COMING ON.
THEN WHAT WERE YOU DOING HERE ALL DAY?
NOT ENOUGH, AS IT TURNS OUT.
IT'S NEVER BEEN VERY EASY FOR ME TO BE HERE.
SOMETIMES, I FELT LIKE I WOULD NEVER FIT IN.
THAT'S SOMETHING I KNOW ABOUT
BUT THEN I'VE MOVED AROUND A LOT AND NOW I'M USED TO IT.
BUT AT THE BEGINNING OF EVERY DAY
I'VE BEEN GRATEFUL THAT I'M WALKING IN HERE
OF MY OWN CHOOSING.
I'M NOT CARRIED IN ON SOME GURNEY.
AND AT THE END OF EVERY DAY, IF I HAVE HELPED JUST ONE PERSON
IT'S BEEN WORTH IT.
AND THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN TODAY
AND THAT MAKES ME SAD.
HEY, YOUR DAY IS NOT OVER.
MAYBE THIS IS YOUR ONE PERSON.
I DOUBT IT.
YES, BUT, UH, LET'S SEE IF I'M RIGHT.
AND MISS THE CIRCUS?
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'VE HAD ENOUGH CIRCUS FOR TODAY.
COME ON.
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT?
PAUL GALINSKI, 36, PUT HIS SNOWMOBILE INTO A TREE
EJECTED WITH MULTIPLE FACIAL FRACTURES.
TRIED BUT COULDN'T TUBE HIM.
TOO MUCH BLOOD.
HE'S ALL YOURS.
YOU CAN INTUBATE.
LOOKS LIKE A DIFFICULT ONE.
YEAH, I'LL TALK YOU THROUGH IT.
YOU EVER USE A TRACH LIGHT?
NO.
OKAY, I'LL SHOW YOU HOW.
