( phone ringing )
HELLO.
HI, MOM.
NO.
I'M MAKING THE NAKYPLIAK RIGHT NOW.
YEAH.
I KNOW IT'S AFTER 6:00, BUT...
WELL, THE DAY JUST GOT AWAY FROM ME, YOU KNOW?
YEAH.
UH-HUH.
NO, I DON'T...
OH, DAMN IT!
( crying )
MOMMY DIDN'T MEAN IT. NO.
NO, EVERYTHING'S FINE.
KATE'S JUST A LITTLE CRANKY.
YEAH.
NO.
I'M FEELING BETTER.
YEAH.
THE INCISION'S HEALED.
OKAY, SWEETIE, OKAY.
SHH.
( alarm blaring )
OH, MY GOD.
( alarm stops )
( panting )
WHEN DID THE PAIN START?
A FEW MINUTES AGO.
HE'S HAVING DIFFICULTY BREATHING.
GET AN E.K.G.
( grunting )
MR. ROLLINS, WHERE DOES IT HURT?
YOU'D BETTER WATCH OUT.
WHAT?
YOU'D BETTER NOT CRY.
LET GO OF MY HAND.
* YOU'D BETTER NOT POUT, I'M TELLING YOU WHY *
NEVER MIND, KIT.
* SANTA CLAUS IS COMING TO TOWN... *
UNLESS YOU HAVE A LEGITIMATE MEDICAL PROBLEM...
I DO.
WHAT?
I'M BORED.
YEAH? WELL, AT LEAST YOU'RE STILL ALIVE.
OH, YOU MEAN UNLIKE THAT POOR WOMAN
THEY SAY I RAPED AND MURDERED?
WE BOTH KNOW THE TRUTH, DON'T WE?
MM-MM. I'M INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY
AND THE D.A. CAN'T PROVE JACK...
THANKS TO YOU.
IF I COULD DO THINGS AGAIN
BELIEVE ME, I WOULD.
NOW, YOU WOULD HAVE LET ME DIE?
WHERE'D YOU GET IT?
PATIENT GAVE IT TO ME FOR CHRISTMAS.
PRETTY. YEAH.
LUCY, GOT A GOOD CASE HERE.
VALERIE PAGE, 24, DILATED CARDIOMYOPATHY
RECENT PROGRESSION OF SYMPTOMS.
PALPITATIONS, DIFFICULTY BREATHING.
CARDIOLOGIST CHANGED HER MEDICATION TWO DAYS AGO.
THROWING P.V.C.s, SIX TO NINE PER MINUTE.
AND LIFT, GENTLY.
I'M ON THE HEART TRANSPLANT LIST.
OKAY, HOW SHOULD WE PROCEED?
CALL TRANSPLANT SERVICES, THEN...
RUN A FIVE.
LUCY, MULTIFOCAL P.V.C.s.
WHAT SHOULD WE DO?
GET THE VITALS.
B.P.'s 95/60. HEART RATE'S 110.
OKAY, B.P.'s STABLE-- SHE'S NOT HYPOTENSIVE
SO TREAT WITH LIDOCAINE? RIGHT. DO IT.
SHE'S IN V-TACH.
Lucy: GET THE PADDLES.
Weaver: NO, NO, NO, NO.
CHECK THE VITALS AGAIN.
B.P.'s 95/60. HEART RATE'S 160.
LUCY?
I DON'T KNOW.
75 OF LIDOCAINE
TWO MIG DRIP.
WITH NORMAL MENTATION
AND VITAL SIGNS, LIDOCAINE IS STILL
YOUR FIRST LINE OF TREATMENT.
IT'S NOT A GOOD IDEA TO SHOCK A PATIENT WHO'S WIDE AWAKE.
BACK TO NORMAL SINUS.
YOU FEELING BETTER?
YEAH.
I WASN'T PLANNING ON THIS FOR CHRISTMAS.
WE'LL JUST ALTER
YOUR MEDICATIONS AND MAYBE GET YOU HOME
IN TIME TO OPEN PRESENTS, OKAY?
Weaver: LUCY?
LILY, DRAW THE CARDIAC LABS.
CHUNY, ORDER AN ECHO.
CALL ME BACK WHEN YOU GET THE RESULTS.
YOU DO NOT KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT THIS CASE
TO MAKE THOSE KIND OF PROMISES.
HER MEDICATIONS WERE OFF.
TRUTH IS, THAT YOUNG LADY WILL BE LUCKY
IF SHE MAKES IT THROUGH THE NIGHT.
I DIDN'T REALIZE...
YEAH, AS A FOURTH-YEAR YOU'VE ACCUMULATED
A LOT OF MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE, NOW YOU HAVE TO APPLY IT.
GO BACK IN THERE, GET A THOROUGH HISTORY AND FIND OUT
WHAT YOU CAN DO FOR YOUR PATIENT.
HEY, WHAT'S WRONG?
NOTHING.
THANKS FOR COVERING THE TRANSPLANT SERVICE.
HAPPY TO WHEN IT MEANS
I CAN SPEND CHRISTMAS MORNING WITH REESE.
WELL, AT LEAST SOMEONE WILL BE ENJOYING THE HOLIDAY.
WHAT ABOUT YOU? NO PLANS?
JUST WORK. MARK'S IN SAN DIEGO HELPING HIS FATHER MOVE.
BUT WITH ROMANO SCARCE TILL THE MILLENNIUM
IT SEEMS LIKE A HOLIDAY, DOESN'T IT?
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT, IT DOES.
DR. CORDAY, DETECTIVE CRUSON IS ON THE PHONE FOR YOU.
I'VE GOT A CONSULT IN THE E.R.
CALL ME WHEN THAT APPY'S READY.
MM-HMM.
HELLO. THIS IS CORDAY.
YES.
YES, I JUST SAW MR. ROLLINS.
I SEE.
I DISCHARGED THE OTITIS IN EXAM THREE.
ONE DOWN, 30 TO GO.
WHOA, GEE!
THESE LIGHTS ARE A FIRE HAZARD.
IS IT ALWAYS THIS BUSY ON CHRISTMAS EVE?
LIKE THE MALLS THE DAY AFTER THANKSGIVING.
I NEED A BREAK, DR. WEAVER.
YEAH, WE ALL NEED A BREAK, AMIRA.
IT'S RAMADAN. I GOT TO PRAY.
OKAY. YOSH, COVER FOR HER, PLEASE.
WHAT'S IN YOUR BAG, SANTA?
SECRET SANTA GIFTS, IF YOU'VE BEEN GOOD
HEY, HAVE I GOTTEN YOURS YET?
IT'S IN MY SUITCASE.
I'LL GIVE IT TO YOU BEFORE I LEAVE.
ALL RIGHT.
OH, THANKS FOR ORGANIZING THIS.
ANYTHING TO HELP MAKE WORKING CHRISTMAS EVE
A LITTLE LESS PAINFUL.
DID I MENTION I WANTED A GAMEBOY?
YES. YES.
YOU KNOW, DR. WEAVER, IT'S NOT TOO LATE
TO GET IN ON THIS LITTLE GIFT EXCHANGE.
YOU KNOW WHAT, JOHN?
ACTUALLY THERE'S NOTHING THAT I REALLY NEED.
EXCUSE ME.
YES.
UH, GENTLEMEN, HOW CAN I HELP YOU?
NOW YOU NEED SOME SCRUBS.
THE CARDIOMYOPATHY WAS DIAGNOSED THREE YEARS AGO
RIGHT AFTER SHE GOT THE FLU ON HER 21st BIRTHDAY.
SOME BIRTHDAY PRESENT.
THERE'S DILATION OF ALL CHAMBERS
AND AN L.V. EJECTION FRACTION OF 10%.
HER PREVIOUS EJECTION FRACTION WAS 20.
DOESN'T THAT MEET THE CRITERIA TO UPGRADE HER FOR TRANSPLANT?
I'LL CALL UNOS AND TELL THEM TO MOVE HER STATUS TO LEVEL ONE.
DR. BENTON, THEY'RE READY FOR YOU IN THE O.R.
ALL RIGHT. TELL THEM I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.
MAKE SURE YOU GO OVER EVERYTHING WITH HER.
CALL RADIOLOGY, SEE IF THEY HAVE A BED, OKAY?
OKAY.
LEVEL ONE.
THAT MEANS THAT I'M A SHOO-IN, RIGHT?
WELL, THERE'S NO GUARANTEE
WHEN A NEW HEART WILL BECOME AVAILABLE.
A GIRL CAN DREAM.
YOU KNOW, I ALMOST WENT TO MED SCHOOL.
WHAT CHANGED YOUR MIND?
HOSPITALS SMELL.
I HEAR YOU.
I OPTED FOR A MASTER'S IN FINE ARTS INSTEAD.
I'M SUPPOSED TO GRADUATE IN JUNE.
REALLY?
ME, TOO.
I'M GOING TO DIE, AREN'T I?
IF YOU DON'T GET A NEW HEART... YEAH.
Santa: WE WENT OVER TO MARTY'S FOR SOME HOMEMADE EGGNOG
AND I HAVEN'T STOPPED PUKING SINCE.
HASN'T ANYONE EVERY WARNED YOU
ABOUT THE HAZARDS OF EATING RAW EGGS?
AT LEAST WE GOT TO FINISH OUR DELIVERIES.
YOU GUYS WORK FOR A CHARITY?
NO, JUST A BUNCH OF WALL STREET SHARKS--
LAWYERS, STOCK TRADERS.
WE TAKE GIFTS TO HOMELESS SHELTERS EVERY YEAR
TO KEEP US HUMAN.
YEAH, WE COULD USE A MRS. CLAUS TO ROUND OUT THE GROUP.
WELL, I COULD USE A GLASS OF WINE AND A HOT BATH.
DR. WEAVER AS MRS. CLAUS?
( laughs )
HOLD IT, CARTER.
COMPAZINE RECTAL SUPPOSITORIES FOR ALL THE SANTAS
AND REHYDRATE UNTIL SYMPTOMS SUBSIDE.
BAH HUMBUG.
IF YOU DON'T MIND ME SAYING, YOU LOOK LIKE HELL.
YEP. I'M MIDWAY THROUGH A DOUBLE SHIFT.
DREW THE SHORT END OF THE STICK?
NO, I VOLUNTEERED.
FIGURED I'D LET PEOPLE SPEND SOME TIME WITH THEIR FAMILIES.
CHAD?
CHAD? WHOA, WHOA, CHAD...
GET OFF OF ME.
TAKE IT EASY. WAIT, CHAD, CHAD...
IT'S DR. FINCH. WE'RE GOING TO HELP YOU.
WHAT HAPPENED?
HE TOOK A NASTY HEADER DOWN THE STAIRS.
WATCH HIS NECK. WATCH HIS NECK.
I THINK HE GOT HIS FOOT CAUGHT IN THE BANISTER.
DID HE EVER LOSE CONSCIOUSNESS?
UH, I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE.
HE'S PRETTY MESSED UP.
ON WHAT? ON WHAT?
I GOT TO GO. WAIT.
HANG IN THERE, DUDE.
YO, TONY!
CHAD, DO YOU HAVE ANY NECK PAIN?
DOES YOUR NECK HURT?
I'M FINE. I'M FINE.
GET A C-SPINE JUST IN CASE.
PUPILS EQUAL, REACTIVE TO LIGHT.
NO MIDLINE TENDERNESS.
B.P.'s 140/90, PULSE 68.
TALUS SHIFTED LATERALLY AND ROTATED.
I NEED TO REDUCE THE DEFORMITY.
OKAY, I NEED RIGHT ANKLE FILMS
AND A NON-CONTRAST C.T. TO RULE OUT A BLEED.
ALSO GET A B.A.L. AND TOX SCREEN.
I GOT IT.
AND CALL THE MOM. NAME'S KOTTMEIER.
PHONE NUMBER SHOULD BE IN THE OLD CHART.
YOU'RE HURTING ME. STOP HURTING ME.
IT'S OKAY, CHAD. YOU'RE GOING TO BE OKAY.
OUCH.
THAT IS A VERY DELICATE INJURY INDEED.
WE WERE AT THE MALL WAITING IN LINE TO SEE SANTA
AND TOMMY REALLY HAD TO GO.
I ALWAYS TELL HIM LOOK DOWN BEFORE YOU ZIP UP
BUT HE WAS IN A HURRY...
I WANT TO SEE SANTA.
I'M AFRAID THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO CUT IT OFF.
WHAT?! WHAT?!
THE ZIPPER-- I MEANT THE ZIPPER.
I'LL GET THE I AND D TRAY.
I WANT TO GO BACK TO THE MALL.
OKAY, TOMMY, I HAVE TO CLEAN THE AREA FIRST.
THIS MAY STING A LITTLE BIT.
OW!
WHOA. YOU WANT TO HOLD ON TO HIM? TIGHT?
ALL RIGHT, PICKUPS AND METZ.
GO AWAY!
I CAN'T WATCH.
OKAY, TOMMY, THIS IS GOING TO PINCH.
OUCH!
OW! OUCH!
ALL DONE.
ALL DONE.
IS HE GOING TO BE
YOU KNOW, OKAY DOWN THERE?
YEAH, ONCE THE INJURY HEALS, HE'S GOING TO BE AS GOOD AS NEW.
OKAY, TOMMY, IT'S ALL OVER.
SO BRAVE.
EXCUSE ME, DR. BENTON?
I'M IN THE MIDDLE OF AN APPY.
I CAN SEE THAT, BUT I'VE BEEN DOING SOME RESEARCH
ON VALERIE PAGE'S CONDITION...
WATCH THE STERILE FIELD.
AND I RAN ACROSS SOME ARTICLES
ON AN L-VAD-- LEFT VENTRICLE ASSIST DEVICE.
SPONGE STICK. WHAT ABOUT IT?
AN IMPLANTED DEVICE COULD KEEP
THE BLOOD PUMPING THROUGH HER BODY
UNTIL SHE CAN GET A TRANSPLANT.
NOT AN OPTION.
WHY NOT?
NO DEVICE. COUNTY ISN'T USING THAT YET.
LET ME GET A DRIVER ON A 2-0 SILK.
BUT WE'RE ABOUT TO, A CLINICAL TRIAL STARTS JANUARY FIRST.
THAT'S TWO WEEKS AWAY. HER HEART WON'T HOLD OUT THAT LONG.
WE CAN TRANSFER HER TO RUSH.
THEIR PROGRAM'S ALREADY UP AND RUNNING.
OKAY, TRY AND ARRANGE IT. LET ME KNOW.
THANKS, DR. BENTON.
HEY, DOC, YOU TAKING ME ON A TRIP?
YOU COULD SAY THAT.
WHAT'S HE DOING HERE?
YOU'RE BEING TRANSFERRED TO THE JAIL WARD.
THIS IS A JOKE, RIGHT?
WHAT, ARE YOU... YOU'RE GETTING BACK AT ME?
IT'S NO JOKE. THE POLICE HAVE FOUND EVIDENCE
LINKING YOU TO ANOTHER MURDER.
LOOK, WAIT A MINUTE. LOOK, STOP.
I SAID STOP.
PUT HIM IN RESTRAINTS!
YOU BITCH!
YOU CANNOT DO THIS TO ME!
OH, YES, I CAN!
SCREW YOU.
OW. OW.
OKAY, SPARE ME THE THEATRICS.
OW, MY LEG. MY LEG, IT'S CRAMPED.
YEAH, AND I'M THE QUEEN OF ENGLAND.
OW.
GOOD-BYE, MR. ROLLINS.
DAMN IT, IT HURTS.
DR. CORDAY, WAIT.
HIS RIGHT LEG IS A LITTLE DUSKY.
OH, GOD, IT'S LIKE SOMEBODY'S JABBING ME WITH NEEDLES.
HOW LONG HAVE YOU HAD THIS?
IT JUST STARTED.
I CAN'T FEEL A PEDAL PULSE.
HE HAS NO POPLITEAL PULSE EITHER.
WANT TO GET AN ANGIOGRAM?
I SUPPOSE SO.
WOULD YOU HURRY UP?
IT'S KILLING ME.
OH, SHUT UP!
EXCUSE ME.
FILL OUT A FORM...
TAKE A SEAT.
WELL, ACTUALLY, I WORK HERE.
HI, CAROL-- IT'S ABOUT TIME
YOU BROUGHT THOSE LITTLE BUNDLES OF JOY AROUND FOR A VISIT.
HI, HALEH.
IT'S AUNTIE HALEH. YES, IT IS.
I'M ACTUALLY NOT VISITING.
Marquez: LOOK AT THEM.
CAROL, THEY'RE ADORABLE.
LOOK AT YOU-- YOU'RE ALMOST
BACK TO YOUR FIGHTING WEIGHT.
HOLD IT, GUYS...
KATE'S NOT FEELING WELL
AND I JUST WANT TO HAVE HER CHECKED OUT.
IS THERE AN ATTENDING FREE?
LET'S FIND OUT.
WE'LL TAKE GOOD CARE OF HER.
DON'T WORRY.
I-I'M NOT WORRIED.
BUT SHE MAY NOT MAKE IT THROUGH THE NIGHT.
YEAH, YOU, TOO.
RUSH TURN YOU DOWN?
THEY CAN'T TAKE HER UNTIL TOMORROW MORNING.
NO CARDIAC BEDS.
CHRISTMAS MORNING. BUMMER.
CHUNY, WAIT. IS IT POSSIBLE TO GET SURGICAL EQUIPMENT
TRANSFERRED FROM OTHER HOSPITALS?
SURE. WE DO IT BETWEEN E.R.s ALL THE TIME.
WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO DO?
WELL, GET A TRANSFER FORM AND A DOCTOR'S SIGNATURE.
THE MALL'S CLOSED NOW.
IT'S NOT FAIR.
ONE MORE PIN SHOULD DO IT.
HO, HO, HO!
MERRY CHRISTMAS!
SANTA!
WHOA, CAREFUL DOWN THERE, LITTLE TOMMY.
COME ON UP HERE.
SANTA'S SO SORRY THAT HE MISSED YOU AT THE MALL.
BUT HE HEARS THAT YOU'VE BEEN A VERY GOOD BOY.
YOU'RE NOT SANTA.
OH.
SURE HE IS, SWEETHEART.
THE SANTA AT THE MALL WAS FAT AND WORE GLASSES.
THIS IS SANTA'S YOUNGER BROTHER.
GO AWAY.
TOMMY, STOP IT.
WELL, SANTA'S GOT A TOY IN HERE FOR YOU, TOMMY.
IT'S... OH! I WANT
THE REAL SANTA, THE ONE AT THE MALL.
OKAY, TOMMY, SANTA'S GOT TO GO NOW
BUT HE WANTS TO WISH YOU A VERY MERRY CHRISTMAS.
WHAT HAVE WE GOT?
YO, SANTA.
CARTER.
TAYLOR SPARKS, 15, G.S.W TO THE LEFT SHOULDER
DURING A DRIVE-BY.
VITALS STABLE, B.P.'s 140 OVER 90, PULSE 100.
HEY, DOG, GET THAT STUFF OUT OF MY FACE.
ABDOMEN'S BENIGN.
YOU REMEMBER HOW MANY SHOTS WERE FIRED?
THAT PUNK ASS LOHMAN EMPTIED A CLIP AT ME.
ALL RIGHT, LET'S ROLL HIM
SEE IF THERE ARE ANY OTHER ENTRY SITES.
TRAUMA PANEL... CHEST, AND LEFT SHOULDER.
BACK LOOKS CLEAR.
WHOA!
HO, HO, HO.
MALIK.
NOT EXACTLY THE PRESENT I HAD IN MIND.
HEY, FOOL, THAT'S MINE.
ALL RIGHT, ORDER A DOPPLER STUDY.
IF THE VESSELS ARE INTACT, WE'LL LEAVE THE BULLET IN.
HEY, GIVE ME BACK MY PIECE.
HEY, WHATEVER HAPPENED TO PEACE ON EARTH
GOODWILL TOWARDS MEN, HUH?
YOU TELL US, SANTA.
HEY, YOU'RE BEING A VERY, VERY GOOD GIRL.
TEMPERATURE'S 100.1.
IT WAS 99.8 WHEN I TOOK IT EARLIER.
WHEN WAS THAT?
2h HOURS AGO.
YOU WON'T BELIEVE HOW LONG IT TAKES US
TO GET US OUT OF THE HOUSE.
SHE CAN BE A LITTLE WARM FROM BEING ALL BUNDLED UP.
YOU THINK I'M BEING CRAZY, RIGHT?
NO, IT'S GOOD YOU BROUGHT HER IN.
I'M SURE IT'S NOTHING BUT, UH, A FEVER
IN A FOUR-WEEK-OLD CAN BE CAUSE FOR CONCERN.
EXACTLY. I KNOW ALL OF THE THINGS
THAT CAN GO WRONG, SO...
IF YOU'D LIKE, WE CAN DO A SEPTIC WORKUP.
IS THAT NECESSARY?
PROBABLY NOT, BUT, UH...
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO NEEDS
TO MAKE THAT DECISION FOR HER OWN PEACE OF MIND.
WELL, AS A NURSE,
I WOULD SAY NO.
AND AS A MOTHER?
UM, I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE EVERYTHING'S OKAY.
HOW ABOUT
WE GET A URINE AND C.B.C., BUT HOLD OFF ON AN L.P.
UNTIL WE GET THE LABS BACK, HUH?
I CAN LIVE WITH THAT-- I WANT YOU
TO DRAW HER BLOOD.
YOU'RE THE BEST STICK IN THE E.R.
I'LL BE NICE AND GENTLE.
OKAY.
HOW ARE YOU FEELING?
MY MOM HERE?
NOT YET.
CHAD, IS YOUR FATHER AROUND?
SURE. JUST SAW HIM YESTERDAY--
CHRISTMAS PHOTO OF HIM AND HIS NEW FAMILY
VACATIONING IN FLORIDA.
I'D LIKE TO CALL HIM, LET HIM KNOW WHAT'S
GOING ON WITH YOU. HE DOESN'T CARE.
ME AND MOM ARE BETTER OFF WITHOUT HIM ANYWAYS.
WHEN CAN I GO HOME?
WE'RE STILL WAITING ON SOME TEST RESULTS.
COME ON. IT'S CHRISTMAS.
CLEO?
DR. FINCH, HOW IS HE?
CHAD HAS A FRACTURED DISLOCATION OF THE RIGHT ANKLE
AND WE'RE WAITING ON A C.T. TO RULE OUT ANY HEAD TRAUMA.
OH, MY GOD.
I DON'T KNOW HOW THIS HAPPENED.
I THOUGHT HE WAS UPSTAIRS PLAYING VIDEO GAMES.
YOU WERE HOME?
I HAD SOME PEOPLE OVER, A SMALL HOLIDAY PARTY.
DID YOU HEAR CHAD FALL?
THERE WAS MUSIC PLAYING, PEOPLE TALKING.
MRS. KOTTMEIER, YOUR SON HAS A BLOOD ALCOHOL LEVEL OF .26.
WERE YOU AWARE HE WAS DRINKING?
NO.
ALL RIGHT, I LET HIM HAVE A BEER--
ONE BEER, THAT'S IT.
IT'S CHRISTMAS EVE, HE'S ON VACATION.
HE'S HAD MORE THAN ONE BEER.
WELL, MAYBE HE TOOK SOMETHING FROM THE BAR
WHEN I WASN'T LOOKING.
I GET IT.
YOU THINK THIS IS MY FAULT.
NO, I'M NOT TRYING TO PLACE BLAME...
NO, YOU'RE RIGHT. I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN WHAT WAS GOING ON.
I MEAN, WHAT KIND OF A MOTHER AM I?
WHY DON'T YOU GO IN TO SEE HIM.
WHAT DO WE GOT? HOWARD WALLER, 71, M.V.A-- ON HIS WAY TO MIDNIGHT MASS.
I HIT MARY. MARY?
AS IN THE VIRGIN MOTHER.
HE LOST CONTROL OF HIS CAR, ACCELERATED INTO A NATIVITY.
I THINK I PASSED OUT.
COMPLAINING OF BACK AND ABDOMINAL PAIN.
SLIGHTLY HYPOTENSIVE.
B.P. IS 100 OVER 60, PULSE 90
ALERT AND ORIENTED AT THE SCENE.
OKAY, PEOPLE, HERE WE GO, NICE AND EASY ON MY COUNT.
ONE... TWO... THREE.
TRAUMA PANEL, C-SPINE, CHEST, FILM, SPIN A CRIT.
OKAY, MR. WALLER
CAN YOU TELL ME EXACTLY WHERE THE PAIN IS?
IT'S AROUND MY BELT.
I ONLY WEAR THIS SUIT ONCE A YEAR.
IT DOESN'T FIT ME ANYMORE.
PULSE OX IS 95.
LET'S GET AN ULTRASOUND IN HERE.
FIND SOMETHING?
YEAH.
A TEN-CENTIMETER PULSATILE MASS
ON THE LEFT SIDE BELOW THE RIB.
COULD BE AN ANEURYSM.
MR. WALLER
THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE YOU'LL NEED SURGERY
TO REPAIR A LEAK IN YOUR AORTA.
IS THERE ANYONE YOU'D LIKE US TO CONTACT?
NO, THERE'S NO ONE.
CONNIE, CALL THE O.R.
TELL THEM TO PREP A ROOM NOW, PLEASE.
THERE'S A BLOCKAGE IN YOUR LEFT FEMORAL ARTERY.
A CLOT HAS FORMED
PREVENTING BLOOD FLOWING TO YOUR LEG.
THIS IS A POTENTIALLY LIFE-THREATENING CONDITION
THAT REQUIRES IMMEDIATE SURGERY.
I'M NOT LETTING YOU FIX ME UP
SO THEY CAN PUT ON TRIAL FOR SOME BOGUS CHARGES.
IF THE CHARGES ARE BOGUS, YOU'LL BE SET FREE.
WITHOUT SURGERY, YOU COULD DIE.
YEAH, WELL, I'LL TAKE MY CHANCES.
BESIDES, YOU KNOW, I LIKE IT HERE--
GOOD DRUGS, FOOD'S NOT HALF BAD.
AND I GET OFF JUST LOOKING AT YOU.
YOU KNOW, EVERY NIGHT
AFTER THE LIGHTS GO OUT, I LIE BACK...
AND THINK ABOUT YOU.
SO YOUR ANSWER'S "NO" TO SURGERY.
THAT'S RIGHT.
WELL, YOU'LL NEED TO SIGN A REFUSAL OF CONSENT.
WELL, BRING IT ON.
MERRY CHRISTMAS, DR. BENTON.
WHAT'S THAT?
SINCE I COULDN'T GET VALERIE PAGE TRANSFERRED TO RUSH
I HAD AN L-VAD TRANSFERRED HERE.
THAT'S A $50,000 DEVICE.
DON'T BE MAD, BUT I SIGNED YOUR NAME
AS THE AUTHORIZING PHYSICIAN. YOU DID WHAT?
YOU WERE IN THE MIDDLE OF SURGERY.
YOU SHOULD HAVE INTERRUPTED ME, YOU DID BEFORE.
BUT THERE WAS NO TIME.
I CAN'T DO IT. WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
YOU CAN'T DO IT RIGHT NOW? NO, I MEAN I CAN DO IT.
I'M NOT QUALIFIED TO DO AN L-VAD IMPLANTATION.
DR. ROMANO IS THE ONLY ONE, AND HE'S HOME FOR THE HOLIDAYS.
BUT THIS COULD SAVE HER LIFE.
I KNOW. LUCY, I'M NOT QUALIFIED.
I'M SORRY.
WHAT?
NOTHING.
HE'S IN V-FIB!
GRAB THE PADDLES.
CHARGE TO 100!
AND CLEAR!
200!
COME ON! COME ON!
IT'S NOT CHARGED YET.
AND CLEAR!
* WE WISH YOU A MERRY CHRISTMAS AND A HAPPY NEW YEAR *
CRANK IT TO 360! AND CLEAR!
* GOOD TIDINGS TO YOU WHEREVER YOU ARE *
HE'S BACK. HE'S BACK.
I SAW HER.
WHAT?
EDITH, MY WIFE.
I SAW HER.
SHE'S NOT HERE.
NO, I KNOW.
SHE'S DEAD, BUT I SAW HER.
I SAW HER.
HEARD ABOUT YOUR SANTA PERFORMANCE.
FIRST AND LAST.
IT'S MALIK'S GAMEBOY.
I DIDN'T WANT TO HEAR HIS GRIPING
IF HE DIDN'T GET IT.
YOU'RE A GOOD WOMAN, HALEH.
Hathaway: NO, MOM.
THERE'S NO NEED TO RUIN YOUR CHRISTMAS, TOO.
I GOT TO GO, OKAY?
BYE.
LUKA, ANY WORD ON KATE'S LABS?
YEAH, I WAS JUST LOOKING FOR YOU.
HER URINE IS NEGATIVE
AND WHITE COUNT IS BASICALLY NORMAL.
"BASICALLY"? WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
UH, THE DIFFERENTIAL SHOWS FIVE BANDS
BUT THAT'S STILL WITHIN THE NORMAL RANGE FOR HER AGE.
WELL, CAN'T THE LAB REPEAT THEM?
YEAH, BUT THAT WOULD MEAN STICKING KATE AGAIN, HUH?
CAN WE DO A MANUAL DIFF?
I WILL CALL THE LAB SUPERVISOR
TO SEE IF HE CAN SQUEEZE ONE IN, ALL RIGHT?
THANKS.
HOW ARE YOU HOLDING UP?
IN ALL HONESTY, I'M... EXHAUSTED.
I'M NOT SURPRISED.
YEAH, WELL, YOU KNOW
I CAN HANDLE 40 PATIENTS IN ONE SHIFT.
I CAN'T HANDLE TWO INFANTS.
WELCOME TO PARENTHOOD.
Lucy: MAYBE HE'S OUT OF TOWN.
Marquez: OR FAST ASLEEP.
DR. ROMANO. THIS IS, UH, LUCY KNIGHT.
FOURTH-YEAR MEDICAL STUDENT.
YES, I REALIZE THAT IT'S ALMOST MIDNIGHT, BUT...
NO, IT'S ABOUT A PATIENT.
YES, SIR, I UNDERSTAND THAT, BUT...
OKAY, IF I COULD JUST EX...
HELLO?
I WANT MY PIECE BACK.
YOUR GUN IS NOW THE PROPERTY OF THE CHICAGO POLICE.
THAT'S WHACK.
IT WAS A CHRISTMAS PRESENT FOR MY LITTLE BRO.
YOU WERE GOING TO GIVE HIM A GUN?
YEAH, DOC. COST ME SOME SERIOUS DOLLARS.
HOW MUCH?
$40. NOW, GIVE IT BACK.
I GAVE IT TO THE POLICE.
SO WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO GIVE MY LITTLE BROTHER?
HERE.
IT'S A GAMEBOY, WORTH AT LEAST TWICE THAT MUCH.
YOUR BROTHER WILL LOVE IT.
YEAH, WHATEVER.
MERRY CHRISTMAS!
Cleo: I APPRECIATE YOU COMING IN.
I FEEL CAUGHT BETWEEN A ROCK AND HARD PLACE ON THIS.
WELL, HOW SO?
IT OBVIOUS MRS. KOTTMEIER CARES ABOUT HER SON
BUT HE NEEDS MORE THAN THAT.
LISTEN, SHE'S AN ALCOHOLIC HERSELF.
STILL, HER ALCOHOLISM ONLY FACTORS IN
IF IT INTERFERES WITH HER ABILITY
TO PROVIDE FOR CHAD'S BASIC NEEDS.
WHAT IF SHE BUYS HIS ALCOHOL AND DRINKS WITH HIM?
DID HE SAY THAT TO YOU?
NO, SHE DID IN SO MANY WORDS.
PETER, DID YOU CONSENT MR. WALLER?
YEAH. WHY?
BETTER GET IN HERE.
PLEASE, NO SURGERY.
MR. WALLER, YOU HAVE A LIFE-THREATENING CONDITION.
I'M NOT AFRAID TO DIE.
I SAW EDITH.
HIS DEAD WIFE.
SHE'S WAITING FOR ME.
I SAW HER AT THE END OF A LONG TUNNEL.
AND THERE WAS THIS BRILLIANT WHITE LIGHT?
YES. IT WAS SO PEACEFUL.
WHAT YOU EXPERIENCED WAS AN HALLUCINATION
DUE TO AN ENDORPHIN RELEASE
WHILE UNDER SEVERE PHYSICAL STRESS.
NO, IT WAS REAL.
IF THIS ISN'T HAPPENING, I HAVE A PAIN CONSULT TO DO.
SIR, IF YOU DON'T HAVE SURGERY
YOU PROBABLY WON'T LIVE THROUGH THE NIGHT.
THAT MEANS EDITH AND I CAN SPEND CHRISTMAS TOGETHER.
I'M SORRY.
I REALLY TRIED.
I KNOW.
TRUST ME. IF THERE WAS ANYTHING ELSE I COULD DO
I WOULD DO IT.
DON'T WORRY.
I PLAN ON BEATING THIS THING...
WITH OR WITHOUT SOME... STUPID DEVICE.
( panting )
GET SOME REST.
KEEP YOUR STRENGTH UP.
HEY.
MERRY CHRISTMAS.
MERRY CHRISTMAS, VALERIE.
BREAST-FEEDING WAS SO DIFFICULT AT FIRST.
I FELT LIKE THIS COW WITH THESE HUGE UDDERS.
YOU LOOKED LIKE A NATURAL TO ME.
YEAH, WELL, BEING THAT I DO IT EVERY THREE HOURS.
WHEN DO YOU SLEEP, GIRL?
OH, SORRY.
NO, THAT'S OKAY.
THE KITCHEN IS NOW CLOSED.
AND AUNTIE HALEH SHOULD GET BACK TO WORK.
MAY I?
THANKS FOR THE CHAIR.
O.B. WON'T MISS IT.
OKAY.
THE MANUAL DIFF CAME BACK.
KATE'S WHITE COUNT IS NORMAL.
OH, THAT'S GREAT.
DO YOU HEAR THAT, SWEET PEA?
YOU'RE GOING TO BE OKAY.
PROBABLY JUST A VIRUS.
NOT TOO SURPRISING, THIS TIME OF YEAR.
I'M SORRY IF I'VE BEEN...
WHAT, A GOOD PARENT?
NO, I WAS GOING TO SAY DIFFICULT.
WELL, SAME THING.
OH...
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT'S 2:00 A.M.
YEAH. IT'S CHRISTMAS.
THAT'S RIGHT.
IT'S CHRISTMAS.
I ADMITTED HIM TO I.C.U.
DONALD, I SAW YOUR NAME ON THE BOARD.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE THIS TIME OF NIGHT?
I HAD A GASTROENTERITIS
TURN INTO AN ISCHEMIC BOWEL ON ME.
MERRY CHRISTMAS.
SO, PETER, SHALL WE INCLUDE ELIZABETH
IN ON YOUR DILEMMA?
I'VE GOT A TRIPLE-A PATIENT WHO REFUSES TO HAVE SURGERY
BECAUSE HE BELIEVES HE SAW HIS DEAD WIFE
WAITING FOR HIM ON THE OTHER SIDE.
THAT'S FUNNY.
I HAVE A PATIENT REFUSING SURGERY AS WELL
EXCEPT MINE IS THE DEVIL INCARNATE.
DEAN ROLLINS?
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED, GOOD RIDDANCE.
WHO MADE YOU JUDGE AND JURY?
DONALD, YOU HAVE NO IDEA
HOW DESPICABLE THIS MAN IS.
OH, I'M SURE I DON'T
BUT BEING A DOCTOR ISN'T ABOUT YOUR PERSONAL FEELINGS.
SO, LET'S GET BACK TO YOUR PATIENT.
WELL, I TRIED TALKING TO HIM.
HE WON'T LISTEN.
BUT DID YOU LISTEN?
YOU KNOW, THIS MAN IS PROBABLY FRIGHTENED
AND THINKING THAT HE SAW HIS DEAD WIFE
MAKES HIM FEEL LESS SO.
IF HE THOUGHT THAT YOU UNDERSTOOD THAT
MAYBE HE'D BE MORE RECEPTIVE TO WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY.
BUT, ULTIMATELY, IT'S THE PATIENT'S CHOICE.
OF COURSE.
BUT WE MUST OFFER TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN
TO KEEP THEM ALIVE.
( pounding )
Man: OKAY!
OKAY, YOU CAN STOP NOW!
YOU GOT MY ATTENTION!
BEFORE YOU SAY ANYTHING
I'VE THOUGHT OF AT LEAST A DOZEN REASONS
WHY I SHOULDN'T BE DOING THIS--
UH, NOT THE LEAST OF WHICH IS RUINING MY CAREER.
WELL, I'D LOVE TO HEAR THE OTHERS
BUT SINCE THE POLICE ARE ON THEIR WAY...
I HAVE A PATIENT, VALERIE PAGE, 24 YEARS OLD
DYING OF CARDIOMYOPATHY.
SHE'S ON THE U.N.O.S. LIST
BUT AN L-VAD COULD BUY HER VALUABLE TIME.
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK I GIVE A RAT'S ASS?
I'M SORRY.
WHAT WAS I THINKING, COMING TO YOU?
A SEASONED DOCTOR WHO SUPPOSEDLY HAS DEDICATED
HIS ENTIRE LIFE TO HELPING PEOPLE
WHILE I'M JUST A PUNY MEDICAL STUDENT WHO WAS STUPID ENOUGH
TO THINK SHE COULD ACTUALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE...
MS. KNIGHT.
WHAT DO YOU WANT?
I WANT YOU TO HELP MY PATIENT.
I WANT YOU TO HELP ME.
LOOKING FOR THE FAT DUDE IN THE RED SUIT.
THERE'S A LOT OF THEM AROUND HERE. WHICH ONE?
THE ONE GIVING UP THE GAME BOYS.
AH, CHUNY. I GOT THIS.
HI.
WE HEARD YOU WAS GIVING UP GAME BOYS FOR GATS.
AH. UH, WELL, THAT'S NOT EXACTLY TRUE.
I MEAN, IT HAPPENED ONCE
BUT THAT WAS SORT OF A UNIQUE SITUATION.
WE OUT OF HERE.
WELL, WAIT, UH... DOES IT HAVE TO BE GAMEBOYS?
HEY, VIVIAN.
I'M LOOKING FOR MY TRIPLE-A--
THE GUY WHO SAW HIS DEAD WIFE.
HOWARD WALLER?
MM-HMM.
OVER THERE.
HE DIED?
CODED LESS THAN AN HOUR AGO.
( sighs )
YOU MISS ME?
I'M CURIOUS ABOUT SOMETHING.
ME, TOO.
ARE YOU A NATURAL REDHEAD?
I'D LIKE TO SEE FOR MYSELF.
I FIND IT FASCINATING
THAT YOU'RE WILLING TO END UP A VEGETABLE
FOR THE REST OF YOUR MISERABLE LIFE
JUST TO WIN A PISSING CONTEST.
WELL, THAT'S ONE CONTEST WITH YOU I'M SURE I CAN WIN.
IF YOU DON'T HAVE SURGERY
THE FLESH ON YOUR LEG WILL BEGIN TO ROT
AND BECOME PAINFULLY INFECTED
PROBABLY GANGRENOUS.
OH, YOU'RE SCARING ME, DOC.
NEXT, YOU'LL GO INTO SEPTIC SHOCK
WHICH WILL DROP YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE SO LOW
YOU'LL HAVE A MASSIVE STROKE.
YOU'LL WIND UP DROOLING IN YOUR FOOD
WEARING DIAPERS...
RATHER LIKE THAT PATHETIC CREATURE OVER THERE--
EXCEPT, OF COURSE, YOU'LL ONLY HAVE ONE LEG
BECAUSE THEY'LL BE FORCED TO AMPUTATE.
BUT YOU'LL HAVE WON, DEAN ROLLINS.
NOW, IS THAT REALLY THE BEST YOU CAN DO?
I'M TELLING YOU THE TRUTH.
IF YOU CHOOSE NOT TO BELIEVE ME
YOU'LL HAVE NO ONE TO BLAME BUT YOURSELF.
YOU DO CARE ABOUT ME... DON'T YOU?
AS YOUR DOCTOR, I DO.
NO, NOT AS A DOCTOR...
AS A WOMAN.
SAY IT.
SAY IT.
I CARE.
THEN LET'S DO IT.
CRAPPY GENERATOR.
I'M GOING TO GIVE THAT AMISH SALESMAN A PIECE OF MY MIND.
WHAT DO YOU NEED A GENERATOR FOR?
TEOTWAKI.
THE END OF THE WORLD AS WE KNOW IT.
AH, Y2K.
DAMN COMPUTERS RULE OUR LIVES.
IT DOESN'T TAKE A GENIUS TO REALIZE WE'RE DOOMED.
OKAY, COME WITH ME FOR AFTERCARE INSTRUCTIONS.
YOU'LL WANT TO CHANGE THAT DRESSING IN 24 HOURS.
HAVEN'T THEY FIXED MOST OF THE Y2K GLITCHES?
ONLY TAKES ONE PEBBLE TO SEND RIPPLES ACROSS AN ENTIRE POND.
AND YOU CAN BET THIS PLACE WILL BE A DEATHTRAP.
OKAY, I ASSURE YOU, MR. THORPE
THE HOSPITAL'S MAINFRAME HAS BEEN
THOROUGHLY Y2K INSPECTED.
AND THEY CHECKED THE INTERFACE
WITH YOUR FRONT-END TERMINALS?
I-I DON'T KNOW.
( chuckling )
COME ON. I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU
HOW WELL YOU'VE BEEN INSPECTED.
CHAD, YOUR C.T. CAME BACK NEGATIVE
WHICH MEANS NO INJURY TO YOUR BRAIN.
( sighing ): THANK GOD.
SO I CAN GO HOME NOW?
I'M AFRAID NOT.
I'VE MADE ARRANGEMENTS FOR YOU TO BE PLACED
IN AN ALCOHOL TREATMENT PROGRAM
HERE IN THE HOSPITAL.
YOU DID WHAT?
YOU CAN'T MAKE ME STAY HERE.
AS YOUR DOCTOR, IT'S MY DUTY
TO LOOK OUT FOR YOUR WELL-BEING AND SAFETY.
MOM...
PLEASE, DR. FINCH, DON'T DO THIS TO US.
I'LL TRY HARDER, REALLY.
CHAD WAS LUCKY THIS TIME, WHAT ABOUT THE NEXT?
I WON'T GET DRUNK AGAIN. I KNOW YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME
BUT THIS IS FOR YOUR OWN GOOD.
I JUST WANT TO GO HOME.
PLEASE, DR. FINCH, I'M BEGGING YOU--
DON'T TAKE HIM AWAY FROM ME.
IT'S CHRISTMAS, FOR GOD'S SAKES.
WHICH PUTS CHAD AT AN EVEN GREATER RISK.
HE'S OUT OF SCHOOL, HE'S PARTYING WITH FRIENDS...
I PROMISE I WON'T DRINK AGAIN.
I PROMISE.
PLEASE.
IT'S ALL RIGHT, SWEETHEART.
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
NOW GO TO THE "MONTH" PULL-DOWN
AND CHANGE IT TO JANUARY 2000.
HIT "APPLY," THEN "OKAY."
DONE.
OKAY. NOW TRY TO RETRIEVE MY MEDICAL CHART.
OKAY, MR. THORPE, I'M SURE WE WILL CONVINCE YOU
THAT WE RUN A TIGHT SHIP HERE AT COUNTY.
NO RECORDS FOUND
FOR DECEMBER 25, 1900.
1900? WHAT-WHAT DID YOU DO?
TIGHT SHIP.
THAT'S WHAT THEY SAID ABOUT THE TITANIC.
AMIRA, GET TECH SUPPORT DOWN HERE!
I'M GETTING OUT OF HERE WHILE I CAN.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, YOU GAVE IT AWAY?
IT WAS FOR A GOOD CAUSE.
THAT WAS MY SECRET SANTA GIFT.
I'LL GET YOU ANOTHER ONE.
I'M ALREADY GETTING CLEO A DISCMAN AND CONNIE A BLENDER.
THESE GUYS WILL TAKE YOU FOR A RIDE.
THERE'S FOUR LESS GUNS ON THE STREET.
THEY CAN TAKE ME FOR ANY RIDE THEY WANT.
CARTER, THERE'S A HORDE OF TROUBLEMAKERS IN CHAIRS
ASKING FOR YOU.
SOMETHING ABOUT GIFTS FOR GUNS?
THANKS, HALEH.
YOU'RE STILL HERE. WHERE'S HER MOM?
TRY EXAM TWO. THANKS.
CONNIE, KEEP EXAM TWO CLEAR
FOR A WHILE, OKAY?
SURE THING. THANKS.
OH, I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS HOSPITAL
DOESN'T HAVE 24-HOUR TECH SUPPORT.
ROMANO'S DEFINITELY GETTING A MEMO ABOUT THIS.
IT'S CHRISTMAS, KERRY.
YEAH, WHICH MEANS THAT Y2K IS SEVEN DAYS AWAY--
ALL THE MORE REASON THAT THEY SHOULD BE HERE.
COMPUTER PROBLEMS?
THE DAMN THING CRASHED ON ME.
I CAN'T GET LABS, I CAN'T GET MEDICAL RECORDS.
I GOT MY START IN TECH SUPPORT.
MIND IF I TAKE A LOOK?
NO. NO, THAT'S HOW I GOT INTO TROUBLE IN THE FIRST PLACE.
WELL, YOUR TERMINAL LOOKS CURRENT.
UH, IT'S A SOFTWARE PROBLEM.
I CAN DOWNLOAD A Y2K PATCH.
THAT OUGHT TO DO THE TRICK.
I GUESS YOU CAN'T MAKE THINGS ANY WORSE.
Corday: I FEEL THE CATHETER SLIDING.
THERE'S SOME MINOR RESISTANCE.
I'LL GIVE YOU SUCTION.
IT'D BE SO EASY FOR ME TO JUST SLIP.
HMM, AT LEAST HE'S GOING TO HAVE TO STAND TRIAL.
OKAY, I'VE GOT THE CLOT.
SHIRLEY, CHECK THE FOOT.
( pager beeping )
911 PAGE TO O.R. THREE?
WHAT THE HELL IS ROMANO DOING HERE?
Shirley: I FEEL A PULSE.
Corday: GOOD. LET'S GET AN ANGIO OF THE LEG.
CHECK THERE ARE NO TEARS IN THE ARTERY.
CAN YOU FINISH?
I'VE COME THIS FAR. GO.
Romano: HOW DO WE CHECK
FOR VENTRICULAR DECOMPRESSION
ONCE A DEVICE IS ACTIVATED?
WITH A TRANSESOPHAGEAL ECHO
YOU SHOULD SEE THE BOWING OF THE SEPTUM.
FOURTH YEAR, HUH? NOT BAD.
WELL, IT'S NICE TO SEE
THAT WHEN THE CAT'S AWAY, THE MOUSE STILL JUMPS.
WHAT'S GOING ON?
JUST TEACHING MS. KNIGHT
THE FINER POINTS OF AN L-VAD IMPLANTATION.
FROM NOW ON, I THINK I'M ONLY GOING
TO DO FAVORS FOR THE PEOPLE
WHO COME BEGGING AT MY DOORSTEP.
WHICH LEADS ME TO ASK, PETER, WHY WASN'T IT YOU?
I NEVER EVEN CONSIDERED IT.
O, YE OF LITTLE FAITH.
I AGAIN WANT TO TELL YOU
HOW MUCH I APPRECIATE YOU DOING THIS.
THAT'S ENOUGH SUCKING UP, LUCY.
CUT PLEASE.
WELL, THAT'LL BE ALL, PETER.
I'D LIKE TO SCRUB IN.
SORRY, PETER, YOU DIDN'T EARN THIS ONE.
I'D STILL LIKE TO HELP.
MS. KNIGHT, WHAT DO YOU THINK?
I THINK VALERIE CAN USE ALL THE HELP SHE CAN GET.
THE '60s WERE
FROM 1961 TO 1970.
WHAT ABOUT 1960?
THAT WAS THE LAST YEAR OF THE '50s.
WHICH MEANS THE NEW MILLENNIUM REALLY STARTS IN 2001.
THEN WHY AM I SPENDING HALF MY PAYCHECK
ON NEW YEAR'S EVE PLANS?
YOU AND THE REST OF THE WORLD.
HEY, SLEEPING BEAUTY.
WOW. GOD, THAT FELT GREAT.
HOW LONG WAS I OUT?
ABOUT FOUR HOURS.
IT FELT LIKE DAYS.
WHERE ARE THE KIDS?
ASLEEP IN THE PEDES ROOM.
YOSH IS ON DUTY.
OH, GOD, I SO APPRECIATE YOU GUYS HELPING ME OUT.
HEY, WHAT ARE FRIENDS FOR?
CHRISTMAS COOKIE?
YEAH, I'M FAMISHED.
CAROL, I HEARD ABOUT KATE.
IS SHE OKAY?
OH, SHE'S FINE. THANKS.
GOOD.
WHERE YOU OFF TO?
INDIANAPOLIS TO SEE THE FAMILY.
DID THEY TAKE THE KOTTMEIER BOY UPSTAIRS?
A FEW MINUTES AGO.
OKAY.
MERRY CHRISTMAS, KWANZA, ALL THAT.
BYE.
SAFE TRAVEL.
I'M SORRY I CAN'T FIT YOU AND THE GIRLS IN MY TWO-SEATER.
HALEH, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
YOU'VE DONE ENOUGH FOR US ALREADY.
CAROL, I CAN GIVE YOU A RIDE.
SINCE WHEN DO YOU OWN A CAR?
SINCE I SOLD MY BOAT.
WELL, THANK YOU
BUT, WITH THE GIRLS ASLEEP, I'D HATE TO...
LOOK WHO'S UP.
OH, COME HERE, SWEETHEART.
I KNOW.
ALL RIGHT, I'M GOING TO GO GET OUR STUFF.
YES, YES, YES.
THAT'S QUITE AN ARSENAL.
YEAH, AFTER I GAVE AWAY ALL THE SECRET SANTA GIFTS
I STARTED WRITING CHECKS.
WELL, CALL THE POLICE DEPARTMENT--
HAVE AN OFFICER COME BY TO PICK THEM UP.
I ALREADY DID.
DOUBLE TRAUMA AT THE BACKDOOR.
17-YEAR-OLD, DRIVE-BY VICTIM, SINGLE G.S.W. TO THE THIGH.
B.P IS 130 OVER 90, PULSE 110.
NAME IS HANK LOHMAN.
DID YOU SAY LOHMAN?
CARTER, TAKE THE NEXT ONE.
SCOOP AND RUN 7-YEAR-OLD
GUNSHOT WOUNDS TO THE CHEST AND ABDOMEN.
HAD A PULSE IN THE FIELD, LOST IT EN ROUTE.
GOOD E.T. TUBE PLACEMENT.
WHAT HAPPENED?
KID WAS OPENING UP HIS PRESENTS
TOOK A BULLET AIMED AT HIS NEIGHBOR--
GUY THEY JUST BROUGHT IN.
SONS OF BITCHES.
LET'S HANG TWO UNITS OF O-NEG ON THE RAPID INFUSER
AND PREP FOR A THORACOTOMY.
HE'S IN FINE V-FIB.
CAN I HAVE SOME STERILE GLOVES?
PUPILS ARE FIXED AND DILATED.
ALL RIGHT, LET'S PREP HIS CHEST.
OH, MY GOD.
WHERE'S THE BLOOD COMING FROM?
THEY SHOT HIM IN THE HEAD.
HOW YOU DOING?
FULL TRAUMATIC ARREST.
THORACOTOMY TRAY'S READY.
CHEST IS PREPPED.
THERE'S GRAY MATTER ALL OVER THIS BACKBOARD.
HE'S DEAD.
Romano: OKAY, THE PUMP IS DE-AIRED.
DECREASE BYPASS FLOW TO TWO LITERS PER MINUTE.
Romano: START THE L-VAD.
UH, FIXED MODE 20 CYCLES PER MINUTE.
THE MOMENT OF TRUTH.
( loud, rhythmic clicking )
IT WORKS.
YOU'RE SURPRISED?
Lucy: IT'S SO LOUD.
HOW'S SHE GOING TO SLEEP AT NIGHT?
Romano: OH, SHE'LL GET USED TO IT.
JUST LIKE HEARING THE BEATING OF YOUR OWN HEART.
OKAY, PUMP IS FILLING NICELY.
HEY, PETER, ISN'T THAT YOUR MUNCHKIN OUT THERE?
OH, YEAH.
UH, YOU MIND IF I SCRUB OUT?
OH, FIRST, YOU WANT IN, THEN YOU WANT OUT.
YEAH, YEAH. I KNOW, I KNOW.
IT'S CHRISTMAS.
GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE.
MS. KNIGHT, CARE TO HELP ME CLOSE?
SURE.
IF YOU FEEL YOU'RE UP TO IT.
ABSOLUTELY.
HEY, LOOK, I KNOW I WAS SUPPOSED
TO PICK HIM UP EARLIER, BUT THIS SURGERY CAME UP.
HEY.
SAVE IT, PETER.
IT'S NOTHING I HAVEN'T HEARD BEFORE.
CARLA, YOU KNOW IT IS THE HOLIDAYS.
WE COULD AT LEAST TRY... TO BE CIVIL.
YOU WANT CIVIL?
FINE.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR RUINING MY LIFE.
AND WHAT IS THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?
ROGER AND I AREN'T MOVING TO GERMANY ANYMORE.
WHAT?
WHEN ROGER ASKED FOR TIME OFF
FOR THE CUSTODY TRAIL
HIS BOSS DECIDED HE WASN'T PROMOTION MATERIAL AFTER ALL.
UM... I...
LOOK, CARLA, I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.
I'M SURE YOU DON'T.
LOOK, OKAY, I'M SORRY ABOUT ROGER'S JOB
BUT, NO, I'M NOT SORRY
THAT REESE GETS TO STAY HERE WITH BOTH HIS PARENTS.
WHATEVER, PETER.
YOU WON.
MERRY CHRISTMAS.
HEY, AMIRA, I'M EXPECTING AN OFFICER TO STOP BY.
HOW ABOUT, UH, THAT ONE?
HEY, WHAT HAPPENED?
GOT ONE PUNK SHOT ANOTHER PUNK
TOOK OUT A LITTLE KID IN THE PROCESS.
CAUGHT THIS COWARD FLEEING THE SCENE.
HE'S GOT A NASTY CUT ON HIS HEAD.
WHAT?
YOU THOUGHT I COULDN'T SCORE ANOTHER PIECE?
YOU WANT A GUN?
HERE, I GOT GUNS.
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE YOUR PICK?
YOU JUST PULL THE TRIGGER AND BANG!
SEVEN-YEAR-OLD'S BRAINS GET SPLATTERED ALL OVER THE WALL.
HEY, CARTER!
WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING, JOHN?
MERRY CHRISTMAS!
WE'LL SEE HOW LONG THIS LASTS.
THEY HAD QUITE A NIGHT.
THEIR FIRST CHRISTMAS EVER.
IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE.
IT ONLY HAPPENS ONCE.
ENJOY IT.
LUKA, WAIT. HMM.
DO YOU HAVE CHRISTMAS PLANS?
OH, LIKE THOSE TWO OVER THERE-- SLEEP.
WHY DON'T YOU STAY FOR SOME EGGNOG?
IT'S THE LEAST I CAN DO.
AND END UP LIKE THOSE SANTAS?
I DON'T THINK SO.
IT'S TRADITION.
OH, WHAT'S IN THAT EGGNOG EXACTLY?
EGGS, SUGAR
MILK, RUM...
RUM?
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I SUPPOSE I CAN RISK IT, HUH?
OKAY.
NEXT FEW DAYS, A BLAND DIET--
CLEAR FLUIDS, RICE, BREAD, THOSE THINGS LIKE THAT.
HEY, COMPUTER RUNNING OKAY?
OH, YES, AND THANK YOU.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR HELP.
I APPRECIATE IT.
SANTA ALWAYS AIMS TO PLEASE.
SAY, YOU WOULDN'T KNOW A PLACE
TO GET BLAND FOOD AROUND HERE?
AH, WELL, DOC MAGOO'S IS RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET
AND YOU CAN'T GET MUCH BLANDER THAN THAT.
THEY OPEN ON CHRISTMAS?
YEAH, ALWAYS OPEN, JUST LIKE US.
WELL, SOUNDS PERFECT.
THANKS.
DR. WEAVER.
HMM?
CARE TO JOIN US?
WELL... I...
MY TREAT.
UM...
FREE BLAND FOOD.
SURE.
Weaver: SO, YOU, UH, WORK
WITH COMPUTERS, HUH?
YEAH, I OWN MY OWN SOFTWARE COMPANY.
JUST WENT PUBLIC.
REALLY.
I'M ALWAYS LOOKING FOR INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES.
OH.
SINCE WE SPLIT THE BREAST BONE
YOUR CHEST WILL HURT FOR QUITE A FEW WEEKS.
THAT'S A SMALL PRICE TO PAY.
SO, HOW'S OUR LOVELY PATIENT?
SHE'S DOING GREAT.
PRESSURE'S UP.
KIDNEY FUNCTION'S IMPROVING.
GOOD. CARRY ON.
I'M GOING BACK FROM WHENCE I CAME HERE.
OH, BY THE WAY, MS. KNIGHT
YOU'LL HAVE TO COME BY MY OFFICE
SOMETIME NEXT WEEK TO DISCUSS SUITABLE DISCIPLINARY ACTION.
NOTHING PERSONAL
BUT I DO HAVE A REPUTATION TO MAINTAIN.
WHAT WAS THAT ALL ABOUT?
NOTHING.
I CANNOT THANK YOU ENOUGH, DR. KNIGHT.
I'M NOT A DOCTOR YET.
YOU ARE TO ME.
GOD, I AM SO TIRED.
