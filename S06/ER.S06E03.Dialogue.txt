HI. I'M HERE TO SEE DR. WEAVER.
SHE WENT THAT WAY, HANDING OUT BADGES.
EXCUSE ME?
"CREATIVITY, ACCOUNTABILITY
RESPECT... EXCELLENCE."
HMM... THAT'S A LOT TO LIVE UP TO.
MALIK? YEAH.
THIS GENTLEMAN'S LOOKING FOR DR. WEAVER.
OH, STEP THIS WAY. I'M DYING HERE.
YOU'RE GONNA BE ALL RIGHT. HAVE A SEAT RIGHT HERE.
THIS GUY'S GOT A CUT ON HIS ARM.
"CUT"? THE BITCH STABBED ME. WHAT'D SHE STAB YOU WITH?
A CARVING KNIFE, AS IF I WAS A STEAK OR SOMETHING. LEMME SEE.
( all yelling )
THERE GOES THE ULNAR. OH, I'M SORRY.
Man: YOU'RE KILLING ME. JUST BREATHE. I'M SORRY.
SIT DOWN, PLEASE.
WHOA, GET DOWN. HOLD STILL. HOLD STILL.
DON'T BE SUCH A BABY. Lucy: WE CAN'T HELP...
LOOK AT ME. LOOK ME IN THE EYE. HOLD STILL.
ARE YOU A DOCTOR? JUST KEEP THE PRESSURE ON.
HERE, WE'LL USE THIS TO MAKE A TOURNIQUET.
PUT HIS ARM OUT. PUT YOUR ARM OUT.
ALL RIGHT. COME ON AROUND THIS SIDE.
PUMP IT UP TO 180. OKAY.
KEEP BREATHING. JUST RELAX YOUR ARM.
OKAY, 180. OKAY.
ALL RIGHT, TAKE YOUR HAND OFF.
( gasping )
HMM.
"CREATIVITY"-- THAT'S WHAT IT SAYS ON YOUR BADGE.
WHO ARE YOU? GABE, I'M SORRY I'M LATE.
OH, MY GOD, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? OF COURSE.
BUT GET ME A COUPLE OF CURVED KELLYS AND SOME 3-0 VICRYL, I'LL BE EVEN BETTER.
( laughing ): IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU. EXCUSE ME.
LUCY, THIS IS DR. GABRIEL LAWRENCE
AND HE'S OUR NEW ATTENDING. HOW DO YOU DO?
Kerry: MARK!
I KNOW. I'M LATE.
I WANT YOU TO MEET GABE LAWRENCE.
HI. GABE, THIS IS DR. MARK GREENE.
DR. LAWRENCE. IT'S A PLEASURE TO MEET YOU.
I'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT YOU.
DON'T HOLD IT AGAINST ME. YOU IN AN ACCIDENT?
NO, NO. I STARTED MY SHIFT A LITTLE EARLY.
I'M SORRY?
GABE IS COMING OVER FROM NEW WESTERN AS OUR NEW ATTENDING.
AS OUR NEW ATTENDING.
WE'RE INCREDIBLY LUCKY TO HAVE HIM, DON'T YOU THINK?
ABSOLUTELY. WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THE GRAND TOUR.
WOULD YOU LIKE TO COME? I'VE DONE THE GRAND TOUR.
I'M GOING TO GET THIS. WHAT DO YOU GOT, DORIS?
A 28-YEAR-OLD FELL OFF HIS BIKE.
HE PASSED OUT FOR TWO MINUTES. SMALL CONTUSIONS TO HIS FOREHEAD.
VITALS ARE STABLE.
REESE MIGHT NOT BE YOURS. THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID.
THINK SHE'S LYING? I DON'T KNOW.
I WASN'T WITH HER 24 HOURS A DAY, YOU KNOW?
OH, MAN, OH, MAN, OH, MAN. SHE'S GOING TO USE THIS AGAINST ME, ISN'T SHE?
SHE CAN'T. IF CARLA HAD ANY DOUBTS
SHE'D HAVE RAISED THEM IN THE PETITION TO DETERMINE
PARENTAGE THREE MONTHS AGO. SHE DIDN'T, SO IT'S MOOT. IT'S NOT A PROBLEM.
YOU PUT YOURSELF THROUGH A HELL OF A LOT FOR THIS.
MAYBE YOU SHOULD MAKE SURE HE'S YOURS-- DO A DNA TEST.
NO.
PETER, YOU HIRED ME TO PROTECT YOUR INTERESTS.
IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A WAY OUT, SHE JUST GAVE YOU ONE.
( groans )
( door bangs open )
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO INTUBATE.
OKAY, EVERYBODY, ON MY COUNT. ONE, TWO, THREE... GOOD.
WHAT DO WE GOT?
GOT A 16-YEAR-OLD MALE SINGLE G.S.W. TO THE LEFT CHEST.
I'M GOING TO PUT IN A CHEST TUBE. CAN YOU INTUBATE?
I CAN MANAGE. 15 OF ETOMIDATE, 100 OF SUX, NUMBER EIGHT E.T. TUBE.
HELP ME. TEN BLADE.
IT'S OKAY. YOU'RE GONNA BE OKAY. WHAT'S HIS NAME?
JOSHUA FOX. THAT'S I.D. HE HAD.
OKAY, JOSHUA,
THEY'RE GONNA PUT A TUBE DOWN YOUR THROAT TO HELP YOU BREATHE.
HALEH, CAN YOU CALL HIS FAMILY? OFF A VIDEO CARD?
IT'S ALL WE'VE GOT. PULSE OX 92, THORASEAL'S READY.
ALL RIGHT, HOOK ME UP.
LIZZIE, WHAT'S THIS ABOUT A RESCHEDULED SURGERY THIS AFTERNOON?
GOT A CANCELLATION, SO I MOVED UP A MASTECTOMY.
YOU CAN MOVE IT BACK DOWN. I'VE GOT AN ELECTIVE HERNIA.
I'M SORRY. I'M NOT TORTURING A WOMAN FOR ANOTHER TWO WEEKS
JUST SO SOME MAN CAN HAVE HIS GROIN PATCHED. ONCE AGAIN, MALE SURGEONS DECIDE...
OKAY, OKAY, I SURRENDER. HORMONES TALKING. YOU CAN HAVE YOUR SURGERY.
I'M IN. BAG HIM.
THERE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE VERY MUCH BLOOD IN HERE.
I'LL SEW THE TUBE IN "O" SILK.
GOOD BREATHS BILATERALLY. CALL I.C.U. SEE IF WE CAN GET JOSHUA A BED?
Carol: SURE. BE RIGHT BACK, JOSH.
SO, DR. CORDAY, THE MASTECTOMY COMING IN TODAY--
IS IT ELAINE NICHOLS? MM-HMM.
THOUGHT THAT WASN'T UNTIL... I MOVED IT FORWARD.
SURE THAT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO?
I MEAN, DOESN'T THAT SEEM KIND OF FAST?
WHY ARE YOU SO INTERESTED?
SHE'S A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY.
REALLY? MM-HMM.
I SHOULDN'T DISCUSS IT WITH YOU.
MAKE SURE YOU GET A CHEST FILM.
LIZZIE, YOU'RE FINISHED ASSISTING DR. CARTER. GOOD. I HAVE SOMETHING FOR YOU.
THE CHICAGO GAZETTE IS SENDING A REPORTER TODAY
MOSTLY TO DO A PUFF-PIECE ON ME, THEY ALSO WANNA TAKE A LOOK AT THE E.R.
WHY ARE YOU TELLING ME? YOU'RE GONNA SHOW THEM AROUND--
LET THEM SEE WHAT HEROES WE ARE HOW WE SAVE KIDDIES' LIVES, ET CETERA--
BLOW MY TRUMPET, LIZZIE. YOU DO THAT BETTER YOURSELF.
LOOK AT YOU. LOOK AT ME. WHO WOULD YOU RATHER SPEND AN HOUR WITH?
YOU HAVE A POINT.
Greene: NEXT TIME, WEAR A HELMET.
COME ON, DOC. GIVE ME A BREAK.
HOW ABOUT A FRACTURED SKULL? WANT TO BE FED THROUGH A TUBE? BE MY GUEST.
OKAY, OKAY, I'LL WEAR THE HELMET. SO, CAN I GO NOW?
NOT YET. I'LL NEED A HEAD C.T.
WHAT'S THAT?
MY CORE VALUES BADGE--
CREATIVITY, ACCOUNTABILITY, RESPECT, EXCELLENCE.
WOW, ALL THAT AND BEAUTIFUL, TOO. YOU MUST BE SOME KIND OF NURSE.
I AM.
WHY DOESN'T DR. GRUMPY HAVE ONE?
GUESS I'M OUT OF THE LOOP.
WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE
YOU'VE GOT A BROKEN ARM, LOREN. WE'LL NEED X RAYS.
ANY OTHER SIGN OF TRAUMA?
CONTUSION TO THE RIGHT SHOULDER
ECHYMOSES OF THE FACE AND RIGHT HIP
AND SLIGHT TENDERNESS TO THE WRIST.
HOW FAR DID YOU FALL, LOREN?
I'M NOT SURE.
CAN YOU TELL ME HOW YOU FELL?
DID YOU FALL LIKE THIS OR DID YOU FALL MORE ON YOUR HAND?
YES.
WHAT? ON YOUR HAND?
I DON'T REMEMBER. I'M SORRY.
NO, DON'T WORRY. DON'T WORRY. THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE X RAYS FOR.
I'LL GET AN A.P. AND A LATERAL OF THE FOREARM
AS WELL AS WRIST AND ELBOW FILMS.
SURE, YOU DON'T WANT TO MISS ANYTHING.
UH, IT'S BUSY-- I KNOW.
PATIENT THROUGH TIME IS LONGER
THAN AT NEW WESTERN, BUT OUR CENSUS IS BIGGER.
NO, BUSY IS GOOD, BUSY KEEPS YOU YOUNG.
I'LL JUST TAKE A LOOK AT THAT FELLOW IN THREE.
Jeanie: LOOK AT THAT. HOW CUTE IS THAT?
THANKS, GUYS.
WHAT'S IN HERE? IT'S HEAVY. SOMETHING TO SPICE UP YOUR WEDDING NIGHT.
OH, CONNIE, YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE.
"SPICE UP MY WEDDING NIGHT"?
NICE HOT GUMBO TO KEEP UP HIS STRENGTH.
JEANIE, IS THIS YOUR LAST SHIFT?
YEP. CATCHING A PLANE AT 6:00 TO NEW ORLEANS.
IN THE MORNING REGGIE WILL MAKE ME AN HONEST WOMAN.
THEN I'M GONNA SHOW HIM THE TOWN. SHOW HIM A WILD TIME.
I'M SURE YOU'LL BE VERY HAPPY.
OH, DIDN'T I GIVE YOU A CORE VALUES BADGE? THE TODDLER CHEWED IT.
THERE YOU GO. ALWAYS WEAR IT. I WILL.
GUESS YOU CAN TAKE IT OFF ON YOUR WEDDING NIGHT.
NOW OPEN YOUR EYES.
RELAX.
WHAT WERE THE THREE THINGS I ASKED YOU TO REMEMBER?
A DOG, FIRE TRUCK AND BRIGETTE BARDOT.
EXCELLENT.
DATES ME, I KNOW BUT YOUR FIRST LOVE IS ALWAYS YOUR STRONGEST.
YOU MUST BE DR. LAWRENCE? JOHN CARTER, SENIOR RESIDENT.
AS USUAL, I'M LEARNING HOW TO BE A DOCTOR FROM MY PATIENT.
MEET MR. ULMAN: MINOR HEAD TRAUMA, BRIEF L.O.C.
CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT REFLEX WOULD INDICATE
INCREASED INTRACRANIAL PRESSURE?
BLOWN PUPIL?
NO, NOT A REFLEX. HERE. OBSERVE, DR. CARTER.
I SCRATCH THE THENAR EMINENCE
AND I LOOK FOR IPSILATERAL CONTRACTIONS
OF THE MUSCLES OF THE CHIN.
I SEE NONE.
THEREFORE, I DIAGNOSE NO SIGNIFICANT HEAD INJURY.
IT'S CALLED RADOVICI'S SIGN.
GET DRESSED, WE'LL SEE ABOUT GETTING YOU DISCHARGED.
THANKS A LOT, DOC. MY PLEASURE.
RADOVICI'S SIGN? YEAH.
THAT'S COOL. TRY IT ON YOUR NEXT HEAD TRAUMA.
IF I REMEMBER.
GOT THAT MIGRAINE IN FOUR? YEAH, SURE.
I'LL TELL YOU HOW: RADOVICI-- IT SOUNDS LIKE RADISH.
I PLUCK THE RADISH WITH MY THUMB...
THE DAYCARE SAID HE WAS CRYING ALL DAY PULLING AT HIS EAR.
HIS TEMP'S 101.
MUST BE A LOAD OFF-- HAVING A DAYCARE CENTER RIGHT HERE.
DOES HIS MOM WORK, TOO?
YEAH.
IT'S GOT TO BE TOUGH ON THE BOTH OF YOU. SUCH A SWEET KID.
SO... HOW'S HIS EAR?
HE'S GOT A NASTY-LOOKING OTITIS.
IS HE ALLERGIC TO ANY MEDICATION?
NAH.
OKAY.
SOME TYLENOL FOR THE PAIN
THEN LET'S PUT HIM ON AMOXICILLIN FOR TEN DAYS.
DID YOU HAVE EAR INFECTIONS AS A KID?
NO, WHY?
IT'S JUST THEY OFTEN RUN IN FAMILIES.
YEAH, WELL, YOU KNOW HE, UM, PROBABLY GOT IT IN DAYCARE.
THERE'S A LOT OF SICK KIDS UP THERE.
DO YOU WANNA LEAVE HIM WITH ME, UNTIL HIS TEMPERATURE GOES DOWN?
UM, YEAH, YEAH, SURE.
I KNOW, COME ON. COME ON.
GO AHEAD.
THERE YOU GO.
RANDI, HAS THE I.C.U. FOUND A BED FOR JOSHUA FOX YET?
THE GUNSHOT WOUND KID IN TRAUMA ONE.
NO. WELL, CALL THEM AGAIN.
CHUNY, HAVE YOU SEEN MY BICYCLE GUY?
ISN'T HE STILL IN CURTAIN THREE?
SPANDEX BUTT? YEP.
HE WAS DISCHARGED BY G.L. WHO'S G.L.?
GABRIEL LAWRENCE.
OH, RIGHT, THE GOOD-LOOKING OLDER GUY.
I JUST SAW HIM GO INTO THE LOUNGE WITH DR. CORDAY.
SO A FRENCHMAN, DR. RENE LAENNEC
RATHER THAN PRESS HIS EAR TO MADEMOISELLE'S MAGNIFICENT BREAST
ROLLED UP A NEWSPAPER INSTEAD
AND USED THAT TO LISTEN TO HER HEART.
VIOLA-- THE FIRST STETHOSCOPE.
VIOLA-- THE FIRST SENSITIVE MALE DOCTOR IN HISTORY.
DR. GREENE, DO YOU KNOW WHO INVENTED THE STETHOSCOPE?
I DON'T.
DID YOU DISCHARGE ONE OF MY PATIENTS?
I DON'T BELIEVE SO.
UH, A MR. ULMAN-- FELL OFF HIS BIKE?
I WASN'T AWARE HE WAS YOUR PATIENT.
WELL, HE WAS.
I'D ORDERED A HEAD C.T., WHICH HE OBVIOUSLY DIDN'T GET.
DON'T WORRY. I PERFORMED A THOROUGH NEUROLOGICAL EXAMINATION.
HE DIDN'T NEED A C.T. HE HAD A LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNESS.
PUT HIM AT A RISK FACTOR FOR INTRACRANIAL HEMORRHAGE.
YEAH, MINUSCULE RISK, I GAVE HIM A HEAD-INJURY INSTRUCTION SHEET--
IF HE HAS ANY WARNING SIGNS, HE'LL COME BACK.
HE LIVES ALONE IF HE SLIPS INTO A COMA NO ONE WOULD KNOW. THIS ISN'T LIKE NEW WESTERN.
COUNTY PATIENTS TEND TO BE A LITTLE LESS RELIABLE WHEN IT COMES TO FOLLOW-UP.
I'M AWARE OF THAT, DR. GREENE.
I TOLD HIM TO CALL ME IN FOUR HOURS, LEMME KNOW HOW HE'S DOING.
DIFFICULT FOR MR. ULMAN IF HE'S PASSED OUT ON THE KITCHEN FLOOR.
DR. CORDAY, WHAT WOULD YOU DO?
UH, WELL, WITHOUT SEEING THE PATIENT I'D REALLY RATHER NOT...
NAH, I'D LIKE TO KNOW. WHAT WOULD YOU DO?
FELL OFF HIS BIKE, HAD A LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNESS.
YOU DID A COMPLETE NEURO EXAM?
YES, HE WAS ALERT AND ORIENTED--
FULL BALANCE, RECALL, NORMAL REFLEXES.
HOW LONG WAS LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNESS?
LESS THAN TWO MINUTES. DID YOU VISUALIZE THE FUNDI?
THE DISCS WERE SHARP.
I THINK DR. GREENE WAS JUST BEING VERY THOROUGH.
SOUNDS LIKE A NO TO ME.
LOOK AT IT THIS WAY-- WE JUST SAVED MR. ULMAN $800.
"A" FOR ACCOUNTABILITY.
RIGHT.
SHE DOES MEET ALL THE REQUIREMENTS.
I COULDN'T AGREE WITH YOU MORE ON THIS... CAN I TALK TO YOU?
YOU'LL GET BACK TO ME LATER? AS SOON AS I CAN.
WHAT'S UP, MARK? WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME YOU WERE HIRING LAWRENCE?
I ONLY FOUND OUT HE WAS AVAILABLE TWO DAYS AGO.
IN TWO DAYS, YOU DIDN'T HAVE TIME FOR A FIVE-MINUTE CONVERSATION?
MARK, LOOK, I MEAN, THE MAN IS A LEGEND.
HE'S ONE OF THE FOUNDING FATHERS OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE.
WE ARE SO LUCKY TO HAVE HIM.
COULDN'T YOU HAVE THE COURTESY TO AT LEAST TELL ME FIRST?
IT'S CALLED RESPECT, KERRY. HEY, LOOK, IT'S EVEN ON YOUR STUPID BADGE.
ELAINE.
JOHN. I HEARD YOU WERE COMING IN TODAY.
DID YOU.
I ASKED YOU TO LEAVE ME ALONE.
YEAH, I KNOW.
I KNOW YOU DID, AND I'M SORRY
BUT I REALLY NEEDED TO TALK TO YOU
BECAUSE IT'S...
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT YOU TO HAVE THE WRONG IDEA ABOUT ME.
I DON'T.
YOU KNOW, I'M HERE FOR YOU AND THIS WASN'T JUST ABOUT...
SEX? YEAH. IT WASN'T ABOUT THAT.
IT WAS FOR ME.
AND IF WE'RE TALKING NEEDS, JOHN
I DON'T NEED YOU TO FEEL SORRY
OR WORRIED OR TENDER OR ANYTHING.
I JUST NEED YOU TO GO AWAY.
I DON'T WANT TO GO AWAY.
LOREN JOHNSON'S X RAY.
MIDSHAFT FRACTURE OF THE RADIUS.
NO INJURY TO THE WRIST OR ELBOW.
SHE WAS LUCKY.
MAYBE NOT.
WHAT'S THIS?
SOME MORE OF LOREN JOHNSON.
I PULLED HER RECORDS. SEE THESE CALLUSES?
HEALED RIB FRACTURES, AND THIS, UH...
SOME KIND OF BLUNT TRAUMA...
MAYBE A BASEBALL BAT.
SHE SAID SHE WANTED TO GO HOME
AS SOON AS WE SPLINT HER ARM.
THIS IS ONLY HER SECOND VISIT HERE
BUT SHE HAS BEEN TO MERCY THREE TIMES
McGAW TWICE, RAVENSWOOD ONCE.
THIS TIME I DON'T WANT HER TO GO HOME.
DR. KOVAC.
YES? YES, HI. I'M LOREN'S HUSBAND PAULY.
I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU FOR LOOKING AFTER HER SO WELL.
LOREN WASN'T CLEAR ON HOW THE ACCIDENT EXACTLY HAPPENED.
YEAH, MAYBE BECAUSE SHE'S A LITTLE BIT EMBARRASSED ABOUT IT.
ISN'T THAT RIGHT, LOREN?
SO, HOW DID IT HAPPEN?
SHE WAS UP A LADDER IN OUR BEDROOM HANGING DRAPES AND SHE LOST HER FOOTING.
I ASKED HER NOT TO DO IT BY HERSELF. DIDN'T I, HONEY?
YES, YOU DID.
SHALL I SPLINT HER?
MARK, CAN I HAVE A WORD? LIZZIE, PAULA TRANCOSO, CHICAGO GAZETTE.
ELIZABETH CORDAY: MY ASSOCIATE HEAD OF SURGERY.
AND MARK GREEN: ONE OF OUR E.R. DOCS.
HI. YOU'RE WEARING SCRUBS.
YES, IT WAS MY IDEA. I WANTED TO BLEND IN.
ELIZABETH'S GONNA SHOW PAULA AROUND THE E.R.-- YOU DON'T MIND, MARK?
IF YOU FEEL THAT DR. CORDAY HAS THE TIME.
WELL, HAD I KNOWN
THAT THE GAZETTE WAS GONNA SEND YOU,
I'D HAVE MADE TIME IN MY SCHEDULE BUT,
I'LL HAVE TO LEAVE YOU TO THE TENDER MERCIES OF DR. CORDAY.
WELL, UH, THIS IS THE E.R. OBVIOUSLY.
THIS IS JOSH'S COUSIN.
OH, GREAT. JOSH?
JOSH, YOUR COUSIN'S HERE.
HOW'S HE DOING?
HE LOOKS A LOT WORSE. HIS LUNG COLLAPSED.
WE PUT A TUBE IN HIS CHEST. TALK TO HIM IF YOU WANT.
HE'S TACKING AT 140.
JOSH, ARE YOU IN PAIN? B.P.'s 180/120.
CALL BENTON, MAYBE HE'S HEMORRHAGING. LET'S SPIN A CRIT.
HIS PULSE IS UP TO 160.
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO WAIT OUTSIDE.
WAIT OUTSIDE, PLEASE!
GO OUTSIDE. COME ON.
GO ON.
WHAT IS IT? DOES THE CHEST TUBE HURT YOU?
WHAT DO WE GOT? HE'S TACHY AT 160.
WHAT'S HIS CRIT? DRAWING IT.
YOU HAVING TROUBLE BREATHING?
YOU WERE SHOT. YES, WE KNOW.
OH, MY GOD.
HE'S THE SHOOTER.
I'LL CALL SECURITY.
HEY! HOLD IT RIGHT THERE. HE'S GOT A GUN!
DROP IT!
GET DOWN! GET DOWN!
AH... HEY.
LOOKS LIKE AN ABDOMINAL WOUND.
GET A BACKBOARD OVER HERE. STRONG CAROTID PULSE.
HIS CHEST IS CLEAR, WHAT'S HIS NAME?
UH, McGINNIS... JOE McGINNIS.
YOU GUYS NEED ANY HELP? NO, NO, WE'RE FINE. THANKS.
I WANT TWO LINES, N.G. AND A FOLEY. ROLL HIM GENTLY... GENTLY.
OKAY, ON MY COUNT: ONE, TWO, THREE, LIFT.
C.B.C., COAGS, TYPE AND CROSS FOR FOUR, CALL THE O.R.
B.P.'s 130/80. PULSE, 96.
NO VISIBLE G.S.W. TO CHEST AND ABDOMEN. LET'S ROLL HIM.
SEE ANYTHING BACK THERE? ANY BLOOD? NOTHING ON THE BACK.
CHECK THE EXTREMITIES. WHERE'S THE BLOOD COMING FROM?
LOOKS LIKE HE CUT HIS HAND.
DID HE EVEN GET SHOT?
NO, HE FAINTED.
THIS THE GUY THAT GOT SHOT? YOU NEED ME?
YEAH, HIS HAND NEEDS SUTURING. SUTURING?
THAT'S IT?
I WANT EVERY PIECE OF EQUIPMENT CHECKED FOR DAMAGE.
I DON'T WANT ANYBODY SEIZING BECAUSE THEIR I.V.'s ARE PUNCTURED.
19 PATIENTS ALL ACCOUNTED FOR.
NOBODY'S HURT? NOTHING SERIOUS APART FROM THE GUARD.
TWO FLESH WOUNDS FROM RICOCHETS, SOME GLASS CUTS
AND CONTUSIONS FROM DIVING TO THE FLOOR... THAT'S ALL.
THAT'S ALL? THERE MUST HAVE BEEN ABOUT 20 BULLETS FLYING AROUND.
I GUESS WE GOT LUCKY.
M.V.A.: S.U.V. VERSUS TRUCK. 38-YEAR-OLD MALE DRIVER
BROKE HIS NOSE WHEN THE AIRBAG INFLATED. MY WIFE AND CHILD?
SIR, YOUR WIFE HAS A FEW MINOR SCRAPES. THE LITTLE BOY SEEMS OKAY.
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE? CURTAIN THREE.
WHAT DO WE GOT? BOY'S NAME IS DAVID. HE'S NINE.
SLIGHTLY TACHY AT 110. B.P.'s 115/83.
COMPLAINED OF CHEST PAIN AT THE SCENE.
ONE, TWO, THREE.
HI, DAVID.
I'M CLEO. DO YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?
WE WERE IN AN ACCIDENT, THIS TRUCK JUST HIT US.
SON OF A BITCH CAME RIGHT THROUGH THE RED.
I KNOW MY NOSE IS BROKEN. WHAT ARE YOU FIDDLING WITH MY FACE FOR?
TO SEE IF ANYTHING ELSE IS BROKEN, MR. BRADLEY.
IF DAVID'S OKAY, WE DON'T HAVE TO STAY, DO WE?
LUNGS CLEAR BILATERALLY, HE'S STILL TACHYCARDIAC.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
WE CALLED OUR DOCTOR, HE SAID TO TAKE US TO AMBROSE
BUT THE PARAMEDICS SAID YOU WERE CLOSEST.
ARE THEY ALLOWED TO DO THAT?
CAN PARAMEDICS GO AGAINST THE PATIENTS' WISHES?
LET'S GET A CRIT AND U.A., C-SPINE AND CHEST FILM.
UNTIL I'VE DONE THESE TESTS, MRS. BRADLEY
THERE'S NO QUESTION OF DAVID GOING ANYWHERE.
ELAINE?
IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?
EVERYTHING'S FINE.
I... I JUST THINK MAYBE THIS HAS ALL BEEN TOO FAST FOR ME
SO, I... I WANT TO GO HOME AND THINK ABOUT IT.
YOU KNOW, I COULD DO WITH SOME FRESH AIR MYSELF. WHY DON'T WE TAKE A WALK?
WANNA SAY GOODBYE? BEEN DOING THAT ALL DAY.
HEY... YOU DIDN'T THIN YOU WERE GOING TO SNEAK OUT ON US?
THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL. HOW AM I GOING TO GET IT ON THE PLANE?
LEAVE REGGIE BEHIND, AND PUT THEM ON HIS SEAT.
THANK YOU. TAKE CARE.
SEE YOU. THANKS. BYE-BYE.
WOW.
JEANIE, I NEED TO SEE YOU, YOU TOO, REGGIE.
MY SHIFTS OVER. I KNOW.
WE'VE GOT A PLANE TO CATCH. I KNOW. COME ON.
CARLOS?
WHAT'S GOING ON? ASK ADELE.
SHE REALLY PUT HERSELF ON THE LINE FOR THIS.
WE'RE GOING TO LET YOU TAKE CARLOS.
( baby whimpering )
REALLY? ON A TEMPORARY BASIS.
AND ONCE YOU GET YOURSELF APPROVED AS A FOSTER PARENT
THEN WE CAN CONSIDER SOMETHING
MORE OFFICIAL AND PERMANENT.
THANK YOU.
YOU'RE WELCOME.
SO, I GUESS WE'RE NOT GOING TO NEW ORLEANS, HUH?
WE CAN STILL GET MARRIED HERE IN CHICAGO.
WE COULD TRY THE COURTHOUSE.
WHEN?
TODAY.
DR. LAWRENCE.
DR. GREENE. I'VE GOT HER.
UH, THE NEXT TIME
COULD YOU SIGN UP ON THE BOARD?
PAPERWORK... YOU CAN RUN BUT YOU CAN'T HIDE.
SHE'S REALLY HURTING THIS TIME.
YOU'VE BEEN SICK WITH FEVER, CRISTAL?
VOMITING AT ALL?
NO, JUST HURTING.
MM-HMM.
SHE'S HAD A SICKLE CRISIS BEFORE?
THE SAME AS LAST MONTH.
WE'RE GOING TO GET YOU SOMETHING FOR THE PAIN
AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO RUN SOME TESTS, OKAY, CRISTAL?
80 OF DEMEROL, 40 OF PHENERGAN.
C.B.C, CHEM PANEL AND A U.A., PLEASE.
OKAY.
CHUNY, IS THAT THE SICKLE CELL, GIRL?
YEAH.
OKAY. YOU ADD A RETIC COUNT AND A BETA H.C.G.
YOU GOT IT.
CAN WE GO NOW, DOCTOR, BEFORE ANOTHER GANGBANGER
STARTS SHOOTING UP THE PLACE?
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU FIRST. SURE. WHAT ABOUT?
IT'S, UH... JUST SOME FORMS TO FILL OUT, PLEASE.
SOMETHING WRONG?
I HAVE TO INFORM YOU, MR. JOHNSON
THAT I BELIEVE YOU ARE MENTALLY ILL.
WHAT? AND THAT BECAUSE
OF YOUR ILLNESS, YOU CAN REASONABLY BE...
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO'S ILL, PAL.
WHAT THE HELL DO YOU THINK...
OKAY, OKAY, I GET IT.
I'M IN A NUT HOUSE, HUH?
ALL RIGHT.
AND THAT BECAUSE OF YOUR ILLNESS
YOU CAN REASONABLY BE EXPECTED
TO INFLICT SERIOUS PHYSICAL HARM ON YOURSELF
OR ON OTHERS.
THEREFORE, YOU ARE SUBJECT TO INVOLUNTARY ADMISSION
AND ARE IN NEED OF IMMEDIATE HOSPITALIZATION.
WAIT TILL MY LAWYER GETS AHOLD OF YOU.
DR. KOVAC, YOU HAVE NO CRITERIA TO HOLD HIM.
THE X RAYS ARE MY CRITERIA.
IF SHE DOESN'T PRESS CHARGES, THEY DON'T MEAN ANYTHING.
SHE'S GOING TO GET TO PSYCH AND THEY'LL SEND HIM BACK AND HE'LL COME HOME.
HEY, I DON'T CARE ABOUT HIM. I CARE ABOUT HER.
WE CAN DO NOTHING OR SOMETHING. THIS WAY SHE HAS A CHANCE.
I CAN'T REALLY RUN AWAY...
CAN I?
YOU CAN DELAY BUT NOT FOR LONG.
ELAINE, IF YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT RECONSTRUCTION
I COULD MAKE AN APPOINTMENT WITH THE PLASTIC SURGEON.
WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO IT? AFTER YOU CUT IT OFF.
NOW YOU'RE BEING MORBID.
WHY? IT'S A PART OF ME.
IT WILL GO TO PATHOLOGY
AND THEN IT WILL BE GOT RID OF.
JUST THROWN IN THE TRASH.
IT'S MEDICAL WASTE...
AND I'LL HAVE A BLOB OF GEL INSTEAD.
WHAT WILL IT FEEL LIKE... WHEN I TOUCH IT?
WHEN SOMEBODY ELSE TOUCHES IT?
ELAINE, LOTS OF WOMEN HAVE THIS TYPE OF SURGERY.
I CAN'T IMAGINE FEELING ANYTHING
AND IF I CAN'T, HOW WILL ANYBODY ELSE?
I MEAN, HOW CAN I EVER BE WITH ANYBODY AGAIN?
YOU CAN'T LET THIS DEFINE YOU.
BUT IT'S HARD NOT TO.
I WAS HAPPY WITH WHO I WAS.
THAT'S EXACTLY WHO YOU'LL STILL BE.
I'D BETTER COME BACK IN.
I MAY BE VAIN, BUT I'M NOT STUPID.
JUST...
CAN YOU DO SOMETHING FOR ME?
OF COURSE.
WHEN YOU CUT...
CUT EVERYTHING. DON'T LEAVE ANYTHING.
YOU CUT IT ALL.
YOU KNOW WHAT THE ONLY GOOD THING IS ABOUT THE SICKLE CELL GENE?
THERE ISN'T ANYTHING GOOD.
NO, NO, THERE IS.
YOU KNOW, THERE'S A DISEASE CALLED MALARIA
THAT KILLS ALMOST A MILLION CHILDREN A YEAR.
WHAT DO YOU THINK PROTECTS PEOPLE AGAINST MALARIA?
THE SICKLE CELL GENE.
THAT ISN'T A BAD THING, IS IT?
THANK YOU, DOCTOR.
MY PLEASURE.
SHE SHOULD DRINK LOTS OF LIQUIDS
BRING HER BACK IF SHE HAS ANYMORE PAIN.
SURE. SAY THANK YOU, CRYSTAL.
THANK YOU.
YOU'RE WELCOME. YOU CAN GET DRESSED AND GO HOME NOW.
OVER HERE. OVER HERE.
THANK YOU.
DID THOSE LABS COME BACK YET?
NOPE, NOT YET. LET ME KNOW IF THEY DO.
OKAY.
DR. KOVAC.
CARL DE RAAD, PSYCHIATRY.
YOUR PSYCHIATRIC HOLD? WAY OUT OF LINE, MY FRIEND.
WHY?
BECAUSE TO JUSTIFY CERTIFICATION
THE PATIENT HAS TO BE A DANGER TO HIMSELF OR OTHERS.
HE IS A DANGER TO OTHERS. JUST LOOK AT HIS WIFE.
SHE SAID SHE FELL.
UNTIL SHE SAYS DIFFERENT
NOTHING WE CAN DO. I'M SORRY.
HAVE YOU TALKED TO HIM?
I'VE SEEN HIM.
DR. KOVAC, I KNOW WHY YOU DID IT
BUT I'M NOT GOING TO TAKE HIM UPSTAIRS FOR AN EVALUATION.
I'M GOING TO RELEASE HIM. CAN YOU DO ME A FAVOR?
CAN YOU TALK TO HIM AT LEAST?
WHAT'S THE POINT?
PLEASE.
YOU AND ME, LET-LET'S TALK TO HIM.
IT'S THE CRAZY FOREIGNER.
THEY SHOULD PUT THESE ON YOU, YOU KNOW?
WHY? I'M NOT GOING TO HIT YOUR WIFE.
I NEVER HURT MY WIFE. NEVER.
MR. JOHNSON. WE JUST WANT TO TALK TO YOU.
TALK TO HER. ASK HER-- HAVE I EVER HURT YOU, DARLING?
NO. WILL YOU LET HIM GO, PLEASE?
YOU WANT US TO RELEASE HIM?
PLEASE.
HOW LONG BEFORE YOU HIT HER AGAIN?
ON THE WAY HOME, OR MAYBE WAIT TILL YOU GET DRUNK
HAVE A BAD DAY AT WORK?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
ONE THING I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
THE X RAYS SHOW
YOUR WIFE HAD THREE CRACKED RIBS-- HERE.
HOW'D IT HAPPEN? LEAVE IT, KOVAC.
SHE FALL OFF THE LADDER AGAIN OR WHAT?
WAS IT DOWN THE STAIRS MAYBE?
CAN YOU SHUT THIS GUY UP?
OR DID YOU JUST KICK HER, HUH?
THATS ENOUGH.
TO BREAK HER RIBS, HUH?
YOU'D HAVE TO KNOCK HER DOWN AND STAMP ON HER CHEST.
WOW, WHAT A MAN.
SHUT UP.
GO ON THEN.
SCREW YOU.
I'LL KILL HIM!
NO!
I'LL KILL HIM!
CALM DOWN, MR. JOHNSON.
GET OFF OF ME. I'M GOING TO KILL HIM.
SEE? A DANGER TO OTHERS.
OH!
GET OUT OF HERE!
SEE?
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
MARK. BETA H.C.G. ON THE SICKLER.
WHERE ARE THEY?
THEY WALKED OUT A COUPLE OF MINUTES AGO.
LAWRENCE!
WE GOT A PROBLEM HERE!
MR. POWELL?
MR. POWELL!
I NEED YOU TO COME BACK INTO THE HOSPITAL.
BUT WE JUST LEFT.
YOUR DAUGHTER NEEDS ANOTHER TEST.
CRYSTAL'S FEELING MUCH BETTER.
WHAT'S GOING ON?
SHE NEEDS TO COME BACK IN. EXCUSE ME?
THE ICON IS POSITIVE.
SHE HAS TO COME RIGHT BACK IN-- NOW.
DR. FINCH. SAM JACOBS. I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU FOR LOOKING AFTER
ONE OF MY FAVORITE FAMILIES SO VERY WELL.
WE HAVEN'T QUITE FINISHED THE TESTS.
I'VE MADE ARRANGEMENTS FOR DAVID TO BE TRANSFERRED
TO AMBROSE, SO IF YOU WOULD BE SO KIND AS TO SIGN HIM...
I'M NOT HAPPY ABOUT MOVING HIM.
I LOOKED AT HIS C-SPINE. IT'S CLEAR.
I'VE GOT AN AMBULANCE WAITING. HE COMPLAINED OF BACK PAIN .
I'M STILL WAITING ON A SECOND CRIT.
WHEN YOU GET THAT, FAX IT OVER TO ME.
IT'LL BE A HALF AN HOUR, THAT'S ALL.
IN HALF AN HOUR, DR. FINCH, HE'LL BE UNDER OBSERVATION
AT AMBROSE, NOT TAKING UP PRECIOUS SPACE HERE.
ARE WE READY TO ROLL, SAM?
ARE WE, DR. FINCH?
THERE'S THE OVARY.
IT LOOKS PRETTY NORMAL.
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR?
THERE. A MASS IN THE FALLOPIAN TUBE.
Powell: WHAT IS IT? FETAL POLL AND A HEARTBEAT.
WHAT DID HE SAY?
THERE'S A HEARTBEAT.
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
THERE'S A HEARTBEAT.
YOUR DAUGHTER'S PREGNANT.
NO.
SHE'S 12 YEARS OLD.
THERE'S GOT TO BE A MISTAKE.
THERE'S NO MISTAKE. SHE'S PREGNANT
BUT THE FETUS IS IN THE FALLOPIAN TUBE
NOT THE UTERUS.
I WANT A SECOND OPINION.
I'M THE SECOND OPINION.
WE'RE LUCKY WE CAUGHT THIS EARLY ENOUGH.
YEAH. YOUR DAUGHTER NEEDS SURGERY-- NOW.
IF IT RUPTURES, IT COULD BE VERY DANGEROUS.
I'M GOING TO CALL THE O.R.
WERE YOU CHECKING UP ON ME?
OH, JUST, UH, WATCHING OUT FOR THE PATIENTS.
WILL THERE BE VIDEO GAMES?
SURE. VIDEO GAMES, TV, YOUR OWN ROOM--
JUST LIKE A HOTEL, REALLY.
WHAT'S YOUR FAVORITE GAME, THEN?
DAVID?
DAVID.
DAVID, CAN YOU HEAR ME?
STOP.
WHAT'S HAPPENING? WHY ARE WE STOPPING?
HE'S TACHY. GET A B.P.
I CAN'T GET A PRESSURE. COULD BE HIS AORTA.
LET'S GO TO TRAUMA.
I DON'T WANT HIM STAYING HERE.
HE HAS TO. NEED A HAND?
EIGHT YEARS OLD, IN RAPID DECELERATION MVA
CRASHED WHILE BEING TRANSFERRED TO AMBROSE.
PROBABLY A TRAUMATIC RUPTURE AT THE JUNCTION
OF THE SUBCLAVIAN AND AORTIC ARCH.
WHY WAS HE BEING TRANSFERRED?
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO CRACK HIM.
SORRY, SORRY.
THORACOTOMY TRAY!
WHERE IS KERRY?
SHE SAID SHE'D BE HERE.
YOU KNOW THIS PLACE CLOSES AT 5:00?
YEAH, WE KNOW.
DO WE REALLY NEED TWO...?
TWO WITNESSES, YES.
ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT, SUCTION.
LET'S START RUNNING WITH THE PACKED CELLS.
HE'S IN V-TACH.
60 OF LIDOCAINE.
SON OF A BITCH, I CAN'T FIND THE SOURCE.
DR. CARTER, HE'S STILL IN V-TACH.
Carter: STAND BY WITH THE PADDLES.
I'VE NEVER DONE ONE LIKE THIS, TALK ME THROUGH IT.
KEEP SUCTIONING.
ALL RIGHT, WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS...
CONNIE, WOULD YOU GET THAT WOMAN OUT OF HERE!
MA'AM, YOU HAVE TO LEAVE.
PETER, YOU NEED ANY HELP?
GET THAT WOMAN OUT OF HERE.
OKAY, YOU NEED TO GO.
GET YOUR HANDS OFF OF ME. OUT!
YOU'LL CLAMP DISTAL TO THE LEFT SUBCLAVIAN.
ALL RIGHT, NOW, OPEN THE PLEURA TO IDENTIFY THE AREA THAT'S LEAKING.
SCISSOR.
RELEASE THE CLAMP DISTALLY TO IDENTIFY THE LEAK.
I SEE IT.
NOW, EVACUATE THE HEMATOMA.
UH-HUH.
PUT A CURVED POTTS UNDERNEATH THE LEAK
TO LEAVE THE AORTA PATENT.
ALL RIGHT, NOW CLAMP ABOVE THE TEAR.
THERE YOU GO, CARTER.
YOU'VE JUST ISOLATED THE LEAK.
NICE WORK, CARTER.
DO YOU, REGINALD MOORE
TAKE THIS WOMAN TO BE YOUR LAWFUL WEDDED WIFE
TO LIVE TOGETHER IN THE STATE OF MATRIMONY
TO LOVE HER, HONOR, AND KEEP HER THROUGH HEALTH
SICKNESS AND PROSPERITY
WHATEVER YOUR FUTURE MIGHT BE?
I DO.
( baby fussing )
I THINK HE NEEDS A FEEDING.
YEAH. OKAY. HERE.
JUST ONE SECOND.
( baby crying )
SORRY.
HI.
ARE YOU HUNGRY?
IT'S OKAY. GO ON.
AND DO YOU, JEANIE BOULET, TAKE THIS MAN TO BE
YOUR LAWFUL WEDDED HUSBAND
TO LIVE TOGETHER IN THE STATE OF MATRIMONY
TO LOVE HIM HONOR AND KEEP HIM THROUGH HEALTH, SICKNESS AND PROSPERITY
WHATEVER YOUR FUTURE MIGHT BE?
I DO.
NO, IT'S NOT UNUSUAL-- THIS IS A TEACHING HOSPITAL
AND RESIDENTS ARE HERE TO LEARN.
SO THEY'RE ALLOWED TO PRACTICE ON PATIENTS.
HOW ELSE DO THEY LEARN?
A BIT TOUGH ON WHOEVER THEY'RE LEARNING ON, ISN'T IT?
RESIDENTS ARE CAREFULLY SUPERVISED.
WHAT I SAW WASN'T CAREFULLY SUPERVISED.
UH, WELL, I'M SURE YOU'VE SEEN ENOUGH, DON'T YOU?
IT WAS REALLY NICE TO MEET YOU
AND I DO LOOK FORWARD TO READING YOUR ARTICLE.
MARK, THANK GOD I GOT RID OF HER.
YEAH. BE CAREFUL SHE DOESN'T TURN UP SOMEWHERE ELSE...
DISGUISED AS A SURGEON.
DID SHE GET IN THE WAY IN TRAUMA? YEP.
MARK, I DIDN'T ASK TO BE HER TOUR GUIDE.
WELL, YOU DIDN'T SAY NO.
HOW'S IT GOING?
FINE. I HEARD ABOUT YOUR PSYCH HOLD.
YEAH, I'M VERY POPULAR WITH PSYCHIATRY NOW.
THEY TOOK HIM UPSTAIRS FOR ASSESSMENT.
MAYBE THEY'LL HOLD HIM.
I DON'T THINK SO.
I PROVOKED HIM IN FRONT OF WITNESSES.
WELL, MAYBE NOW SHE'LL SEE
WHAT HE'S REALLY LIKE, YOU KNOW? YOU DON'T THINK SHE KNOWS?
CAROL, IT'S HOPELESS.
MAYBE NOT. SHE DIDN'T GO UPSTAIRS WITH HIM.
LUCY TOOK HER TO THE CAFETERIA.
OH. FINGERS CROSSED.
YEAH.
WE GOT DAVID STABILIZED.
HE'S IN SURGERY.
BARRING ANY COMPLICATIONS, HE SHOULD BE OKAY.
IF YOU WANT TO GO AND SEE HIM, THE NURSE'LL TAKE YOU.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU, DOCTOR.
DR. FINCH...
YOU DID WELL TO CATCH THAT.
IF WE'D WAITED FOR THE TESTS, WE WOULD HAVE SEEN THIS.
WE COULD'VE OPERATED IN A CONTROLLED MANNER
RATHER THAN HAVING TO RIP AN EIGHT-YEAR-OLD'S CHEST OPEN.
WE HAD NO CHOICE.
I DID.
I SHOULDN'T HAVE LET MYSELF LISTEN TO YOU.
HOW ARE YOU FEELING?
( drowsily ): I'M GOOD.
IT WENT WELL.
THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE THE CANCER HAD SPREAD
BUT WE WILL HAVE TO WAIT FOR THE PATHOLOGY REPORTS
ON THE LYMPH NODES.
I GOT A PLASTIC SURGEON IN TO CLOSE
SO WE COULD MINIMIZE SCARRING
AND, OF COURSE, WITHIN THE NEXT COUPLE OF WEEKS
WE CAN BEGIN RECONSTRUCTION.
WHEN CAN I GO HOME?
WELL, WE HAD TO PUT IN SOME DRAINS
TO COLLECT ANY ACCUMULATING FLUID.
LIKE I'M A SEWER SYSTEM.
MOST LIKELY, IT'LL JUST BE FOR THE NIGHT
SO YOU'LL BE ABLE TO GO HOME TOMORROW.
NOW, I'VE GIVEN THE NURSE ALL MY NUMBERS, SO IF YOU
NEED ANYTHING OR HAVE ANY QUESTIONS
JUST CALL, ANYTIME.
THANKS.
OH-- DR. KOVAC, NOW THAT, UH, DR. LAWRENCE IS HERE
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE NEEDING YOU ANYMORE, OKAY?
OKAY.
HEY. ARE YOU ON TONIGHT?
NO. NO, I'M NOT.
HOW MUCH FLUID DID YOU GIVE HIM? TWO LITERS WIDE OPEN.
WHAT DO WE GOT? 17-YEAR-OLD, TWO GUNSHOT WOUNDS
TO THE RIGHT CHEST, ONE TO THE LEFT.
B.P. 90/60, PULSE 120-- INTUBATED IN THE FIELD.
OKAY, HE NEEDS BILATERAL CHEST TUBES...
ONE FOR YOU AND ONE FOR ME.
MALUCCI, YOU DO A CENTRAL LINE.
RIGHT I.J.
ON MY COUNT: ONE, TWO, THREE.
TWO CHEST TUBES AND A CENTRAL LINE-- LET'S MOVE IT.
WE'VE ONLY GOT ONE CHEST TRAY. THEN GET ANOTHER ONE.
WE'LL SHARE. TEN BLADE.
HERE.
B.P.'s DOWN TO 80.
PULSE OX 92. CURVED KELLY.
CONNIE-- 20cc's FOR YOUR LABS.
THANKS. "O" NEG'S HERE.
Lawrence: CHEST TUBE.
GET THIS DAMN THING OUT OF MY WAY!
SOMEBODY GRAB THIS BADGE. FLIP IT.
HERE... HERE YOU ARE.
ALL RIGHT, STITCH, PLEASE. I'M IN-- LOCK AND LOAD THE INFUSER.
B.P.'s DOWN TO 70.
100cc's ON THE RIGHT.
WE GOT BLEEDING ON YOUR SIDE, DR. GREENE.
WHERE'S BENTON?
OOH, HE'S OFF AT 6:00.
CONNIE, WE NEED A SURGEON DOWN HERE NOW.
OH.
GIVE ME THE FOLEY.
FOLEY-- COME ON, COME ON, COME ON!
30cc SYRINGE FOR DR. GREENE.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING? CHECK THE BALLOON.
CHECK THE BALLOON. COME ON, CHECK THE BALLOON.
WE CAN'T PUT PRESSURE ON THE BLEEDER FROM THE OUTSIDE
WE'LL DO IT FROM THE INSIDE.
Malucci: PRESSURE'S DOWN TO 60.
ANOTHER TWO OF "O" NEG.
TELL ME WHEN.
20cc's...
UH-HUH.
THERE'S 30cc's.
MM-HMM.
CHEST TUBE OUTPUT'S DOWN TO A TRICKLE.
PRESSURE'S UP TO 80.
OLD ARMY TRICK FOR TAMPONADING THE SUBCLAVIAN.
COOL.
VERY COOL.
OKAY, LET'S GET HIM UP TO THE O.R.
( sighs )
DR. CARTER?
HOW IS SHE?
SHE'S RESTING COMFORTABLY.
YOU CAN GO IN IF YOU LIKE.
( car horn honking )
HEY, KOVAC! HEY.
YOU WANT A LIFT?
WHAT, IN THAT?
IT'S MY MOM'S.
I HAD TO PICK UP SOME STUFF FROM WORK.
WHAT, BABY STUFF? YEAH.
OKAY.
HERE WE ARE.
YEAH.
LET'S SEE...
OOH.
OH... OOH...
HEY.
JEANIE... LET'S GET HIM ONE OF THESE, HUH?
HE'S NINE MONTHS OLD.
YEAH, BUT YOU'RE NEVER TOO EARLY TO START.
( laughing )
OOH.
( imitates siren )
WHAT DO YOU THINK, CARLOS?
YOU THINK YOUR DADDY'S SILLY?
WHAT ABOUT THIS, CARLOS, HUH?
YOU LIKE ONE OF THESE?
PULL OVER.
PULL OVER.
HE IS SILLY.
ELIZABETH, I WANTED TO APOLOGIZE FOR BEING ABRUPT.
YOU MEAN RUDE.
YES.
I'LL THINK ABOUT IT.
YOU KNOW, YOU COULD APOLOGIZE, ACTUALLY
FOR THAT CRAP ABOUT THE HEAD C.T.
WHAT?! NO WAY AM I GOING TO APOLOGIZE FOR THAT.
YOU PUT ME ON THE SPOT.
YEAH, I EXPECTED YOU TO GIVE THE RIGHT ANSWER.
THE RIGHT ANSWER?
THAT LAWRENCE IS STILL BUGGING YOU, ISN'T HE? HMM?
WELL...
JUST BECAUSE HE CAN DIAGNOSE SOMEBODY
WITHOUT HAVING TO ORDER EVERY TEST IN THE WORLD.
HE MAY HAVE SOME FANCY MOVES IN TRAUMA
BUT HE DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO FUNCTION IN AN INNER-CITY E.R.
YOU'RE AFRAID YOU MIGHT LEARN SOMETHING. HE'S TOO SLOW.
HE SPENDS HOURS WITH EVERY PATIENT
AND THEN HE TIES UP THE RESIDENTS
CHATTERING ON ABOUT THE RADOVICI SIGN.
THE WHAT?
THE... YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT?
NO. WHAT IS IT?
I DON'T THINK I SHOULD TELL YOU.
MARK...
LOOK, JUST ONE MORE.
COME ON, REESE, PLEASE? OKAY.
MAYBE NOT.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING? WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
( laughing )
WHAT ARE YOU DOING? HEY, JACKIE, YOU THINK HE LOOKS LIKE ME?
I HOPE NOT.
HE'S GOT ENOUGH PROBLEMS.
WHEN I WAS A KID, DID I HAVE A LOT OF EAR INFECTIONS?
I DON'T KNOW, PETER.
I WAS YOUR SISTER, NOT YOUR MOTHER.
YOU WERE A SCRAWNY LITTLE THING, THOUGH--
ALWAYS COMING DOWN WITH SOMETHING OR OTHER.
NO WONDER YOU GOT INTO MEDICINE.
MMM. THANKS.
I'LL TAKE HIM UP TO BED, OKAY?
ALL RIGHT.
YOU DO THE WASHING UP, ALL RIGHT? ALL RIGHTY.
AND DRY UP, DON'T LEAVE EVERYTHING SITTING ON THE SIDE.
YEAH. HEY, HEY... HEY.
LOVE YOU.
YOU LOVE ME? YOU LOVE ME?
OH, GET OUT OF HERE. COME ON, MY BABY.
OOH.
( kissing )
YOU LIVE HERE?
I TOLD YOU IT'S ON THE WATER.
YEAH, BUT I MEAN...
IS IT SANITARY?
SURE.
WHAT DO YOU DO IN WINTER?
IN WINTER I GO SOUTH.
LIKE THE BIRDS.
YEAH.
THANK YOU FOR THE LIFT.
SURE. SEE YA.
SURE.
WELL, YOU SCRATCH THE THENAR EMINENCE
WHICH CAUSES IPSILATERAL CONTRACTIONS
OF THE MUSCLES OF THE CHIN.
( laughing )
OH, DEFINITELY CONTRACTING.
IS THAT A GOOD THING?
SADLY, NO.
IT INDICATES INCREASED INTRACRANIAL PRESSURE...
DISTURBANCES OF THE BRAIN
WHICH EXPLAINS WHY YOU'RE WORKING WITH ROMANO.
( laughing )
