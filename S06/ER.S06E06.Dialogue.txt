CAN I GIVE YOU A HAND WITH THAT?
OH, THANKS, JOHN.
PAID A FORTUNE FOR IT AND THE DAMN THING'S STUCK.
NO PROBLEM AS LONG AS I CAN SNEAK UNDER A CORNER OF IT.
I LEFT MINE IN THE HOUSE
ON MY WAY OUT.
I HATE COMING INTO WORK IN THE MORNING
WHEN IT'S STILL DARK.
THAT DOESN'T LOOK PROMISING.
YEAH, A PERFECT START
TO WHAT'S BOUND TO BE A PERFECT DAY!
WE GOT A 93-YEAR-OLD WOMAN WITH C.O.P.D.
INCREASED WHEEZING DUE TO SMOKE INHALATION
WITH NO EVIDENCE OF FACIAL BURNS.
B.P. IS 154/92, PULSE 96.
GIVE HER FIVE ALBUTEROL.
GET HER ON A PULSE OX AND ORDER CHEST FILMS.
WHAT'S GOING ON?
OH, THERE WAS A FIRE IN A NURSING HOME.
THERE WEREN'T ENOUGH PEOPLE THERE TO GET THEM OUT.
CARTER, CAN YOU GET THIS LAST AMBULANCE?
90-YEAR-OLD WITH LEFT-SIDED STROKE.
TACHYPNEA AND ALTERED MENTAL STATUS. B.P. IS 95/60.
NO SINGED NASAL HAIRS.
THEY'RE SENDING US
TWO MORE, ONE CRITICAL.
FULL THICKNESS BURNS.
WHO'S ON THE DESK?
NOBODY. STEVE CALLED IN SICK
AND RANDI LEFT AT 6:30.
SHE DIDN'T WAIT FOR HER REPLACEMENT?
I AM NOT HER KEEPER.
IF YOU WANT TO BITCH AT SOMEBODY, BITCH AT HER.
HALEH, I NEED YOU.
OH, AND JEANIE CALLED.
SHE'S NOT COMING IN TODAY EITHER.
YOU HAVE BASKETBALL PRACTICE OR YOU COMING STRAIGHT HOME?
I GOT PRACTICE.
YOU JUST ABOUT READY?
YEAH.
MORNING.
MORNING.
WHERE'S YOUR BACKPACK? MM-HMM.
UPSTAIRS BATHROOM, ON TOP OF THE TOILET
YOUR BASKETBALL STUFF IS ON THE BASEMENT STEPS.
YOU WANT IT TO END UP IN THE WASHER
YOU PUT IT IN THE BASKET.
SHE CAN HIT A 20-FOOT FADING JUMPER
BUT SHE CAN'T GET WITHIN TEN YARDS OF THE HAMPER.
SHEESH.
YOU GOT A MINUTE?
NOT REALLY.
YEAH, UH...
CARLA TOLD ME THAT REESE MIGHT NOT BE MINE.
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?
I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T KNOW THAT I BELIEVE HER
WITH EVERYTHING THAT'S GOING ON.
THAT BITCH.
WHAT THE HELL IS THE MATTER WITH HER?
JACKIE...
EVERYTHING SHE'S PUT YOU THROUGH AND SHE ISN'T EVEN SURE?
I'M SORRY, BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S WORSE--
THAT SHE'S ALWAYS KNOWN
OR SHE'S DOING THIS TO GET REESE.
YEAH. WELL, I GOT A PATERNITY TEST.
I HAVEN'T TAKEN IT YET.
HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE?
I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW I'M GOING TO DO IT.
YOU HAVE TO.
WHAT IF I'M NOT HIS FATHER, HUH?
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO-- WAIT TILL HE GETS OLDER?
HE'S BOUND TO FIND OUT...
YEAH, I KNOW.
THEN HE'S GOING TO KNOW
THAT YOU'VE LIED TO HIM.
HI.
HI. WHAT DO YOU WANT?
WELL, I CALLED
BUT THE PHONE JUST KEPT RINGING.
I DON'T ALWAYS HEAR IT. IT'S DOWN THE HALL.
I GOT TO GET TO WORK.
ARE YOU STILL WORKING AT THE PHARMACY?
THE PAY SUCKS, BUT THE HOURS ARE GOOD.
YOUR TESTS CAME BACK AFTER YOU LEFT.
YOU'VE GOT TO COME BACK TO THE HOSPITAL
AND GET TREATED FOR THE BLADDER INFECTION.
A BLADDER INFECTION CAN BE VERY DANGEROUS
WHEN YOU'RE PREGNANT.
I'LL COME BY AS SOON AS I CAN.
HAVE YOU GIVEN ANY MORE THOUGHT
TO THE DETOX PROGRAM?
YOU REALLY HAVE TO.
I STOPPED USING ABOUT, UH...
FIVE DAYS AGO.
OH, GOOD FOR YOU.
YEAH. THANKS AGAIN.
YEAH, I DON'T GIVE A DAMN HOW MANY PATIENTS YOU'VE GOT.
EXCUSE ME?
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT? WE ARE DROWNING DOWN HERE
AND I NEED SOME QUALIFIED BODIES.
EXCUSE ME. I'M LOOKING FOR...
GO AWAY.
I'VE GOT 11 FRIED OLD FOLKS.
YOU WANT TO COMPARE PATIENT LOADS?
UH-UH. YOU NEED SOMETHING TALK TO THE BOSS LADY.
HEY, YOU'RE IN A NASTY CAR ACCIDENT
I HOPE YOU END UP DOWN HERE SO I CAN PERSONALLY BE
OF ABSOLUTELY NO DAMN HELP TO YOU WHATSOEVER!
TWERP.
EXCUSE ME.
HI, UH... I'M ANDREW.
YOU HAVE M.D. BEHIND YOUR NAME?
NO, I...
THEN HAVE A SEAT. I'LL GET TO YOU
WHEN I GET TO YOU.
MARGARET RAMEY SENT ME.
YOU'RE A DESK CLERK?
YES, MA'AM.
THEN GET BACK HERE NOW.
OKAY, SO YOU WANT ME TO...
YOU'RE A CLERK. CLERK.
MALIK, GET ON THE PHONE TO ANYBODY WHO HAS THE DAY OFF.
TELL THEM TO GET INTO WORK TODAY
IF THEY STILL WANT TO WORK HERE TOMORROW.
OH, GOD!
CAN I HELP YOU, MA'AM?
OH, I'VE LOST MY HUSBAND.
WERE YOU IN THE FIRE?
BARRY IS MY HUSBAND'S NAME
AND I WAS FOLLOWING HIM DOWN THE HALL, AND...
THEY WENT SO FAST!
YOUR HUSBAND'S NAME IS BARRY?
YES.
LET'S SEE IF WE CAN FIND HIM.
THANK YOU.
SIR, CAN YOU TAKE A DEEP BREATH FOR ME?
PULSE OX 82 ON FOUR LITERS.
I FOUND YOUR PATIENT'S WIFE WANDERING AROUND.
CAN I BRING HER IN?
ABSOLUTELY. YOU FREE?
YEAH, I WAS HEADING BACK TO THE DESK
TO GRAB ANOTHER ONE.
I GOT TWO. YOU CAN HAVE THIS ONE.
NO SINGED NASAL HAIRS.
BARRY, I'M RIGHT HERE.
SIR, I NEED YOU TO LEAN FORWARD, SO I CAN LISTEN TO YOUR BACK.
HE CAN'T LIFT HIMSELF...
WET CRACKLES BILATERALLY.
PUT HIM ON A NON-REBREATHER MASK.
M.S., C.H.F. CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE.
ALL RIGHT. S4 GALLOP. LET'S GET A NITRO DRIP.
TITRATE TO A SYSTOLIC OF 100.
ADD ANOTHER 80 OF LASIX
AND FOUR OF MORPHINE.
YOU GOT IT?
YEAH. YEAH.
78-YEAR-OLD WOMAN WITH RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS
CONTUSION TO THE RIGHT THIGH. B.P. IS 155/88, PULSE 96.
THREE CENTIMETER VERTICAL LACERATION
TO THE FOREHEAD.
I SHOULD HAVE HAD THAT THIRD CUP OF COFFEE THIS MORNING.
WHAT'S GOING ON?
NURSING HOME FIRE. CHECK THE RESIDENTS.
MAKE SURE ALL THE MAJORS ARE COVERED.
AND, CAROL, CAN YOU TAKE OVER THE DESK?
THEY'RE STACKING UP LIKE CORD WOOD.
NO PHYSICAL FINDINGS OF SMOKE INHALATION
BUT SHE'S STILL SHORT OF BREATH AND HYPOXIC.
PULSE OX IS DOWN TO 84.
LET'S CRANK HER UP TO TEN, ALL RIGHT?
WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON?
HER CHEST IS CLEAR, I MEAN...
SHOULD I GET DR. GREENE?
UH, NO.
WHAT'S HER TEMP?
IT'S 101.2.
YOU APPRECIATE THE COARSE RHONCHI
AT THE RIGHT BASE?
SHE'S GOT PNEUMONIA.
NOT MUCH GETS BY YOU, DOES IT, DR. DAVE?
C.B.C., BLOOD CULTURES...
CHEST X-RAY, CEFTRIAXONE. SIGN.
YOU KNOW, ANDY DOES IMITATIONS.
ASK HIM.
IMITATIONS, HUH?
I'M BETTER AT IMPROV, YOU KNOW, SECOND CITY?
THIS IS JUST MY DAY JOB.
DO KEANU REEVES, MAN.
NO...
OH, COME ON. DO SOMETHING, MAN.
GO AHEAD.
( as Keanu Reeves ): WHOA...
SO, YOU'RE A LITTLE PREGNANT, HUH?
ALL RIGHT.
YOU PICKED A NAME FOR THE LITTLE DUDE, YET?
NO, I HAVEN'T.
WELL, HOW ABOUT LEAF OR BODHI
OR KEANU?
KEANU IS A MOST EXCELLENT NAME.
THAT'S VERY GOOD.
MALIK, DID YOU GET A HOLD OF JEANIE?
SHE CAN'T MAKE IT IN.
SHE HASN'T MADE IT IN ALL WEEK.
CALL HER AND TELL HER TO COME IN HERE--
IF NOT TO WORK, THEN TO EXPLAIN TO ME
WHY I SHOULDN'T FIRE HER.
JUST HAD A GREAT PICK-UP.
OH, YEAH?
ELDERLY WOMAN WAS IN THAT FIRE.
PRESENTED WITH RAPID BREATHING AND ALTERED MENTAL STATUS.
TACHYPNIC AND HYPOXIC.
YOU'RE FIGURING SMOKE INHALATION?
YOUR BUNSEN BURNER'S ON.
THAT ONE STICKS. JIGGLE IT.
PULSE OX WAS 84. YOU WITH ME?
I'M STRUGGLING TO KEEP UP
BUT I GET THE PICTURE.
I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST INHALATION
BUT I NOTICED A FEW SUBTLE PHYSICAL FINDINGS--
QUIET CRACKLES IN THE RIGHT MIDDLE LOBE
SLIGHT DULLNESS TO PERCUSSION
AND A LOW-GRADE FEVER.
PNEUMONIA.
RIGHT.
I FIGURE I'LL FIND SOME GRAM POSITIVE DIPLOCOCCI
IN HER SPUTUM.
SHE'S LUCKY YOU WERE HER PHYSICIAN.
DAMN STRAIGHT.
HALEH TOLD ME SHE HEARD THE RHONCHI
ON THE PATIENT, TOLD YOU.
( mumbling )
I CAN'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT HE'S SAYING.
HE'S NOT GETTING ENOUGH OXYGEN.
IT CAN LEAD TO CONFUSION AND DISORIENTATION.
HIS LUNGS ARE VERY SICK.
RIGHT NOW, OUR ONLY OPTION
IS TO PLACE A TUBE DOWN HIS THROAT
TO HELP HIM BREATHE.
BUT I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT WILL BE HELPFUL.
WELL, IS THERE A CHANCE HE CAN GET BETTER?
THERE IS A CHANCE.
BUT IN HIS DECLINING HEALTH...
I'M NOT OPTIMISTIC.
BUT HE COULD GET BETTER?
YES, HE COULD.
THEN LET'S TRY IT.
IT COULD ALSO BE HIS HEART.
WHY DON'T WE RUN SOME MORE TESTS
AND, UM... JUST MAKE SURE
THAT WE'RE DOING THE RIGHT THING FIRST.
LILY, CAN WE GET CARDIOLOGY DOWN HERE?
TO, UH... DO AN ECHO?
YEAH.
Woman: PLEASE, HELP ME!
HOW YOU DOING?
UH, 89-YEAR-OLD WOMAN, AGITATED, DELUSIONAL, VITALS NORMAL.
NO SIGNS OF SMOKE INHALATION OR INJURY.
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE SO FAR?
GAVE FIVE OF HALDOL, TWO OF ATIVAN.
LOST MY READING GLASSES SOMEWHERE YESTERDAY.
WHY WON'T YOU HELP ME?
PLEASE HELP ME!
THESE DEMENTIA CASES ARE SO SAD.
I HATED MY GERIATRICS ROTATION.
IT'S ONE OF THE REASONS I CHOSE PEDES. MA'AM...
LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE DOING FINE.
HELP ME! PLEASE HELP ME!
PLEASE HELP ME!
PLEASE, PLEASE!
HELP ME! PLEASE!
HELP ME! HELP ME!
HOW'S SHE DOING?
FINE.
EXCUSE ME.
I THINK WE'RE GETTING ON TOP OF IT.
THREE HAVE BEEN ADMITTED TO MEDICINE.
THE BROKEN HIP WENT UP TO SURGERY.
ONE'S IN C.I.C.U., AND FIVE WERE TREATED AND RELEASED.
YOU SMELL GAS?
YES, I DO.
MALIK, SMELL THAT?
YEAH.
OKAY, I'LL CALL MAINTENANCE.
MALIK, GET EVERYONE OUT OF THIS HALL.
DEFINITELY STRONGER IN HERE.
( groaning )
BOTH EARDRUMS ARE INTACT.
HOW'S THE RINGING, STILL BAD?
RINGING STILL BAD?
WHAT WAS IT?
FIRE DEPARTMENT THINKS
SOMEBODY LEFT A BUNSEN BURNER ON.
I WAS DOING A STAIN EARLIER
BUT I'M SURE I TURNED IT OFF.
YOU WANT ME TO SET UP AN AUDIOLOGY APPOINTMENT?
NO, I'VE HAD IT WORSE
SITTING TOO CLOSE TO THE STAGE AT A CLASH CONCERT.
I JUST WANT TO GET OUT OF THESE WET CLOTHES.
A FEW SCRATCHES, BUT THAT'S IT.
THANKS, GABE. COULD THIS DAY GET ANY WORSE?
WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED HERE?
WE'RE NOT CERTAIN YET.
WE THINK A SMALL GAS LEAK MAY HAVE IGNITED NEXT DOOR.
SMALL?
I HEARD IT UP ON THE FOURTH FLOOR.
FORTUNATELY, NO ONE WAS SERIOUSLY INJURED.
SOMEONE MAY HAVE
LEFT A BUNSEN BURNER ON.
WHEN DID THE PAIN START?
LAST NIGHT, BEFORE I WENT TO BED.
HAD YOU HAD ANYTHING TO EAT?
WE SHARED A PIZZA FOR DINNER.
ANY VOMITING?
NO.
ANY PAIN?
A LITTLE BIT AROUND MY BELLY BUTTON.
HOW OLD ARE YOU, EDDIE?
12. MARRIED?
BIG FOR YOUR AGE. YOU PLAY FOOTBALL?
UH, HE'S NOT MUCH INTO SPORTS.
UH, VIDEO GAMES, THAT'S WHAT KIDS DO NOW.
SIT UP FOR ME, WILL YOU?
YOU HAVE ANY PAIN BACK HERE?
Jarvik: CARTER. YEAH, A LITTLE.
DR. KAYSON'S HERE.
THANKS. I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.
OKAY, I DON'T THINK IT'S TOO SERIOUS, MR. BERNERO.
MAYBE JUST A LITTLE TOUCH OF THE STOMACH FLU.
WHY DON'T YOU PEE IN THE CUP, GIVE IT TO MALIK.
IT'S WHAT HE LIVES FOR.
PISTACHIO ALMOND AND PEPPERMINT.
YUM, ICE CREAM CAKE.
PEPPERMINT?
JUST EAT THE PISTACHIO, THEN.
OH, GOD, ANOTHER BIRTHDAY.
WE SHOULD LEAVE THE DECORATIONS UP PERMANENTLY.
IT'S CAROL HATHAWAY'S BABY SHOWER.
Marquez: IT'S A SURPRISE.
ANYBODY MISSING A PAIR OF READING GLASSES?
JUST FOUND THEM IN THE FREEZER.
MAY I SEE THOSE?
I'VE LEFT MINE IN SOME PRETTY WEIRD PLACES.
IN THE DRYER ONE TIME.
ARE THEY YOURS?
NO, BUT I THINK I KNOW WHOSE THEY ARE.
GOT A MINUTE?
I WISH I HAD.
WE CAN TALK WHILE I WORK IF YOU LIKE.
NICE OFFICE.
YEAH. YOU HAVE TO ADMIRE THE METHOD TO HIS MADNESS
NO MATTER HOW SOCIOPATHIC.
WHO?
ROMANO. THIS OFFICE.
SORRY.
YOU WANTED TO TALK?
Romano: SLUMMING AMONGST US
SIMPLE SURGICAL FOLK, DR. BENTON?
WE WERE JUST DISCUSSING A PATIENT.
OH, NOTHING THAT WAS TAKING PETER AWAY
FROM THE ELECTRIFYING EXCITEMENT OF TRAUMA MEDICINE, I HOPE?
LIZZIE, I'VE GOT A, UH, HERNIA
SCHEDULED FOR TOMORROW IN THE A.M.
AND I WAS GOING TO BE TIED UP
WITH A BREAKFAST MEETING WITH THE INSURANCE PEOPLE.
I WAS HOPING YOU COULD TAKE IT FOR ME.
IT'S A BIT EARLY-- 6:00.
IN THE MORNING?
EARLY BIRD CATCHES THE WORM.
SEEMS ONE OF THE MORE ADVANCED MEMBERS
OF YOUR E.R. BRAIN TRUST BLEW UP THE LAB
AND THE BOYS FROM THE INSURANCE COMPANY
ARE RIGHTLY CONCERNED ABOUT HOSPITAL SAFETY.
DID ANYONE GET HURT?
YOUR BOYFRIEND GOT HIS HAIR MUSSED A BIT.
MARK?
YEAH, BUT HE, UH, BOUNCED RIGHT BACK.
HAVE TO HAND IT TO HIM, HE IS A SCRAPPER.
HE'S DEAF AS A POST, BUT I UNDERSTAND
THAT'S, UH, PROBABLY TEMPORARY.
OH, OH...
UH, LIZZIE...
HOW MUCH WOULD YOU PAY FOR MY SPERM?
I BEG YOUR PARDON?
OH, IS THAT SEXUAL HARASSMENT?
OH, OH, MY.
OH, NO, I'M BEING, UH...
RECRUITED BY THE MARSHALL/HILLBERG SPERM BANK.
ITS DONORS INCLUDE OLYMPIC ATHLETES
AND NOBEL PRIZE WINNERS.
IT'S AN ELITE GENE POOL.
AND THEY WANT YOU?
YEAH, IT'S A LITTLE EMBARRASSING, ACTUALLY
UH, BUT IT'S FOR A GOOD CAUSE.
I MEAN, WHO KNOWS WHAT THE MOTHER'S SIDE
IS GOING TO BRING TO THE PARTY
BUT AS FOR MY SIDE OF THE GENETIC DIVIDE
I CAN GUARANTEE A SIGNIFICANT ADVANTAGE
OVER THE REST OF THE SPERMIC COMPETITION.
CAN'T HAVE TOO MANY
EXTRA ROMANOS RUNNING AROUND
SPICING UP THE GENE POOL, CAN WE?
HEY, WHAT HAVE WE GOT?
SHATTERED FEMUR.
ROCK CLIMBING.
55-YEAR-OLD TRYING TO KEEP UP WITH HIS MUCH-YOUNGER WIFE.
WOW, WHAT A MESS.
NOTHING LIKE MAJOR ORTHOPEDIC SURGERY
AND FOUR MONTHS IN A WHEELCHAIR
TO PROVE YOUR VITALITY TO THE FAIRER SEX.
YOU STILL LOOKING FOR YOUR READING GLASSES?
YEAH. I MEANT TO STOP BY A DRUGSTORE ON THE WAY IN
TO PICK UP ONE OF THOSE TEN-DOLLAR PAIRS.
ARE THESE THEM?
THAT'S GREAT. WHERE DID YOU FIND THEM?
IN THE FREEZER, IN THE LOUNGE.
THE FREEZER?
THAT'S ONE PLACE I DIDN'T LOOK.
THANKS.
HEY, CLEO, COULD YOU WRITE ME A PRESCRIPTION FOR KEFLEX?
I'VE GOT A SOMETIME PATIENT EIGHT MONTHS PREGNANT.
SHE HASN'T HAD PRENATAL CARE
AND HAS A BLADDER INFECTION.
WANT ME TO LOOK AT HER?
WELL, SHE'S NOT IN THE HOSPITAL.
DON'T ASK.
I JUST... I THOUGHT I'D GET HER THE PRESCRIPTION
AND HOPE THAT SHE FILLS IT.
THANK YOU.
IT'S PROBABLY THE HEART FAILURE
THAT'S MAKING HIM SICK
NOT HIS LUNGS.
I THINK THAT WE NEED TO ACCEPT
THAT THE TIME HAS COME
TO LET NATURE TAKE ITS COURSE.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.
BARRY ALWAYS MADE ALL THE IMPORTANT DECISIONS.
DO YOU KNOW WHAT
A "DO NOT RESUSCITATE" ORDER IS?
YES.
I THINK YOU NEED TO SIGN ONE
FOR YOUR HUSBAND.
WILL YOU DO THAT FOR ME?
YES.
EXCUSE ME, DR. SPIELMAN'S OFFICE.
YEAH, UH, THIRD FLOOR AND MAKE A LEFT
PAST THE M.R.I. SUITE.
DR. SPIELMAN.
KERRY, MY GOD.
HOW ARE YOU?
I'M FINE, THANKS.
STILL SACRIFICING YOURSELF TO THE ALTAR
OF THE INDIGENT DOWN AT COUNTY?
BATTLING WINDMILLS IS MORE LIKE IT.
PLEASE.
WANT SOME TEA?
NO, THANKS. NO, THANKS.
SO YOU MOVED, UH, THE OFFICE AROUND A LITTLE BIT.
YEAH, WHEN WE PUT IN THE M.R.I. SUITE.
WHAT A MESS.
SO, WHAT BRINGS YOU TO OUR HUMBLE DIGS?
JOB HUNTING, I HOPE.
NO. GABE LAWRENCE.
YOU LET HIM GO A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO.
HE LEFT THE STAFF, YES.
I HEARD IT WAS POLITICS, A BIT OF A... PALACE COUP.
WITH ME CAST AS IAGO, I SUSPECT.
I WAS WONDERING
IF THAT'S WHAT REALLY HAPPENED.
GABE LAWRENCE WAS MY CLOSEST FRIEND, MY MENTOR, MY TEACHER
AND THE FINEST DOCTOR I'VE EVER HAD THE PRIVILEGE TO WORK WITH.
HIS LEAVING WAS THE MOST
TRYING EXPERIENCE OF MY CAREER.
I HIRED HIM AT COUNTY.
I HADN'T HEARD THAT.
RENEE, I NEED TO KNOW--
SHOULD I BE CONCERNED ABOUT THE SAFETY OF MY PATIENTS
WITH DR. LAWRENCE ON MY STAFF?
HEY, HAVE YOU SEEN DR. LAWRENCE?
CHECK TRAUMA TWO.
HE'S IN WITH MALUCCI.
WHAT HAVE THEY GOT?
STAB WOUND TO THE CHEST.
Lawrence: RIB SPREADER.
SUCTION.
STILL NO PULSE.
GABE, DO YOU NEED A HAND?
NO, WE'RE FINE.
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY ABOUT TOO MANY COOKS.
HEART'S STILL BEATING.
YOU NOTICE HOW LITTLE BLOOD THERE IS
IN THE HEART ITSELF?
PULSELESS ELECTRICAL ACTIVITY.
Lawrence: ALL RIGHT, WE NEED FOUR MORE UNITS OF O-NEG.
STAB WOUND TO THE LEFT VENTRICLE.
KEEP YOUR FINGER ON IT.
I'LL DO INTERNAL COMPRESSIONS.
HOW FAST ARE YOU AT SEWING?
BLINK AND YOU'LL MISS IT.
WE NEED TWO NEEDLE DRIVERS, LOAD THEM WITH 2-0 SILK.
I'M PUTTING HIM INTO VENTRICULAR FIBRILLATION.
ARE YOU SERIOUS?
UNLESS YOU WANT TO SEW A MOVING TARGET.
WHAT AM I DOING NEXT?
SAUERBRUCH GRIP.
I EVER TELL YOU DR. WEAVER WAS THE FINEST STUDENT
I EVER HAD? HANDS DOWN.
SCARY, REALLY.
SHE KNEW THE ANSWERS BEFORE YOU COULD
ASK THE QUESTIONS. AND WHAT IS A SAUERBRUCH GRIP
DR. WEAVER?
OCCLUDE THE INFLOW FROM THE INFERIOR AND SUPERIOR VENA CAVA.
WHAT DID I TELL YOU?
WHEN HE ARRESTS, YOU'VE GOT
30 SECONDS TO FIX THIS HOLE.
GO IN HIGH WITH A HORIZONTAL MATTRESS.
"V" FIB.
CHARGE THE PADDLES TO 20.
Haleh: TWO MORE UNITS ARE IN.
KEEP THEM COMING. DON'T TIE THAT OFF TOO TIGHT.
PADDLES NOW.
LAST KNOT.
DON'T LOOK AT THE MONITOR.
LOOK AT THE HEART. THAT, MY YOUNG FRIEND
IS WHAT NORMAL SINUS RHYTHM LOOKS LIKE
INSIDE THE CHEST.
DAMN.
SHE WAS THE LAST ONE.
THEY'RE SURE?
NOBODY ELSE USED IT.
GOD, ARE THEY GOING TO FIRE HER FOR THAT?
WHO? DR. FINCH. SHE WAS THE LAST ONE USING THE BUNSEN BURNER.
YOU CAN GET FIRED FOR THAT?
IF YOU CAN GET FIRED FOR DRESS CODE VIOLATIONS
YOU CAN GET FIRED FOR BLOWING UP HALF A HOSPITAL.
FOR DRESS CODE VIOLATIONS?
IS ANYTHING OPEN? I JUST NEED IT FOR A FEW MINUTES.
DO CHRISTOPHER WALKEN AGAIN.
( as Christopher Walken ): WELL...
YOU SEE, YOU WANT A ROOM
THE ONLY ROOM THAT'S AVAILABLE...
EXAM ONE.
THANKS.
YOU'RE WELCOME.
HAVE FUN STORMING THE CASTLE.
ALL RIGHTY.
OKAY.
THERE YOU GO.
SIT UP.
ALL RIGHT, MAN LET'S GET THIS DNA STUFF OVER WITH.
SEE?
SEE?
SEE HOW EASY THAT WAS? IT DIDN'T HURT.
ALL RIGHT, YEAH.
GOOD MAN.
THERE'S MY BIG MAN.
OKAY.
I'M SORRY.
COME HERE.
EXCUSE ME, IS MEG CORWIN WORKING?
DEB, WHERE'S MEG?
ON BREAK.
SHE'S PROBABLY OUT BACK
PAST THE WATER FOUNTAIN AND THE BATHROOMS.
THANK YOU.
I GET PAID TODAY, REALLY.
HEY.
UH, CATCH YOU LATER, OKAY?
I'M OFF AT 6:30.
MAYBE.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
BROUGHT YOU YOUR PRESCRIPTION
FOR YOUR BLADDER INFECTION.
THANKS.
WHO WAS THAT GUY?
UM...
OH, MEG, YOU'RE PREGNANT.
NO KIDDING.
I DIDN'T ASK TO BE.
OH, YOU WEREN'T THERE WHEN IT HAPPENED?
THIS IS NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.
LOOK, YOU WANT TO PISS YOUR LIFE AWAY, FINE
BUT YOUR KID DESERVES A CHANCE.
I THINK YOU'RE MIXING ME UP WITH SOMEONE WHO GIVES A DAMN.
I DIDN'T LEAVE IT ON.
I WAS THERE. I SAW YOU.
I TURNED IT OFF.
YOU NEED TO TELL DR. WEAVER IT WAS YOU.
WHY WOULD I BE STUPID ENOUGH TO DO THAT?
BECAUSE DR. FINCH IS GOING TO GET FIRED.
MAYBE SHE LEFT IT ON.
BENTON'S IN WITH YOUR BROKEN ARM.
I CHECKED THE CHARTS.
HER PATIENT CAME IN AN HOUR BEFORE YOURS.
DR. FINCH WOULD HAVE BEEN IN THERE LONG BEFORE WE WERE.
I TURNED IT OFF, LUCY, HONEST.
HEY, CLEO, I GOT A 12-YEAR-OLD BOY
HIS BLOOD SUGAR'S 278.
DIABETES PREVIOUSLY DIAGNOSED?
NO, I JUST GOT THE TEST BACK.
HE OVERWEIGHT?
CRAPPY DIET? COUCH POTATO?
ALL OF THE ABOVE.
KIDS SIT AROUND EATING JUNK FOOD
AND PLAY VIDEO GAMES ALL DAY
AND BINGO, THEY'VE GOT DIABETES.
HOW DO I TREAT IT?
YOU WANT ME TO TALK TO THE FAMILY WITH YOU?
I'VE GOT SOME EXPERIENCE WITH IT.
SURE, THAT'D BE GREAT.
I'D HEARD THAT GABE HAD LOST A POWER STRUGGLE
WITH RENEE SPIELMAN
OVER SOME JUNIOR STAFF TENURE ISSUE.
AND YOU NEVER CHECKED WHEN YOU HIRED HIM?
HEY, I HAVE KNOWN GABE LAWRENCE MY ENTIRE CAREER.
HE TRAINED ME.
HE'S THE REASON I BECAME AN E.R. DOCTOR.
WHEN I HEARD THAT HE WAS FORCED OUT
I JUMPED AT THE CHANCE TO HIRE HIM.
YOU JUMPED AT THE CHANCE TO IMPRESS HIM.
STUDENT HIRES TEACHER.
OKAY.
SPIELMAN SUSPECTED SIGNS OF EARLY ALZHEIMER'S.
BUT WHEN SHE ASKED HIM
TO UNDERGO NEUROLOGICAL TESTING
HE BLEW UP AND HE QUIT.
HE HASN'T SPOKEN TO HER EVER SINCE.
YOU HAVE TO FIRE HIM.
NO, SHE WASN'T SURE.
HIS INABILITY TO COPE WITH STRESS
WANDERING AROUND THE HALLS
'CAUSE HE CAN'T REMEMBER...
HE'S ALWAYS BEEN SCATTERED.
HE COULD ENDANGER THE PATIENTS.
MARK, I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN DO IT.
I MEAN, I LOVE HIM LIKE A FATHER.
I DON'T KNOW IF I COULD FIRE HIM.
Finch: IS THERE A HISTORY OF DIABETES?
MY MOTHER HAS IT.
I THOUGHT THIS WAS SOMETHING ONLY OLD PEOPLE GET.
THIS TYPE, PRIMARILY YES.
BUT SOME CHILDREN ARE SUSCEPTIBLE TO IT.
WE NEED TO GET YOUR SON INTO A DIABETES CLINIC.
THERE'S A NEW DRUG, GLUCOPHAGE
THAT WORKS WELL FOR KIDS, BUT IT IS EXPENSIVE.
DOES YOUR INSURANCE COVER
PRESCRIPTION MEDICATIONS?
I'M NOT INSURED RIGHT NOW.
HOW EXPENSIVE?
$100 A MONTH
PLUS HE'LL NEED CONSTANT MONITORING AND CLINIC VISITS.
I CAN'T AFFORD THAT.
LOOK, YOUR SON NEEDS TO LOSE WEIGHT
EXERCISE AND CONTROL HIS DIET.
IF HE DOES ALL OF THOSE THINGS
HE MIGHT NOT NEED THE MEDICATION.
I'M STARTING A NEW JOB NEXT WEEK.
IT'S GOT GOOD BENEFITS, BUT THEY DON'T KICK IN FOR THREE MONTHS.
CAN IT WAIT TILL THEN?
THE LONGER YOUR SON WALKS AROUND WITH AN ELEVATED BLOOD SUGAR
THE MORE LIKELY HE IS TO DEVELOP COMPLICATIONS.
THIS WILL BE A PRE-EXISTING CONDITION, RIGHT?
ON MY NEW INSURANCE...
IF YOU START TREATING HIM RIGHT NOW
THEN THAT'S A PRE-EXISTING CONDITION
AND THEY WON'T COVER HIM.
OH, I DON'T KNOW THE SPECIFICS OF YOUR NEW PLAN
BUT IT'S POSSIBLE.
W-WHAT ABOUT I START HIM ON A DIET
AND GET HIM WORKING OUT?
MY MOTHER'S IN AN HMO.
SHE GETS FREE DIABETES PILLS.
HE COULD TAKE THOSE FOR THREE MONTHS.
YOUR SON NEEDS THE SUPPORT
OF A PHYSICIAN-SUPERVISED PROGRAM.
YOU CAN'T CHANGE HIS LIFESTYLE OVERNIGHT.
HE NEEDS A NUTRITIONIST
AN EXERCISE SPECIALIST, A DIABETIC EDUCATOR.
HOW MUCH IS ALL THAT GOING TO COST?
I-IT'S ONLY THREE MONTHS.
I'LL STAY ON HIM.
WE WEREN'T EVEN HERE, ALL RIGHT?
NO! YOUR SON NEEDS MEDICAL ATTENTION.
THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS DISEASE.
HE COULD SUFFER KIDNEY FAILURE
HEART DISEASE, GO BLIND.
THERE COULD BE INFECTIONS, HE COULD LOSE HIS LIMBS.
LET ME TALK TO DR. FINCH FOR A MINUTE.
I THINK YOU'RE MAKING IT WORSE.
THE MAN IS CONSIDERING WAITING THREE MONTHS
TO TREAT HIS SON'S DIABETES.
IF THE INSURANCE COMPANY WON'T COVER HIS SON
HE CAN'T AFFORD MEDICATIONS
WHAT DO YOU THINK WILL HAPPEN TO THE KID
IN THREE YEARS?
HE CAN'T TAKE HIS GRANDMOTHER'S GLYBURIDE.
HE COULD DROP HIS BLOOD SUGAR
EAT MORE AND GAIN MORE WEIGHT.
SO, WE START HIM OFF ON HALF A PILL.
TWO-AND-A-HALF MILLIGRAMS
DAD GETS HIM TO TAKE OFF SOME WEIGHT
WHEN THE INSURANCE STARTS, HE GETS BETTER CARE.
YOU ASKED ME TO HELP
BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT TYPE-TWO DIABETES IN CHILDREN.
SEDENTARY KIDS DON'T CHANGE THEIR LIFESTYLES
WITHOUT PROFESSIONAL SUPERVISION.
DAD HASN'T BEEN ABLE TO GET THE KID OFF THE SOFA
AND AWAY FROM THE PIZZAS AND POTATO CHIPS
IN THE LAST 12 YEARS.
WHAT MAKE YOU THINK HE'S GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO IT NOW?
CARTER, YOUR C.H.F. GUY'S IN V-TACH.
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE. HE'S YOUR PATIENT
BUT IF YOU LET THAT KID WALK OUT OF HERE
TO ACCOMMODATE THE FATHER'S FINANCIAL PROBLEMS
YOU'RE ENDANGERING THAT BOY'S LIFE.
BUT WHAT IS IT?
IT'S VENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA.
IT'S AN ABNORMAL HEART RHYTHM.
HOW MUCH LONGER?
A FEW MINUTES.
( crying ): A FEW MINUTES.
( breathing very fast )
( weeping ): A FEW MINUTES.
DR. LAWRENCE?
COULD I TALK TO YOU FOR A SECOND?
YEAH. WHAT'S UP?
YOU TOLD MRS. KARIS TO WAIT HERE IN CHAIRS
FOR A PRESCRIPTION OVER FOUR HOURS AGO.
OH, I'M SORRY.
SORRY, MRS. KARIS, I, UH...
I GOT TIED UP WITH OTHER PATIENTS
AND I... I COMPLETELY FORGOT ABOUT IT
AND I'M VERY SORRY.
UH, ONE PILL EVERY SIX HOURS
AND ELEVATE YOUR ANKLE AND ICE IT THREE TIMES A DAY.
GABE, CAN I TALK TO YOU IN THE LOUNGE, PLEASE?
YEAH.
THANKS, BRENDA.
THAT'S IT?
YEAH, APPRECIATE IT.
WAIT A SECOND. WHAT IS SHE DOING?
WHAT IS THIS?
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE? WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?
WHY IS SHE TAKING OFF HER ANKLE WRAP?
DR. LAWRENCE, THAT'S BRENDA BREWER.
SHE WORKS UP IN ACCOUNTING.
SHE DOESN'T HAVE AN ANKLE INJURY
AND YOU'VE NEVER SEEN HER BEFORE.
YOU TRICKED ME? PLEASE, CAN WE NOT
DO THIS OUT HERE.
IT'S BEEN VERY BUSY HERE TODAY.
I HAD SEVERAL ANKLE INJURIES.
I GOT THEM CONFUSED.
I WENT TO SEE RENEE SPIELMAN.
GABE.
GABE!
( quietly ): TIME OF DEATH IS 7:42.
MRS. CONNELLY?
HAS HE GONE?
YES.
BARRY, YOU...
YOU'RE SO SWEET. YES, YOU ARE.
I'LL MISS YOU.
I, UH...
I-I NEED TO CALL MY SON.
IS THERE A PHONE I COULD USE NEARBY?
I'LL SHOW YOU.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU, DOCTOR.
Reggie: YOU'RE SURE YOU WANT TO GO THROUGH WITH THIS?
I MEAN, JAIL ISN'T EXACTLY
THE BEST PLACE ON THE PLANET TO HAVE A BABY.
AT LEAST SHE WON'T BE HIGH.
THERE HE IS.
GOT HIM.
5-3-2-0, GOT A WHITE MALE
WITH A LEATHER JACKET AT THE ALLEY.
Officer: We see him.
WHAT HAPPENS NOW?
JUST WAIT TO SEE IF IT GOES DOWN.
BINGO.
Dispatcher: Car one. Car two.
Meg: OH, GOD... JOEY.
WHAT DO I DO?
WHERE YOU GOING, MAN?
Meg: OKAY, OKAY, OKAY, OKAY.
Officer: PILLS, SOME WEED.
WHAT'S THIS, EINSTEIN, CRANK?
KID'S A REGULAR LITTLE CASH-AND-CARRY PHARMACY.
YOU BITCH!
HOW COULD YOU DO THIS TO ME?
DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO SAY TO ME?
HOW COULD YOU DO THIS TO ME?
LUCY, HAS DR. LAWRENCE COME BACK?
NO, NOT YET.
UH... DR. WEAVER?
YEAH.
IT'S A POSSIBILITY
THAT I WAS THE LAST PERSON USING THE BUNSEN BURNER
BEFORE THE EXPLOSION THIS MORNING.
I UNDERSTAND IT'S BEEN ASSUMED
THAT DR. FINCH USED IT LAST
BUT I USED IT, AS WELL, MAYBE AFTER SHE DID.
PROBABLY AFTER SHE DID.
I THINK I TURNED IT OFF
BUT I-IT'S POSSIBLE THAT I DIDN'T
SO IT COULD'VE BEEN MY FAULT.
THE FIRE INVESTIGATOR SAID IT WAS THE GAS LINE.
THEY FOUND A RUPTURED PIPE IN THE WALL.
OH.
WELL, I... I GUESS IT WASN'T ME.
DR. MALUCCI, SAFETY IS OUR NUMBER-ONE PRIORITY HERE.
IT'S NOT ACCEPTABLE
FOR YOU TO THINK YOU LEFT ON
A POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS LAB TOOL.
ARE WE CLEAR?
YES, MA'AM.
GABE? THIS IS KERRY.
I'M AT THE HOSPITAL AND PLEASE CALL ME BACK.
DR. CARTER, CAN I COME IN?
SURE.
UM... THIS IS MY SON'S RECORD, RIGHT?
IT WAS ON THE END OF HIS BED.
YES, IT IS.
BUT IT SAYS IN HERE THAT EDDIE HAS DIABETES.
YOU PUT THAT IN HERE?
YES.
TEAR IT UP. PLEASE.
I CAN'T DO THAT.
IT'S ILLEGAL.
I'M NOT A FOOL. I LOVE MY SON.
I WOULDN'T DO ANYTHING TO HURT HIM.
BUT WE'RE JUST GETTING BACK ON OUR FEET HERE.
I DON'T HAVE THE KIND OF MONEY
THAT OTHER DOCTOR WAS TALKING ABOUT
FOR ALL THOSE SPECIALISTS AND THINGS.
I'LL HAVE MY NEW INSURANCE IN THREE MONTHS
AND IT'S GOOD.
I'LL GET EDDIE ON A DIET AND EXERCISING.
WE CAN USE MY MOM'S PILLS.
SHE GETS THOSE LITTLE KITS THAT CHECK HER BLOOD.
GLUCOSE LEVELS.
RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT.
WE'LL GET THOSE, AND IF HE'S NOT IMPROVING RIGHT AWAY
I'LL BRING HIM BACK. I'LL DO WHATEVER YOU TELL ME TO DO, BUT...
IF THERE'S A CHANCE TO DO THIS ANY OTHER WAY...
PLEASE HELP US.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
AH, I WAS DOING CHART REVIEW IN HERE THIS MORNING
AND THE SPRINKLERS SOAKED EVERYTHING.
I JUST DID SOMETHING AND NOW I'M NOT SO SURE
IT WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO.
OH, YEAH? ME, TOO.
REALLY?
YEAH, ABOUT AN HOUR AGO.
WHAT?
I JUST, UH...
DESTROYED WHAT LITTLE IS LEFT
OF A GOOD MAN'S CAREER.
WHAT'D YOU DO?
GOT A...
A PREGNANT JUNKIE ARRESTED FOR POSSESSION
SO SHE COULD GET CLEAN IN JAIL
AND GIVE THE BABY A CHANCE.
( sighs )
WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT?
WE COULD DROWN OUR SORROWS
IN A COUPLE OF GINGER ALES.
NO, THANKS.
THE GIRLS ARE THROWING ME A SURPRISE BABY SHOWER.
THOUGHT THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A SURPRISE.
I'LL LOOK SURPRISED.
I MISS DOUG.
YOU CALL HIM?
HAS HE CALLED YOU?
HE LEAVES MESSAGES ON MY MACHINE.
I THINK HE CALLS WHEN HE KNOWS I WON'T BE THERE
SO I DON'T HAVE TO TALK TO HIM IF I DON'T WANT TO.
YOU DON'T WANT TO?
I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE THERE IS TO SAY.
RAIN CHECK ON THAT GINGER ALE?
SURE.
OKAY.
HEY, MALIK.
YEAH.
YOU SEEN THE T-SHEET ON THE BERNERO KID'S CHART?
THE DIABETES KID?
WHY IS IT SO HARD TO KEEP THE T-SHEETS ON THE CHARTS?
IT WAS THERE A WHILE AGO.
YEAH, I HATE THIS. NOW I GOT TO FILL OUT A WHOLE NEW CHART.
I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THIS CRAP.
RANDI, BERNERO KID IN CURTAIN THREE CAN GO HOME.
JUST A LITTLE CASE OF THE STOMACH FLU.
KICK HIM OUT OF THERE. WE NEED THE BED.
RANDI, HAVE YOU SEEN KERRY?
UM, CURTAIN TWO.
THANKS.
HEY! HOW'S THE BABY?
HE'S DOING GREAT.
WE'RE HAVING A BABY SHOWER FOR CAROL. STOP BY.
YEAH, I'LL TRY.
ALL RIGHT.
HANG A BANANA BAG AND TRY TO DRESS THOSE ABRASIONS.
I THINK HE FELL ON HIS FACE AGAIN.
KERRY, MALIK CALLED.
SAID IT WAS IMPORTANT I COME IN.
YEAH, YOU KNOW, I CHECKED YOUR TIME CARDS
AND YOU'VE WORKED TWO DAYS IN THE LAST THREE WEEKS.
WE DEPEND ON YOU DOWN HERE
AND WHEN YOU CALL IN AT THE LAST MINUTE
IT JUST MAKES IT TOUGH ON EVERYBODY ELSE.
I'M NOT COMING BACK.
I'M SORRY, I DIDN'T MEAN TO MAKE IT TOUGH ON EVERYBODY.
I DIDN'T INTEND TO.
I SHOULD'VE COME TO TALK TO YOU EARLIER.
WELL, IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?
I'VE NEVER BEEN HAPPIER.
I HAVE REGGIE AND THE BABY
AND EVERY TIME I'M AT WORK
I WANT TO BE HOME WITH THEM.
THAT'S GREAT.
IF YOU NEED ME TO WORK A FEW SHIFTS...
NO, NO, NO.
BUT AS THE BABY GETS OLDER
AND DOESN'T NEED YOU SO MUCH, CALL ME.
THERE WILL ALWAYS BE A JOB FOR YOU HERE.
THANKS, KERRY.
I'M GOING TO MISS YOU.
I'M GOING TO MISS YOU, TOO.
HEY.
HELLO, BABY.
ROGER WAS GOING TO PICK HIM UP
AT YOUR PLACE LATER.
YEAH, I KNOW, I KNOW.
UH, ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW WHAT? I CALLED HIM AND TOLD HIM
I WAS GOING TO DROP REESE OFF MYSELF.
ROGER!
REESE IS HERE.
HEY, I, UM...
I GOT THIS DNA KIT...
TO TEST FOR PATERNITY.
AND?
AND I'M NOT GOING TO USE IT.
I'M GOING TO THROW IT AWAY.
WHY?
CARLA...
I PUT MY HAND ON YOUR STOMACH
WHEN YOU WERE PREGNANT...
AND I FELT HIM MOVE.
AND I WAS THERE WHEN HE WAS BORN
AND ALL THOSE NIGHTS IN THE NICU.
I WAKE UP IN THE MORNING--
THAT LITTLE BOY IS THE FIRST THING ON MY MIND.
I GO TO SLEEP AT NIGHT, HE'S THE LAST.
I LOVE HIM.
HE'S MY SON.
I DON'T CARE ABOUT BIOLOGY.
I DON'T NEED SOME DAMN DNA KIT
TO TELL ME THAT.
I DON'T HAVE A WHOLE LOT IN MY LIFE, CARLA.
MY CAREER... ( scoffs ).
JACKIE AND HER KIDS AND THAT BOY.
HE MEANS MORE TO ME
THAN ALL THE REST OF THEM COMBINED.
I'D LAY DOWN IN FRONT OF A TRAIN FOR HIM.
THAT'S HOW I LOVE HIM.
SO I'M ASKING YOU.
I AM...
I'M ASKING YOU...
PLEASE...
DON'T... DON'T... DON'T TAKE MY SON AWAY FROM ME.
PLEASE.
CAROL...
WEAVER NEEDS YOU AT THE DESK.
SOMETHING ABOUT OVERTIME.
GREAT. OKAY.
All: SURPRISE!
OH, MY GOD.
YOU GUYS.
YOU DIDN'T KNOW?
I HAD NO IDEA.
( all clamoring )
WE HAVE NO MONEY ANYMORE.
( all laughing )
OH, THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL!
DR. WEAVER, DR. LAWRENCE IS DOWN IN TRAUMA TWO.
YOU WERE LOOKING FOR HIM, RIGHT?
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?
OUT WALKING BY THE LAKE.
I WAS WORRIED ABOUT YOU.
"WHEN DESPAIR FOR THE WORLD GROWS IN ME
"I GO AND LIE DOWN
"WHERE THE WOOD DRAKE RESTS IN HIS BEAUTY ON THE WATER
"AND THE GREAT HERON FEEDS.
"I COME INTO THE PEACE OF WILD THINGS
"WHO DO NOT TAX THEIR LIVES
"WITH FORETHOUGHT OF GRIEF.
"I COME INTO THE PRESENCE
"OF STILL WATER AND FEEL ABOVE ME
"THE DAY-BLIND STARS WAITING WITH THEIR LIGHT
"AND, FOR A TIME, I REST
"IN THE PEACE OF THE WORLD
AND AM FREE."
HOW CAN I REMEMBER A WILLIAM BLAKE POEM
I MEMORIZED OVER 30 YEARS AGO AND NOT REMEMBER
THAT I SAW A WOMAN WITH A SPRAINED ANKLE THIS AFTERNOON.
I STARTED TO NOTICE SOMETHING WAS WRONG
ABOUT A YEAR AGO.
YOU KNOW...
MEMORY LOSS AND...
NOT BEING ABLE TO FIND THE RIGHT WORD.
I WENT TO BOSTON TO SEE AN OLD CLASSMATE OF MINE--
A NEUROLOGIST.
HE DID A PET SCAN AND IT SHOWED
BILATERAL HYPOPERFUSION TO THE PARIETAL AREAS.
HE STARTED ME ON ARICEPT.
IT'S SUPPOSED
TO PUT THE BRAKES ON... ON... ON... ON THE ALZHEIMER'S
BUT I GUESS... I GUESS IT, UH...
IT DIDN'T HELP ENOUGH.
ROZ CHOW IS DOING GREAT WORK UPSTAIRS
AT THE COMPREHENSIVE DEMENTIA CENTER.
YOU SHOULD GO SEE HER.
WHAT FOR?
I HAVE A PROGRESSIVE NEUROLOGIC DISORDER.
THEY'RE WORKING WITH NEUROTROPINS
AND ANTIOXIDANTS.
MAYBE YOU COULD GET INTO A CLINICAL TRIAL.
I WAS THINKING OF COMMITTING SUICIDE.
I CAN'T FIGURE OUT THE BEST TIME TO DO IT.
TOO EARLY AND I'LL MISS WHAT LITTLE LIFE I HAVE LEFT.
IF I WAIT TOO LONG, I WON'T REMEMBER TO DO IT.
( sobbing )
PLEASE DON'T SAY THAT.
GOD, I'M GOING TO MISS THIS, YOU KNOW?
YOU KNOW, MEDICINE HAS BEEN MY WHOLE LIFE.
NO. NO, YOU COULD STAY ON...
AND YOU COULD LECTURE THE MEDICAL STUDENTS
AND THE RESIDENTS.
BUT NOT SEE PATIENTS, RIGHT?
GABE, YOU ARE A BRILLIANT DOCTOR AND YOU ARE A WONDERFUL TEACHER.
PLEASE... PLEASE DON'T GIVE UP THOSE GIFTS.
( sighs )
I SAW A WOMAN THIS MORNING...
DEMENTIA... SHE HAD...
SHE HAD NO IDEA WHERE SHE WAS.
SHE DIDN'T KNOW WHO SHE WAS.
TEN YEARS, THAT'LL BE ME.
BEDRIDDEN...
IN DIAPERS...
LOCKED AWAY IN SOME HOME.
NOBODY COMING TO SEE ME.
I'LL COME AND SEE YOU.
YEAH, BUT I WON'T... I WON'T KNOW YOU'RE THERE.
( laughing and talking )
