ONE MINUTE I'M FREEZING, THE NEXT I'M BURNING UP.
I CAN'T KEEP ANYTHING DOWN.
SIR, IT'S PROBABLY THE FLU. IT'S GOING AROUND.
I GOT BODY ACHES, NASTY COUGH...
I REALLY NEED TO SEE A DOCTOR.
( sneezes )
HAVE A SEAT. WE'LL GET TO YOU IN A MINUTE.
THAT'S WHAT YOU SAID AN HOUR AGO!
( coughing )
HEY, I NEED TO GO HOME, CHIEF.
FORGET IT, MALUCCI.
WE'RE SHORTHANDED AS IT IS.
I PUKED UP MY BREAKFAST. I GOT TO GO.
SO DID HALF THE RADIOLOGY TECHS.
I GOT A FEVER, ALL RIGHT? FEEL MY HEAD.
FEEL YOUR OWN HEAD.
Greene: COLD AND FLU SEASON HAS HIT WITH A VENGEANCE.
YES, TAKE YOUR PICK.
FEVER, SORE THROATS
RUNNY NOSES, ASSORTED ACHES AND PAINS, VOMITING--
WHY DON'T THESE PEOPLE GO HOME?
MY POINT EXACTLY. I GOT IT COMING OUT BOTH ENDS.
THANKS FOR SHARING, DAVE.
OKAY, THE LAB IS BACKED UP.
IT'S TAKING FOUR HOURS TO GET A C.B.C.
THEY'RE 40 BEHIND IN TRIAGE.
YOU LOOK AWFUL, KERRY.
YEAH, AND I LOOK BETTER THAN I FEEL.
THERE'S NO TELEMETRY BEDS.
WE'RE BOARDING SEVEN PATIENTS.
CAROL CALLED IN TWO REGISTRY NURSES.
GOD ONLY KNOWS WHEN THEY'LL GET HERE.
( coughing )
NASTY COUGH, KERRY.
YOU SHOULD SEE A DOCTOR.
YEAH, I SHOULD, TOO.
YOU DON'T WANT ME EXPOSING PATIENTS, DO YOU?
TAKE SOME IMODIUM. WEAR A MASK.
( groaning )
DID YOU TOUCH THE THERMOSTAT?
NO, I JUST CLEANED OUT THE SEDIMENT.
MORNING, MARK.
MORNING. MORNING, MARK.
DID YOU LET THE FAUCETS RUN?
FOR, LIKE, TEN MINUTES. IT WAS FREEZING COLD.
I HAD TO BOIL WATER ON THE STOVE
AND WASH MY HAIR IN THE SINK.
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO CALL A PLUMBER NOW.
LET ME LOOK AT IT AGAIN.
A PLUMBER WILL WANT TO SELL YOU A NEW ONE.
IT'S OLD, NOT DEAD.
WHAT?
KOVAC IS FIXING YOUR WATER HEATER?
WELL, TRYING TO FIX IT.
HE WAS DROPPING ME OFF, MARK.
OH. FROM WORK.
I WAS COMPLAINING ABOUT IT MAKING SOME NOISE...
WHY AM I EVEN EXPLAINING THIS TO YOU?
BEATS ME.
NO, IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK.
AND WHAT AM I THINKING?
I DON'T KNOW, BUT IT'S NOT.
IT'S NOT WHAT?
IT'S NOT ANYTHING.
IF YOU'VE GOT THE FLU EXCUSE ME.
IT'S TOO LATE FOR A FLU SHOT!
EXCUSE ME, MY NAME IS ABBY LOCKHART...
E.R., PLEASE HOLD. E.R., PLEASE HOLD.
E.R.
ABBY. YEAH.
DID THEY SEND YOU DOWN HERE?
UM, YEAH.
I WAS WONDERING WHEN THEY WERE GOING TO GET SOME HELP.
CAROL.
HATHAWAY! RIGHT.
YOU WERE MY O.B. NURSE.
RIGHT-- TWIN GIRLS. HOW ARE THEY DOING?
GREAT. SLEEPING THROUGH THE NIGHT
JUST NOT AT THE SAME TIME.
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU DO IT.
IT'S NOT EASY, BUT NEITHER IS MANAGING 36 PATIENTS
WHEN WE'RE SHORT TWO NURSES.
WELL, ACTUALLY... Lucy: COMING THROUGH!
FOUND HIM IN THE EL STATION.
HE COULDN'T WALK. WHAT'S OPEN, CAROL?
UH, IF YOU CAN FIND A BED, GRAB IT.
SORRY, SORRY.
SOMEBODY CALL HOUSEKEEPING.
YEAH, GREAT. MED STUDENTS.
THEY THINK WE'RE THEIR MAIDS.
WE ARE SO SWAMPED.
RIGHT, BUT ACTUALLY...
CAN YOU SEND MR. SRANSKI UP FOR A CHEST FILM?
WHO'S SRANSKI? FLU PATIENT.
OH, THAT HELPS.
WE NEED TO GET YOU SOME SCRUBS.
HALEH, DO WE HAVE ANY EXTRA SCRUBS?
I DON'T KNOW AND I DON'T CARE.
WE REALLY DO GET ALONG.
HEY, CAROL, YOU BELIEVE IN ZOMBIES?
WHAT? NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD?
HUMAN CADAVERS WALKING THE EARTH AFTER THEY'VE DIED?
NO. THEN WHAT'S EARL CARTESH'S BODY
STILL DOING IN EXAM ONE?
I CALLED TRANSPORT.
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?
PIGGYBACK HIM TO THE MORGUE. I NEED THE BED.
RESIDENTS-- THE ONLY THING WORSE THAN MED STUDENTS.
RIGHT.
COULD SOMEBODY TAKE THIS? I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR FIVE MINUTES.
DID YOU CALL AHEAD?
YEAH. TODD SULLIVAN, FIVE.
HE TOOK A NASTY HEADER WHILE SLEDDING.
MOM'S ON HER WAY.
I LOST MY TEETH!
OH, SWEETIE, DON'T WORRY.
I BET THEY WERE JUST YOUR BABY TEETH.
HEY, MALIK, CAN YOU CALL A DOC?
Malik: YEAH, RIGHT. GOOD LUCK.
HE'S AVULSED HIS FRONT INCISORS.
WE NEED A C-SPINE AND A HEAD C.T.
IF WE CAN FIND A DOC TO ORDER IT.
I COULD DO IT. WHAT?
MED STUDENTS WORK UP PATIENTS, RIGHT?
YEAH.
I'M A THIRD-YEAR. I START MY E.R. ROTATION TODAY.
YOU'RE A MED STUDENT?
YES.
WHAT CAN I SAY? I CROSSED OVER TO THE DARK SIDE.
HIS FACIAL FILMS ARE CLEAR AND I PAGED AN ORAL SURGEON.
UPDATE HIS TETANUS?
HE HAD ONE A YEAR AGO.
Kovac: UH, GUESS NOT. I'M LUKA KOVAC.
ABBY LOCKHART. I'M A THIRD-YEAR.
ANOTHER NEW RESIDENT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE YEAR.
OH. WELL, I'M A MED STUDENT.
ANOTHER HALF GRAM OF ANCEF?
UM, ABBY?
UH, SURE. SOUNDS GOOD.
OKAY, NICE JOB.
WELL, WE NEVER HAD DOCTORS LIKE THAT UP IN O.B.
EASY ON THE EYES, ISN'T HE? I'LL SAY.
IS HE SINGLE?
HE DOESN'T TALK ABOUT HIS PERSONAL LIFE.
OOH. TALL, DARK, HANDSOME AND MYSTERIOUS.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING? CLEANING UP.
I GOT IT. DON'T BE SILLY.
NO, REALLY. I GOT IT.
OKAY.
UM, CAROL.
I'D LOVE TO SEE PICTURES OF YOUR GIRLS.
SURE.
Greene: HE HAS TO TAKE
HIS BLOOD PRESSURE PILLS EVERY DAY.
WELL, SOMETIMES HE FORGETS.
WELL, MAYBE YOU CAN REMIND HIM.
SOMETIMES I FORGET.
WELL, MAYBE YOU CAN PUT A NOTE
ON YOUR MEDICINE CABINET TO REMIND YOU.
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.
I'LL TRY TO REMEMBER THAT.
HEY, MARK.
I'M FEELING HORRIBLE.
CAN YOU COVER MY SHIFT?
I DON'T REMEMBER YOU TAKING A SICK DAY.
WELL, I'D RATHER DIE AT HOME.
OH, AND WE HAVE A NEW MEDICAL STUDENT.
MAKE SURE SHE DOESN'T KILL ANYONE.
HEY, MALUCCI, LEAVE HER ALONE.
ABBY? GIVE ME A BREAK, CHIEF.
YEAH, SUCK IT UP.
ABBY LOCKHART, THIRD YEAR
MARK GREENE, ATTENDING.
WE'VE MET. GOOD, I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW
IF I LIVE THROUGH THE NIGHT.
SO SHE WASN'T HALLUCINATING?
NO, I'M A MED STUDENT.
AND AN O.B. NURSE. I TAKE A SHIFT OCCASIONALLY
TO PAY THE BILLS.
WELL, WELCOME TO THE GLORY THAT IS E.R.
HAS ANYBODY GIVEN YOU THE THREE-DOLLAR TOUR?
NOT YET. YOU START HERE
BY SIGNING UP FOR YOUR PATIENT ON THE BOARD.
GRAB A T-SHEET BASED ON THE CHIEF COMPLAINT.
NURSES ORDERS GO HERE.
LAB AND X RAYS GO HERE FOR THE CLERK.
ANY QUESTIONS?
SO FAR, SO GOOD. THAT'S CURTAIN AREA ONE.
THIS IS CURTAIN AREA TWO.
THAT'S YOSH TAKATA.
WAVE "HI" TO YOSH.
THAT'S TRAUMA ONE, TRAUMA TWO.
HALEH. WE'VE MET.
HI. STILL HURTING, TODD?
A LITTLE.
YEAH? WE GAVE HIM FOUR OF MORPHINE.
CAN WE GIVE HIM TWO MORE?
WHY NOT?
YOU SURE YOU NEED THIS TOUR? COULDN'T HURT.
THEN, COME ON.
THE TRAM DOESN'T STOP.
KEEP YOUR ARMS INSIDE AT ALL TIMES.
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT, CARTER?
THIS IS DARNEL SMITH, 13, WITH MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY
VISITING US TODAY WITH A POSSIBLE FOREARM FRACTURE.
WHAT HAPPENED, DARNEL?
SOME LOSER PUSHED ME DOWN THE STAIRS.
IN YOUR WHEELCHAIR?
DUH!
YEAH, HE GOT INTO A FIGHT AT SCHOOL.
CLEO'S GOT THE PUSHER.
WELL, LET'S KEEP THE TWO OF THEM APART, SHALL WE?
OH, THAT WAS CARTER. GOT IT.
AND THIS IS THE PEDES E.R.
IT'S REALLY JUST A LARGE EXAM ROOM
WITH PEDIATRIC EQUIPMENT
AND MURALS ON THE WALL.
HEY, CLEO.
HEY.
I WAS JUST GOING TO CLASS
AND HE JUST STARTED FREAKING OUT ON ME IN THE HALLWAY
WHEN I TRIED TO GET PAST HIM.
THAT'S NO REASON TO PUSH A KID DOWN THE STEPS
ESPECIALLY A KID IN A WHEELCHAIR.
COME ON, I DIDN'T EVEN PUSH THE PSYCHO
UNTIL HE STABBED ME WITH HIS PENCIL.
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT?
Woman: DARNEL, DON'T BE RUDE.
WELL, THE GOOD NEWS IS HIS ARM'S NOT BROKEN.
I CAN'T BELIEVE ONE OF HIS CLASSMATES
WOULD BE CRUEL ENOUGH TO DO THIS.
WELL, I HEARD HE MIGHT HAVE PROVOKED IT.
DARNEL, IS THAT TRUE?
NO.
HE'S BEEN ACTING UP LATELY
AT HOME AND AT SCHOOL.
IS HE IN SPECIAL ED?
NO, HE'S IN A REGULAR CLASSROOM.
WE WANTED HIS LIFE TO BE AS NORMAL AS POSSIBLE.
YOU HAVE CANCER.
THEY'RE GOING TO CHOP OFF YOUR PENIS.
Mother: DARNEL!
THAT'S ENOUGH OF THAT! HE'S JUST KIDDING.
MRS. HENRY, WHY DON'T YOU GO WAIT IN CHAIRS?
I DON'T LIKE TO LEAVE HIM ALONE.
WELL, I STILL NEED TO CHECK HIM FOR OTHER INJURIES.
OH, ALL RIGHT.
YOU BEHAVE YOURSELF, AND I'LL BE RIGHT OUT
IN THE WAITING AREA IF YOU NEED ANYTHING, HONEY.
SO, DARNEL, SOUNDS LIKE
YOU'RE HAVING A LITTLE TROUBLE IN SCHOOL.
THAT WOULDN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO
WITH YOUR MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY, WOULD IT?
SO, SUDDENLY, YOU DON'T SPEAK.
I CAN'T FEEL MY TOES.
IT LOOKS LIKE YOU HAVE FROSTBITE, MR. CLAYTON.
DO WE NEED TO DEBRIDE?
IS HE DIABETIC?
NO, HE HAS A RESPIRATORY INFECTION--
PROBABLY THE FLU-- BUT HIS LUNGS ARE WET.
THE SKIN'S PLIABLE.
FROSTBITE'S SUPERFICIAL.
START HIM ON A RAPID REWARM
OF 105 DEGREE CIRCULATING WATER FOR 20 MINUTES, OKAY?
ANYBODY IN THIS CITY NOT SICK?
IT'S LIKE THE DAMN PLAGUE DOWN HERE.
I DON'T SUPPOSE YOU'RE HERE TO LEND A HELPING HAND?
WHY MESS WITH NATURAL SELECTION?
A GOOD INFLUENZA EPIDEMIC THINS THE HERD.
WHERE'S KERRY?
SHE WENT HOME SICK.
AND THEY WONDER WHY WE CALL THEM THE WEAKER SEX.
OH, DID YOU BOOK AN O.R. FOR 3:00?
OH, YEAH, I SAW AN OPENING, SO I GRABBED IT.
I'M ASSISTING DR. ASHCOFF
ON A FACIAL SCAR REVISION.
WHY CAN'T THAT BE DONE IN THE PLASTICS CLINIC?
MULTIPLE SCARS. ASHCOFF WANTS TO DO IT UNDER GENERAL.
AND WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO WITH YOU?
THE LITTLE GIRL IS A PATIENT OF MINE
FOLLOWING UP ON A DOG-BITE TRAUMA FROM SIX MONTHS AGO.
YEAH, SO?
WELL, MEDICAID WON'T COVER IT
SO I GOT ASHCOFF TO DONATE HIS TIME.
I WAS HOPING THAT THE HOSPITAL...
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
WE PROVIDE MEDICALLY-NECESSARY SERVICES TO THE POOR.
THAT DOES NOT INCLUDE COSMETIC SURGERY.
WHAT'S NEXT-- LIPOSUCTION FOR FAT KIDS?
THE LITTLE GIRL IS DISFIGURED.
LOOK, PETER, I ADMIRE YOUR NOBLE EFFORT
BUT THIS IS EXACTLY THE KIND OF THING
THAT COULD LOSE OUR STATE FUNDING, OKAY?
I'M SORRY, BIG GUY.
I WON'T GET LEAD POISONING FROM THE PENCIL?
THEY USE GRAPHITE IN PENCILS.
TEMP'S 99.2.
DID THAT HURT?
UH, NO, NO.
IT'S JUST COLD.
OH, SORRY.
HOW'D YOU GET THESE BRUISES?
UH, I DON'T KNOW.
WHO HIT YOU, MARTY?
SOME KIDS AT SCHOOL.
ARE YOU SURE? YEAH, I'M SURE.
I MEAN, I'M THERE WHEN THEY DO IT.
DO YOUR PARENTS KNOW ABOUT THIS?
NO.
WHAT ABOUT THE TEACHERS OR THE PRINCIPAL?
YEAH, SO THAT THEY CAN REALLY KILL ME?
WHAT'S THIS?
MOSQUITO BITES.
IN FEBRUARY?
THEY MUST BE HUNGRY. YOU HAVE QUITE A FEW.
LOOK, IS MY DAD COMING?
HE'S ON HIS WAY.
I'LL BE BACK.
GET A C.B.C.
CHEM 20 AND A TOX SCREEN.
THOSE ARE INFECTED TRACK MARKS.
Greene: WHAT EXACTLY AM I LOOKING FOR?
TOP OF PAGE FOUR.
I WAS ENJOYING MY FIRST FREE MORNING.
SAT DOWN WITH THE PAPER WHEN I SPOTTED IT.
WHAT?
OH, FOR PETE'S SAKE!
"THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO'S
DEPARTMENT OF ASTROPHYSICS..."
BLAH, BLAH, BLAH...
"WILL PRESENT A SYMPOSIUM..."
BLAH, BLAH...
"GUEST SPEAKERS INCLUDE..."
"ISABELLE CORDAY." YOUR MOTHER.
YES.
I SEE THE RESEMBLANCE.
I LOOK LIKE MY FATHER.
SO YOU DIDN'T TELL ME YOUR MOTHER'S COMING TO TOWN.
I DIDN'T KNOW.
IT'S SO LIKE HER.
YOU GUYS HAVING A FIGHT?
NO, NO. SHE'S JUST BEING MOTHER.
YOU SHOULD CALL HER.
OF COURSE.
I'M SUPPOSED TO COME TO HER.
THAT'S PART OF THE GAME.
OR DON'T CALL HER.
I WON'T. I'M NOT PLAYING ANYMORE.
Man: GET OFF ME!
I'LL KILL YOU! I'LL KILL YOU!
HOLD STILL.
IS HE TRYING TO HURT HIMSELF?
NO, HE'S JUST FREAKING OUT.
IS HE ON ANY MEDICATION?
HE'S ON DRUGS.
LOOKS LIKE PCP.
WHAT HAPPENED?
JUMPED OUT OF A THIRD-STORY WINDOW.
LET ME GO! I'LL KILL YOU!
HE TRIED TO WALK AWAY.
HE'LL FEEL SOMETHING SOON.
CAN YOU GET OUT OF THE WAY? WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
I'M TAPING THIS SO HE CAN SEE WHAT HE ACTS LIKE.
WE'RE TRYING TO HELP.
Corday: BILATERAL TIBIAL DEFORMITIES.
HE'S BROKEN BOTH LEGS, EXPOSED BONE.
YOU EVER SEEN AN OPEN FRACTURE?
NOT UP CLOSE.
HE'S TACHING AWAY.
PULSE IS STRONG. ( screaming )
GIVE HIM TEN OF HALDOL I.M.
GET THAT OUT OF HERE.
CAN YOU BACK UP AND LET THE DOCTOR WORK?
NO, NO, THIS IS TOO GOOD.
NOW!
Corday: C.B.C., CHEM PANEL
TOX SCREEN, U.A. AND A MYOGLOBIN.
I'M GOING TO KILL YOU, YOU BITCH!
I NEED THAT HALDOL NOW!
YOU WANT RESTRAINTS OR HALDOL?
Corday: TETANUS BOOSTER I GOT IT.
GRAM OF ANCEF
AND 100 OF GENT.
OKAY.
ROLL HIM.
GIVE IT IN THE THIGH ANTERIOR.
( man panting )
( screaming )
Corday: I'M GOING TO NEED A CULTURE SWAB.
SET ME UP FOR A P.M. SPLINT!
Man: LET ME GO.
( screaming continues )
YOU'VE HAD HEPTOVAX, RIGHT?
YEAH. PATIENTS GENERALLY DON'T BITE IN O.B.
IT'S AN OCCUPATIONAL HAZARD DOWN HERE.
SEROLOGIES WILL BE BACK TOMORROW.
DON'T SWEAT IT.
BET YOU DIDN'T EXPECT TO BE YOUR OWN TEACHING CASE.
WELL, I EXPECTED THE E.R. TO BE DIFFERENT.
Malucci: OW.
WELL, IF YOU WOULD STOP SQUIRMING
I COULD GET IT IN. COULD YOU BE ANY ROUGHER?
COULD YOU WHINE ANY MORE?
HEY, DAVE, BE GLAD
SHE'S NOT PUTTING IN A FOLEY.
WE HAVE A TRADITION DOWN HERE
THAT ONCE YOU'VE BEEN BITTEN BY A RAVING LUNATIC
YOU'RE READY TO SEE PATIENTS.
I DON'T KNOW.
GRAB A CHART, AND YELL IF YOU GET INTO TROUBLE.
OKAY.
CAROL?
CAN YOU KEEP AN EYE ON HER?
SURE. OH, AND UPDATE HER TETANUS.
I WANT YOU TO PRESS ON MY HAND
LIKE YOU'RE STEPPING ON THE GAS.
THAT'S GOOD.
LET'S DO THE OTHER FOOT.
DO YOU DO MUCH DRIVING, DARNEL?
OKAY.
OKAY. NOW, I WANT YOU TO SQUEEZE MY HAND
AND IF YOU MAKE ME SCREAM, I'LL GIVE YOU A PRIZE.
GIVE ME A BREAK.
HE SPEAKS.
OKAY, COME ON.
I WANT TO SEE IF THE M.D.'s AFFECTING YOUR BODY.
DUCHENNE'S MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY IS AN X-LINK GENETIC DISORDER
CHARACTERIZED BY THE PROGRESSIVE WASTING
OF SKELETAL MUSCLES.
FIRST YOU LOSE YOUR LEGS, THEN YOUR ARMS
AND THEN YOU DIE.
THAT'S HOW IT'S AFFECTING MY BODY.
I WANT YOU TO HOLD HIS HEAD STILL.
I'M SORRY. HE'S JUST GOTTEN
TO THE POINT WHERE HE REALLY HATES HOSPITALS.
IT'S OKAY, CONNER. DON'T BE AFRAID.
WE WANT TO MAKE YOU BETTER.
HE'S REALLY A GOOD-NATURED KID, YOU KNOW
CONSIDERING EVERYTHING HE'S BEEN THROUGH.
WHAT KIND OF SURGERY HAS HE HAD?
HE HAD A NISSEN FUNDOPLICATION
FOR GASTROESOPHAGEAL REFLUX.
HE'S HAD A HEMICOLECTOMY
AND A FEW LAPAROTOMIES FOR ADHESIONS.
WHEN DID HE START VOMITING?
THIS MORNING.
MUCOUS MEMBRANES ARE MOIST.
WERE YOU FEEDING HIM ORALLY
OR THROUGH HIS G-TUBE?
I GAVE HIM A LITTLE BIT BY MOUTH LAST NIGHT
BUT NOT ENOUGH TO INDUCE THIS.
I'M PRAYING IT'S JUST THE FLU
BUT I'M AFRAID HE'S GOT ANOTHER BOWEL OBSTRUCTION.
ABBY, CAN YOU GET THIS?
WE HAVE FOREIGN BODY INGESTION IN EXAM TWO.
SURE, JUST A SEC.
CAN I STEAL ABBY FROM YOU?
WE'RE REALLY BACKING UP OUT THERE.
YEAH, IT'S OKAY. GO AHEAD.
WHAT DO YOU THINK IT IS?
I'M NOT SURE.
WE'LL HAVE TO TAKE SOME X RAYS FIRST.
CAROL, CAN I GET A WEIGHT
AND A THREE-WAY ABDOMINAL SERIES?
SURE.
YOU DEHYDRATED OR SOMETHING?
HOW'D YOU GUESS?
JEREMY BARNES, THREE DAYS OF ABDOMINAL CRAMPING
SOME DIARRHEA, MAYBE A LOW-GRADE FEVER
WITH A HISTORY OF A TRIPLE-A.
HOW ARE YOU FEELING, SIR?
LOUSY.
MM-HMM. ANY VOMITING?
NO, BUT I FEEL REAL NAUSEOUS.
WHEN WAS YOUR ANEURYSM REPAIRED?
YEAR AND A HALF AGO.
ANY COMPLICATIONS?
NO COMPLICATIONS.
I WAS FEELING GREAT UNTIL LAST WEEK.
BELLY'S BENIGN. IT'S JUST THE FLU.
THANK YOU. YOU'RE WELCOME.
MAYBE HE'S TELLING THE TRUTH.
KIDS HIS AGE, SCHOOL CAN GET KIND OF ROUGH.
THIS ISN'T ROUGHHOUSING.
HE HAS SKIN-POPPING ABSCESSES.
GET A TOX SCREEN?
IT'S NEGATIVE. ONLY THE WHITE COUNT'S UP.
HE'S CLEAN. YOU CAN'T BE SURE.
TOX SCREEN DOESN'T COVER EVERYTHING.
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?
I DON'T KNOW, BUT MAYBE YOU
CAN BLUFF IT OUT OF HIM.
YOU OKAY? SOMEBODY STOLE MY PATIENT.
PETER, DID YOU STEAL LUCY'S PATIENT?
CHECK THE LOST AND FOUND.
DR. BENTON?
HI.
HI. I TOOK TIA UP TO SURGERY TO REGISTER
AND THE NURSE SAID SHE CAN'T HAVE HER OPERATION TODAY?
UH, YOU KNOW, ACTUALLY, I TRIED TO CALL YOU.
PLEASE HAVE A SEAT.
UM, THERE'S AN AVAILABILITY PROBLEM IN THE O.R.
MM-HMM. DID DR. ASHCOFF CHANGE HIS MIND?
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
WE JUST HAVE TO RESCHEDULE.
WE CAME ALL THE WAY DOWN HERE.
WE CAN WAIT.
TIA HASN'T EATEN IN EIGHT HOURS, LIKE YOU SAID.
WE CAN'T... DO IT TODAY.
I'M... I'M SORRY.
I'M NOT GOING TO GET THEM FIXED?
YOU WAITED THIS LONG.
A FEW MORE DAYS ISN'T GOING TO HURT.
HOLD ON A MINUTE, HONEY.
CAN WE...?
IT HAS TAKEN ME MONTHS
TO GET TIA TO STEP OUT OF THE HOUSE.
I CAN'T GIVE HER FALSE HOPE.
NOW, IF THIS ISN'T GOING TO HAPPEN
YOU NEED TO TELL US.
IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.
I JUST NEED A LITTLE TIME, THAT'S ALL.
THANKS.
MR. BARNES NEEDS FIVE OF COMPAZINE.
THEN RUN A LITER OF SALINE THROUGH
AND CHECK HIS ELECTROLYTES.
CAN'T YOU GET A NURSE TO DO THAT?
RUMOR HAS IT YOU USED TO BE A NURSE.
WELL, THAT'S NOT WHY I'M HERE.
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. YOU'RE HERE TO LEARN
AND THIS IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY
FOR YOU TO LEARN HOW TO CHECK
HIS STOOL FOR FECAL LEUKOCYTES.
THANKS.
WHAT'S HIS PULSE OX?
DOWN TO 82.
AND HOW MUCH O2 IS HE ON?
TEN LITERS.
THE FLU IS MAKING IT DIFFICULT FOR YOU TO BREATHE.
( mumbling )
IT AIN'T JUST THE FLU.
NO. YOU ALSO HAVE WHAT'S CALLED
CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE, AND WE NEED TO PUT
A TUBE DOWN YOUR THROAT TO HELP YOU BREATHE.
NO.
THANK YOU.
DO YOU HAVE SOMEONE WE CAN CALL?
NO.
ALL MY FRIENDS IS HOMELESS, NO PHONES.
ANY FAMILY?
NO.
OKAY.
I REALLY THINK YOU NEED TO GO ON A VENTILATOR.
NO.
THANK YOU.
ALWAYS HOPED I MIGHT DIE IN A WARM BED
WITH CLEAN SHEETS, IF IT'S ALL THE SAME TO YOU.
X RAYS SHOW NONSPECIFIC BOWEL GAS PATTERN.
SO IT'S NOT ANOTHER ADHESION?
RIGHT. BLOOD GAS IS BACK.
pH IS 7.38, pCO2 IS 30.
IS IT RESPIRATORY ALKALOSIS?
PARTLY, BUT ALSO AN ACIDOSIS.
IT'S... IT'S COMPLICATED.
ARE YOU A NURSE?
OH, NO, I'VE JUST READ EVERY BOOK
AND EVERY INTERNET ARTICLE ON CHALASIA.
LAST TIME, DID THEY DO AN UPPER G.I.?
SIX MONTHS AGO.
THEY THOUGHT HE MIGHT HAVE A GASTRIC OUTLET BLOCKAGE.
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE TO DO THAT AGAIN?
IT'S THE ONLY WAY TO RULE OUT AN OBSTRUCTION.
NO. PLEASE. IT WAS HORRIBLE.
HE COULDN'T SWALLOW THE BARIUM.
THEY PUT AN N.G. TUBE UP HIS NOSE.
HE WOULDN'T STOP CRYING.
I KNOW CONNER HAS BEEN THROUGH A LOT
BUT HE HAS A SEVERE METABOLIC DISORDER
AND WE HAVE TO FIND OUT WHAT'S MAKING HIM SICK
AND I'LL BE AS GENTLE AS POSSIBLE.
OKAY?
OKAY.
I'LL BE BACK.
WHAT? YOU TELL ME.
NOTHING.
WE TESTED YOUR BLOOD, MARTY.
YEAH?
SO?
SO WHERE DO YOU GET THE DIRTY NEEDLES?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
MARTY, I KNOW.
LOOK, YOU CAN'T TELL MY DAD. PLEASE.
I MEAN, HE'S NOT GOING TO UNDERSTAND.
YOU CAN'T USE DIRTY NEEDLES.
YOU'RE GETTING AN INFECTION
AND IF YOU SHARE, YOU COULD GET HIV.
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS? YEAH.
DON'T EVEN WORRY.
I STOLE THEM FROM MY GRANDMOTHER.
SHE'S GOT DIABETES.
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?
KIDS WITH CROOKED TEETH GET BRACES
AND MY MOM GOT LASER SURGERY ON HER EYES.
WHY CAN'T I USE HORMONES?
FOR WHAT?
TO GROW TALLER.
YOU'RE INJECTING HUMAN GROWTH HORMONE?
WHERE DO YOU GET IT?
LOOK, IT'S NOT ILLEGAL.
YOU CAN'T GET H.G.H. WITHOUT A PRESCRIPTION.
WHERE DO YOU GET IT, MARTY?
( sighing )
OFF THE INTERNET.
THEN YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT'S IN IT.
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHAT SORT OF HEALTH RISKS YOU'VE EXPOSED YOURSELF TO?
WELL, IT CAN'T BE ANY WORSE THAN BEING BEAT UP EVERY DAY.
I MEAN, EVEN THAT STUPID KID IN THE WHEELCHAIR
THINKS THAT HE CAN PICK ON ME.
LOOK, IF YOU CAN GET ME THE REAL STUFF, I...
HORMONE THERAPY IS FOR KIDS WHO HAVE PROBLEMS
NOT FOR HEALTHY ADOLESCENTS.
YEAH? WELL, I'M NOT HEALTHY.
YOU KNOW, I GO TO SCHOOL EVERY DAY
KNOWING THAT I'M GOING TO BE BEAT UP
OR SHOVED INTO A LOCKER
OR DRAGGED INTO THE GIRLS' SHOWER ROOM.
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW EMBARRASSING IT IS TO BE STUFFED INSIDE A TRASH CAN
WHILE THE WHOLE CAFETERIA IS LAUGHING AT YOU?
HORMONES AREN'T GOING TO HELP THAT.
YEAH?
WELL, BEING BIGGER WILL.
HI. HEY.
YOU OKAY?
OH, YEAH.
HAVE YOU SEEN THE CETACAINE?
NO. I HAVEN'T USED ANY.
I ALWAYS KEEP IT ON THIS COUNTER.
SORRY.
UM, CAROL.
ARE YOU UNCOMFORTABLE WITH MY BEING HERE?
WHY WOULD I BE?
WELL, I KNOW SOMETIMES IT'S HARD FOR NURSES
WHEN NURSES GO TO MED SCHOOL.
KIND OF LIKE I SWITCHED TEAMS OR SOMETHING.
I THINK I'M GOING
TO BE SICK. NO. ACTUALLY
UH, I ALMOST WENT TO MED SCHOOL MYSELF.
IS IT SOMETHING ELSE?
IT'S JUST STUPID.
OH, MY GOD.
MR. BARNES? HAVE YOU HAD AN ULCER?
GOD, WHAT'S WRONG?
I DON'T KNOW. PREP THE SUCTION.
I'M GOING TO GO GET A DOCTOR.
I NEED A YANKAUER.
TOP DRAWER.
PETER?!
I'LL START A CENTRAL LINE. CHECK HIS B.P.
WHAT IS IT?
UH, HAD SOME COMPAZINE.
HE JUST STARTED VOMITING BRIGHT RED BLOOD.
OKAY, WHAT'S THE HISTORY?
UH, LOOKS LIKE A TRIPLE-A.
I THINK HE CAME IN WITH NAUSEA.
YOU THINK? HE'S NOT MY PATIENT.
OKAY, HERE WE GO. HERE WE GO.
SET ME UP FOR A CENTRAL LINE.
CAROL, SQUEEZE IN TWO LITERS.
GIVE ME FOUR UNITS O-NEG, TYPE AND CROSS FOR EIGHT.
HE'S BLEEDING OUT THROUGH HIS G.I. TRACT.
SOMEBODY CALL THE O.R.
WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED?
AORTO-ENTERIC FISTULA.
WE NEED AN AIRWAY.
SHOULDN'T WE GET HIM TO THE O.R.?
NO. JUST TUBE HIM. EIGHT-O E.T.
COME ON, MALUCCI, NOW. DAMN IT.
WHY WASN'T HE SENT UPSTAIRS?
CORDAY SAID IT WAS THE FLU. HIS PULSE IS WEAK.
B.P.'s 50 PALP.
HE'LL NEVER MAKE IT UP TO O.R UNLESS WE STOP THE BLEEDING.
LINE'S IN. WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
ABBY LOCKHART. I'M A MED STUDENT.
CAN YOU SEW THIS?
YES. JUST AN INTERRUPTED SUTURE?
I DON'T CARE AS LONG AS IT DOESN'T PULL AWAY.
LET'S MOVE.
PREP HIS BELLY FOR A LAP.
YOU CAN'T DO A LAPAROTOMY DOWN HERE.
WE DON'T HAVE A CHOICE. SCALPEL.
ALL RIGHT, I'LL DO A SMALL MIDLINE INCISION
AND CLAMP BELOW THE DIAPHRAGM.
YOU GOT THAT? ALMOST.
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO. LET'S MOVE.
PRESSURE'S UP TO 90.
THIS SHOULD HOLD HIM TILL WE GET HIM UPSTAIRS.
TELL THE O.R. WE'RE ON OUR WAY UP.
TWO UNITS OF O-NEG IN. I NEED MORE.
OPERATING IN THE E.R.? SHAME ON YOU.
HE HAD AN AORTO- ENTERIC FISTULA.
THEN WHY THE HELL DIDN'T YOU ADMIT HIM TO SURGERY?
BECAUSE HE PRESENTED WITH FLU SYMPTOMS.
YEAH, THIS LOOK LIKE THE FLU TO YOU-- WHAT YOUR NAME?-- MALATUCCI?
MALUCCI. THE PATIENT WAS BLEEDING OUT
AND IF IT WASN'T FOR DOCTOR...
SAVE IT FOR THE DISCIPLINARY HEARING, KID.
LET'S GET HIM UP TO THE O.R
BEFORE YOU USE UP THE REST OF OUR BLOOD SUPPLY.
YOU GOT TO ADMIT, THAT WAS...
THAT WAS PRETTY COOL.
CAN I GO HOME NOW?
NOT JUST YET.
I WANT YOU TO TRY SOMETHING FIRST.
WHAT?
A COMPUTER.
I'VE SEEN ONE OR TWO.
I WAS THINKING MAYBE YOU WERE HAVING
TROUBLE AT SCHOOL 'CAUSE THE M.D.'s
AFFECTING YOUR MOTOR SKILLS...
WRONG.
...IN WHICH CASE A COMPUTER MIGHT HELP YOU KEEP UP
WITH THE OTHER KIDS.
WHO SAYS I WANT TO? THE SCHOOL'S FULL OF LOSERS.
OH, COME ON. JUST GIVE IT A TRY.
OOPS.
FEEL BETTER?
A LITTLE.
YOU WANT TO SMASH SOMETHING ELSE?
MAYBE.
IS THAT THE BEST YOU CAN DO?
YEAH, YOU GOT THAT.
HERE.
YEAH, THAT'S IT, THAT'S IT.
NOW LET ME SEE YOU WRITE YOUR NAME.
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?
I'M TRYING TO HELP YOU.
I'M TIRED OF PEOPLE TRYING TO HELP ME ALL THE TIME.
I CAN DO THINGS FOR MYSELF.
PEOPLE TRYING TO HELP YOU TOO MUCH SOMETIMES?
( sobbing )
I DON'T NEED TO BE PUSHED AROUND.
I DON'T NEED TO HAVE MY FOOD CUT.
I DON'T NEED MY MOM
GIVING ME A FREAKING BATH ALL THE TIME.
I'M NOT A BABY.
NO, YOU'RE NOT.
I'M GOING TO GO TALK TO YOUR MOTHER.
WHY DON'T YOU CLEAN THIS UP?
ME?
YOU HELPED ME MAKE THE MESS.
YOU CAN HELP ME CLEAN IT UP.
OKAY.
IT'S OKAY. IT'S OKAY, HONEY.
HE'S ALMOST DONE. THERE, NO MORE.
LUKA, I NEED TO TALK TO YOU FOR A MINUTE.
HOLD ON. I HAVE TO GIVE THE CONTRAST.
IT'LL JUST TAKE A SECOND.
OKAY, I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
GOOD BOY, GOOD BOY.
YEAH, GOOD BOY, HONEY.
I TRIED CONTACTING HIS PEDIATRICIAN.
MM-HMM.
HE DOESN'T HAVE ONE.
IT SEEMED KIND OF WEIRD TO ME FOR A KID THIS SICK
SO I CALLED AROUND.
I CALLED NORTHWESTERN, RUSH, MERCY.
CONNER'S BEEN ADMITTED TO ALL THREE E.R.s
SEVERAL TIMES, MULTIPLE ADMISSIONS
SEVERAL LAPAROTOMIES.
I KNOW. I'VE SEEN THE SCARS.
BUT HE'S ONLY EVER REALLY NEEDED SURGERY ONCE
FOR HIS FUNDOPLICATION.
ALL THE REST WERE EXPLORATORY PROCEDURES
AND THEY DIDN'T FIND ANYTHING.
HE HAS A METABOLIC DISORDER
AND HE IS STILL AT HIGH RISK
FOR ADHESIONS AND OBSTRUCTION.
BUT NOBODY HAS BEEN ABLE TO DOCUMENT ANYTHING
SINCE HIS FIRST SURGERY.
I KNOW, BUT SOMETHING'S MAKING HIM SICK.
HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT THE MOTHER?
WHAT ABOUT HER?
MAYBE SHE'S INTENTIONALLY INDUCING HIS SYMPTOMS.
CAROL, SHE'S DONE EVERYTHING
SHE CAN TO FIND OUT WHAT'S WRONG WITH HIM.
MAYBE SHE LIKES THE ATTENTION. "ATTENTION"?
SHE'D HURT HER CHILD FOR ATTENTION?
I'VE SEEN PARENTS DO IT BEFORE.
OKAY, HOW? HOW'S SHE DOING THIS?
I DON'T KNOW.
YEAH, BUT YOU CAN'T SAY THIS KIND OF THING WITHOUT PROOF.
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN HIS UPPER G.I. IS NEGATIVE, C.T. SHOWS NOTHING?
ARE YOU GOING TO ADMIT HIM FOR SURGERY?
I'VE JUST STARTED THE WORKUP.
GIVE ME A CHANCE TO FIGURE IT OUT.
WILL YOU JUST CONSIDER IT?
YEAH, I'LL CONSIDER IT.
OKAY.
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH HIM.
HE'S BEING ABUSED BY HIS CLASSMATES.
SO HE NEEDS TO LEARN TO FIGHT BACK.
THAT'S NOT A SOLUTION.
LOOK, DR. FINCH, MY SON'S SHORT, SO WHAT?
I'M SHORT
AND, YEAH, I GOT PICKED ON
BUT I LEARNED TO DEAL WITH IT AND SO WILL HE.
HOW? BY INJECTING HIMSELF WITH GOD KNOWS WHAT?
THAT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN AGAIN
I CAN ASSURE YOU.
DR. FINCH, MARTY SPIKED A FEVER OF 103.
HOW ARE YOU FEELING, MARTY?
PRETTY CRUMMY.
WHAT DO YOU EXPECT AFTER PUMPING THAT CRAP INTO YOUR BODY?
HAVE YOU HAD A FEVER RECENTLY?
LAST WEEK-- HE HAD THE FLU.
THERE'S A PANSYSTOLIC MURMUR.
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
HAS HE HAD A HEART MURMUR BEFORE?
HE'S GOT SPLINTER HEMORRHAGES. NO.
Dorset: WHAT'S GOING ON?
GET THREE BLOOD CULTURES.
WE'LL START HIM ON PEN, OX AND GENT
AND ORDER A CARDIAC ECHO.
IS THERE SOMETHING WRONG WITH MY HEART?
THE NEEDLE YOU KEPT USING MAY HAVE PUT BACTERIA
INTO YOUR BLOODSTREAM
CAUSING AN INFECTION OF YOUR HEART.
MR. SPENCER, I'M ABBY LOCKHART.
I NEED A PRIVATE ROOM.
I DON'T THINK WE HAVE ANY.
WELL, THERE SHOULD BE. WITH THIS FLU EPIDEMIC
THIS PLACE IS ONE BIG PETRI DISH.
WOULD YOU TAKE A DEEP BREATH?
WHAT IF SOMEBODY COMES IN HERE WITH T.B. OR LEPROSY OR SOMETHING?
WHAT SEEMS TO BE YOUR PROBLEM TODAY?
I THINK MY PULSE IS THREADY.
REALLY?
MY STOMACH'S UPSET, MY CHEST FEELS TIGHT
I'M FATIGUED, MY HEAD IS POUNDING
AND I CAN BARELY HEAR ANYTHING.
DO YOUR STOOLS GLOW IN THE DARK?
WHAT?
YOUR EARS ARE FULL OF WAX, MR. SPENCER.
OH, MAN.
I READ SOMEWHERE YOU CAN GET THAT
FROM FOOD ADDITIVES OR ENVIRONMENTAL TOXINS.
I CAN CLEAN THEM OUT FOR YOU.
HOW DO YOU DO THAT?
I WAS TOLD NEVER TO PUT ANYTHING IN MY EARS
SMALLER THAN MY ELBOW.
WE USE A SPECIAL DRILL.
A DRILL? I'M KIDDING. I USE PEROXIDE.
MRS. BRANT, RADIOLOGY'S READY.
OKAY, OKAY. HERE WE GO, SWEETIE.
WHAT ABOUT MY PALPITATIONS?
I THINK I NEED AN E.K.G.
I'LL TRY TO FIND ONE.
CAROL, WHERE'S THE E.K.G. MACHINE?
TRY THE TRAUMA ROOM. DO YOU NEED ME TO DRAW LABS?
NOPE, I GOT IT.
WE CAN WHEEL HIM OUT ON THE GURNEY.
NO. I'D RATHER CARRY HIM IF THAT'S OKAY.
OKAY, SURE.
DR. ROMANO, I'M STILL ON SHIFT DOWNSTAIRS.
YEAH? WELL, YOU SHOULD HAVE CONSIDERED THAT
BEFORE YOU DECIDED TO TURN THE E.R.
INTO YOUR OWN PRIVATE OPERATING ROOM.
BUT I'M NOT DOING ANYTHING HERE.
IT WON'T KILL YOU TO OBSERVE ONCE IN A WHILE, PETER.
YOU OBVIOUSLY HAVE A FEW THINGS LEFT TO LEARN.
SOMEBODY TURN DOWN THE HEAT. IT'S A HUNDRED IN HERE.
THE THERMOSTAT SAID "68."
MAYBE YOU'VE GOT THE FLU.
I DON'T GET SICK.
MAYBE YOU'RE GOING THROUGH THE CHANGE.
DEBAKEY CLAMP.
I CAN FINISH UP IF YOU'D LIKE.
WHAT I WOULD LIKE IS FOR YOU TO STAND THERE
AND SHUT UP WHILE I TRY TO SAVE THIS MAN'S LIFE.
SUCTION.
WHAT DID YOU FIND?
NO OBSTRUCTION.
THE STUDY WAS NEGATIVE.
SO, WHAT DO WE DO NOW?
WE SHOULD DO A C.T. SCAN.
WHAT ABOUT ENDOSCOPY?
I DON'T WANT TO PUT YOUR SON THROUGH
ANOTHER INVASIVE PROCEDURE IF I DON'T HAVE TO.
OKAY, BUT I FEEL WE'RE WASTING TIME.
SHOULDN'T A SURGEON SEE HIM?
AFTER THE SCAN.
SAT'S DOWN TO 78.
PUT HIM ON 100% NON RE-BREATHER MASK.
MR. CLAYTON, IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE
I CAN DO FOR YOU TO MAKE YOU MORE COMFORTABLE?
MY LUNCH BOX.
THIS?
THERE'S $118 IN THERE.
GIVE IT TO MY FRIENDS.
IS THERE A SPECIFIC SHELTER YOU WANT IT TO GO TO?
OH, JUST THROW IT OFF THE ROOF.
THROW THE MONEY OFF THE ROOF?
THEY'LL FIND IT.
CONNER'S G.I. SERIES WAS NEGATIVE.
YOU SEEM SURPRISED.
AFTER YOU SAID THAT ABOUT THE MOTHER
I WAS HOPING TO FIND SOMETHING WRONG WITH HIM
BUT SHE WANTS AN ENDOSCOPY.
ALMOST SEEMED DISAPPOINTED WHEN I WANTED TO WAIT
AND I THINK YOU MIGHT BE RIGHT.
IS THIS GOING TO HURT?
NO. IT'S JUST PEROXIDE.
YOU MIGHT FEEL A FEW BUBBLES.
"BUBBLES"?
WHAT IF THEY GET INTO MY BLOODSTREAM? I COULD GET AN EMBOLISM.
THAT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.
I FORGOT A CURETTE. I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
WHAT ABOUT MY CHEST PAINS?
YOUR E.K.G. WAS NORMAL.
YEAH, BUT THAT DOESN'T RULE OUT UNSTABLE ANGINA.
MAYBE I SHOULD HAVE A STRESS ECHO.
I DON'T THINK THAT'S GOING TO BE NECESSARY.
WHAT IS THE SENSE OF HAVING ALL THIS SOPHISTICATED TECHNOLOGY
IF YOU DIE BEFORE YOU GET A CHANCE TO USE IT? HEY!
SORRY ABOUT THAT.
THAT'S OKAY.
HOW'S HE DOING?
OH, WELL, NOT SO GOOD.
IT'S THE SAME STORY.
LOTS OF TESTS AND THEY CAN'T FIGURE OUT WHAT'S WRONG WITH HIM.
WELL, I'M SURE DR. KOVAC IS BEING AS THOROUGH AS HE CAN.
DID HE CALL FOR A SURGICAL CONSULT YET?
I DON'T KNOW. I COULD CHECK.
WOULD YOU? SURE.
ANOTHER 3-0 PROLENE.
GET THAT RAKE OUT OF MY WAY, PLEASE.
OH, MAN!
DR. ROMANO, ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE OKAY?
YES.
YOU JUST SPENT THE LAST 20 MINUTES
OVER-SEWING THE DUODENAL DEFECT.
WELL, THERE'S NO SUBSTITUTE FOR PRECISION, PETER.
LIZZIE, COME TO JOIN THE PARTY?
I HEARD MR. BARNES ERODED HIS AORTIC GRAFT.
IS HE A FRIEND OF YOURS?
WELL, I EVALUATED HIM DOWNSTAIRS.
I THOUGHT HE HAD GASTROENTERITIS.
REALLY? PETER, YOU NEVER MENTIONED THAT.
HOW VALIANT OF YOU TO NOT HAVE RATTED LIZZIE OUT
ON HER GROSS OVERSIGHT.
HOW'S HE DOING?
FINE, NOW THAT HE'S BEEN COMPETENTLY DIAGNOSED
AND BROUGHT TO AN OPERATING ROOM.
PETER, YOU'RE DISMISSED.
LIZZIE, SCRUB IN.
WELL, I'M OFF, ACTUALLY.
NO, ACTUALLY, YOU'RE NOT ANYMORE.
GIVE ME A PEANUT.
I'M GOING TO DISSECT THE SMALL BOWEL
OFF THE AORTA NOW.
YOU'D BE BETTER OFF USING A METZ.
PETER, I'D QUIT WHILE I WERE AHEAD IF I WERE...
OW! DAMN IT!
ROBERT?
I'M FINE.
ROBERT?
GOD, HE'S BURNING UP.
I GOT THIS. OPEN UP A NEW TRAY.
LET'S GET METZ AND A PICK-UP.
SOMEBODY GET A GURNEY.
HE'S GOT A WEAK PULSE, TACHY AT 140.
SUCTION. 3-0 PROLENE.
LET'S GET READY.
YOU'RE NOT AFRAID YOU'LL CATCH COLD?
HEY, IF I HAVEN'T CAUGHT ONE BY NOW.
THEY'RE NOT STACKING UP AGAIN, ARE THEY?
NO, I THINK IT'S OVER.
DID YOU FIGURE WHAT WAS WRONG WITH THAT KID?
YEAH, HE GOT TIRED OF BEING SHORT
SO HE INJECTED HIMSELF WITH BOGUS GROWTH HORMONE.
OF COURSE. WHY DIDN'T I THINK OF THAT?
HIS ECHO SHOWS VEGETATIONS ON HIS MITRAL VALVE.
ENDOCARDITIS?
KEPT REUSING GRANDMA'S INSULIN NEEDLES.
WHAT DID CARDIOLOGY SAY?
THEY ADMITTED HIM
PUT HIM ON TRIPLE ANTIBIOTICS.
HOPEFULLY I CAUGHT IT
BEFORE HE NEEDS SURGERY.
ALL THAT FOR A COUPLE OF INCHES.
YEAH.
YOU'RE RELEASING TOO EARLY
WHEN YOU SHOOT.
OH, WHY DON'T YOU SHOW ME?
YOU DON'T WANT ANY OF THIS.
OH, I DON'T? TRUST ME.
OKAY, SHOW ME WHAT YOU GOT.
WHAT IS IT? I DON'T KNOW.
HIS STOMACH IS DISTENDED.
GIVE ME A SYRINGE.
I TOLD YOU TO CALL A SURGEON. HE'S GETTING WORSE.
W-WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
HOLD ON.
OH, MY GOD, WHAT IS THAT? IS HE BLEEDING?
NO.
IT'S AN INDICATOR, MIXED WITH SALINE.
TURNS RED IN STOMACH ACID.
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
THAT'S NOT MINE.
TH-THAT BELONGS TO THE DOCTOR OR THE NURSE...
WHATEV... WHOEVER IT WAS, SHE LEFT IT HERE.
WELL, ACTUALLY, WE HAD HER LEAVE IT
AND IT'S NOT PEROXIDE, IT'S SALINE.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.
YES, YOU DO, MRS. BRANT.
YOU'VE BEEN POISONING YOUR SON
AND THIS PROVES IT.
OKAY, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
STOP, STOP. I DIDN'T GIVE YOU PERMISSION
TO DO ANY OF THIS. WE ARE LEAVING.
NO, I'M AFRAID YOU ARE NOT. I CAN'T ALLOW YOU TO KEEP HURTING HIM.
I LOVE CONNER.
I WOULD NEVER HURT HIM.
MRS. BRANT, YOU NEED HELP.
OH, GOD.
OKAY, SWEETIE, IT'S OKAY.
IT'S OKAY, SWEETIE.
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO HURT YOU.
MOMMY HAS YOU.
MOMMY HAS YOU, HONEY.
IT'S OKAY.
AMIRA, CALL TRANSPORT.
MR. CLAYTON IN EXAM ONE NEEDS TO GO TO THE MORGUE.
THAT OLD GUY DIED?
FROM THE FLU?
WENT INTO RESPIRATORY FAILURE.
I KNEW I SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN THAT FLU SHOT.
Malucci: SOMEONE GIVE YOU A TIP?
HE HAD A DAUGHTER.
WHO?
MY HOMELESS MAN WHO DIED TOLD ME HE HAD NO FAMILY.
AND WHAT? YOU THE EXECUTOR OF HIS ESTATE?
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
HEY, ABBY.
DID YOU KNOW IT'S A TRADITION
FOR THE RESIDENTS TO TAKE OUT THEIR STUDENTS
FOR A DRINK AFTER THEIR FIRST DAY?
I THOUGHT YOU WERE SICK.
WELL, MAYBE YOU COULD NURSE ME BACK TO... WHOA!
WOW. YOU... YOU LOOK... JUST, WOW.
UH, YOU KNOW... WHAT, YOU HAVE A DATE OR SOMETHING?
MAYBE.
EXCUSE ME, YOU'RE DROOLING ON MY CHART.
SORRY.
UM... SO... YEAH.
HOW ABOUT THAT DRINK?
YOU'RE KIDDING, RIGHT?
HOW'S HE DOING? GROUCHIER THAN EVER.
HE HAS A KIDNEY STONE.
YOU'RE KIDDING.
NOT AS BIG AS WE'D LIKE, MIND YOU.
HE WON'T NEED SURGERY.
PASSING THROUGH THE OLD PLUMBING.
THAT CAN'T BE A LOT OF FUN.
THANKS FOR TRYING TO COVER FOR ME.
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO, BUT I APPRECIATE IT.
ANYBODY COULD HAVE MISSED IT.
I HOPE SO. MY MIND WAS ELSEWHERE.
WELL.
SO, YOU'RE GOING IN TO GLOAT.
OH, YEAH.
I WOULDN'T TAKE TOO MUCH GLEE
IN THIS IF I WERE YOU, PETER.
NO, NO, NO, I JUST CAME TO TELL YOU
THAT MR. BARNES IS STABLE IN RECOVERY.
IT'S A GOOD THING I WAS OBSERVING WHEN THIS HAPPENED.
I SUPPOSE YOU THINK THIS MEANS I OWE YOU.
I'LL SETTLE FOR A THANK YOU.
HOW VERY GRACIOUS OF YOU, PETER. THANK YOU.
AND THE O.R. TIME THAT I NEED FOR THE LITTLE GIRL'S
FACIAL SURGERY.
LOOK, YOU FINISHED A REPAIR AND CLOSED FOR ME. BIG DEAL.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW YOU COULD BE AGAINST
A LITTLE GIRL GETTING HER FACE FIXED.
THIS IS MY JOB.
IF WORD GETS OUT THAT I DO FAVORS FOR YOU
I'LL HAVE TO DO THEM FOR EVERYBODY
WHICH IS WHY WE NEVER HAD THIS CONVERSATION.
SO THAT MEANS I CAN HAVE THE O.R.
I DON'T WANT TO KNOW ABOUT IT.
HMM. GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.
THANK YOU.
YOU'RE WELCOME, PETER.
( groans )
ABBY, THANK YOU FOR HELPING BACK THERE.
I KNOW IT WAS BIZARRE.
OH, SURE. DID SHE ACTUALLY POUR IT DOWN HIS G-TUBE?
YEAH, IT DIDN'T TAKE HER LONG.
I BET YOU WERE NEVER PART
OF A STING OPERATION UPSTAIRS.
NO, THIS IS THE FIRST. WELCOME TO THE E.R.
ABBY. YEAH?
DO YOU HAVE A PATIENT NAMED SPENCER?
THE HYPOCHONDRIAC, YEAH.
HE'S HAVING A HEART ATTACK.
WHAT?!
Carter: START HIM ON DOPAMINE, TEN MIKES PER KILO.
WHAT HAPPENED? IS THIS YOUR PATIENT?
DID YOU GIVE HIM ANY MEDICATION?
NO, I CLEANED OUT HIS EARS.
B.P.-- 70 PALP.
DID HE COMPLAIN OF ANY CHEST PAIN?
YEAH, HE COMPLAINED OF EVERYTHING, BUT HIS EKG WAS NORMAL.
NOT ANYMORE. S.T. ELEVATION ON THE 12-LEAD.
HE'S HAVING AN ACUTE M.I.
HE HAD A HISTORY OF REFLUX.
THERE WAS NO CARDIAC RISK FACTOR.
HEMOCUE IS SIX.
ALL RIGHT, LET'S HANG TWO UNITS OF PACKED CELLS.
HE'S GOING TO NEED NITROGLYCERIN AND A HEPARIN DRIP.
Abby: I'LL START A SECOND LINE.
V-TACH.
CHARGE TO 100.
SYNCH CARDIOVERSION.
CHUNI CAN GET THAT. TAKE THOSE.
IT'S YOUR PATIENT.
CLEAR.
ELIZABETH.
HELLO, MOTHER.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
WELL, I LIVE HERE, REMEMBER?
YES. I MEANT TO CALL YOU.
I JUST GOT IN LAST WEEK.
OH, ELIZABETH, SAVE ME THE POUTY FACE.
I'M NOT POUTING.
I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE YOU WERE GOING TO TRAVEL
SEVERAL THOUSAND MILES AND NOT CALL ME.
YES. WELL, I'M HERE NOW AND FREEZING
SO IF WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE
THIS CONVERSATION, COULD WE FIND SOMEWHERE WARM?
PREFERABLY WHERE THEY SERVE ALCOHOL
OR HAVE THE AMERICANS BANNED THAT TOGETHER WITH TOBACCO?
Finch: DIDN'T ANYONE EVER TELL YOU WHITE MEN CAN'T JUMP?
NOW, THAT WAS A FOUL.
OH, I GET A FOUL BECAUSE YOU TRIPPED.
NO, YOU HIP-CHECKED ME.
DR. GREENE.
YOU SAID WHAT IS IT?
TO CALL YOU IF I GOT INTO TROUBLE.
YEAH?
WELL, UM...
HE WAS A HYPOCHONDRIAC. ALL HIS TESTS CAME BACK NORMAL.
M.I.s DON'T ALWAYS PRESENT TEXTBOOK SYMPTOMS.
YOU DIDN'T GET A BLOOD COUNT.
WHITE COUNT WAS 1800. CRIT WAS ONLY 18.
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
APLASTIC ANEMIA.
BINGO. DECREASED OXYGEN-CARRYING CAPACITY
IS A RISK FACTOR.
YOU'RE GOING TO NEED TO GET HEMATOLOGY DOWN HERE FOR A CONSULT.
THEY'RE GOING TO WANT TO DO A BONE MARROW BIOPSY.
I'M SORRY. NO, I'M SORRY.
I SHOULD HAVE PROTECTED YOU MORE.
IT'S GREAT THAT YOU WERE A NURSE
BUT YOU GOT START THINKING LIKE A DOCTOR, OKAY?
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO IT ALL.
FROM NOW ON, MAKE SURE
THAT THE NURSES ORDER YOUR LABS.
THEY HAVE A STANDING ORDER ON C.B.C.s.
SEE YOU TOMORROW. OKAY.
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU MANAGE
TO KEEP YOUR COMPLEXION IN THIS CITY.
WIND, NOTHING BUT WIND.
I DON'T WORK ON A CONSTRUCTION SITE.
OH, THAT'S RIGHT, YOU CUT PEOPLE UP LIKE YOUR FATHER.
HOW IS CHARLES?
HAPPY. WE HAD A LOVELY TIME WHEN HE WAS IN TOWN LAST.
YOU KNOW, DADDY STAYS AT MY PLACE.
HOW DELIGHTFUL.
WOULD YOU LIKE TO COME AND STAY WITH ME?
WHATEVER FOR?
BECAUSE I HAVE A SPARE ROOM.
BECAUSE I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU IN THREE YEARS.
THAT'S NOT MY FAULT.
I'M JUST SAYING, I'D LIKE YOU TO COME AND STAY.
ALL RIGHT. I AGREE.
I'M HONORED.
YOU DO LOOK WELL.
YOU MUST HAVE A MAN.
DO I NEED A MAN TO LOOK WELL?
IT HELPS.
SO... HAVE YOU?
YES.
I SUPPOSE
HE'S A DOCTOR.
ACTUALLY, YES.
HIS NAME'S MARK
AND HE'S LOVELY.
( clucking like a chicken )
COME ON, CHICKEN.
WE NEVER FINISHED THAT GAME.
YOU WERE DOWN BY EIGHT POINTS.
YEAH, WELL, I WAS PACING MYSELF.
GOOD NIGHT.
QUITTER.
ALL RIGHT, BRING IT ON.
GOOD NIGHT, MARK.
NICE HAT.
HI.
HI.
YOU'RE THE NEW MED STUDENT, RIGHT?
YEAH. I'M ABBY LOCKHART.
LUCY.
NICE TO MEET YOU.
HOW WAS YOUR FIRST DAY?
UM... WELL, LET'S PUT IT THIS WAY.
I HAVEN'T HAD ONE OF THESE IN TWO YEARS.
WHAT HAPPENED?
IT'S MORE LIKE, WHAT DIDN'T HAPPEN?
I USED TO WORK IN O.B., AND UP THERE
I WOULD DELIVER A BABY, AND THEN I WOULD DELIVER A BABY
AND THEN I WOULD DELIVER A BABY
AND TODAY
I WAS PUKED ON, SPIT AT, BIT...
AND THEN I TRICKED A PSYCHOTIC WOMAN
AND THEN I ALMOST KILLED A GUY.
THAT SOUNDS ABOUT RIGHT.
FORTUNATELY, IN THE E.R., "ALMOST" DOESN'T COUNT.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
PATIENT'S LAST REQUEST.
TOSS SOME.
YOU MIGHT FEEL BETTER.
DO YOU HAVE TO SAY A PRAYER OR SOMETHING?
I DON'T THINK SO.
