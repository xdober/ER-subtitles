Corday: MARK?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
PLAYING TETRIS.
IT'S 5:30 IN THE MORNING.
I COULDN'T SLEEP.
THIS WOULDN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO
WITH YOUR FATHER ARRIVING TODAY.
NO, OF COURSE NOT.
YOU KNOW, YOU'D FEEL A WHOLE LOT WORSE
IF HE SPENT THE HOLIDAYS ALONE.
YEAH, WHAT WOULD THANKSGIVING BE
WITHOUT TURKEY AND GUILT?
GOD, I HOPE WE CAN FAKE AT GETTING ALONG.
I JUST HOPE HE'LL BE COMFORTABLE
WITH OUR SLEEPING ARRANGEMENTS.
YEAH, HIM AND ME IN HERE
AND YOU OUT ON THE COUCH.
( chuckling )
STOP IT.
PETER!
PETER, WAKE UP!
HOW LONG WAS I ASLEEP?
HOW SHOULD I KNOW? I JUST CAME ON.
WE NEED YOU NOW!
SHH! ALL RIGHT... DAMN...
WATCH YOUR BACK!
Weaver: PETER, ROUGH NIGHT ON CALL?
YEAH, WE GOT SLAMMED.
YEAH, NOTHING LIKE A TRAUMA TO GET THE JUICES FLOWING.
READY, AND LIFT.
Benton: WHAT HAPPENED?
CHOIR BUS FROM LOUISVILLE GOT HIT BY A SEMI.
LOUISVILLE?
YEAH, THEY DROVE UP FOR A GOSPEL FESTIVAL.
THIS BLUNT ABDOMINAL TRAUMA MAY NEED SURGERY.
I'M ASSIGNING HIM TO YOU, DR. BENTON.
ASSIGNING HIM?
I AM THE TRIAGE OFFICER.
YOU NEED TO LET ME KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH YOUR PATIENTS.
OH, GOD, THIS IS A NIGHTMARE.
HE'S A SENIOR.
HE REQUESTED MORE RESPONSIBILITY.
HEY, LET ME KNOW IF YOU NEED HELP.
RIGHT-O.
THE BLOOD BANK IS RUNNING LOW ON O-NEG
SO LET'S ALL TRY AND GO EASY.
GIVE ME THE BULLET.
26-YEAR-OLD WOMAN COMPLAINS
OF NECK PAIN AND MID-LINE TENDERNESS.
NO L.O.C.
VITALS?
STABLE.
LET'S SHOOT A LATERAL C-SPINE
AND LEAVE HER ON THE BACK BOARD
UNTIL I CAN COME IN AND CLEAR THE X RAY MYSELF.
WHATEVER YOU SAY, JOHN.
CHUNY, WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
TAKING THIS LADY FOR AN ANKLE X RAY.
WAIT-- SHE MIGHT NOT NEED IT
AND WE DON'T WANT TO TIE UP RADIOLOGY.
OW!
OKAY, TAKE HER TO X RAY.
GOOD IDEA.
LUCY, SO GLAD YOU COULD JOIN US.
SORRY, I SLEPT THROUGH MY ALARM.
I NEED YOU IN FOUR.
CAN'T I AT LEAST TAKE MY COAT OFF?
NO, YOU CANNOT.
ANGULATED COLLES FRACTURE.
THERE'S SPACE DOWN HERE-- TALK TO ME.
I'M ON TOP OF IT.
YOU CHECK THE WRIST PULSES?
NO, I THOUGHT I'D JUST AMPUTATE.
DAVE...
NEURO CIRC IS FINE.
GET HER SOMETHING FOR THE PAIN
GET HER TO X RAY AND GET BUSY IN THE SUTURE ROOM.
YES, MAESTRO.
Weaver: HOW WE DOING, CARTER?
EVERYTHING'S UNDER CONTROL, WHAT'VE YOU GOT?
CHEST CONTUSION.
I'M PUTTING HER ON A MONITOR JUST TO BE SAFE.
WHAT'S THE 12-LEAD SHOW?
WE'RE JUST BRINGING HER IN.
OH, RIGHT, UH... I GOT A SPACE OPEN IN EXAM FOUR.
HEY, DO YOU THINK I CAN ATTEND
THE EMERGENCY SERVICES COMMITTEE MEETING TODAY?
CARTER, ONE STEP AT A TIME!
EXCUSE ME. EXCUSE ME.
YEAH.
I GOT TO GO...
CAN YOU TAKE THIS GUY TO THE BATHROOM?
PATIENT NEEDS A BREATHING TREATMENT.
CHUNY, ARE YOU FREE?
GOT TO RUN THIS URINE TO THE LAB.
LUCY, I NEED YOU...
ALLERGIC REACTION. I NEED SUB-Q EPI.
IF ANYBODY NEEDS ME, WE'LL BE IN THE MEN'S ROOM.
( phone rings )
I GOT IT.
THANKS, CONNIE.
E.R.
APPRECIATE YOU FILLING IN AT THE DESK, CAROL.
OH, SURE.
THERE'S NOT MUCH ELSE I CAN DO EXCEPT ANSWER PHONES, ANYWAY.
Oligario: DR. WEAVER, THAT WAS DR. ROMANO
REMINDING YOU TO BRING ALL THE Q.A. DATA
TO THE EMERGENCY SERVICES MEETING.
WHEN DON'T I?
CAROL, REMEMBER TO ELEVATE YOUR FEET
TO REDUCE THE SWELLING IN YOUR ANKLES.
CONNIE, COULD YOU GIVE CAROL A STOOL
SO SHE CAN PUT HER FEET UP, PLEASE?
THANK YOU.
IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE I CAN GET YOU?
YOU KNOW, UH... A CARTON OF MILK WOULD BE GREAT.
AND I COULD USE SOME PENS.
MY PLEASURE.
THANKS.
OH, CONNIE, CONNIE, CONNIE!
COULD YOU SLIDE THE PHONE OVER HERE?
MMM.
GREAT.
I GUESS I'M ALL SET NOW.
Kovac: MORNING.
HEY. YOU'RE BACK.
YEAH. DR. WEAVER CALLED ME IN.
I THOUGHT YOU WENT SOUTH FOR THE WINTER.
SOON. BEFORE THE FIRST SNOW.
YOU LOOK GREAT.
REALLY?
YEP.
I FEEL LIKE AN OVERGROWN PUMPKIN.
WHAT... PUMPKIN?
THE BIG, ROUND, ORANGE THING YOU CARVE ON HALLOWEEN.
OH, BUNDEVA. YEAH.
ACTUALLY, I'D SAY MORE LIKE A LUBENICA.
WHAT IS THAT?
I FORGET HOW TO SAY IT IN ENGLISH.
SEE YA.
HE'S OOZING.
CRIT'S 29. WANT THE LAST UNIT OF O-NEG?
NO, I'VE GOT THE BLEEDING UNDER CONTROL.
MORNING, PETER.
MORNING.
LASER SURGERY ON THE LIVER LAC?
I'M USING THE ARGON TO REDUCE THE BLOOD LOSS.
WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO SCRUB IN?
NO, NO, NO, I GOT IT.
BUT I DO NEED TO ASK YOU A FAVOR.
WHAT'S THAT?
I NEED SOME TIME OFF.
HOW MUCH TIME?
I'M NOT SURE.
MY CUSTODY CASE IS GOING TO TRIAL.
I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG IT'S GOING TO LAST.
IF YOU'D BE WILLING TO TRADE HOLIDAY SHIFTS
WHATEVER IT TAKES. TAKE EXTRA CALL...
I'LL SEE WHAT I CAN DO.
DR. BENTON, CHAIN REACTION PILEUP
OFF THE ROOSEVELT.
THEY NEED YOU AT THE SCENE.
AH, DAMN.
LOOK, YOU FINISH UP HERE. I'LL TAKE IT.
NO, NO, NO, I GOT IT.
PETER, EVEN YOU CAN'T OPERATE
AND FLY ON A CHOPPER AT THE SAME TIME.
I OWE YOU.
YOUR E.R. COMPLIANCE RATE IS A MEAGER 78%
FOR THE PNEUMONIA CLINICAL PATHWAY.
REALLY, KERRY, I EXPECTED BETTER FROM YOU.
THIS IS ONLY THE FIRST MONTH'S DATA.
ALL THE NURSES HAVEN'T BEEN IN-SERVICED YET.
YEAH, WELL, LET'S SHOOT FOR A MINIMUM
OF 90% NEXT MONTH, SHALL WE, LADIES?
SORRY WE'RE LATE.
TO WHAT DO WE OWE THE UNEXPECTED
PLEASURE OF DR. CARTER'S COMPANY?
OH, UH, CARTER WANTED ADMINISTRATIVE EXPERIENCE
SO I APPOINTED HIM AS THE NEW RESIDENT REPRESENTATIVE.
I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU.
YOU DIDN'T SAY SQUAT. KERRY, DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THIS?
CARTER ASKED, I SAID NO.
IT APPEARS DR. CARTER
HAS BEEN PLAYING MOMMY AGAINST DADDY.
I CAN STEP OUT, IF YOU'D LIKE TO DISCUSS THIS.
THERE'S NOTHING TO DISCUSS, CARTER.
HAVE A SEAT.
REALLY?
YOU'RE COMFORTABLE
SENDING THE MESSAGE TO OUR RESIDENTS
THAT THEIR OPINIONS ARE WORTHLESS
AND THEY'RE JUST HERE TO SERVE YOU?
ACTUALLY, I'D BE COMPLETELY COMFORTABLE WITH THAT.
BUT SINCE I ADMIRE
THE DEVIOUSNESS WITH WHICH YOU GOT YOURSELF HERE...
GOOD. CARTER, WELCOME
TO THE EMERGENCY SERVICES COMMITTEE.
UNFORTUNATELY, I HAVE TO TAKE OFF.
SO, CARTER, CAN YOU TAKE GOOD NOTES?
SO, WHAT'S ON THE AGENDA?
CHAD'S LOST 20 POUNDS. HIS GRADES ARE FALLING.
MOM, I'M FINE.
HAS YOUR APPETITE CHANGED RECENTLY, CHAD?
NOT REALLY.
HE'S DOING DRUGS. I KNOW IT.
I TOLD YOU A THOUSAND TIMES, I DON'T GET HIGH.
WHAT ABOUT THOSE LOSERS YOU HANG OUT WITH?
MOM, YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING.
LET'S START WITH A FEW BLOOD TESTS.
TRY TO RULE OUT ANEMIA.
I BROUGHT HIM IN FOR A DRUG TEST.
SEE? SHE NEVER BELIEVES ME.
I DON'T FEEL THAT IT'S APPROPRIATE
TO FORCE THAT ON CHAD, MRS. KOTTMEIER.
WHO'S IN CHARGE HERE?
LET'S, UH... CALL A SOCIAL WORKER
AND TRY TO DISCUSS THIS RATIONALLY.
IS THERE A PROBLEM?
YES, MY SON IS ON DRUGS AND SHE REFUSES TO TEST HIM!
CHAD DENIES DRUG USE AND I WAS URGING MRS. KOTTMEIER
TO CONSIDER FAMILY COUNSELING.
CHAD, DO YOU OBJECT TO BEING TESTED?
( sighs )
WHATEVER.
IF IT'LL GET HER OFF MY BACK.
PROBLEM SOLVED. LUCY, RUN A TOX SCREEN.
FINE.
EXCUSE ME. LUCY...
I'M A MEDICAL STUDENT, YOU'RE A RESIDENT.
YOU CAN QUESTION MY CLINICAL JUDGMENT
JUST DON'T DO IT IN FRONT OF MY PATIENTS.
CHAD HAD NO OBJECTIONS.
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO CHOOSE SIDES.
I WASN'T CHOOSING SIDES.
I WAS TRYING TO WORK WITH THEM.
WELL, SOMETIMES THE PATH OF LEAST RESISTANCE WORKS BEST.
SINCE YOU'VE GOT THIS FIGURED OUT
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE THIS CASE?
BABETTE FRITZLER, 28.
G.S.W. TO THE SHOULDER.
NEURO VASCULAR'S INTACT.
HUSBAND MATT SHOT HER.
( hiccuping ): IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.
I WAS TRYING TO SCARE THE HICCUPS OUT OF HER.
NOTHING ELSE WORKED.
SWEET PICKLE JUICE IS MORE EFFECTIVE AND SAFER.
WHY DON'T YOU GO FIND SOME, DAVE? I'LL DO THIS.
Weaver: OH, NO, YOU DON'T, CARTER.
MALUCCI, GET AN UPRIGHT CHEST X RAY.
I'LL SEND KOVAC IN.
COME ON, YOU'RE DOING THE POSITIVE CHARTS.
OH, CAN'T I DO THAT LATER?
NO, PEOPLE COULD BE GETTING SICK AND NOT EVEN KNOW IT.
WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO?
OKAY, I WANT YOU TO REVIEW ALL POSITIVE URINE
AND SPUTUM CULTURES FROM THE PAST 72 HOURS
AND CALL BACK ANY PATIENT WHO WASN'T TREATED
WITH THE APPROPRIATE ANTIBIOTIC.
WHEN YOU'RE DONE SORTING THROUGH THESE
I WANT YOU TO CHECK OUR COMPLIANCE ON T.B. MASK FIT TESTING.
YOU ASKED FOR MORE ADMINISTRATIVE EXPERIENCE?
AND YET, SOMEHOW, I FEEL I'M BEING PUNISHED.
YEAH. NO PAIN, NO GAIN.
Woman: MULTICAR PILEUP!
TRANSPORTING FOUR TO LOCAL HOSPITALS.
ANY CRITICALS?
TRUCK DRIVER'S OKAY.
WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE GUY UNDERNEATH THE TRUCK.
WHAT'S THIS?
Paramedic: NECK AND BACK PAIN.
HOW ARE YOU DOING?
I'M OKAY.
OKAY. CAN YOU WIGGLE YOUR TOES FOR ME?
GREAT. THIS ONE'S CLEAR TO GO BY GROUND.
WHAT'S HIS STATUS?
COULDN'T GET IN TO TAKE VITALS.
IS HE AWAKE? TALKING?
HE WAS GROANING.
HOW SOON BEFORE WE CAN GET TO HIM?
GAS TANK'S LEAKING.
WE GOT TO FINISH FOAMING THE AREA FIRST.
HOW SOON?
SHUT IT OFF!
I CAN'T SEE ANYTHING!
CAN YOU BREAK THROUGH?
HELP ME!
PLEASE, SOMEBODY HELP!
HELLO! CAN YOU HEAR ME?
WHAT'S YOUR NAME? DEAN.
OKAY, DEAN, WE'RE GOING TO HELP YOU.
HE'S GOT A WEAK CAROTID PULSE.
Corday: WE'RE GOING TO GET YOU OUT.
HANG ON!
( phone ringing )
E.R.
NO, YOU DON'T NEED AN APPOINTMENT... STUPID.
CAROL, COULD YOU ORDER A GRAM STAIN ON THE SPUTUM?
I'M JUST ANSWERING PHONES.
OH, WELL, EXCUSE ME.
Knight: WHAT ARE YOU MAKING?
WHAT'S IT LOOK LIKE?
A BLANKET.
IT'S A HAT.
SORRY. NICE COLOR.
LUCY, I WANT TO TALK TO YOU.
DID YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND ABOUT DRUG TESTING THAT KID?
NOPE. WAITING FOR THE RESULTS.
E.R.
IT'S ROUGH BEING A FOURTH-YEAR.
NOBODY THINKS YOU'RE READY TO FLY.
Man: EXCUSE ME...
I GOT TWO MEMBERS OF MY CHOIR OUT HERE
STILL NEEDS TO BE SEEN.
AND A CUT ON MY HAND.
CLEO?
LUCY, WHY DON'T YOU ASSESS THEM, ORDER THEIR TESTS
AND I'LL SIGN OFF BEFORE YOU DISCHARGE THEM.
SURE.
( phone rings )
E.R.
HEY, CAROL.
CAN YOU ORDER MY GRAM STAIN NOW?
YOU THE DOC?
YEP. CORDAY FROM COUNTY.
DETECTIVE CRUSON, VIOLENT CRIME.
IS HE STILL ALIVE? JUST ABOUT.
WHAT ABOUT HIS PASSENGER?
THERE'S NO ONE ELSE IN HIS CAR.
Cruson: THERE SHOULD BE.
HE CARJACKED A LADY THIS MORNING.
HELP ME...
WHAT'D YOU DO WITH HER?
SOMEBODY HELP ME!
WHAT'D YOU DO WITH THE LADY YOU CARJACKED?
OH! OKAY!
HE'S CUT HIS CAROTID!
OPEN A FEW PACKS OF FOUR-BY-FOURS.
HE'LL NEED TWO LARGE-BORE I.V.s.
PLEASE...
DON'T MOVE!
YOU'VE CUT AN ARTERY IN YOUR NECK.
WE'LL REMOVE THE COLLAR
TO STOP YOUR BLEEDING.
TELL ME WHERE SHE IS.
WHO?
YOU KNOW WHO, YOU SON OF A BITCH.
DON'T MOVE!
DON'T MOVE! NOW BACK OFF HIM AND LET ME WORK!
A WOMAN'S OUT THERE IN TROUBLE. GOD KNOWS WHAT HE DID.
TAPE HIS FOREHEAD!
DON'T MOVE!
DON'T LET ME DIE.
I'M A DOCTOR. I'LL LOOK AFTER YOU.
LISTEN! THERE IS A WOMAN OUT THERE THAT COULD BE DYING.
YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?
WE GOT TO FIND HER.
WHERE IS SHE, DEAN?
YOU'RE BLEEDING, REALLY BADLY.
WHERE IS SHE?
I DON'T KNOW.
B.P.'s DOWN TO 70.
THIS IS YOUR LAST CHANCE.
DO YOU WANT TO DIE?
UH-UH.
THEN YOU TELL ME WHERE SHE IS.
YOU TELL ME WHERE SHE IS
OR I'LL LET YOU BLEED TO DEATH.
DO YOU HEAR ME?
LINC... LINCOLN PARK...
UNDER THE BRIDGE.
SHE'S IN LINCOLN PARK UNDER THE BRIDGE!
LINCOLN PARK! LINCOLN PARK!
OKAY, WE'VE GOT TO STOP THIS BLEEDING.
GET ME AN ATRAUMATIC CLAMP NOW!
Benton: HOW'S HE DOING?
HE'S STABLE, I INTUBATED HIM ON THE CHOPPER.
I HEARD YOU TIED OFF HIS CAROTID.
THAT'S A PRETTY AGGRESSIVE MOVE.
I HAD NO CHOICE.
ARE HANDCUFFS NECESSARY?
HE'S NOT GOING ANYWHERE.
I'M JUST FOLLOWING PROCEDURE.
HE'S UNDER ARREST FOR ATTEMPTED MURDER.
CAROL? JUDY ROGERS.
I'M MEG CORWIN'S NURSE.
SHE HAD A BABY BOY
AND WOULD REALLY LIKE TO SEE YOU.
WHY DOES SHE WANT TO SEE ME?
SHE DIDN'T SAY.
HOW'S THE BABY DOING?
QUITE WELL UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES.
WE WERE ABLE TO GET MEG
OFF THE HEROIN BEFORE SHE DELIVERED.
SHE SAID YOU GOT HER ARRESTED.
WELL, SHE REFUSED TREATMENT
SO I DIDN'T HAVE MUCH CHOICE.
HEY, I'M WITH YOU.
IF YOU WANT TO SEE HER SHE'S ON THE JAIL WARD.
THANK YOU.
HEY, CAROL? I HEARD UCAN's FLYING IN A TRAUMA.
ELIZABETH AND PETER HAVE IT.
I'LL GO SEE IF THEY NEED A HAND.
NOT SO FAST.
I CHECKED OVER YOUR LIST.
YOU HAVEN'T BEEN FITTED FOR A T.B. MASK.
WELL, I'LL DO IT LATER.
I EXPECT YOU TO SET A GOOD EXAMPLE
FOR THE OTHER RESIDENTS.
LET'S GO.
HE'S SHOCKY, CONNIE, TYPE AND CROSS FOR SIX.
HANG TWO UNITS OF O-NEG ON THE RAPID INFUSER.
BLOOD BANK'S OUT OF O-NEG.
WE'LL HAVE TO TYPE HIM FIRST.
WE NEED BLOOD NOW.
WHAT DO YOU KNOW, HE'S GOT A BLOOD DONOR CARD.
"I WAS AN ANGEL, I DONATED BLOOD."
HE'S B-POSITIVE.
OKAY, I'LL ORDER IT.
SEND OFF BLOOD, C-SPINE AND A CHEST X RAY.
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GET A GRAM OF ANCEF.
LET'S UPDATE THE TETANUS.
RE-CHECK HIS CHEST. BELLY'S SOFT.
CHEST IS CLEAR.
HE'S GOT AN UNSTABLE PELVIS, ADD AN A-P.
PRESSURE'S DOWN 60 PALP.
OKAY, HE'S BLEEDING OUT.
LET'S LOG ROLL HIM, CHECK HIS BACK.
HE'S CUFFED.
UNCUFF HIM! SUPPOSED TO KEEP THEM ON.
LILY, GET THE BOLT CUTTERS.
ALL RIGHT, BUT YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE.
YEAH, YEAH.
ALL RIGHT, GO.
NO SIGN OF ANY INJURY.
COULD BE A PELVIC HEMATOMA.
COULD BE AN INTRA-ABDOMINAL BLEED.
I'LL DO AN ULTRASOUND.
NO, NO, NO. WHY DON'T YOU TAKE A BREAK.
I GOT HIM.
NO, I BROUGHT HIM IN.
I'LL STAY WITH HIM.
ALL RIGHT, YOU GOT IT.
Knight: WHERE'S THE COMPETITION BEING HELD?
AT NAVY PIER.
THEY'RE SENDING OVER A BUS TO PICK US UP.
SO, KEEP THE SUTURES CLEAN AND DRY
AND IN ABOUT A WEEK
GO SEE YOUR DOCTOR AND HAVE THEM REMOVED.
THANK YOU.
ARE YOU OKAY
MR. OWENS? YOU'RE BREATHING KIND OF FAST.
YOU KNOW, LET ME LISTEN TO YOUR LUNGS.
OH, I'M FINE.
I'LL HAVE YOU BREATHE IN AND OUT, DEEPLY.
AGAIN.
YOU'VE GOT RALES-- WET LUNGS.
ARE YOU ON ANY MEDICATIONS?
DIGOXIN AND LASIX FOR CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE.
I'D LIKE TO RUN SOME BLOOD TESTS.
OH, NO.
I'VE HAD THIS FOR FIVE YEARS.
I NEED TO ROUND EVERYONE UP AND REASSIGN PARTS.
YOUR LUNGS SOUND BAD, MR. OWENS.
SO WILL MY CHOIR IF WE DON'T REHEARSE.
HE'S GOT A PELVIC HEMATOMA.
HE MAY NEED EMBOLIZATION.
CALL STEVE FLINT IN RADIOLOGY.
LILY, HOW ARE WE DOING ON THAT BLOOD?
FOUR UNITS ON THE WAY.
Oligario: RADIOLOGY'S READY WHEN YOU ARE.
THEY MUST HAVE FOUND HER. WHO?
THE WOMAN HE KIDNAPPED. SHE'S STILL ALIVE.
PRESSURE'S DOWN TO 60. WHAT?
B.P.'s 60, YOU WANT ANOTHER LITER OF SALINE?
NO. LILY, GET THE RAPID INFUSER.
MULTIPLE STAB WOUNDS TO THE CHEST.
DECREASED BREATH SOUNDS.
YOU WANT TO PUT IN A CHEST TUBE?
YEAH. TEN BLADE.
SHE'S HYPOTENSIVE, B.P. 90, PULSE 130.
THE BLOOD BANK HAVE ANY O-NEG?
NOT YET.
DOES HER HUSBAND KNOW HER BLOOD TYPE?
HE SAID HE DOESN'T KNOW.
TYPE AND CROSS HER FOR FOUR.
ARE THOSE SCRATCHES ON HER NECK?
STEP BACK, WE NEED TO WORK.
DR. WEAVER, YOU MIGHT WANT TO TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.
ABRASIONS
TO THE EXTERNAL GENITALIA.
YOSH, GET THE CAMERA.
SANDRA...
CAN YOU DESCRIBE THE MAN THAT STABBED YOU?
RON...
WHERE'S RON?
TRY AND REMEMBER.
SATS HAVE DROPPED TO 88.
I GOT TO INTUBATE.
YOU GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE.
I NEED A POSITIVE I.D.
YOU HEARD HER. GET OUT NOW.
SANDRA, I'M GOING TO PUT A TUBE DOWN YOUR THROAT
TO HELP YOU BREATHE.
15 OF ETOMIDATE, 100 OF SUX.
DON'T WORRY, YOUR HUSBAND IS ON THE WAY.
SHE'S BLEEDING OUT.
HAND ME THE CELL SAVER. CHUNY...
RUN A RED TOP TO THE BLOOD BANK.
TELL THEM TO DROP EVERYTHING
AND GIVE US FOUR UNITS OF TYPE SPECIFIC.
DONE.
CHECK A SECOND HEMACUE AND PRIME THE RAPID INFUSER.
HOW WE DOING ON THAT CENTRAL LINE?
I'M ALMOST THERE.
HE CAN'T HOLD HIS ARM UP.
SQUEEZE MY HAND.
TIGHTER.
WHAT'S WRONG?
HE'S GOT WEAKNESS.
YOU TIED OFF HIS CAROTID.
WHAT DO YOU EXPECT?
HE SHOULD STILL HAVE GOOD COLLATERAL FLOW TO HIS BRAIN.
I GOT THE B-POSITIVE.
HANG IT ON THE RAPID INFUSER.
WE NEED TO PUT IN A SHUNT!
HE COULD BE STROKING OUT!
CONNIE, GET A JAVID FROM THE O.R.
ALL RIGHT, THAT'S IT. I'M IN.
BRING DOWN AS MANY
SIZES AS YOU CAN.
OH!
OKAY, MALIK! MALIK, CLAMP IT!
I GOT IT. GET THOSE CLOTHES OFF HIM.
PREP HIS NECK AND GET A VASCULAR TRAY.
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?
WE'RE SAVING HIS LIFE.
NO, YOU'RE DESTROYING EVIDENCE.
HER BLOOD COULD BE ON THEM.
SO IS A UNIT OF DONOR BLOOD.
IT DOESN'T MATTER.
STOP CUTTING HIS CLOTHES.
I'M SORRY, I DIDN'T REALIZE.
KEEP ALL HIS BELONGINGS SEPARATE.
HIS WEAKNESS IS PROGRESSING.
WE GOT TO GET THAT SHUNT IN.
AND DON'T CLEAN HIM UP
UNTIL I COME BACK WITH A WARRANT.
HOW MUCH HAVE YOU GIVEN HER?
I AUTOTRANSFUSED A LITER BACK.
OKAY, SHE'S BLED ANOTHER LITER INTO THE CELL SAVER.
BLOOD BANK SAYS ANOTHER TEN MINUTES ON THE TYPE SPECIFIC.
WE CAN'T WAIT THAT LONG.
SHE'S LOST TOO MUCH BLOOD.
CHECK AND SEE IF ANYONE HERE IS O-NEGATIVE.
WHAT TYPE ARE YOU?
I'M B-POSITIVE.
MALUCCI, WHAT'S YOUR BLOOD TYPE?
A-POSITIVE, WHY?
Haleh: TELL ME IF YOU TASTE ANYTHING.
HALEH, WHAT'S YOUR BLOOD TYPE?
A-B.
CARTER? O-NEGATIVE.
WHAT? O-NEGATIVE.
YOU'RE THE MAN. COME ON.
CARTER'S O-NEGATIVE.
WHAT'S GOING ON?
WE NEED YOU TO DONATE.
SIT HIM DOWN AND GET A 14-GAUGE NEEDLE.
YOU WANT TO PUT THIS ON HIM?
MULTIPLE STABBING VICTIM, NEEDS BLOOD.
THERE'S NO TIME TO TYPE HER.
I'VE BEEN NUMBING IT WITH A LITTLE BIT OF... ( screams ).
I GOT A FLASH.
KEEP YOUR ARM STRAIGHT, CARTER.
THIS IS A NEEDLE, NOT A CATHETER.
SHE'S TACHYCARDIC.
HEART RATE'S 140.
STAND BY WITH THE PADDLES.
VESSEL LOOPS ARE IN PLACE.
I'LL CANNULATE THE PROXIMAL END OF THE SHUNT
SO WE CAN FLUSH IT OUT.
OTHERWISE, WE COULD SEND
AN AIR EMBOLISM TO THE BRAIN.
SNUG IT DOWN
WHILE I DO THE DISTAL END.
WHAT'S WRONG?
SHUNT'S NOT ADVANCING.
HOLD ON. HOLD ON. YOU COULD BE RAISING
AN INTIMAL FLAP.
HE'S THROWING P.V.C.'s.
GIVE HIM 100 OF LIDOCAINE AND PREP A DRIP. THERE...
DISTAL VESSEL LOOPS
ARE SECURE.
ALL RIGHT, LET'S OPEN THE SHUNT
AND SEE HOW HE DOES.
WITH ANY LUCK, HE'LL BE ABLE TO STAND TRIAL.
BLOOD'S READY.
HANG IT ON THE INFUSER.
YOU'RE A GOOD BLEEDER, CARTER.
WHAT CAN I DO?
GO TO THE LOUNGE.
GET YOURSELF SOME ORANGE JUICE AND COOKIES.
HEY, I'M FINE.
CARTER, GO!
HER PRESSURE'S DROPPING.
OKAY, WE'VE GOT TO CONTROL THE BLEEDING.
I PUT IN ANOTHER CHEST TUBE.
OH, MY GOD.
SIR, YOU HAVE TO LEAVE.
MY WIFE... SHE'S GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT?
WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN. ( chorus singing )
WHERE IS THAT MUSIC COMING FROM?
LUCY'S GOSPEL SINGERS.
OKAY, ASK THEM TO STOP SINGING.
WE'RE TRYING TO WORK HERE.
WE'VE LOST HER PRESSURE, THORACOTOMY TRAY.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
WE HAVE TO STOP THE BLEEDING.
GET HIM OUT OF HERE.
GIVE ME THE STERNAL SAW.
( singing continues )
DR. WEAVER WANTS THEM TO STOP.
WHAT?
PLEASE, QUIET DOWN!
I'M SORRY.
YOU JUST CAN'T SING IN HERE.
THEN WE'LL REHEARSE OUTSIDE.
LET'S GO, EVERYONE.
NO, MR. OWENS, YOU CAN'T LEAVE.
HIS BLOOD TESTS AREN'T BACK YET.
TAKE IT UP WITH DR. WEAVER.
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
I GOT TO PEE.
DO I HAVE TO GO IN A CUP AGAIN?
NO, YOU CAN FLUSH THIS TIME.
IS THAT DRUG TEST BACK ON CHAD KOTTMEIER?
YEAH. TOX SCREEN CAME BACK NEGATIVE.
THAT'S GOOD NEWS.
BUT HIS LIVER FUNCTION TESTS WERE ABNORMAL.
COULD YOU CALL THE LAB
AND ADD ON A BLOOD ALCOHOL LEVEL?
SURE.
OH, WHOA, CAROL, ARE YOU OKAY?
DAVE, NEED A HAND! CAROL'S PRESYNCOPAL.
I'M JUST DIZZY. YEAH, OKAY.
I'M OKAY, REALLY.
TAKE SOME DEEP BREATHS.
GUYS, I'M FINE.
SHE'S PROBABLY HYPOTENSIVE.
WE'RE PUTTING YOU AND THE BABIES ON A MONITOR.
COME ON, I'M ALL RIGHT.
CAROL, BREATHE.
I'VE GOT THE BLOOD.
OKAY, HANG IT WIDE OPEN ON THE RAPID INFUSER.
PULMONARY VEIN IS SHREDDED ON MY SIDE.
CLAMP OFF THE HILUM.
SHE'S LOSING BLOOD FASTER THAN WE CAN GIVE IT TO HER.
GIVE ME SUCTION. GIVE ME SUCTION.
2-0 SILK AND PICKUPS.
OKAY, HILUM IS CLAMPED.
TAKE OVER COMPRESSIONS. GIVE ME THE STITCH.
SHE'S IN FIB.
HER HEART'S FILLING.
GIVE ME THE PADDLES.
CHARGE TO 30, AND CLEAR!
LET'S TAKE HIM TO RADIOLOGY FOR EMBOLIZATION.
DO YOU STILL NEED ME?
NO, I'LL TAKE HIM UP.
ALL RIGHT.
UH, CONNIE, YOU GO ON.
I'LL BE UP IN A MINUTE.
CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT THEY'RE DOING TO MY WIFE?
THEY'RE SHOCKING HER HEART
TO TRY TO GET IT BEATING AGAIN.
WHY ARE THEY STOPPING?
MR. PERRY, WE NEED TO TALK TO YOU.
( crying )
THEY OKAY?
GOOD VARIABILITY.
NO CONTRACTIONS.
YOUR BABIES ARE DOING GREAT.
IT'S YOU I'M WORRIED ABOUT.
I'M TAKING IT EASY.
THERE'S NO SUCH THING
AS TAKING IT EASY IN THE E.R.
YOU'RE IN YOUR THIRD TRIMESTER
WITH TWINS.
YOU NEED TO GO HOME AND REST.
HEARD YOU COLLAPSED. YOU OKAY?
I DIDN'T COLLAPSE.
I'M FINE.
HER BLOOD PRESSURE WAS LOW.
NORMAL FOR THIS STAGE OF THE PREGNANCY.
CALL ME IF YOU HAVE ANY PROBLEMS.
THANKS.
YOU NEED...
TO GO HOME, I KNOW.
HEY, HOW'S YOUR DAD?
HE NEVER GOT OFF THE PLANE.
WAS IT THE RIGHT FLIGHT?
YES. THE ONLY MORNING FLIGHT FROM SAN DIEGO.
I CALLED THE AIRLINE
AND THEY WOULDN'T GIVE ME ANY INFORMATION.
DID YOU CALL HIM AT HOME?
YEAH, AND I CHECKED WITH THE NEIGHBOR.
SHE HAS A KEY AND SHE WENT OVER TO THE HOUSE.
THERE'S NO SIGN OF HIM.
UM, MAYBE HE TOOK A LATER FLIGHT.
YEAH, OR HE'S JUST LOST SOMEWHERE
IN THE CONTINENTAL UNITED STATES.
GUESS I'M OFF THE HOOK, HUH?
NOT QUITE.
YOUR TESTS ARE A BUNCH OF CRAP.
I'M CLEAN.
YOU'RE DRUNK.
IF YOU CALL THIS DRUNK
LADY, YOU DON'T GET OUT MUCH.
WHEN WAS YOUR LAST DRINK?
I HAD A FEW BEERS LAST NIGHT.
MUST HAVE HAD MORE THAN A FEW
TO STILL HAVE ALCOHOL IN YOUR BLOOD THIS AFTERNOON.
OKAY, SO MAYBE I HAD A COUPLE SIX PACKS.
I DON'T REMEMBER.
IS THAT BECAUSE YOU BLACKED OUT?
CHAD, YOU'VE ALREADY GOT LIVER DAMAGE
FROM THE ALCOHOL.
THAT MEANS YOU'VE BEEN DOING SOME SERIOUSLY HEAVY DRINKING.
I LIKE TO PARTY WITH MY FRIENDS.
NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT.
WE NEED TO TALK TO YOUR MOM.
SO WHAT'S SHE GOING TO SAY?
SHE GETS BOMBED EVERY NIGHT HERSELF.
SHE JUST WENT TO GO GET US COFFEE.
THAT'S ALL.
Kovac: MR. PERRY, COULD WE SPEAK TO YOU OUTSIDE?
I CAN'T LEAVE.
NOT YET.
Weaver: WE NEED TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT SOMETHING
THAT'S GOING TO BE VERY DIFFICULT.
WE HAVE TO DO A RAPE EXAM ON YOUR WIFE.
PLEASE, COME WITH US.
I'M VERY SORRY
BUT I MUST ASK.
HAVE YOU HAD INTERCOURSE WITH YOUR WIFE
IN THE PAST 72 HOURS?
WHY?
IF THE EXAM IS POSITIVE, WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE
THAT IT WASN'T YOU.
NO.
( sobbing )
Flint: HE'S BLEEDING FROM THE INTERNAL ILIAC.
WE'LL HAVE TO EMBOLIZE THE VESSEL.
ANY OTHER SITES OF HEMORRHAGE?
NO, HE LUCKED OUT.
NONETHELESS, HE'S GOT A FRACTURED PELVIS
SHREDDED CAROTID, DISLOCATED HIP
TORN HYPOGASTRIC.
ALL THE RADIOLOGISTS AND ALL THE SURGEONS
MIGHT NOT PUT HUMPTY BACK TOGETHER AGAIN.
STEP OUT, PLEASE.
WE'RE ABOUT TO TAKE X RAYS.
I HAVE A WARRANT TO GATHER EVIDENCE.
THE CHARGES AGAINST THIS GUY HAVE BEEN CHANGED.
WHAT DO YOU NEED TO DO?
FINGERPRINT HIM, SCRAPE UNDER HIS NAILS.
YOU'RE LOOKING AT MURDER ONE, PAL.
( gospel choir singing )
* AND HE REJOICES
* AND HE REJOICES...
YOUR LUNGS SOUND BETTER SINCE THE LASIX.
THAT DAMN STUFF MADE ME PEE LIKE A FOUNTAIN.
WE'RE LATE.
WE GOT TO BE HEADING OUT.
YOU CAN'T LEAVE UNTIL YOUR BLOOD TESTS ARE BACK.
I'M NOT GOING TO DISAPPOINT MY CHOIR.
I'LL COME BACK RIGHT AFTER THE CONCERT
I PROMISE.
FREDDY, WE'RE TAKING OFF.
YOU'RE LEAVING AGAINST MEDICAL ADVICE.
I'M GOING TO NEED YOU TO SIGN A WAIVER.
I HAVE TO GO GET A DOCTOR, OKAY?
I THOUGHT YOU WERE A DOCTOR.
I'M A MEDICAL STUDENT. YOU STAY THERE!
IF THE BOY DOESN'T WANT HELP
THERE'S NOT MUCH WE CAN DO.
IF HE KEEPS IT UP
HE'S GOING TO KILL HIMSELF OR SOMEONE ELSE.
I CAN GIVE YOU THE NAMES OF SOME TREATMENT PROGRAMS
THAT YOU CAN REFER HIM TO.
I OFFERED THAT. HE REFUSED.
CAN'T WE COMMIT HIM?
WE CAN'T PULL HIM OUT OF HIS HOME
FOR BEING AN ALCOHOLIC.
WHAT IF I CONVINCED THE MOM TO SIGN HIM
IN TO A TREATMENT FACILITY?
MAYBE.
MR. OWENS IS LEAVING A.M.A. TALK TO HIM.
HE'S IN CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE.
WHAT'S HIS E.K.G.?
NO S.T. CHANGES.
I PUT HIM ON LASIX AND NITRO PASTE AND I'M
WAITING ON CARDIAC ENZYMES.
WHERE IS HE?
WHY DIDN'T YOU GET ME SOONER?
THOUGHT I COULD HANDLE IT.
IF HIS ENZYMES SHOW HE'S HAD A HEART ATTACK
YOU BETTER FIND HIM.
HOW WAS THE EMERGENCY COMMITTEE MEETING?
I'LL LET YOU READ THE MINUTES.
DR. WEAVER IS MAKING ME TYPE THEM UP.
MARK, CAB COMPANY FROM SAN DIEGO CALLED BACK.
THEY SAID THEY PICKED UP YOUR DAD THIS MORNING
AND DROPPED HIM OFF AT THE AIRPORT.
THANK YOU.
GOT ANY LEADS?
NO, NOT YET.
WHAT ARE YOU STILL DOING HERE?
IF I DON'T FINISH THESE TIME CARDS
THE NURSES DON'T GET PAID.
CAN'T SOMEBODY ELSE DO IT?
IT'S GOING TO TAKE ME JUST AS LONG
TO EXPLAIN IT TO SOMEONE ELSE.
BESIDES, I'D BE DOING THIS AT HOME ANYWAY.
TAKE IT EASY. YES, DOCTOR.
MARK, THE NEUROLOGIST WANTS TO KNOW
IF YOU OR DR. WEAVER CAN COME UP TO SIX WEST.
IT'S ABOUT DR. LAWRENCE.
WHERE'S KERRY?
SHE'S DOING A RAPE EXAM.
ALL RIGHT. TELL HIM I'M ON MY WAY.
OOH, I ALMOST FORGOT.
SOME GIRL NAMED MEG CALLED.
SHE SAID SHE REALLY WANTS TO SEE YOU.
THANKS.
UH-HUH.
IT'S A VOLCANO.
WHETHER IT'S MT. ETNA OR VESUVIUS
I COULDN'T TELL YOU.
OKAY, VOLCANO WILL DO.
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.
I FEEL LIKE A LAB RAT.
JUST BEAR WITH ME.
FINE, JUST POINT ME TO THE CHEESE.
WHAT'S THIS?
IT'S A MARTINI GLASS WITHOUT THE BASE.
OR IT'S A...
IT'S A CONE, RIGHT?
OKAY, LET'S TRY ANOTHER ONE.
WHAT'S THIS?
THOSE ARE THE PICKER UPPERS
THAT YOU USE TO PUT THE ICE IN A MARTINI GLASS.
THEY'RE ALSO CALLED...?
CALL 'EM WHATEVER YOU LIKE.
OKAY. THEY'RE TONGS.
GREAT, THEY'RE TONGS.
WHO THE HELL CARES?
HOW ABOUT THIS ONE?
LOOK, STOP THIS NONSENSE.
WE'RE NOT QUITE FINISHED YET.
I AM. I'M NOT GOING TO SIT HERE AND PLAY GUESSING GAMES
WITH YOU AND A BUNCH OF LOUSY DRAWINGS.
I'M SORRY.
WHY DON'T WE TAKE A SHORT BREAK?
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
DON'T RUSH.
SALINE.
ARE YOU READY FOR THE WOODS LAMP?
YEAH, PLEASE.
I SEE A SPOT.
LOOKS LIKE SEMEN.
THAT'S IT.
FINISHED UP?
I'M JUST WAITING FOR THE TEST RESULTS.
HAVE A SEAT.
SHARE MY BOREDOM.
WANT TO GRAB A CUP OF COFFEE?
WELL, SURE.
WHY NOT?
HOW ARE THINGS GOING?
FOR A DOC WHO CAN'T PRACTICE MEDICINE?
CAN'T COMPLAIN.
I CALLED YOUR SON.
HE'S ON HIS WAY OVER.
OH, NO.
LOOK, I JUST... I TOLD THAT NEUROLOGIST
I DON'T WANT MY SON INVOLVED.
YOU CAN'T ENLIST IN A CLINICAL TRIAL WITHOUT A CAREGIVER.
YOU NEED SOMEONE TO BE IN TOUCH
ON A DAILY BASIS,
MAKE SURE THAT YOU TAKE YOUR MEDS.
MY SON IS NOT GOING TO BABY-SIT ME.
YOU TOOK CARE OF HIM WHEN HE NEEDED YOU.
NOW IT'S HIS TURN.
THAT'S JUST IT--
I WAS TOO BUSY BEING A DOCTOR...
TOO BUSY HELPING EVERYBODY ELSE.
YEAH, WELL, LET YOUR SON DECIDE, OKAY?
NO, I'M NOT GOING TO BE A BURDEN TO HIM.
DR. CHOW IS GOING
TO BE TESTING A NEW NEUROTROPHIN.
IT COULD GIVE YOU SOME MORE TIME.
WHAT DIFFERENCE IS A COUPLE OF MORE MONTHS GOING
TO MAKE?
SO, YOU'RE JUST GIVING UP
BECAUSE YOU'RE TOO DAMN PROUD TO ASK YOUR SON FOR HELP?
( sighs )
IF HE SAYS YES...
I'LL STILL END UP THE WAY I'LL END UP.
I DON'T THINK I COULD BEAR FOR HIM TO SAY NO.
JUST TALK TO HIM.
HE MIGHT SAY YES.
I THINK IT'S TOO LATE.
I'M GOING TO CLEAN OUT MY LOCKER.
DOPPLER SHOWED AN INTIMAL TEAR OF THE CAROTID.
WE'LL GO IN AND TACK IT DOWN.
YEAH, SOUNDS LIKE A PLAN.
LIZZIE... I UNDERSTAND
YOU'VE HAD YOURSELF QUITE A DAY.
I'M NOT IN THE MOOD.
PERHAPS YOU'D BE IN THE MOOD
TO HEAR WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON DOWNSTAIRS.
NO. YOUR, UH, PATIENT RAPED THAT WOMAN.
( whispering ): OH... DEAR GOD.
YEAH.
I ALSO GOT A LITTLE VISIT
FROM AN INVESTIGATOR IN THE PUBLIC DEFENDER'S OFFICE.
IT SEEMS SOME BLEEDING HEART IS CLAIMING
THAT YOU COERCED ROLLINS
INTO TELLING YOU WHERE HE LEFT HER.
DID YOU COERCE YOUR PATIENT
INTO GIVING INFORMATION
IN EXCHANGE FOR HIS LIFE?
DR. ROMANO, YOU'RE OUT OF LINE.
IT'S OKAY, PETER.
I'LL ANSWER THAT.
I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY I PRESSURED MR. ROLLINS.
WELL, LIZZIE
YOU NEVER FAIL TO IMPRESS ME.
I DIDN'T THINK
YOU HAD IT IN YOU TO CROSS THAT LINE...
BUT YOU MAY WANT TO REFLECT
ON WHETHER THAT'S REALLY HOW YOU'D CHARACTERIZE
WHAT HAPPENED TODAY
BECAUSE, UNFORTUNATELY, IN THIS COUNTRY
WHEN A CONFESSION IS COERCED
IT'S USUALLY THROWN OUT.
I'M HERE TO SEE MEG CORWIN.
Rogers: CHANGE YOUR MIND?
I WANTED TO SEE THE BABY.
JUST IN TIME.
SOCIAL SERVICES WILL BE HERE SOON TO TAKE HIM.
SHE'S IN HERE.
KIND OF CRAZY HAVING TO LOCK HER IN LIKE THIS
BUT COUNTY HAS ITS RULES.
Hi, Meg.
Hi.
This is Joshua.
He's beautiful.
Hi, Joshua.
THEY'RE-THEY'RE SENDING ME BACK TO JAIL.
I NEED YOU TO TALK TO SOMEONE
ABOUT LETTING JOSHUA STAY
WITH ME.
OH, MEG, THAT WOULDN'T DO ANY GOOD.
YOU DID THIS.
IF YOU HADN'T GOTTEN ME BUSTED
I WOULDN'T BE HERE RIGHT NOW.
I DID WHAT I THOUGHT WAS BEST FOR YOU AND YOUR BABY.
I'M GOING TO BE IN JAIL FOR TEN MONTHS.
YOU THINK THAT'S WHAT'S BEST FOR HIM?
LOOK, I KNOW HOW HARD THIS IS
BUT IF YOU GET YOUR LIFE BACK TOGETHER
AND YOU PROVE THAT TO THEM
I'M SURE YOU CAN GET JOSHUA BACK.
HOW CAN YOU BE SO DAMN SELF-RIGHTEOUS?
MEG, SOCIAL SERVICES
IS HERE.
JUST GIVE ME A LITTLE MORE TIME, OKAY?
Rogers: YOU KNOW THE RULES.
MOMS CAN'T KEEP THEIR BABIES IN JAIL.
Meg: THIS ISN'T RIGHT.
I KNOW I SCREWED UP BAD, BUT HE NEEDS ME.
Come on, now.
I'm his mother.
Carol, please do something.
There isn't anything I can do.
Carol, please.
I-I'm sorry, Meg.
Please, Carol.
You did this.
Let him stay a little while longer.
No, sweetheart.
We're going find a good home for this baby.
CAN YOU OPEN THIS DOOR?!
He's really happy with me.
JUST A MOMENT. YEAH, SORRY.
Please let him stay.
Rogers: I'm sure, Meg.
OPEN THIS DOOR NOW, PLEASE!
I'm his mother.
...precious one a place to live.
No, no, please don't take him.
We're going to take really good care of him.
Please don't take my baby!
I'm his mother.
Rogers: When I get back
I'll get you something so you can get to sleep.
Mama loves you, honey.
Attendant, come with me.
I love you.
I love you.
We'll be back for you.
( crying ): I'm his mother!
( footsteps running )
DR. LAWRENCE, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
I'M WAITING FOR MY RIDE.
Woman: EARL RYDIGER, 63--
WIFE FOUND HIM UNCONSCIOUS.
SEIZED IN THE RIG FOR THREE MINUTES.
GAVE HIM TWO OF ATIVAN.
HISTORY OF TYPE-TWO DIABETES, MICRONASE.
Haleh: HE'S SEIZING AGAIN. TWO MORE OF ATIVAN.
LOAD HIM WITH DILANTIN, 15 PER KILO.
PAGE DR. WEAVER.
I GUESS I GOT MYSELF ALL WORKED UP OVER NOTHING.
MRS. KOTTMEIER, ALCOHOL ABUSE IS HARDLY NOTHING.
OH, SO HE HAD A FEW BEERS WITH HIS FRIENDS.
THANK GOD IT WASN'T SPEED OR COKE.
YOUR SON IS AN ALCOHOLIC.
HE HAS A SERIOUS PROBLEM WE CAN'T IGNORE.
WITH YOUR PERMISSION
I CAN REFER CHAD TO A TREATMENT PROGRAM.
DR., UH, FINCH
I BROUGHT MY SON HERE TO BE TESTED FOR DRUGS.
I DID NOT GIVE YOU PERMISSION TO TEST FOR ALCOHOL.
YOUR SON NEEDS HELP.
LOOK, HE'S NOT ON DRUGS, RIGHT?
ARE YOU AVOIDING THIS
BECAUSE YOU HAVE A DRINKING PROBLEM?
HOW DARE YOU?
COME ON, CHAD.
Carter: HOW MUCH DILANTIN'S ON BOARD?
400 MILLIGRAMS.
ALL RIGHT, KEEP PUSHING IT.
Jarvik: pH IS LOW-- 6.95.
POTASSIUM'S 6.8.
WHY IS HE SO ACIDEMIC?
HE'S DIABETIC.
COULD IT BE KETOACIDOSIS?
Haleh: BLOOD GLUCOSE IS NORMAL.
Carter: SEPTIC?
TEMP AND WHITE COUNT ARE NORMAL. B.P.'s STABLE.
SEIZURE STOPPED.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS.
HE'S THROWING P.V.C.s
Carter: START LIDOCAINE.
WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON?
HE'S SEIZING AGAIN.
HE'S GOING TO ARREST.
DR. LAWRENCE, CAN YOU HELP ME?
I DON'T WORK HERE ANYMORE.
PLEASE, I GOT A GUY WHO'S CODING.
HIS pH IS FALLING.
HIS POTASSIUM'S RISING.
HE'S HAVING REFRACTORY SEIZURES.
PLEASE.
IT'S NOTHING OBVIOUS.
IT'S NOT D.K.A.
IT'S NOT SEPSIS.
IT'S NOT ASPIRIN.
IT'S NOT UREMIA.
Haleh: HE'S THROWING MULTIFOCAL P.V.C.s.
GET ME SIX OF PAVULON.
PAVULON? JUST DO IT.
WHAT'S GOING ON?
GUY WITH REFRACTORY SEIZURES AND ACIDEMIA.
DR. LAWRENCE HAS ASKED ME TO GIVE HIM PAVULON.
COME ON, PUSH IT, CARTER.
I'VE NEVER TRIED GIVING PAVULON FOR ACIDEMIA AND SEIZURES.
IT'S STRYCHNINE POISONING.
GIVE ME THAT.
I'LL DO IT.
IT WORKED.
HOW DID YOU KNOW?
STRYCHNINE COMPETITIVELY ANTAGONIZES
THE CENTRAL INHIBITION OF GLYCINE
WHICH CAUSES HYPEREXCITATION.
I HAD A CASE LIKE THIS 20 YEARS AGO.
PATIENT TRIED TO COMMIT SUICIDE BY EATING GOPHER GO.
ONCE YOU SEE STRYCHNINE POISONING, YOU NEVER FORGET IT.
CHECK HIS pH.
I'LL BET YOU'LL SEE IT'S COMING BACK UP.
DR. CARTER, YOUR PATIENT WILL RECOVER.
THANK YOU.
SCORE ONE FOR THE ABSENT- MINDED PROFESSOR, HUH?
WELL, I GOT TO GO.
GABE...
THAT PATIENT WOULD'VE DIED
IF YOU HADN'T BEEN HERE.
THIS OLD DOG CAN STILL TEACH YOU
A FEW NEW TRICKS.
I WOULDN'T BE HERE WITHOUT YOU.
I JUST GAVE YOU A LITTLE PUSH
IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION IS ALL.
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?
MARK CALLED MY SON... ASKED HIM TO STOP BY TODAY.
WE TALKED AND...
( sighs )
UM, I AGREED TO LIVE WITH HIM.
I'M GLAD.
HE'S PICKING ME UP NOW.
I'LL SEE YOU, KERRY.
I'LL SEE YOU.
YOU FIND THAT PATIENT?
I CALLED A DOZEN TIMES.
NOBODY'S SEEN HIM.
WHAT'VE YOU GOT?
55-YEAR-OLD MALE...
COMPLAINS OF HEADACHE AND CHEST PAIN
ALONG WITH GOSPEL SINGERS
WITH SUSPECTED CARBON-MONOXIDE POISONING.
THIS IS YOUR FAULT.
MR. OWENS...
WE MISSED THE FESTIVAL.
CALL CARDIOLOGY AND DON'T LOSE HIM THIS TIME.
MARK?
DAD?
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
I WAS WORRIED ABOUT YOU.
I'M FINE...
A LITTLE TIRED BUT 200 BUCKS RICHER.
MY FLIGHT WAS OVERBOOKED
SO I VOLUNTEERED TO TAKE A LATER ONE.
YOU KNOW, THEY ACTUALLY PAY YOU TO GET OFF THE PLANE.
DAD, YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT SAVING A COUPLE HUNDRED BUCKS, YOU KNOW?
I COULD BUY YOU A TICKET.
I CAN AFFORD MY OWN TICKET, MARK.
DAD, HOW ABOUT A TOUR?
I'VE BEEN IN PLENTY OF HOSPITALS.
WELL, YOU'VE NEVER BEEN IN THIS ONE.
YOU'RE THE BOSS AROUND HERE, RIGHT?
YEAH, ONE OF THEM.
OH.
DR. KOVAC...
THANK YOU.
OH. FOR WHAT?
FOR DOING A GOOD JOB
ON A TOUGH CASE.
OKAY...
TILL NEXT TIME.
LUKA, I... WOULD LIKE YOU TO STAY...
PERMANENTLY.
THERE'S AN OPENING HERE SINCE DR. LAWRENCE IS LEAVING.
OKAY.
GREAT.
DON'T YOU WANT TO KNOW
HOW MUCH IT PAYS?
YOU'LL BE FAIR.
SEE YOU TOMORROW.
SEE YOU.
Corday: I'LL CLOSE.
WHAT'S HIS BLOOD LOSS?
Woman: 700cc's.
LET'S GIVE HIM ANOTHER UNIT.
NORMAL SINUS AT 100.
LUCKY BASTARD.
THE POLICE THOUGHT I SHOULD'VE LET HIM DIE.
WELL, DON'T BEAT YOURSELF UP.
YOUR GETTING HIM TO TALK
MADE IT POSSIBLE TO FIND HER.
YEAH, A FAT LOT OF GOOD THAT DID.
HEY, LOOK, SHE DIDN'T DIE ALONE
OUTSIDE AND UNDER A BRIDGE OR SOMETHING.
HE'S IN V-TACH!
Woman: PRESSURE'S DROPPING.
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GET THE PADDLES, PEOPLE. LET'S MOVE.
CHARGE TO 200.
PADDLES ARE CHARGED.
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO, ELIZABETH?
ELIZABETH?
CLEAR.
HE'S BACK.
