PASS ME SOME TAPE.
NOT THAT MUCH.
DAD, YOU GOT TO FINISH UP, OKAY?
I'M ON AT 3:00.
YOU GOT THAT BULB?
YOU'RE LUCKY I FOUND IT.
THEY DON'T MAKE THESE ANYMORE.
BET WE HAVEN'T LOOKED AT THESE SLIDES IN 25 YEARS.
YOUR MOTHER MADE ME DRAG THAT CAMERA EVERYWHERE.
I MADE AN APPOINTMENT FOR YOU ON MONDAY
WITH THE ONCOLOGIST.
I TOLD YOU I DIDN'T WANT THAT.
WOULD YOU AT LEAST TALK TO HIM?
YOU GOT THAT BULB?
DON'T GET YOUR FINGERPRINTS ON IT.
IN SAN DIEGO, THEY SAID THE CANCER WAS INCURABLE.
DOESN'T MEAN WE CAN'T TREAT IT.
PLUG THAT IN, WILL YOU?
THIS IS OUR TRIP
TO THE GRAND CANYON.
YOU MUST HAVE BOUGHT THE WRONG BULB.
YOU LEFT THIS IN THE HALL CLOSET.
OH, I ALWAYS PACK THE GARMENT BAG LAST.
BE A DEAR AND EMPTY THE TOP DRAWER.
I CAN'T STAY LONG.
I'VE GOT AN INCARCERATED HERNIA IN THE O.R.
WHAT SHOULD I DO WITH THIS?
( laughs )
WOULD YOU MIND RETURNING IT TO DAVID?
DO YOU SUPPOSE HE WORE ONLY ONE SOCK HOME?
HE'S A SWEET MAN.
MUCH LIKE HIS SON.
DOES THAT MEAN YOU APPROVE?
OH, I MORE THAN APPROVE.
I'VE SEEN HOW YOU GLOW WHENEVER HE'S AROUND.
YOU TWO BELONG TOGETHER.
SINCE WHEN HAVE YOU BEEN AN EXPERT ON RELATIONSHIPS?
I'VE ENJOYED BEING SINGLE.
I HAVE NO REGRETS.
WELL, WHAT ABOUT YOU, ELIZABETH?
WHAT WILL MAKE YOU HAPPY?
DO YOU REALLY WANT TO DISCUSS THIS AS YOU'RE ABOUT TO LEAVE?
UH, IF YOUR PLANE DOESN'T LEAVE TILL 10:00
WHY DON'T YOU DROP BY THE HOSPITAL?
WE'LL GRAB A COFFEE.
YES.
ABSOLUTELY.
I'D LOVE THAT.
MOTHER?
( chuckling ): WOULD YOU RETURN THOSE AS WELL?
( laughing )
WELCOME BACK, CARTER.
THANK YOU, HALEH.
HEY.
HOW YOU FEELING?
READY TO GO.
YEAH?
HEY, YOU KNOW, I SAW YOUR M.R.I.
LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE RECOVERING JUST FINE.
YEAH. SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET RID OF THESE IN ABOUT A WEEK OR TWO.
CARTER, TAKE YOUR TIME.
DON'T PUSH IT, ALL RIGHT?
JOHN, HOW YOU DOING? OH...
JUST LET ME KNOW IF YOU NEED ANYTHING.
I'M OKAY.
YEAH?
HAVE YOU SEEN ABBY?
NOT LATELY.
LABS ARE BACK ON TWO OF HER PATIENTS.
WE'VE GOT TO MOVE THEM.
YOU'RE LATE.
DEAL WITH THIS.
WHERE'S KOVAC AND WEAVER?
THEY ARE ON TONIGHT
SO YOU'RE THE MAN.
ALL RIGHT.
HAVE YOU CHECKED MY X RAY YET?
ABBY, CAN YOU TAKE THIS LADY?
I'M SORRY. I'VE GOT FOUR ALREADY.
RANDI, CAN YOU FIND OUT WHO THIS WOMAN'S DOCTOR IS?
WE GOT A LOT OF ANGRY PATIENTS WAITING.
IT'S SATURDAY.
EVERYONE SHOWS UP WHEN THE CLINICS ARE CLOSED.
WELL, YOU TELL THEM THAT.
DR. GREENE, PHONE.
IT'S YOUR DAD.
HEY... PHONE BOOK?
YEAH, WHY DON'T YOU TRY THE DESK DRAWER?
NO, DAD, I CAN'T HOLD. NO, DAD...
HAS ANYONE SEEN THE XEROFORM?
IT'S RIGHT HERE UNDER THE TEGADERM.
OH, UH-HUH.
SO, UH, WHAT TIME DO YOU GET OFF?
10:00.
SATURDAY NIGHT, WHAT YOU DOING?
WASHING MY HAIR.
HAVE FUN.
NOT THE BEDROOM DESK, THE LIVING ROOM DESK.
Marquez: GOT A NEW ONE.
FRANK BACON, I.C.U. CHARGE NURSE.
PASSED OUT IN THE UNIT.
I FEEL FINE. CAN I GO BACK TO WORK?
NOT UNTIL WE CLEAR YOU. CURTAIN THREE.
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE, MR. BACON.
CALL ME FRANK.
MARK, THREE PATIENTS LEFT WITHOUT BEING SEEN.
LISTEN, DAD, I GOT TO GO.
CALL 411.
THEY CAN HELP YOU FIND THE PLACE.
YOU GOT TO DO SOMETHING.
ALL RIGHT.
UH, RANDI, WHY DON'T YOU HAND ME THE CORDLESS PHONE?
HALEH, BRING OVER THE ROLLING CART.
UH, CHEN, ABBY, MALUCCI, OVER HERE.
WE'RE GOING TO DO POWER ROUNDS.
CARTER, YOU CARE TO JOIN?
PARAMEDICS ARE BRINGING AN O.D. IN.
OKAY. YOU READY FOR THAT?
ALL RIGHT. IT'S YOURS.
HOW ARE YOU DOING?
IT WON'T STOP.
OKAY, WELL, DR. DAVE WILL BE BACK
IN A MINUTE TO FIX YOU UP.
RANDI, IT'S DR. GREENE.
I NEED A NASAL SPECULUM AND A MEROCEL SPONGE IN 3-A.
THANKS. 3-B?
KIM TADLOCK, ASCITES.
OKAY.
C.B.C., CHEM PANEL AND A THREE-WAY OF THE ABDOMEN.
SHOULD I CHECK FOR A FLUID WAVE?
UH, LET'S GET THE LABS COOKING FIRST.
3-C?
I'VE ALREADY GOT HIM.
CUTE GUY WITH SYNCOPE. HE'S OFF PEEING FOR ME.
ALL RIGHT. LET'S GO.
WHERE'S SHE GOING?
OH, ROMANO WANTS THIN CUTS THROUGH THE MANDIBLE
BEFORE HE DISCHARGES HER.
OKAY, YOU GUYS EVER SEE A TONGUE BLADE TEST?
NO.
OKAY, MA'AM, I'M GOING TO WANT YOU
TO BITE DOWN ON THIS
AS HARD AS YOU CAN, OKAY?
AND, CHEN, YOU'RE GOING TO GIVE IT A TWANG.
YOU'RE GOING TO LET US KNOW
IF IT HURTS, OKAY?
UH-UH.
ALL RIGHT, NO FRACTURE.
YOU CAN CANCEL THE C.T.
THAT'S IT?
WELL, WHY DO AN $800 TEST
WHEN A SIMPLE STICK WILL DO THE TRICK?
ONE, TWO, THREE.
ADAM PULIDO, 38
ALTERED FROM A PROBABLE OVERDOSE.
LET ME DIE. I JUST WANT TO DIE.
Carter: WHAT DID HE TAKE?
I FOUND EMPTY BENADRYL PACKS IN THE BATHROOM.
ADAM, DID YOU TAKE ANYTHING ELSE?
LEAVE ME ALONE.
LET'S START WITH A C.B.C., E.K.G., LYTES
BLOOD AND URINE TOX SCREEN.
CARTER, SCOOT OVER.
I NEED TO PUT ON THE DYNAMAP.
DO IT ON THE OTHER SIDE.
THE I.V.'s IN THE OTHER SIDE.
CAROL, YOUR NANNY'S ON LINE THREE.
CAN YOU ASK HER TO HOLD, PLEASE?
YEAH. SHE'S NEW.
IT'S OKAY. GO AHEAD, TAKE IT.
110/78, HE'S STABLE.
HELLO.
DID YOU TRY THE BOUNCY SEAT? TRY RUNNING THE VACUUM.
THAT STOPS HER FROM CRYING SOMETIMES.
GOOD BREATH SOUND BILATERALLY.
GET AWAY!
HEY, COME ON!
LOOK, I GOT TO GO.
LET GO OF ME!
WHOA, WHOA. SETTLE DOWN.
CARTER, YOU OKAY?
YEAH, I'M OKAY.
HOW ABOUT SOME SOFT RESTRAINTS?
OKAY.
Abby: YOU HAVE A LOT OF FLUID IN THERE.
SO THE COLON CANCER SPREAD?
YEAH.
THEY SAID THAT COULD HAPPEN
IF I DIDN'T RESPOND TO THE CHEMO.
WELL, WE SHOULD TAP YOUR BELLY.
IT'S PRETTY TENDER.
YEAH. WELL, COULD I INTEREST YOU IN SOME MORPHINE?
REALLY?
LAST TIME, THEY WOULDN'T GIVE ME
ANYTHING UNTIL MY LABS CAME BACK AND I SAW THE SURGEON.
WELL, NOBODY SHOULD SIT AROUND IN PAIN.
I SEE YOU'VE BEEN PAYING ATTENTION ON ROUNDS, HUH?
THANKS.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH THE MORPHINE.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
OH, THE APRIL NURSING SCHEDULE.
YOU NEED TO BE ON THE MONITOR.
NO, NO, REALLY. I'M FINE.
YEAH, WELL, YOU KNOW THE DRILL.
LET'S HOOK YOU UP.
SO, YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE IS
90... 90 OVER... UM, 60.
YEAH, THAT'S NORMAL FOR ME.
YOU KNOW, ALL THOSE YEARS OF TRIATHLONS.
WELL, WE STILL NEED TO MONITOR YOU.
LISTEN, I KNOW WHY I FAINTED, OKAY?
I RAN 12 MILES BEFORE I CAME TO WORK, RIGHT?
I SKIPPED BREAKFAST, I SKIPPED LUNCH...
DO YOU WANT TO GET SOMETHING
AT THE CAFETERIA?
OH, NO. I NEVER TOUCH THAT STUFF.
OH.
UH, WHAT IS THAT ON YOUR CHAIN?
OH. IT'S AN ANCIENT ROMAN COIN.
I FOUND IT WHILE I WAS DIVING IN THE MEDITERRANEAN.
OH, REALLY?
YEAH.
HEY, UH, LET ME HELP YOU WITH THAT.
THANK YOU.
YOU, UH, NEED SOME HELP OVER THERE, DR. CHEN?
NO, EVERYTHING IS UNDER CONTROL.
AH, GOOD.
Greene: NO, DAD, SCHAUMBURG IS 45 MINUTES AWAY.
I DON'T CARE IF THEY HAVE THE PART.
WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THIS LATER, ALL RIGHT?
HAVING A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION?
HE IS DRIVING ME CRAZY.
YEAH, MY MOTHER'S BEING UNPREDICTABLE.
SUDDENLY, WHEN SHE'S PACKING TO LEAVE
SHE WANTS TO BE A PARENT.
HE WON'T LISTEN, HE WON'T DISCUSS TREATMENT OPTIONS.
FOR WHAT?
HIS EMPHYSEMA.
IS HE WORSE?
I THINK SO.
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT?
HISTORY OF ANGINA, 15 MINUTES OF CHEST PAIN.
COMPLETE RELIEF WITH ONE NITROSPRAY.
RANDI, WE NEED A MONITORED BED.
WE'RE FULL.
MAYBE YOU SHOULD CLOSE TO CRITICALS.
OH, NO, NO. WE CAN HANDLE THIS.
OKAY, LET'S MOVE THE T.I.A. TO FIVE
C.H.F. TO THREE, AND WE'RE GOING TO PUT HIM IN TWO.
I'LL SEE YOU NEXT TRAUMA.
RANDI, I'M GOING TO GET A REFILL.
OH, I'M SORRY. YOU WANT SOME PRIVACY?
NO, NO. I'M DONE PUMPING.
WE STAFFED OKAY FOR TONIGHT?
DOWN A NURSE, BUT I'M WORKING ON IT.
WHAT DID I DO WITH THAT OTHER LID?
THIS IT?
THANKS. SOME DAYS, THEY TAKE THE BOTTLE
AND OTHER DAYS, THEY WANT THEIR MOM.
THAT'S WHY THEY'RE SO CRANKY.
CAROL, CARTER NEEDS YOU BACK IN TRAUMA.
CAN YOU COVER?
SORRY. G.S.W. TO THE HEAD COMING IN.
OKAY.
I'LL GET THE GUNSHOT.
HOW MUCH ATIVAN'S ON BOARD?
FOUR.
PUSH ANOTHER TWO.
SATS ARE DOWN TO 81.
I NEED AN INTUBATION TRAY.
HOW LONG HAS HE BEEN SEIZING?
THREE MINUTES.
OVERDOSE IS WORSE THAN I THOUGHT.
CAROL, WOULD YOU BAG HIM? HE'S NOT BREATHING.
YEAH. B.P.'s ONLY 60 SYSTOLIC.
ALL RIGHT, START A DOPAMINE
TEN MIKES PER KILO. OKAY.
AHH!
YOU ALL RIGHT?
YEAH. JUST PUMP UP THE BED.
HE'S BRADYING DOWN.
I'M GETTING MARK.
NO, NO, I CAN DO THIS.
STOP. THAT'S HIGH ENOUGH.
CONNIE, WHY DON'T YOU GO PAGE THE RENAL FELLOW?
THIS GUY'S GOING TO NEED DIALYSIS.
ALL RIGHT, I'M IN.
Corday: ANY IDEA WHO SHOT HIM?
NO. PROBABLY A DRUG DEAL GONE BAD.
ABBY, I WANT YOU TO GLOVE UP
BECAUSE YOU GOT TO PUT IN CENTRAL LINE.
ON MY COUNT, ONE, TWO, THREE.
ORDER A HEAD C.T. AND A LATERAL C-SPINE.
DON'T BOTHER.
THERE'S GRAY MATTER EVERYWHERE.
BLOWN PUPIL ON THE RIGHT.
LET'S START MANNITOL AND HYPERVENTILATE.
WE HAVE AN ORGAN DONOR HERE.
B.P.'s 80 PALP.
OKAY, LET'S GET HIS PRESSURE UP.
IS THIS A GOOD ANGLE?
AIM IT TOWARDS THE STERNAL NOTCH.
I HIT THE CLAVICLE.
MARCH IT DOWN SLOWLY
TILL YOU SLIP UNDER THE BONE.
OKAY, LOWER THE ANGLE OR YOU'LL
GIVE HIM A NEW PNEUMOTHORAX.
I'LL STILL UP AGAINST THE BONE.
PULL OUT AND REPOSITION.
MARK, WE NEED THAT LINE IN NOW.
GIVE HER A CHANCE.
THIS GUY'S BRAIN-DEAD.
I'M NOT GETTING A FLASH.
OKAY, WE'RE NOT PERFUSING HIS ORGANS.
I'M SORRY, ABBY. I'LL HAVE TO DO IT.
GOT A DRIVER'S LICENSE.
HIS NAME'S ROBERT JACKSON
FROM NAPERVILLE.
HE'S 18.
OKAY, DO WHATEVER YOU CAN
TO TRACK DOWN HIS PARENTS.
WE NEED THEIR CONSENT TO MAKE HIM A DONOR.
OKAY, I'VE GOT IT.
LET'S GET TWO LITERS ON THE RAPID INFUSER.
LOOK AT THIS. HIS Q.R.S. IS WIDENING.
HE NEEDS DIALYSIS.
THERE'S NO INDICATION FOR DIALYSIS
IN BENADRYL OVERDOSE. LOOK IT UP.
I READ A CASE IN THE ANNALS
AND THEY SAVED A PATIENT USING HEMOPERFUSION.
I KNOW THE PHARMACOKINETICS.
EXTRA-CORPOREAL ELIMINATION WON'T WORK.
WELL, WE SHOULD GIVE IT A TRY.
I'M NOT PUTTING THIS MAN AT RISK FOR HEMOLYSIS
AND CHARCOAL EMBOLISM
FOR AN UNPROVEN PROCEDURE YOU READ ABOUT
IN AN EMERGENCY JOURNAL.
EXCUSE ME.
THIS IS NOT A RENAL CASE.
LIKE HELL, IT ISN'T.
WANT ME TO PUSH MORE BICARB?
IT WON'T HELP.
RUN OF SEVEN.
WELL, DAMN IT, I'M NOT GOING
TO STAND HERE AND WATCH HIM ARREST.
I'LL WRITE THE DIALYSIS ORDERS.
A NEPHROLOGIST HAS TO DO THAT.
THE ARTICLE SAYS EXACTLY WHAT TO DO.
KERRY ONCE DID A HEMOPERFUSION ON AN O.D.
THEN WE SHOULD DO IT.
I KNOW THIS WILL WORK.
OKAY.
WRITE OUT THE ORDERS. I KNOW A DIALYSIS NURSE.
SHE WON'T QUESTION THEM.
SET ME UP FOR A FEMORAL LINE.
YOU WANT TO RUN THIS?
IF YOU BACK ME UP.
PULSELESS V-TACH.
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?
UH, DEFIBRILLATE AT 200.
SOUNDS GOOD TO ME.
CHARGED AND READY.
OKAY, CLEAR.
OH!
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!
GET SOME WATER!
ALL RIGHT, TURN OFF THE OXYGEN!
OH, HE'S STILL IN V-TACH.
START COMPRESSIONS.
OH, IT SMELLS.
TWO PREP RAZORS.
I GOT THIS SIDE.
ABBY, GET THE PADDLES.
HEY, RAMBO, WHY AREN'T YOU UP IN THE I.C.U.?
HE'S MY PATIENT.
I THOUGHT YOUR NAME WAS FRANK.
IT'S MY NICKNAME FROM DESERT STORM.
OKAY, CLEAR.
NORMAL SINUS.
I'VE NEVER SEEN THAT HAPPEN BEFORE.
ME, EITHER.
SOMETIMES, YOU JUST GOT TO WING IT.
WHOO!
WE'RE FOLLOWING THAT CASE STUDY
FOR MASSIVE OVERDOSE.
EXAM TWO IS SET UP FOR CHARCOAL HEMOPERFUSION.
GOOD. KEEP ME POSTED.
WHAT'S UP?
DROPPED HIS PRESSURE.
HE NEEDS MORE VOLUME. LILY, ANOTHER TWO UNITS.
IF IT'S BRAIN STEM FAILURE, YOU DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME.
I KNOW. THAT'S WHY WE NEED TO GET HIM TO THE O.R.
DID YOU FIND HIS FAMILY?
SORRY. IT'S A PHONY LICENSE.
KIDS BUY THEM ON THE STREET.
MAYBE HE'S BEEN REPORTED MISSING.
HAVE YOU CHECKED?
WE SCANNED HIS PHOTO, SENT IT.
NOTHING'S COME BACK.
KEEP ON TRYING.
WE NEED THAT CONSENT.
PRESSURE'S UP TO 90.
THAT'S ENCOURAGING.
EVEN WITH CONSENT, IT COULD TAKE HOURS
TO LINE UP THE PROCUREMENT TEAMS.
ELIZABETH, BE REALISTIC.
I COULD SAVE FIVE LIVES...
HE COULD ARREST FIRST. WITH HIS ORGANS.
I WON'T LET THAT HAPPEN.
LET KATE SLEEP FOR ANOTHER HOUR
AND THEN WAKE HER FOR HER BOTTLE.
Carter: CAROL?
I'LL TALK TO YOU LATER.
CAROL, I NEED 3-0 NYLON.
DORI, I THINK WE ARE READY.
( cries out in pain )
YOU OKAY?
I JUST CONTAMINATED MY GLOVES.
SORRY. I SHOULDN'T HAVE MADE YOU REACH.
JUST GET ME ANOTHER PAIR.
DID DR. KRUPP SAY WHY HE'S USING CITRATE?
NO.
THAT'S WEIRD. HE ALWAYS USES HEPARIN.
I BETTER GO PAGE HIM.
DID HE SAY WHEN TO CHECK AN A.C.T.?
UH... DO IT 30 MINUTES INTO THE RUN.
WELL, I BETTER CHECK WITH HIM.
HE'S VERY PARTICULAR
ABOUT HIS ORDERS.
DORI, THESE AREN'T HIS ORDERS.
KRUPP WOULDN'T HELP US.
WE TOOK THEM FROM A JOURNAL.
I WON'T DO THIS WITHOUT HIS ORDERS.
LOOK AT THE HEART MONITOR.
HIS COMPLEXES ARE NARROWING.
I'M GOING TO LOSE MY JOB.
WE'RE SAVING HIS LIFE.
NO. WE'RE STOPPING.
I'LL TAKE FULL
RESPONSIBILITY.
HEY, CARTER, YOU WANT TO EXPLAIN?
I TOLD YOU ABOUT THIS.
DID HE TELL YOU NEPHROLOGY REFUSED TO SIGN OFF?
MARK, IT'S WORKING.
JUST LET US FINISH.
CARTER, STEP OUT.
CAROL, MONITOR HIS VITALS.
KEEP THE DIALYSIS GOING.
SORRY, DORI.
I'LL SPEAK WITH THE RENAL SERVICE.
OKAY.
YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH ANOTHER DEPARTMENT
YOU COME TO ME.
MY PATIENT'S IMPROVING.
FINE, BUT YOU DIDN'T GIVE ME THE WHOLE STORY.
LET ME BREAK THE RULES.
THAT'S WHAT I'M HERE FOR. I CAN HANDLE THIS.
IT'S YOUR FIRST DAY BACK. YOU DON'T HAVE
TO PROVE ANYTHING.
MARK, WE NEED YOU.
I WANT TO KNOW EVERYTHING
YOU'RE DOING TO THIS GUY.
SIX MONTHS OLD, WITH FEVER AND VOMITING.
NOW LETHARGIC AFTER A SEIZURE.
COULDN'T GET A LINE.
UH-HUH. WHERE'S CLEO?
IT'S HER DAY OFF.
OKAY. HAS SHE HAD SEIZURES BEFORE?
NO. SHE'S A VERY GOOD BABY.
UH-HUH. WHEN DID THE VOMITING START?
AFTER SHE WOKE UP FROM HER NAP.
WHAT'S HER NAME?
ESTRELLA. IS SHE OKAY?
SHE LOOKS DEHYDRATED.
CHUNY, SET ME UP WITH AN INTRAOSSEOUS LINE.
BOLUS 20 PER KILO SALINE.
SHE'S TACHY AT 160.
OKAY. C.B.C., LYTES, BLOOD AND URINE CULTURES.
FULL SEPTIC WORKUP.
¿QUE PASA?
ESTA MUY SECA.
NECESSITA UN SUERO.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
WE NEED TO PUT THIS INTO THE BONE TO GIVE HER FLUIDS.
PLEASE DON'T HURT HER.
POR FAVOR, DILE QUE NO LA LASTIME.
CHUNY, TAKE HER TO CHAIRS.
BRING HER BACK AFTER THE SPINAL TAP.
NO. I WANT TO STAY WITH THE BABY.
CAN I STAY WITH MY BABY?
COME ON, HONEY.
DOCTOR, PLEASE, CAN I JUST STAY WITH MY BABY?
IT'S OKAY.
STILL IN NORMAL SINUS, DOC.
HOW MUCH LONGER?
UNTIL YOUR ELECTROLYTES COME BACK.
WHAT ABOUT MY PATIENTS?
WELL, I TOLD THE UNIT YOU'RE TAKING A SICK DAY.
THEY CALLED IN BACKUP.
WELL, THEN, I GUESS I'M YOUR PRISONER.
EXCUSE ME.
HAVE YOU SEEN DR. GREENE?
HE'S SUPPOSED TO HELP ME WITH THIS PARACENTESIS.
UH... HE'S IN TRAUMA.
I CAN DO IT.
KIM, THIS IS DR. CHEN.
HELLO. HEY, DOC.
I'VE NUMBED THE LOWER LEFT QUADRANT.
14-GAUGE ANGIOCATH OKAY?
YEAH. USE A Z-TRACK SO IT WON'T LEAK.
AND, UM... WHAT LABS SHOULD I SEND OFF?
CELL COUNT, GLUCOSE, PROTEIN, AMYLASE, CYTOLOGY
GRAM STAIN AND CULTURE.
THANK YOU, FRANK.
NO PROBLEM.
THERE'S YOUR FLUID.
GOOD FLOW.
YOU GOT IT FROM HERE?
YEAH. THANK YOU.
I'LL BE IN EXAM FOUR.
WELL, THAT WASN'T SO BAD.
ACTUALLY, IT'S STARTING TO HURT.
I CAN READJUST THE CATHETER FOR YOU.
HEY!
UH-OH.
IF I WERE YOU
I'D ORDER AN UPRIGHT
CHEST FILM, STAT.
SHE'S IN V-TACH.
START COMPRESSIONS.
CHARGE THE PADDLES TO 20.
BAG HER.
WHAT'S GOING ON?
PROBABLY SEPTIC.
COULD BE MENINGITIS.
CLEAR.
WHAT DO YOU WANT, CARTER?
I CAN COME BACK. STILL IN V-TACH.
CHARGE AGAIN. WHAT'S UP?
MY OVERDOSE GUY-- HIS Q.R.S. IS DOWN TO .12.
WEANED HIM OFF PRESSORS.
CLEAR. GO ON.
HE'S WAKING UP. CAN I EXTUBATE HIM?
CHARGING. GIVE HIM ANOTHER HALF AN HOUR.
CLEAR.
THANKS.
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
CHECKING LABS.
WE DON'T ALLOW PATIENTS BACK HERE.
HE'S A NURSE. I GAVE HIM PERMISSION.
FRANK, WHY ARE YOU
OFF THE MONITOR?
SOME OF MY LABS CAME BACK.
DR. CHEN, YOUR PATIENT HAS A LOW SODIUM.
THAT MUST HAVE BEEN THE FOUR LITERS OF WATER
I DRANK AFTER MY WORKOUT.
JUST NEED TO FLUID RESTRICT.
LET'S GO BACK TO BED.
YOUR CARDIAC ENZYMES ARE STILL PENDING.
OH, I THINK SHE WANTS
TO KEEP ME HERE.
THAT GUY'S A PIECE OF WORK, HUH?
AND YOU'RE NOT?
WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?
EATING CAP'N CRUNCH FOR DINNER
OUT OF AN EMESIS BASIN? PLEASE.
RANDI, DID MY NANNY CALL AGAIN?
NO, THANK GOD.
EWW! WHAT IS THAT?
I'M HUNGRY.
NOTHING IN THE LOUNGE
EXCEPT A BOX OF CEREAL AND A JAR OF MILK.
A JAR OF MILK?
YEAH.
OH, GOD, MALUCCI.
WHAT?
I'M IN. RESUME COMPRESSIONS.
SHE'S IN V-FIB. PADDLES!
SHE SHOULD COME AROUND WITH O2 AND EPI.
MARK, OUR GUY'S CRASHING.
CLEAR.
NO CHANGE. V-FIB.
WHAT'S HAPPENED?
HE'S HYPOTENSIVE ON MAXIMUM DOPAMINE.
I'M STARING LEVOPHED.
CHUNY, START WITH PROCAINAMIDE-- 100 SLOW I.V. PUSH.
SHOCK AGAIN.
CLEAR.
HIS BRAIN STEM'S MUSH.
YOU GOING TO CALL IT?
NO. THERE MUST BE A WAY TO MAKE HIM A DONOR.
NOT WITHOUT HIS CONSENT.
WHEN WAS THE LAST EPI?
FOUR MINUTES. PUSH ANOTHER cc.
CAN'T WE GET A COURT ORDER?
NO. NOT IN A CASE LIKE THIS.
WELL, I'LL KEEP HIS PRESSURE UP
FINE. UNTIL WE FIND HIS FAMILY.
SHOCK AGAIN.
CLEAR.
THE BLACK STRIPE IS AIR UNDER THE DIAPHRAGM.
THE NEEDLE PERFORATED THE COLON.
AND IT HURTS LIKE HELL.
I'M REALLY SORRY.
PERFORATION IS A KNOWN COMPLICATION
OF THE PROCEDURE.
WHAT DO WE DO NOW?
WELL, WE COULD OPERATE TO REPAIR THE DEFECT.
HOW LONG WILL I HAVE TO BE IN THE HOSPITAL?
A WEEK.
BUT THEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT A TWO-MONTH RECOVERY.
DOC, THEY DON'T EXPECT ME TO LIVE THAT LONG.
WHAT HAPPENS
IF I DON'T HAVE THE OPERATION?
THE HOLE COULD SEAL OFF.
BUT, UH, MORE THAN LIKELY
YOU WOULD DEVELOP AN INFECTION, PERITONITIS.
AND THEN I DIE.
YEAH.
GIVE A SECOND ROUND OF ATROPINE.
PACER PADS ARE READY.
HOLDING COMPRESSIONS.
STILL FLAT LINE.
LABS ARE BACK.
C.B.C. AND LYTES ARE NORMAL.
WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH THIS BABY?
ALL RIGHT, START PACING, 180.
PACER'S ON.
NO CAPTURE.
TURN UP THE GAIN.
COME ON...
STILL NO CAPTURE.
TURN UP THE RATE.
CAN'T FEEL A PULSE.
MORE EPI?
HOW MANY ROUNDS SO FAR?
SEVEN.
STOP BAGGING.
THAT'S IT.
WE'RE DONE.
CLEAN UP THE BABY
BEFORE I BRING IN THE MOTHER.
I DON'T WANT THE SURGERY.
IT'S THE ONLY WAY.
I UNDERSTAND
BUT I DON'T WANT ANOTHER SURGERY.
WELL, THEN, WE...
( beeper beeps )
WE COULD, UM...
TREAT YOU WITH ANTIBIOTICS
AND HOPE FOR THE BEST.
I'M SORRY.
WOULD YOU EXCUSE ME?
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
YEAH.
DR. BENTON
AREN'T WE SUPPOSED TO FIX OUR MISTAKES?
USUALLY.
YOUR PATIENT HAS END-STAGE CANCER.
SURGERY'S ONLY GOING TO PROLONG
HIS SUFFERING.
YOU HAVE TO RESPECT HIS WISHES.
HE'S GOING TO DIE BECAUSE I MADE A MISTAKE.
HE'S GOING TO DIE ANYWAY.
MARK, WE NEED YOU OVER HERE.
WHAT IS IT?
( woman speaking Spanish )
DOCTOR, PLEASE, HELP ME.
MY BABY...
YOU WANT ME TO GIVE HER SOMETHING?
UH, NO. PILAR...
SHE'S STILL WARM. DO SOMETHING.
PILAR, WE TRIED EVERYTHING, OKAY?
I EXPLAINED THAT.
NO, SHE'S STILL WARM... MY BABY.
POR FAVOR, AYUDAME. AYUDAME.
PLEASE, USE YOUR MACHINES.
GIVE HER THE MEDICINE.
BLOW IN HER MOUTH.
DO SOMETHING. MAKE HER BREATHE.
WE CAN'T.
YES, YOU CAN.
YES, YOU CAN!
YOU'RE A GOOD DOCTOR!
I KNOW YOU CAN!
YOU CAN SAVE HER!
PLEASE... SHE'S STILL WARM.
MY LITTLE BABY.
POR FAVOR.
PILAR, SHE'S DEAD.
I'M SORRY.
MALIK, WHAT'S UP?
COPS FOUND MR. BARTLETT UNDER THE EL.
HOW YOU DOING, MR. BARTLETT?
KISS MY ASS.
OKAY, START A BANANA BAG
ORDER A HEAD C.T.
AND PREP HIM FOR SUTURES.
WHOA. WHOA.
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT?
RULE OUT C.V.A.
AND I'VE GOT TWO NEW PATIENTS TO PRESENT.
WHAT ABOUT FRANK'S WORKUP?
MY ENZYMES ARE NORMAL, I'M FINE.
YEAH, HE SAW US GETTING SLAMMED
SO HE PITCHED IN.
UH, DR. GREENE, THERE WAS A COMPLICATION
WITH MY COLON CANCER PATIENT.
YEAH, BENTON SAID.
I THOUGHT I WAS SUPPOSED TO SUPERVISE.
WELL, YOU WERE BUSY
SO I ASKED DR. CHEN.
YOU DIDN'T GIVE DR. CHEN A COMPLETE HISTORY
OTHERWISE, YOU WOULD HAVE TAPPED THE MIDLINE
AND YOU WOULDN'T HAVE PERFED THE BOWEL.
WELL, HE SPIKED A FEVER.
I THINK HE'S SEPTIC.
YOU SHOULD MAKE SURE THAT HE'S COMFORTABLE NOW.
I'D LIKE TO STAY WITH HIM.
THERE'S NO FAMILY.
NO, WE NEED YOU OUT HERE, OKAY?
THE NURSES CAN TAKE CARE OF HIM.
RIGHT.
ABBY, AFTER YOUR SHIFT
I WANT YOU TO GO TO PATHOLOGY
AND PRACTICE PROCEDURES WITH DR. UPTON.
DR. GREENE, GOT A LIVE ONE HERE!
WHAT HAPPENED?
MY BUDDY'S IN PERU.
I'M FEEDING HIS GILA MONSTER
WHEN THE SON OF A BITCH BITES ME.
HE WON'T LET GO.
WE HAVE TO KILL THE LIZARD?
ONLY AS A LAST RESORT.
MALIK, GRAB A COUPLE OF VASCULAR CLAMPS.
GET THEM YOURSELF.
I'M NOT GOING NEAR THAT THING.
I GOT IT.
PLEASE, DON'T HURT HIM.
I'LL DO MY BEST.
OH... THOSE JAWS ARE AWFULLY STRONG.
OW.
OOH.
MALUCCI, GET READY TO CATCH HIM.
IN WHAT?
GRAB A KICK BUCKET.
ALL RIGHT.
HERE WE GO.
NICE AND EASY.
DO IT TOGETHER.
ALMOST...
ALMOST. THERE!
NOW WHAT DO I DO?
CALL ANIMAL CONTROL OR THE ZOO.
NEED SOME HELP?
YEAH.
WHY DON'T YOU MONITOR HIS VITALS
THREE GRAMS OF UNASYN AND IRRIGATE THE WOUND.
OUCH.
HOW'S HE DOING?
HE'S ON MAXIMUM DOPAMINE AND LEVOPHED
WITH RUNS OF P.V.C.s.
HIS HEART'S NOT GOING TO LAST MUCH LONGER.
V-TACH. LILY, CHARGE THE PADDLES.
DON'T. HE'S A D.N.R.
MARK, LET ME CODE HIM.
NO. IT'S A WASTE OF TIME.
I'M PUSHING LIDOCAINE.
WE'RE SWAMPED, YOU'RE TYING UP MY NURSES
AND A TRAUMA ROOM ON A CASE
THAT WILL NEVER MAKE IT
TO THE O.R., IT'S TIME TO STOP.
NO, NOT WHEN HIS ORGANS ARE STILL VIABLE.
I'M SURE HIS FAMILY
WOULD WANT GOOD OUT OF THIS TRAGEDY.
YOU WANT A LIDOCAINE DRIP?
NO. I'LL START ONE.
YOU GO HELP THE OTHER NURSES.
DON'T KEEP FLOGGING HIM!
I MEAN IT, HE'S A D.N.R!
MARK, LABS ARE BACK FROM TRAUMA TWO.
TOX SCREEN'S POSITIVE FOR AMPHETAMINES.
LET ME SEE THAT.
OH, MAN.
WHAT?
IT'S A BABY.
SOMEONE KILLED THEIR BABY WITH AMPHETAMINES?
PILAR...
THE LABS CAME BACK ON ESTRELLA
AND SHE TESTED POSITIVE FOR AMPHETAMINES.
MY BABY DIED FROM DRUGS?
DO YOU KNOW ANYBODY WHO COULD HAVE GIVEN SOMETHING TO HER?
NO ONE HAS DRUGS AT HOME.
DO YOU KNOW ANYONE WHO USES DRUGS?
FRIENDS OR RELATIVES?
PILAR, WHAT IS IT?
I WORK TWO JOBS.
SOMETIMES I GET SO TIRED, I TAKE SOMETHING TO STAY AWAKE
BUT I NEVER BRING DRUGS AT HOME.
ARE YOU NURSING THE BABY?
PILAR, DO YOU NURSE YOUR BABY?
THE DRUGS ARE IN THE BREAST MILK.
( crying ): I LOVE MY BABY.
I WOULD NEVER HURT HER.
GOD FORGIVE ME, I WOULD NEVER HURT HER.
I DIDN'T KNOW.
I REALLY-- I DIDN'T KNOW.
( crying ): I DIDN'T KNOW.
MOTHER? ARE YOU THERE?
I'M INVOLVED IN A CASE.
I CAN'T MAKE IT FOR COFFEE, SO PAGE ME. BYE.
DR. CORDAY, I COMPLETELY FORGOT
TO GIVE YOU A MESSAGE.
WHAT MESSAGE?
YOUR MOTHER'S TAKING AN EARLIER FLIGHT
AND SHE WON'T BE ABLE TO MEET YOU.
THAT'S ALL?
YEAH.
HEY, MARK, YOU ALL RIGHT?
OH, YEAH...
YOU KEEPING AN EYE ON THAT GUNSHOT KID?
YES, I HAD TO CANCEL A DINNER DATE
WITH MY MOTHER
BUT SHE STOOD ME UP FIRST.
THAT'S PARENTS FOR YOU.
MM-HMM.
OKAY, GIVE ME LYTES ON BURKE
DIG ON DAVIS, COAGS ON NGUYEN.
YOU GOT IT.
HOW WE DOING?
DON'T WORRY, DOC, I'M MOVING THE MEAT, MAN.
I NEED TO FREE UP THIS BED.
I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR AN HOUR FOR C.T. RESULTS.
I'M HOLDING FOR RADIOLOGY NOW.
YEAH, WELL, PAGE STEVE FLINT.
DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME.
I HAVE A DIRECT LINE TO HIS ROTO-VIEWER.
CHUNY, MY COLON CANCER PATIENT
NEEDS MORE MORPHINE.
HE WAS ASLEEP LAST TIME I CHECKED.
THEN CHECK MORE OFTEN.
I DON'T WANT HIM IN ANY PAIN.
DAD, WHAT HAPPENED?
HE WAS SHORT OF BREATH, CALLED 911.
WHY DIDN'T YOU CALL ME?
NOTHING YOU COULD DO OVER THE PHONE.
WHEN DID IT START?
COUPLE OF DAYS AGO.
PULSE OX 82 ON ROOM AIR.
DECREASED BREATH SOUNDS ON THE LEFT.
I'M FINE, MARK.
IT'S PROBABLY JUST A CHEST COLD.
OKAY, LET'S MOVE HIM OVER.
NICE AND EASY.
I'M NOT THAT SICK.
I CAN DO IT MYSELF.
YOU WANT A BLOOD GAS?
C.B.C., COAGS
AND A PORTABLE CHEST.
IF I KNEW IT WAS GOING TO BE SUCH A BIG DEAL
I WOULD HAVE SEEN THE DOCTOR ON MONDAY.
DAD, CAN YOU BE QUIET AND TAKE A DEEP BREATH?
YEAH, I THINK YOU HAVE FLUID ON YOUR LUNGS.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, YOU THINK?
LEAN FORWARD.
YEAH, FLUID'S HALFWAY UP.
WHY'D YOU WAIT SO LONG?
YOU COULD HAVE PASSED OUT
GOT A TERRIBLE INFECTION...
DON'T SCOLD ME.
OKAY, WE NEED TO DRAIN THE FLUID.
MARK, WHAT'S WRONG?
HUGE PLEURAL EFFUSION.
NEEDS A THORACENTESIS.
HE WANTS TO STICK A NEEDLE IN MY CHEST.
YOU'RE A SURGEON
I THINK YOU SHOULD DO IT.
I DON'T THINK THAT'S SUCH A GOOD IDEA.
DAD, I CAN HANDLE THIS.
MARK DOESN'T THINK A DOCTOR SHOULD TREAT HIS OWN FAMILY.
IT'S A SIMPLE PROCEDURE.
I'VE DONE IT A HUNDRED TIMES.
I WANT ELIZABETH TO BE MY DOCTOR.
FINE.
THE LIZARD GUY'S CRASHING.
WHY DIDN'T SOMEBODY GET ME?
HE JUST WENT SOUTH.
HE DROPPED HIS PRESSURE TO 60.
IT'S GILA VENOM.
TWO LITERS OF SALINE WIDE OPEN.
I HEARD THIS GUY WAS CODING.
WHAT DO YOU NEED?
POINT THREE OF EPI, 50 OF BENADRYL.
HERE YOU GO. WHO'S SMOKING?
I DON'T SMELL ANYTHING.
IT'S OUT THERE.
THAT'S MY HERNIA PATIENT.
YEAH, WELL, TELL HIM TO SMOKE OUTSIDE.
MARK, BAD COCAINE OVERDOSE.
PRESSURE'S SKY HIGH.
B.P.'s 260/140.
I'VE BEEN WAITING HERE FOR FIVE HOURS.
HEY, YOU WANT TO GET THAT CIGARETTE OUT OF HERE?
START WITH ESMOLOL AND PHENTOLAMINE
BEFORE SHE STROKES OUT.
DR. GREENE, THERE'S A PSYCH PATIENT ON THE THIRD FLOOR
GETTING READY TO JUMP.
WHY DON'T YOU CLEAR A TRAUMA ROOM?
I'M ON IT.
DR. GREENE, MY STROKE PATIENT'S SON
WANTS TO TALK TO THE ATTENDING.
MARK, YOU WANT A FOLEY ON THIS GUY?
WHY ARE YOU ASKING ME? JUST DO IT.
I CAN'T GET A SECOND I.V.
CAN YOU PUT IN A CENTRAL LINE?
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM? SHE'S GOT GOOD VEINS.
HOW ABOUT MY STROKE PATIENT?
CAN'T YOU SEE I'VE GOT TWO CRITICAL PATIENTS HERE?
JUST DEAL WITH IT.
THE GUY JUST JUMPED.
THEY SAID IT WAS A STAGE-FOUR LUNG CANCER.
DOCTOR SAID IT COULDN'T BE CUT OUT OR CURED.
SOMETIMES CHEMOTHERAPY CAN SHRINK THE TUMOR
AND LENGTHEN SURVIVAL.
I KNOW ALL ABOUT THAT.
ARE YOU INTERESTED?
MARK SURE SEEMS TO BE.
WHAT ABOUT YOU? WHAT DO YOU WANT?
I JUST WANT TO LIVE OUT
THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS OF MY LIFE
AS NORMAL AS I CAN.
I DON'T WANT TO BE HOOKED UP TO A BUNCH OF TUBES
PUKING MY GUTS OUT
ALL FOR THE SAKE OF A FEW EXTRA MISERABLE WEEKS.
WHEN WE GET THE FLUID OFF, YOU'LL FEEL A LOT BETTER.
I'M GOING TO NUMB YOU UP.
THIS WILL STING A BIT.
READY WHEN YOU ARE.
STICK AROUND, PETER, FRESH TRAUMA COMING IN.
PAGE CORDAY, I WAS OFF AT 7:00.
YOU GETTING AROUND OKAY, CARTER?
YES. YOU LATE FOR SOMETHING?
YEAH. I'LL SEE YOU LATER.
ABBY, SORRY TO HEAR ABOUT YOUR PATIENT.
WHAT PATIENT?
YOUR BELLY TAP IN CURTAIN THREE.
HE EXPIRED.
WELL, WHY DIDN'T ANYBODY TELL ME?
MY PATIENT DIES, I'M THE LAST ONE TO FIND OUT ABOUT IT.
PULSE IS WEAK.
YOSH, START TWO LARGE-BORE I.V.s.
DECREASED BREATH SOUNDS ON THE RIGHT.
WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO PUT IN A CHEST TUBE.
YOU WANT SOME HELP?
UH, NO, THANKS.
WHAT'S FRANK DOING HERE?
IT'S A LONG STORY.
CARTER, EVERYTHING OKAY?
YEP.
FEELS LIKE A COUPLE OF BROKEN RIBS.
LET'S GET CHEST X RAYS.
FRANK?
HEY, GET THE CRASH CART!
FRANK?
AIRWAY'S CLEAR, HE'S BREATHING.
WHAT HAPPENED?
PROBABLY VASO-VAGALLED.
GOOD PULSE, WE'RE OKAY.
I'LL GET A B.P.
I NEED TO INTUBATE.
PUSH 15 OF ETOMIDATE, 100 OF SUX.
PREP FOR A CHEST TUBE.
I CAN DO THAT.
I'VE GOT IT, CARTER.
WE'VE GOT TO MOVE FAST.
HOW CAN I HELP?
HERE, RUN THE HEMOCUE.
DR. WEAVER, YOU NEED A HAND UP THERE?
NO, BUT WORK ON THAT HEMOCUE.
CAROL, IT'S THE NANNY.
I HEAR THE BABIES CRYING.
TAKE OVER FOR ME, YOSH.
EIGHT-0 E.T. TUBE.
NO, I'M IN THE MIDDLE OF A TRAUMA
I CAN'T RIGHT NOW.
TEN BLADE AND A KELLY.
CHECK THE CUFF.
I KNOW, BUT I CAN'T.
WHAT'S THE PULSE OX?
IT'S 92.
HEMOCUE IS 12.4.
HEY, CAROL, WE'RE OKAY.
OKAY, JUST PUT KATE'S EAR TO THE PHONE.
32 FRENCH.
* I CAN'T GIVE YOU ANYTHING BUT LOVE, BABY *
Greene: YOU CALL THAT A LULLABY?
* THAT'S THE ONLY THING I'VE PLENTY OF... *
Weaver: CARTER, GIVE ME CRICOID PRESSURE.
* DREAM A WHILE, DREAM A WHILE... *
O-SILK ON NEEDLE DRIVER.
* HAPPINESS AND I GUESS...
GOOD BREATH SOUNDS.
* ALL THE THINGS YOU'VE ALWAYS PINED FOR... *
OPEN THE XEROFORM.
OKAY, CALL RESPIRATORY FOR A VENT.
IT LOOKS LIKE WE'LL NEED A PORTABLE CHEST.
Yosh: PULSE OX IS UP TO 99.
B.P. IS 110/70.
FIND THE CHART.
Kovac: YOU HAD QUITE A DAY, HUH?
RANDI, I'M GOING TO BE SUTURING IN EXAM FOUR.
I CAN PICK UP A FEW OF YOUR PATIENTS
IF YOU WANT.
JUST TAKE THE NEW ONES.
OH, SORRY, CAROL, PEDES IS FULL.
OH, THESE ARE MY GIRLS.
THEY'VE GOTTEN SO BIG.
YEAH.
IS YOUR NANNY SICK?
NO, NO, SHE'S NEW AND THEY WERE FUSSY
SO I JUST HAD HER BRING THEM IN.
YEAH, THEY CERTAINLY LOOK CONTENT.
THEY'RE ALWAYS HAPPY AFTER I'VE NURSED THEM.
YEAH, THEY MISS THEIR MOM.
WE'LL BE IN THE LOUNGE.
AW.
HEY, RANDI, CURTAIN TWO'S GOING UP.
SORRY TO CAUSE YOU SO MUCH TROUBLE.
OH, IT WAS NOTHING. FEEL BETTER.
WHAT'S WRONG WITH SUPER NURSE?
FRANK IS BEING ADMITTED.
OH, YEAH, WHAT? TO THE PSYCH WARD?
TO MEDICINE.
I DIAGNOSED HIS ADDISON'S DISEASE.
HE'LL BE FINE IN A FEW DAYS.
GOOD PICKUP.
I'M GOING TO GO UP TO THE FIFTH FLOOR LATER
KEEP HIM COMPANY.
TIME OF DEATH: 2137.
I'LL GET THE DEATH KIT.
SUCH A WASTE.
HIS ORGANS COULD HAVE SAVED
SO MANY LIVES.
I COULDN'T DO A THING.
YOU HAD NO CHOICE.
WHY COULDN'T THEY FIND HIS FAMILY?
PROBABLY A RUNAWAY.
HE'S SOMEONE'S SON.
HIS PARENTS DON'T EVEN KNOW HE'S HERE.
THEY MAY NEVER KNOW.
DR. CORDAY, COULD YOU SIGN A DISCHARGE ORDER?
WHICH PATIENT?
DR. GREENE'S FATHER.
I'LL BE RIGHT OUT.
MARK, WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME YOUR FATHER HAS CANCER?
HE DIDN'T WANT ANYBODY TO KNOW.
YOU TOLD HIM TO FOLLOW UP WITH ONCOLOGY.
HE DOESN'T WANT TO.
WHAT ABOUT NAVELBINE?
THERE'S NO SIDE EFFECTS
IT'LL SHRINK THE TUMOR
AND HE WON'T GET HIS CHEST TAPPED EVERY WEEK.
I'VE GIVEN HIM THOSE OPTIONS.
BUT IT CAN IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF HIS LIFE.
TALK TO HIM, HE'LL LISTEN TO YOU.
IT'S HIS DECISION.
MAYBE IF YOU EXPLAIN IT, HE'LL CHANGE HIS MIND.
MARK, I HAVE TO RESPECT HIS WISHES.
HE'S MY FATHER.
HEY, I WANT TO HELP HIM.
IF YOU REALLY WANT TO HELP
JUST BE THERE FOR HIM.
I WON'T JUST SIT THERE
WHEN THERE'S SOMETHING MORE I CAN DO.
THE PATIENT DONATED HIS BODY TO THE MED SCHOOL
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE.
FOR ANATOMY CLASS.
YES, BUT WE OFTEN ALLOW STUDENTS
TO PRACTICE PROCEDURES HERE ON THE FRESH CADAVER.
DR. GREENE MENTIONED THAT YOU NEEDED WORK
ON YOUR CENTRAL LINES.
PLACE YOUR INDEX FINGER IN THE STERNAL NOTCH.
ENTER THE SKIN AT THE JUNCTION
OF THE MIDDLE AND PROXIMAL THIRD OF THE CLAVICLE.
I'M SORRY.
I DON'T THINK I CAN DO THIS.
YOU'RE DOING FINE.
HE WAS MY PATIENT.
YOU WANT TO STOP?
NO.
WHY DON'T YOU, UH, TAKE ME THROUGH IT.
AIM JUST ABOVE AND POSTERIOR
TO YOUR INDEX FINGER.
CRAZY DAY, HUH?
YEP.
JOHN, ARE YOU STILL IN A LOT OF PAIN?
IT'S NOT TOO BAD.
YEAH.
IT SEEMED LIKE YOU'RE HAVING
A HARD TIME GETTING AROUND IN TRAUMA.
I'M OKAY.
WELL, THE FIRST DAY BACK CAN BE ROUGH.
YEAH, EVERY DAY GETS A LITTLE BIT EASIER.
HAVE YOU TALKED TO ANYBODY
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED?
AND YOUR FAMILY'S BEEN SUPPORTIVE?
REALLY, DR. WEAVER
I'M OKAY.
YOU KNOW, YOU MIGHT BENEFIT
FROM A TENS UNIT OR FROM ACUPUNCTURE.
THANKS. I'LL LET YOU KNOW.
OKAY.
Corday: I NEED A P.T/P.T.T. ON DE SALVO.
YEAH.
YOU ON HOLD?
I CAN TAKE A CAB
IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING ELSE PLANNED.
DON'T BE RIDICULOUS, DAD. WE'RE GOING HOME.
GOOD NIGHT.
GOOD NIGHT.
SHOELACES ARE UNTIED.
I CAN'T BEND DOWN AFTER THAT NEEDLE THING.
DON'T WANT YOU TO FALL
AND BREAK YOUR NECK.
ALL RIGHT. FROM THIS ANGLE.
THE ONE.
JUST CUT IT IN THERE.
JUST HIT A LITTLE BIT TO THE LEFT AND LET IT...
SLIDE DOWN.
THAT'S TOO MUCH THINKING.
I GO BY INSTINCT.
DO IT YOUR WAY.
ALL RIGHT.
UH, HOW ABOUT THIS SIX IN THE CORNER?
( making whistling sound )
( both chuckle )
YEAH, RIGHT.
HERE WE GO.
( clears throat )
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE LAWS OF PHYSICS?
YOU DISTRACTED ME.
YEAH. EXCUSE ME.
AH, YOU LEFT ME NOTHING.
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
GO FOR THE 11.
ARE YOU CRAZY? I CAN'T MAKE THAT.
OF COURSE, YOU CAN.
COME HERE.
LET ME SHOW YOU SOMETHING.
ALL RIGHT, JUST CALL IT.
11 IN THE CORNER POCKET.
JUST LINE IT UP AND THEN HIT IT TO THE RIGHT.
IT'LL SLIDE RIGHT
DOWN THE RAIL
NICE AND EASY, OKAY? TRUST ME.
NICE AND EASY.
TRUST YOU?
YEAH, RIGHT.
SEE?
HOW'S THAT?
THAT'S NOT BAD.
WHAT?
HMM?
IF I'D KNOWN YOU WERE COMING
WE'D HAVE SERVED A LATE DINNER.
SOUP'S FINE.
YOU'RE LOOKING WELL, JOHN.
THANK YOU.
I STARTED BACK TO WORK TODAY.
SHOULDN'T YOU GIVE YOURSELF A BIT MORE TIME OFF?
I DID OKAY.
ACTUALLY, IT WAS KIND OF TOUGH.
I DIDN'T KNOW IF I WAS GOING TO MAKE IT THROUGH THE DAY.
I, UH, FELT, I DON'T KNOW, AFRAID.
AFRAID OF WHAT?
THAT I COULDN'T HANDLE IT.
BUT YOU DID.
I KNOW WE'VE HAD OUR DISAGREEMENTS
ABOUT YOUR CAREER, BUT I CAN SEE NOW
THAT MEDICINE IS WHAT YOU LOVE.
I REMEMBER WHEN YOU WERE IN HIGH SCHOOL
YOU'D DROP BY UNEXPECTEDLY.
I'D MAKE COCOA AND WE'D TALK.
I REMEMBER.
WE HAVEN'T DONE THIS IN A LONG TIME.
I KNOW.
WHERE'S THAT, MAMMOTH?
NO.
LAKE TAHOE.
I LOST 200 BUCKS AT THE CRAP TABLE.
NEXT SLIDE.
THIS IS A FANCY MACHINE.
IF I'D KNOWN YOU COULD GET ONE
AT THE HOSPITAL
I WOULDN'T HAVE FIXED THE OLD ONE.
SAN DIEGO?
THAT WAS A SANTA BARBARA TRIP.
YOU WERE SEVEN.
I TAUGHT YOU TO SWIM UNDERWATER.
YOUR MOTHER NEVER DID LIKE MOTELS
SO WE RENTED AN R.V.
PLANTING THE GARDEN.
YOU USED TO MAKE ME PULL THE WEEDS.
I DID NOT.
YOU REMEMBER YOU ALWAYS WANTED
TO GROW A WATERMELON TREE.
YOU SAVED ALL THOSE SEEDS
AND THEN SNUCK OUT AND PLANTED THEM
IN YOUR MOTHER'S PETUNIAS.
NEVER DID GET A WATERMELON.
NO, BUT YOU SURE KILLED OFF THE PETUNIAS.
( chuckling ): I FORGOT ALL ABOUT THAT.
I THOUGHT THIS WAS THE VACATION BOX.
WHY DID YOUR MOTHER TAKE THIS ONE, ANYWAY?
GUESS SHE LIKED WHAT SHE SAW.
