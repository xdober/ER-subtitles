( David coughing )
Greene: KEEP IT IN, DAD.
I HAVE TO COUGH, MARK.
YEAH, WELL, YOU DON'T HAVE TO TALK.
PUT IT BACK IN.
YOU WANT ME TO BITE DOWN ON IT?
DAD.
END UP WITH A MOUTHFUL OF MERCURY.
DAD.
ALL RIGHT, SAY "E."
E...
ONCE AGAIN.
E...
LAST TIME.
E... CRIPES!
SOUNDS LIKE PNEUMONIA.
WE GOT TO GET YOU TO THE HOSPITAL
AND GET A CHEST FILM.
OH, HELL, MARK, DO WE HAVE TO?
YOU HAVE SOMETHING BETTER TO DO TODAY?
SON, I FIGURED WE COULD GO TO CHURCH.
YEAH, RIGHT.
TEMPERATURE'S 101.
BIG DEAL.
MORNING, RANDI.
DR. WEAVER, WELCOME BACK.
KERRY
NICE TO SEE YOU. ROBERT.
I HOPE A FEW WEEKS OFF WAS ENOUGH TIME FOR YOU TO RETHINK
SOME OF YOUR PROFESSIONAL CHOICES.
WAS A FEW WEEKS LONG ENOUGH
FOR YOU TO GET BURIED DOWN HERE
WITH MARK TAKING EXTRA TIME OFF?
NOT AT ALL.
I LOVE BEING UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL WITH MY TROOPS
AND YOU DIDN'T ANSWER MY QUESTION.
I DON'T INTEND TO.
WELL, I'LL TAKE THE FACT THAT YOU CAME BACK TO WORK
AS A YES.
AFTER ALL, I DIDN'T APPOINT YOU CHIEF
SO YOU COULD TURN ALL SOFT AND MUSHY ON ME.
NO, NO, YOU DIDN'T.
AND I'M SURE YOU DO REALIZE
THAT I CAN UN-APPOINT YOU SHOULD YOU FIND IT
TOO DIFFICULT TO UPHOLD THE STANDARDS
OF THIS DEPARTMENT.
YES, I DO.
WELL, THEN, TOP OF THE MORNING TO YOU.
JOHN...
JOHN...
OH, MAN.
WHAT TIME IS IT?
QUARTER PAST 7:00.
HOW ABOUT SOME BREAKFAST?
UM, YEAH, MAYBE JUST SOME TOAST.
DID YOU GET ANY SLEEP?
( sighs )
I GAVE UP TRYING AROUND 2:00.
I CAME DOWNSTAIRS
AND WATCHED A COUPLE INFOMERCIALS.
HEY, I ORDERED YOU ONE OF THOSE MACHINES
SO YOU CAN MAKE YOUR OWN BEEF JERKY.
YOU DIDN'T?
I DIDN'T. THEN I CAME IN HERE.
THIS SEEMS TO BE
THE ONLY ROOM IN THE HOUSE WHERE YOU CAN SLEEP.
MAYBE WE SHOULD PUT A BED IN HERE.
Carter: SOMEBODY!
( metallic clattering )
JOHN?
HMM? WHAT?
I WISH YOU'D TALK TO SOMEBODY ABOUT YOUR NOT SLEEPING.
I'LL BE FINE.
YOU WANT A SLICE?
ABSOLUTELY.
YOU WANT TO SHOOT SOME HOOPS?
WAIT TILL SHE'S DONE BULKING UP.
HEY!
I'M SORRY, CLEO.
I CAN TAKE IT. AS SOON AS I'M DONE BULKING UP.
HEY, WHY DON'T YOU GUYS GO AHEAD? GO, GO.
SHE'S SO BAD, IT'S NO FUN.
I'LL KICK YOUR BUTT.
HEY, HEY! GO, BOTH OF YOU, NOW!
I'D LIKE TO SAY "EXCUSE MY CHILDREN"
BUT THERE'S JUST NO EXCUSE FOR MY CHILDREN.
THAT'S OKAY.
I GREW UP WITH THREE BROTHERS.
I'M USED TO THE ABUSE.
PETER SAYS YOU'RE FROM INDIANAPOLIS.
IS THAT RIGHT? YUP.
DOES YOUR FAMILY ALL STILL LIVE THERE?
MOM! YEAH, THEY DO.
PETER, COULD YOU GO SHUT THEM UP, PLEASE?
YEAH, YEAH, LISTEN, JUST DON'T GRILL HER
WITH A MILLION QUESTIONS, ALL RIGHT?
GO, GO!
( kids arguing playfully outside )
ANY OF YOUR BROTHERS BECOME DOCTORS, TOO?
NO, A COUPLE OF THEM WORK WITH MY DAD.
AND THAT WOULD BE IN...?
INSURANCE. HMM.
GOOD LINE OF WORK.
YOU DIDN'T WANT TO DO THAT?
WORKING TOGETHER, LIVING SO CLOSE
FAMILY CAN BE A LITTLE STIFLING.
I MEAN, NOT ALL FAMILIES, OF COURSE.
OF COURSE.
HAVE ANOTHER WAFFLE.
THANKS.
( kids continue arguing playfully )
LET'S TRANSFER. ONE, TWO, THREE.
GET A C.B.C., CHEM PANEL AND DIP A URINE.
DELIA, DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED?
DADDY WAS TAKING ME TO SHELLY'S HOUSE
AND THIS CAR HIT US REALLY FAST.
MR. CHADSEY, DOES SHE HAVE ANY PREVIOUS MEDICAL PROBLEMS?
SHE HAD LEUKEMIA.
DO YOU KNOW WHAT KIND?
A.M.L. SHE'S BEEN IN REMISSION FOR EIGHT MONTHS.
HOW'S YOUR ARM?
LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE GOING TO NEED SUTURES.
I WANT TO STAY WITH DELIA.
HALEH?
WE CAN DO IT RIGHT HERE.
I'LL GO GET A CHAIR.
ARE YOU OKAY, DADDY?
IT'S JUST A LITTLE CUT.
THEY'RE GOING TO FIX ME UP.
I HAD STITCHES ONCE. IT'S NOT BAD.
Father: I'M GOING TO TRY TO BE AS BRAVE AS YOU ARE.
OKAY?
OKAY.
ALL I'M SAYING IS
YOU CAN'T GO WRONG WITH A CHEVY.
I'VE GONE WRONG MANY TIMES IN A CHEVY.
I ALWAYS ADMIRED THE SUBARU.
I SAY GO WITH SOMETHING CLASSIC
LIKE AN OLD MUSTANG CONVERTIBLE.
TWO BABIES, RANDI, REMEMBER?
MAYBE AL COULD GET YOU SOMETHING
FROM THE POLICE AUCTION.
WHAT DO YOU DRIVE, LUKA?
AN OLD SAAB.
NO, DON'T GO SWEDISH.
THEY'VE GOT THE HIGHEST SUICIDE RATE, YOU KNOW?
WHAT'S THIS ALL ABOUT?
I'M GOING TO GO BUY A NEW CAR-- A NEW, USED CAR.
TODAY?
YEAH. MY MOM'S GOT THE TWINS, SO...
WHAT TIME ARE YOU OFF?
ABOUT AN HOUR? WHY?
YOU SHOULD GO TO THE PLACE I GOT MINE.
I KNOW THE GUY. HE'LL GIVE YOU A GOOD DEAL.
IF YOU CAN WAIT A BIT, I CAN COME WITH YOU.
YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY TAKE A GUY WITH YOU.
THEY DON'T LISTEN TO ME, BUT THEY LISTEN TO AL.
THEY LISTEN TO ME, BUT I'M ON ALL DAY.
ME, TOO.
YOU SURE YOU DON'T MIND?
NO, OF COURSE NOT.
I JUST HAVE A FEW CASES TO FINISH UP.
OKAY, THANKS.
GOOD.
Lockhart: DR. CORDAY
C.B.C.'s BACK ON DELIA CHADSEY.
WHITE BLOOD COUNT OF 60,000-- 50% BLASTS.
HER LEUKEMIA'S BACK.
I WONDER WHY SHE NEVER GOT
A BONE MARROW TRANSPLANT.
DO YOU WANT ME TO TALK TO THE FATHER?
UH, NO, I CAN DO IT.
THANKS.
OH, MARK, I HEARD YOUR FATHER'S HERE.
MALIK'S GETTING HIM SETTLED IN.
WHAT IS IT?
RHONCHI AND CONSOLIDATION IN HIS RIGHT LUNG.
I'M GOING TO GO CHECK ON HIM NOW.
I DIDN'T WANT TO BE HERE, EITHER
BUT MY SON HAS THE LAST WORD
IN MOST THINGS MEDICAL.
TELL ME ABOUT IT.
MY SON'S A FIRST-YEAR MED STUDENT.
ONLY THING WORSE IS A FIRST-YEAR LAW STUDENT.
THAT WOULD BE MY DAUGHTER.
HEY, MARK, THIS IS SARAH MacKENZIE.
WE'RE, UH, KINDRED SPIRITS IN BEING HOSPITAL HOSTAGES.
HOW DO YOU DO?
NOTHING SERIOUS, I HOPE?
NO, KNOCKED UP MY SHIN, GOT INFECTED.
HELLO, DAVID, HOW ARE YOU?
WELL, I'M STILL HERE, ELIZABETH.
COULDN'T BE TOO BAD.
Malik: WANT TO DO A PORTABLE CHEST?
NO, GET HIM TO RADIOLOGY.
GET A GOOD P.A. AND A LATERAL.
MAKE SURE HE GOES OVER ON O2.
THIS IS DR. ELIZABETH CORDAY.
SHE AND MY SON ARE...
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU CALL IT NOWADAYS-- FRIENDS?
HELLO. HELLO.
LOOKS LIKE YOU'VE GOT YOUR HANDS FULL.
YES.
I CAN DO THAT.
NO, I GOT IT. FIVE OF ALBUTEROL.
I CAN DO THAT, TOO. WANT ME TO START A SALINE LOCK?
SURE.
NOT BAD. TWO DOCTORS, HUH?
NO WAITING.
REESE WENT OUT LIKE A LIGHT.
NOT ONLY CAN SHE EAT, SHE CAN PLAY.
THE KIDS LIKE HER.
MM-HMM.
WHAT ABOUT YOU?
SINCE WHEN DO YOU CARE WHAT I THINK?
THE QUESTION IS DO YOU LIKE HER?
I WOULDN'T HAVE BROUGHT HER HERE
IF I DIDN'T.
ARE YOU SERIOUS ABOUT HER?
JACKIE, IT'S A LITTLE EARLY TO BE SERIOUS.
I HOPE SO
BECAUSE SHE'S NOT SERIOUS ABOUT YOU.
( kids arguing playfully )
ALL RIGHT, WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?
I'M JUST SAYING.
SHE'S HAVING FUN
BUT THAT GIRL'S NOT READY TO SETTLE DOWN.
WHO SAYS I AM?
RIGHT.
YOU'RE NOT SO SETTLED WITH A THREE-YEAR-OLD.
OH, COME ON, JACKIE.
THAT DOESN'T MEAN I WANT TO GET MARRIED.
SHE'S NICE, WE HAVE FUN
BUT IT'S NOT SERIOUS.
GOOD, GLAD TO HEAR IT.
THEN I LIKE HER, TOO.
SO, WHAT IS THIS
YOUR FEMALE INTUITION THING AGAIN?
CERTAINLY NOT.
DID SHE SAY SOMETHING?
SHE HAD TO. I ASKED
A MILLION QUESTIONS.
Cleo: COME ON, SHOOT.
Luka: EDGAR'S MOTHER IS AN I.C.U. NURSE UPSTAIRS.
SHE'S TRYING TO FIND SOMEONE TO FILL IN FOR HER.
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING, MENINGITIS?
FEVER, VOMITING, HEADACHE.
I NEED YOU TO HELP ME WITH THE L.P.
IS HE LETHARGIC?
A LITTLE SLEEPY.
GAVE HIM VERSED.
CAN YOU ROLL HIM UP IN A BALL?
YEAH.
ALL RIGHT, EDGAR, DON'T WORRY.
EVERYTHING'S GOING TO BE JUST FINE.
OKAY, GOOD POSITION.
OKAY, HERE WE GO.
STEADY.
Knight: OKAY, I'M READY.
GOOD, I'M IN.
OKAY, I FEEL THE POP.
Carter: DO YOU FEEL THE POP?
Knight: NO.
KEEP GOING.
I CAN'T.
YES, YOU CAN!
Paul Sobriki: STOP, PLEASE?! YOU'RE HURTING ME! PLEASE!
Knight: CALM DOWN. IT'S ALL RIGHT.
MALIK, GIVE HIM ANOTHER TWO OF ATIVAN.
LUCY, KEEP GOING.
IT'LL BE A TRAUMATIC TAP.
WE'LL GET BLOOD IN THE SPINAL FLUID.
I DON'T THINK
IT'S GOING TO GET ANY EASIER.
AH! YOU'RE HURTING ME! PLEASE, STOP!
YOUR MEDICATION WILL WEAR OFF SHORTLY
AND YOU WON'T FEEL SO SLEEPY, OKAY?
THANKS, CARTER.
CARTER?
HMM?
THANKS.
SURE... YEAH, SURE, NO PROBLEM.
DID ANYONE EVER DISCUSS BONE MARROW TRANSPLANT WITH YOU?
YEAH, THERE WAS NO H.L.A.-MATCHED RELATIVE.
I ONLY MATCHED THREE OUT OF HER SIX ANTIGENS.
YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH THIS BEFORE, I GUESS.
OH, YEAH, BIG TIME.
WITH THE RECURRENCE, SHE'S GOING TO NEED
REINDUCTION CHEMOTHERAPY.
CHEMO AGAIN? OH, MAN.
WE WERE SO HOPEFUL.
IN ABOUT TWO MONTHS, WHEN SHE GOES
INTO HER SECOND REMISSION, THEY CAN TRY A B.M.T.
YEAH, IF THEY CAN FIND A DONOR.
THERE ARE NO OTHER POSSIBILITIES IN THE FAMILY?
NO, NOT EXACTLY.
"NOT EXACTLY"?
DELIA HAS A HALF-SISTER, BUT SHE'S NOT BEEN TESTED.
WHY NOT?
DAUGHTER FROM MY FIRST MARRIAGE.
THE DIVORCE WAS PRETTY UGLY.
MY EX-WIFE'S NOT REALLY INCLINED TO HELP.
NOT EVEN TO SAVE ANOTHER CHILD'S LIFE?
I THINK THAT WE SHOULD JUST GO AHEAD
WITH THE CHEMO, AND THEN JUST GO FROM THERE.
SURE, AND I'LL CHECK WITH THE NATIONAL REGISTRY
IN MILWAUKEE, 'CAUSE A MATCH
WITH AN UNRELATED DONOR'S BETTER THAN NOTHING.
THANK YOU.
ARE YOU READY YET?
JUST ABOUT.
C.V.A. IS BEING ADMITTED TO MEDICINE
SEIZURE PATIENT CAN GO HOME
AND LITTLE EDGAR BRALEY'S L.P. WAS NEGATIVE FOR MENINGITIS
BUT WE'RE STILL WAITING FOR HIS LYTES
AND HIS MOTHER HAD TO GO BACK TO WORK UPSTAIRS.
OKAY, I'LL CHECK UP ON HIM.
GOOD LUCK.
THANKS. THANK YOU.
HEY, EDGAR, HOW YOU DOING?
WHAT'S SHE GOT?
WHY DOES SHE HAVE THAT STICK?
WHAT'S SHE GOING TO DO?!
NOBODY'S DOING ANYTHING.
I DON'T WANT HER TO TOUCH ME.
DON'T LET HER TOUCH ME!
NO!
GET HER AWAY FROM ME!
IT'S ALL RIGHT. SWEETIE, HEY!
GET HER AWAY FROM ME!
GET HER AWAY FROM ME!
GET HER AWAY FROM ME!
HEY, HEY!
I'M SORRY, DR. WEAVER.
WELL, I GUESS HE'S FEELING BETTER.
GO AHEAD AND GET HIM, CONNIE.
GET MALUCCI IF YOU NEED HELP!
MARK.
HEY. HEY.
HOW IS HE?
MAKING NEW FRIENDS AS USUAL.
GOT THE FILMS BACK.
IT IS POST-OBSTRUCTION PNEUMONIA.
GAVE HIM A GRAM OF CEFOTAXIME
I.V. PIGGYBACK.
SO, ARE YOU GOING TO KEEP HIM HERE?
FOR A WHILE
MAKE SURE HE DOESN'T HAVE A BAD REACTION
TO THE ANTIBIOTICS.
I'LL STOP IN AND SAY HELLO.
SO, UM, CAN I DO ANYTHING TO HELP?
I'M JUST GOING TO STEAL SOME SUPPLIES.
DON'T TELL ANYBODY.
I LOVE STEALING. LET ME HELP.
SALINE FLUSHES, NEED ALCOHOL WIPES.
OKAY, CHECK.
TWO-BY-TWOS
EXTENSION TUBING.
EXTENSION TUBING. CHECK.
NEEDLES AND SYRINGES.
SYRINGES, SYRINGES.
MARK...
UH, NEEDLES AND SYRINGES.
I'M GOING TO, UH...
I GUESS I'M GOING TO NEED TO BORROW
SOME MORE FUSION BOTTLES OF CEFOTAXIME.
MY DAD WILL BE ON ANTIBIOTICS FOR TEN TO 14 DAYS
DEPENDING ON HOW HE RESPONDS.
YEAH, OF COURSE.
I'M SORRY.
IT WOULD'VE BEEN FASTER
IF I'D HAD MY CAR TODAY.
OH, THAT'S OKAY.
UNFORTUNATELY, IT'S IN THE SHOP.
WHAT?!
NO, JUST A ROUTINE CHECKUP--
NOTHING WRONG, REALLY.
THIS IS A GOOD PLACE.
YOU'LL LIKE HERB.
HERB?
YEAH.
HE AND I ARE LIKE THIS, YOU KNOW.
HE'S MY SECOND COUSIN'S WIFE'S BROTHER-IN-LAW.
( laughing ): THAT WOULD DEFINITELY MAKE YOU LIKE THIS.
EXCITED?
ABOUT BUYING A USED CAR?
NO.
MY MOM THINKS I SHOULD GET A MINIVAN.
OH, YEAH, THEY'RE VERY GOOD, YOU KNOW... PRACTICAL...
VERY... "MY LIFE IS OVER"?
NO, DON'T SAY THAT, COME ON.
WE'LL HAVE HIM PUT A PORSCHE ENGINE IN IT.
REALLY?
NO.
( laughing ): I'M-I'M SORRY, I WAS KIDDING.
I DON'T THINK BRINGING YOU ALONG
WAS SUCH A GOOD IDEA.
NO, YOU'LL SEE.
WE'LL GET YOU SOMETHING REALLY GOOD.
MRS. POOLER, DO YOU HAVE ANY ALLERGIES?
WHAT IS IT? WH-WHAT'S WRONG?
Takata: TACHY AT 120.
PULSE OX IS 91 ON TWO LITERS.
ARE YOU ON ANY MEDICATIONS?
UH, JUST A PILL FOR HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE-- UH, PROPRANON...
PROPRANOLOL?
YEAH, PROPRANOLOL, YEAH.
YOU SHOULDN'T TAKE THAT WITH ASTHMA.
THAT CAN KILL YOU.
WHO'S YOUR DOCTOR?
MR. POOLER?
IT-IT'S MY MEDICATION
FOR HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE.
YOU SEE, RUTH HAS MEDICARE
AND THEY WON'T PAY
FOR HER PRESCRIPTIONS--
HER, UH, UH, ENALA...
YEAH. ENALAPRIL?
IT COSTS $50.
WE-WE JUST HAVE OUR SOCIAL SECURITY
SO... WE THOUGHT SHE COULD TAKE MINE.
SEE, I'M AN H.M.O.
I-I GET THEM FOR FREE.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
WHY ARE YOU IN AN H.M.O. AND YOUR WIFE ISN'T?
WELL, I-I HAVE HEART TROUBLE.
I TAKE A LOT OF PILLS
BUT SHE JUST HAS THE-THE ASTHMA
AND WANTED TO KEEP HER DOCTOR.
SO, UH, THE H.M.O. WON'T LET HER DO THAT.
Malucci: HEY, FOUND YOUR RUNAWAY.
WHERE WAS HE?
CAFETERIA, EATING TAPIOCA PUDDING.
SAYS HE HANGS OUT THERE WITH HIS MOM.
IS HE OKAY?
YEAH, HE SEEMS TO BE ALL RIGHT.
GOOD. HIS LABS CAME BACK-- ELEVATED B.U.N. AND CREATININE.
ALSO, HIS POTASSIUM'S A LITTLE LOW.
GIVE HIM A SALINE BOLUS, TEN PER KILO
AND PUT HIM ON MAINTENANCE.
OOH, YOU WANT ME TO TAKE HIM?
I WANT YOU TO SPIFF HIM UP, MALUCCI.
SURE THING, CHIEF.
I DON'T THINK THIS IS RIGHT.
UH, NO, I THINK YOU WOULD'VE REMEMBERED
IF IT HAD BEEN ACROSS THE STREET
FROM A MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL FIELD.
IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE A NATURAL PLACE
FOR A USED CAR LOT, DOES IT?
GEE, NO, IT DOESN'T.
I'M HUNGRY.
YEAH, ME, TOO.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
IT'S HERE.
SORRY ABOUT THIS.
MR. CHADSEY...
OH, I WAS JUST GETTING DELIA SOME WATER.
UH, I SPOKE TO THE LEGAL DEPARTMENT
AND THERE'S NOTHING WE CAN DO TO MAKE YOUR EX-WIFE...
I DIDN'T ASK YOU TO CHECK ON THAT.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
WELL, I THINK YOU SHOULD TALK TO HER.
NO. I-I ALREADY TOLD YOU SHE'S NOT GOING TO HELP.
WELL, THEN, LET ME TRY.
NO. MR. CHADSEY...
I SAID NO!
I JUST WANT TO BE WITH MY DAUGHTER.
PLEASE DON'T MAKE THIS HARDER THAN IT ALREADY IS.
DO YOU THINK THIS IS REALLY NECESSARY?
THE PROPRANOLOL THAT YOU GAVE HER LASTS FOR 24 HOURS
SO SHE NEEDS TO BE ON A CONTINUOUS BREATHING TREATMENT.
OH, SUCH A FUSS.
I'M SORRY.
DON'T WORRY, MRS. POOLER.
THE I.C.U. WILL TAKE GOOD CARE OF YOU.
I KNOW.
THEY DID LAST TIME, AFTER MY OPERATION.
YOU WERE HERE FOR AN OPERATION?
MM-HMM.
FOR WHAT?
OH... OH, DEAR, LET ME THINK.
UH, UH, WH-WHAT-WHAT WAS IT CALLED, RALPH?
OH, GEE, I'M- I'M NOT SURE.
IT WAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH HER, UH, STOMACH.
OH, YES, THAT'S IT.
THEY TOOK SOMETHING OUT OF MY STOMACH.
DO YOU THINK THAT'D MAKE A DIFFERENCE NOW?
OH, I DOUBT IT, BUT I'LL CHECK HER OLD CHART JUST TO BE SURE.
COME ON, HERE WE GO.
OH, THANK YOU, DOCTOR.
YOU'RE VERY WELCOME.
RANDI, IF ANYBODY NEEDS ME, I'LL BE IN MEDICAL RECORDS.
OKEYDOKEY.
THE INFIELD FLY RULE...
IS... WHEN THE BATTER...
HITS THE BALL... AND IT GOES... WAY HIGH UP IN...
YOU KNOW, UP, LIKE, OVER THE PITCHER'S MOUND.
THEN, THE RUNNER ON SECOND HAS TO RUN TO THIRD
BEFORE THE RUNNER ON FIRST CAN RUN TO SECOND.
HMM.
I THOUGHT THEY WEREN'T SUPPOSED TO RUN AT ALL ON A FLY BALL.
IT'S COMPLICATED.
( laughing )
YOU DON'T HAVE ANY IDEA
WHAT THE INFIELD FLY RULE IS, DO YOU?
CAN WE GO NOW?
( laughing )
I MEAN, YOU MAY HAVE A NEW USED CAR
BUT I DON'T.
MY FIRST TRANSPORTATION WAS A TRACTOR.
( laughing ): A TRACTOR?
( laughing ): YEAH... MY GRANDPA'S FARM.
HE LET ME DRIVE WHEN I WAS ABOUT 11, 12
UNTIL I TOOK OUT A COUPLE OF FENCES AND ONE OF HIS COWS.
WAS YOUR DAD A FARMER, TOO?
NO, HE WAS A TRAIN CONDUCTOR.
HE LET ME RIDE ON HIS LAP WHEN I WAS LITTLE.
SOMETIMES, MY-MY BROTHER AND I WOULD GO
ALL THE WAY TO ZAGREB WITH HIM
AND WE'D RUN THROUGH THE OTHER CARS
LOOKING AT THE PASSENGERS, THINKING, YOU KNOW
"MY FATHER DRIVES THE TRAIN."
YOU SPENT A LOT OF TIME WITH YOUR DAD?
YEAH.
DID YOU COME HERE A LOT WITH YOUR FATHER...
LEARN ABOUT BASEBALL?
WHY? 'CAUSE I KNOW SO MUCH?
YEAH.
NO, ACTUALLY...
MY DAD DIED WHEN I WAS REALLY LITTLE.
I'M SORRY. I NEVER REALLY KNEW HIM.
YEAH, SO AM I.
IT MUST MAKE YOU THINK ABOUT KATE AND TESS
ABOUT THEIR KNOWING THEIR FATHER.
YEAH, I GUESS...
BUT YOU WOULD KNOW
WHAT THEY'RE MISSING MORE THAN I DO.
ARE WE GOING TO BUY A CAR
OR ARE WE GOING TO BUY A CAR?
WE ARE GOING TO BUY A CAR.
Man: I COULDN'T FIND THE FILE ON RUTH POOLER.
IF IT'S BEEN MORE THAN TWO YEARS
IT'S PROBABLY IN REMOTE STORAGE.
OKAY. I CAN GET IT IN ABOUT AN HOUR.
OH, BUT I FOUND
THAT OTHER ONE YOU WANTED...
UH, PAUL SOBRIKI-- PSYCH FILE?
THAT'S THE ONE.
SIGN RIGHT HERE.
ALL RIGHT.
Dr. DeRaad: HEY, DR. CARTER.
DR. DeRAAD, HI.
HOW YOU DOING?
GOOD, FINE.
YEAH, JUST GOING OVER AN OLD CHART-- ASTHMA PATIENT.
GETTING BACK INTO WORK OKAY?
YEAH, PRETTY WELL.
I HAVE GOOD DAYS AND BAD DAYS.
ACTUALLY, TODAY HASN'T BEEN, UH...
I...
WELL... COME ON UP AND WE'LL TALK.
NO, NO-NO.
( chuckles ): I'M OKAY.
I KNOW... BUT I HAVE TIME.
SAY... 3:00?
SURE.
THANKS.
THAT WAS A HELL OF A TIME, THAT'S FOR SURE.
SAM DID TWO TOURS. WANTED TO DO A THIRD
BUT I TOLD HIM I'D KILL HIM.
HE HEARD ME.
DAD, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
MRS. MacKENZIE AND I
ARE TALKING.
PLEASE, CALL ME SARAH.
PULSE OX, DAD.
YOU GOT TO LEAVE IT ON YOUR FINGER.
OH, I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW IT WAS OFF.
HER HUSBAND'S AN OLD NAVAL MAN, TOO--
EVEN SERVED IN VIETNAM
ALTHOUGH LATER THAN I DID.
IS THAT SO?
HE STILL THINKS HE'S A NAVY MAN-- OUT ON THE LAKE NOW
RUNNING AROUND IN HIS OLD POWERBOAT.
SAYS IT KEEPS HIM SANE.
ISN'T THIS THING SUPPOSED TO BE DRIPPING?
I UNDERSTAND WHAT HE MEANS.
TRY AND KEEP YOUR ELBOW STRAIGHT.
I LOVED BEING OUT ON THE WATER.
SOMETIMES, IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT
YOU'D... YOU'D GET A STORM--
30-FOOT WAVES COMING IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS...
ROCKING AND ROLLING LIKE YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE.
STILL...
IT COULD PUT YOU TO SLEEP LIKE A LITTLE BABY.
I'D WAKE UP AT DAWN, GO OUT TO THE TIP OF THE BOW, AND...
THE WATER WOULD BE CLEAR AND CALM...
THE SHIP SLICING
THROUGH IT LIKE COOL AIR.
CALMEST PLACE ON EARTH, I USED TO THINK...
LIKE THE STORM...
NEVER EVEN HAPPENED.
HI, JESSAMYN?
YES?
JESSAMYN CHADSEY?
YES.
JESSAMYN, WHO IS IT?
HI... MRS. LOMAX?
YES?
MY NAME IS ABBY LOCKHART.
I WORK AT COUNTY GENERAL.
IS SOMETHING WRONG?
DID SOMETHING HAPPEN TO TERRY?
PLEASE, COME IN.
NO, NO.
UM...
I'VE... I'VE BEEN TREATING
YOUR FORMER HUSBAND'S DAUGHTER.
DID HE SEND YOU HERE?
NO, HE DIDN'T.
YOU KNOW ABOUT HER LEUKEMIA.
GET OUT OF HERE RIGHT NOW.
JESSAMYN, UPSTAIRS.
MOM, I WANT TO STAY.
MRS. LOMAX, SHE'S A CHILD
AND THE CLOSEST MATCH WE HAVE IS AN UNRELATED DONOR.
I SAID GET OUT.
IF JESSAMYN MATCHED
SHE WOULD HAVE A MUCH BETTER CHANCE
OF SURVIVAL.
I DON'T CARE ABOUT HIM OR ANYTHING TO DO WITH HIM.
CAN YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?
MOM, CALM DOWN.
DON'T TELL ME TO CALM DOWN, JESS.
NOW, PLEASE, LEAVE.
MRS. LOMAX, IF YOU COULD JUST...
I ASKED YOU TO LEAVE.
DO I NEED TO CALL SOMEBODY?
'97 CAMRY.
POWER STEERING, POWER BRAKES
POWER WINDOWS, POWER LOCKS
POWER SEATS
AND ALL FOR ONLY... $18,000?
THAT'S OUTRAGEOUS.
YOU'RE REALLY ENJOYING THIS, AREN'T YOU?
NOW, HERE WE GO.
SPECIAL DEAL-- VERY LOW PRICE.
$3,300.
WHAT IS IT?
IT'S, UH... DODGE DYNASTY. 1989.
EXCELLENT YEAR, AND ONLY 90,000 MILES.
WHO GETS A DODGE DYNASTY?
OKAY, OKAY, IT'S NOT YOUR THING.
HOW ABOUT THE '91 MERCURY SABLE?
FOR... $2,900.
WHAT MORE COULD YOU WANT?
HEY, FOUR DOORS, WINDSHIELD WIPERS, ANTENNA...
( laughing )
HEY, MALUCCI.
YEAH, CHIEF?
COME HERE.
DON'T LOOK NOW, BUT YOUR LITTLE RUNAWAY, EDGAR BRALEY
IS HIDING DOWN THE HALL.
Malucci: WHAT'S HE DOING?
Weaver: I DON'T KNOW.
MY GUESS IS HE'S SPYING ON ME.
GET HIM BACK TO EXAM TWO.
WE'RE TREATING HER WITH ANTIBIOTICS
BUT THE OXYGEN LEVEL IS LOW.
PNEUMONIA CAN BE A PEACEFUL WAY FOR AN ELDERLY PERSON TO DIE.
WE DON'T WANT HER TO DIE.
AS THE OXYGEN LEVEL DROPS
SHE'LL SIMPLY FALL ASLEEP, AND EVENTUALLY
STOP BREATHING.
THERE'S NO PAIN OR SUFFERING.
CAN'T YOU PUT HER ON A BREATHING MACHINE?
SOMETIMES IT'S BEST TO JUST LET NATURE TAKE ITS COURSE.
LAST MONTH, SHE WAS SITTING UP IN A CHAIR EATING.
WELL, SHE STOPPED EATING AWHILE AGO
ACCORDING TO THE NURSING HOME.
SHE'S BEING FED
THROUGH A TUBE NOW DIRECTLY INTO HER STOMACH.
WE CAN'T JUST LET GRANDMA DIE.
WE'RE NOT GOING TO, HONEY.
IF YOU'D LIKE SOME TIME TO...
Man: WE DON'T NEED TIME.
WE NEED SOMEBODY WHO'S WILLING TO HELP US
AND OBVIOUSLY
THAT'S NOT YOU.
IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME FOR A MOMENT.
HAVE YOU SEEN DR. WEAVER?
NO.
WELL, I KEEP HAVING THESE THOUGHTS.
IT'S LIKE I... I SEE MOMENTS OF THE ACCIDENT
OR SOMETHING THAT REMINDS ME...
THE ACCIDENT?
I'D SAY IT WAS MORE OF AN ATTACK--
A BRUTAL ATTACK
FOR WHICH YOU HAD NO WARNING.
RIGHT.
WELL, THAT'S THE THING--
SEE, I ASSISTED ON THE SPINAL TAP ON PAUL SOBRIKI
AND HE WAS AGGRESSIVE...
AND HE WAS OVERREACTING
AND HE'D HAD ATIVAN
AND I'D NUMBED HIM WITH LIDOCAINE
BUT HIS RESPONSE WAS...
AS IF...
WE WERE STABBING HIM.
IN HIS MENTAL STATE, HE THOUGHT YOU WERE.
I... I SHOULD HAVE REALIZED THAT SOMETHING WAS VERY WRONG.
SO SHOULD HAVE LUCY
BUT SHE DIDN'T PICK UP ON IT, EITHER
DID SHE?
THERE'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE "WHAT IFS."
WHAT IF I HAD GOTTEN DOWN THERE SOONER
FOR THE PSYCH CONSULT?
IT'D BE EASIER FOR ALL OF US
IF WE COULD THINK OF IT AS AN ACCIDENT
BUT NONE OF US HAVE THAT LUXURY.
I KNOW.
I JUST WANT TO GET THESE THOUGHTS OUT OF MY HEAD.
IT'S GOING TO TAKE SOME TIME.
HAVE YOU SEEN HIM?
PAUL SOBRIKI?
I WAS JUST WONDERING IF YOU'D SEEN HIM
OR HIS WIFE.
NO, I HAVEN'T.
YOU'RE CURIOUS ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH HIM?
NO, NO.
I JUST...
( beeping )
IT'S A 911.
I GOT TO GO.
THANK YOU.
ANY TIME.
COME BACK.
IT HAS BEEN A PLEASURE, A REAL PLEASURE.
COME BACK SOON, ALTHOUGH I KNOW YOU WON'T NEED TO
'CAUSE THIS CAR'S GOING TO LAST YOU TEN YEARS.
MY NAME IS MANNY.
DID YOU GET A NUMBER?
OH, GOD, I HOPE I'M NOT DRIVING THIS CAR IN TEN YEARS.
IT'S A BEAUTY. COME ON.
LUKA, IT'S A SMALL STATION WAGON
BUT I THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP.
SHALL WE CELEBRATE?
( laughing )
ARE YOU STEALING?
NO, DAD, I'M BORROWING.
I THINK HE'S STEALING.
Chen: DR. GREENE...
I NEED YOUR HELP WITH THIS FAMILY.
I'M NOT ON TODAY.
I KNOW, BUT I CAN'T FIND DR. WEAVER.
DAD, I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
LET'S HEAR IT.
WHAT HAPPENED?
SYNCOPE WITH BLUNT HEAD TRAUMA, ALTERED.
HE TOOK A FALL WHILE SETTLING HIS WIFE INTO THE I.C.U.
Carter: MR. POOLER, YOU ALL RIGHT?
LATERAL C-SPINE AND CHEST?
C.B.C., LYTES, CARDIAC ENZYMES, REPEAT E.K.G.
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!
LOOK OUT, LOOK OUT, LOOK OUT!
LET'S GET A HEAD C.T. AFTER WE CLEAR THE NECK.
WHERE'S ALL THE BLOOD COMING FROM?
OCCIPITAL SCALP LAC, NO HEMOTYMPANUM.
SYSTOLIC'S 95, PULSE OX 98.
BOLUS ANOTHER 250 OF SALINE.
GIVE HIM A GRAM OF ANCEF
AND UPDATE HIS TETANUS.
HERE'S THE 12-LEAD FROM UPSTAIRS.
NO S.T. CHANGES.
AT LEAST HE'S NOT HAVING A HEART ATTACK.
SHE CAN'T EAT.
SHE HAS NO QUALITY OF LIFE.
IF WE INTUBATE HER
THEY'LL TAKE HER UP TO THE I.C.U.
AND HOOK HER UP TO TUBES AND WIRES
AND MACHINES
AND SHE'LL DIE IN PERHAPS
TWO, THREE WEEKS.
IF WE LEAVE HER AS SHE IS NOW...
SHE'LL DIE TODAY, MAYBE TOMORROW
BUT PEACEFULLY.
YOU NEED TO THINK CAREFULLY ABOUT WHAT SHE WOULD WANT.
MR. HEMMINGS, YOUR MOTHER IS LETTING GO.
AND YOU THINK THAT'S WHAT WE SHOULD DO?
I THINK YOU SHOULD SPEND SOME MORE TIME WITH HER.
THANK YOU, DR. GREENE.
SURE.
THANKS, ELIZABETH.
I'LL LET YOU KNOW WHAT THE HEAD C.T. SHOWS.
MM-HMM.
HOW'S IT GOING?
ALL RIGHT. HOW ARE YOU?
I THINK I'M GOING TO PACK UP THE OLD MAN
AND TAKE HIM FOR A SPIN.
HIS LABS HAVEN'T COME BACK YET
NEITHER HAVE HIS FILMS.
OKAY, I'LL CALL THE LAB. YOU CALL RADIOLOGY?
OKAY. OH, BOY.
WHAT?
DO YOU REMEMBER
THAT LEUKEMIA CASE I MENTIONED?
HI, JESSAMYN.
ARE THEY STILL HERE?
THIS IS DR. WEAVER.
HI, JESSAMYN.
YES, THEY'RE WAITING FOR A BED UPSTAIRS.
I WANT TO DO THIS.
I WANT TO HELP OUT IF I CAN.
SO WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO?
UH, OKAY, WELL, UM, I DON'T KNOW...
DID YOUR MOTHER DRIVE YOU HERE?
NO, I...
DROVE IN MYSELF.
DOES SHE KNOW YOU'RE HERE?
I'M OLD ENOUGH TO DECIDE ON MY OWN.
MY MOM IS A GOOD PERSON
BUT WHEN IT COMES TO THIS SUBJECT
THERE IS NO TALKING TO HER.
SO SHE HASN'T GIVEN CONSENT.
MY DAD WANTS THIS.
I WANT THIS.
THAT HAS TO COUNT FOR SOMETHING.
IT DOES.
I MEAN, IT COUNTS FOR A LOT
BUT I'M AFRAID THE RULES ARE VERY CLEAR ON THIS.
THIS IS YOUR MOTHER'S DECISION.
SHE SAID SHE COULDN'T UNDERSTAND
HOW SOMETHING LIKE THIS COULD HAPPEN
WITH A LIFE AT STAKE.
I DON'T, EITHER.
I'M SO SORRY.
ABBY, LET ME KNOW WHEN THOSE LABS ARE BACK.
UM...
WHY DON'T I TAKE YOU TO SEE YOUR FATHER?
I DON'T WANT TO SEE HIM.
WELL, I'M SURE IT WOULD MEAN A LOT
KNOWING THAT YOU WANTED TO DO THIS.
I DON'T CARE WHAT HE THINKS.
I'M ONLY TRYING TO HELP DELIA.
GOOD EATING TODAY.
HOT DOG, HAMBURGER.
FRENCH FRIES?
MMM!
THANK YOU.
I HAVEN'T BEEN THROUGH A DRIVE-THROUGH
IN I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG.
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A PITY TO HAVE LEFT THE CAR ALL ALONE
ON ITS FIRST DAY.
YES, I AGREE.
WHEN I FIRST CAME TO CHICAGO
I USED TO COME OUT HERE A LOT
TO LOOK AT THE CITY.
IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL.
DID YOU GROW UP IN THE CITY?
NO, NEAR THE COAST.
IS THAT WHERE YOU WERE DURING THE WAR?
NO.
THEN WE WERE IN, UH, VUKOVAR.
A SMALL APARTMENT.
WE DIDN'T HAVE MUCH MONEY.
WE... KEPT THE CHILDREN IN
ALL THE TIME FOR SAFETY.
THEY WOULD GET CRAZY...
WHAT DO YOU CALL IT, UH...?
CABIN FEVER. YEAH, YEAH.
I WAS GOING TO THE MARKET-- NOT FOR MUCH--
SOME CHEESE AND BREAD...
AND THEY WERE CLIMBING
ALL OVER ME-- "PLEASE, LET ME COME, LET ME COME."
AND THE ANSWER WAS THE SAME AS ALWAYS--
"NO, IT'S... IT'S NOT SAFE."
AND MY WIFE STAYED WITH THEM.
LUKA...
NO, IT'S OKAY.
I WAS ONLY MAYBE, UH...
50 METERS AWAY WHEN I HEARD THE WHISTLE IN THE AIR.
AN ARTILLERY SHELL HIT THE BUILDING.
IT'S ALL REDONE NOW.
PEOPLE REBUILT ALL DURING THE WAR.
ONE DAY, YOU ARE SITTING AT A CAFE.
THE NEXT DAY IT'S BOMBED
AND THE DAY AFTER THAT, THEY... THEY BEGIN TO BUILD.
THAT'S WHAT YOU DO.
SOMETHING HAPPENS...
YOU REBUILD, YOU GO ON.
WE SHOULD PROBABLY GO, HUH?
YOUR MOTHER WILL THINK YOU'VE GONE JOYRIDING.
HEY, RANDI, WHERE IS DR. MALUCCI?
HE WAS WITH A PATIENT
IN EXAM ONE A LITTLE WHILE AGO.
THANKS.
HEY, MALU...
DR. WEAVER.
ABBY, CAN I SPEAK TO YOU FOR A MOMENT?
SURE.
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR YOUR REASONS.
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR YOUR JUSTIFICATIONS.
DO YOU KNOW THAT I COULD FAIL YOU FOR THAT?
YES.
WHAT THE HELL WERE YOU THINKING?
I WAS JUST TRYING TO HELP.
WHAT THAT GIRL DID COMING HERE WAS BRAVE.
WHAT YOU'VE DONE IS STUPID.
HER SISTER IS GOING TO BE IN CHEMOTHERAPY
FOR TWO MONTHS BEFORE THE TRANSPLANT.
YOU DON'T THINK THE MOTHER'S
GOING TO FIND OUT IN THAT TIME?
SHE WAS TAKING THE FIRST STEP.
IT'S OUR SOMETIMES LOUSY JOB TO SAY NO.
THERE ARE RULES THIS EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT
MUST FOLLOW AND WILL FOLLOW.
IS THAT CLEAR?
YES.
MAKE SURE SHE'S OKAY TO DRIVE HOME.
DR. WEAVER...
I DON'T THINK TRYING TO HELP IS EVER STUPID.
I'M REALLY SORRY.
I HOPE I DIDN'T GET YOU INTO TOO MUCH TROUBLE.
I'LL LIVE.
JESSAMYN, WHILE YOU'RE HERE
WHY DON'T YOU JUST GO SEE YOUR DAD?
NO, I'M... I'M GOING TO LEAVE.
WELL, I... I REALLY WISH YOU WOULDN'T.
DR. WEAVER. HMM?
I'M HAVING A LITTLE TROUBLE WITH AN H.M.O.
76-YEAR-OLD GUY WITH SYNCOPE.
THEY WANT TO TRANSFER HIM.
I THINK WE SHOULD KEEP HIM HERE.
NO. ANY E.K.G. CHANGES OR ECTOPY ON THE MONITOR?
BLUE BEACON. WHAT'S THE HEALTH INSURANCE?
THEY CONTRACT WITH NEW WESTERN.
WE ALWAYS TRANSFER THEIR STABLE PATIENTS.
IT'S MORE COMPLICATED THAN THAT.
I ADMITTED HIS WIFE TO THE I.C.U.
THEY WON'T AUTHORIZE THAT.
I THINK IT'D BE BEST TO KEEP THEM TOGETHER.
THEY WON'T AUTHORIZE IT, JOHN.
HE WON'T BE STABLE ENOUGH FOR TRANSFER. HE'S DEHYDRATED.
SO REHYDRATE HIM.
HE'S HYPOKALEMIC.
REPLETE HIS POTASSIUM.
HE'S ANEMIC.
NO. ACTIVELY BLEEDING?
THEN IT'S A CHRONIC PROBLEM.
THE GUY'S READY TO GO.
HE WANTS TO STAY WITH HIS WIFE.
DOES HE ALSO WANT
TO PAY A $2,000 HOSPITAL BILL?
I'M LEAVING PRETTY SOON.
I DON'T KNOW IF I'LL BE ABLE
TO OVERSEE THE TRANSFER.
THEN I'LL DO IT.
THEY WERE FILMING THIS MOVIE--
SWEDISH, I THINK--
NEAR MY GRANDPA'S FARM, AND THEY NEEDED ANIMALS.
SO YOU JUST RENTED OUT
A WHOLE BUNCH OF COWS AND CHICKENS?
SHEEP AND HORSES, TOO, MY BROTHER AND I.
MADE A LOT OF MONEY FOR TEENAGERS
BUT IT WAS A HUGE MESS.
( engine sputtering )
LUKA, WHAT'S HAPPENING?
I DON'T BELIEVE THIS.
I'M GOING TO KILL HERB!
WE DIDN'T EVEN MEET HERB.
SAME THING HAPPENED WHEN I BOUGHT MY CAR
AND HERB SAID IT WAS A FLUKE.
YOU'RE TELLING ME THIS NOW?
NOT TO WORRY.
I CAN FIX IT.
SO YOU BROUGHT ME TO THE WATER.
GOOD BOY, GOOD BOY.
IT'S FUNNY, MARK.
YOU KNOW HOW SOME YEARS
SEEM TO PASS FASTER THAN OTHERS?
YEAH.
WELL, THIS YEAR HAS BEEN THE FASTEST.
I WAS THINKING HOW STRANGE THINGS CAN BE.
DO YOU KNOW THAT IN ALL THE WARS I SERVED IN...
I NEVER WATCHED A MAN DIE.
ON SOME SHIPS, YOU GET LUCKY.
BUT I MUST HAVE TOLD YOU ABOUT THAT TIME
WE HAD AN EXPLOSION AT THE BASE MOTOR POOL.
WHEN YOU WERE STATIONED IN GUAM?
YES.
I WAS LITTLE.
MOM AND I WERE IN SAN DIEGO.
I REMEMBER YOU CALLED
AND TOLD HER ABOUT IT OVER THE PHONE.
WE LOST SEVEN MEN.
I WAS IN THE EXCHANGE WHEN IT HAPPENED.
I WAS LOOKING FOR SOME SHAVING CREAM OR SOMETHING.
EVERYBODY SCRAMBLED OUT.
I STARTED TO--
ME AND THIS LIEUTENANT IN THE AISLE NEXT TO ME--
THE SHAMPOO SECTION, AS I RECALL.
NEXT THING I KNOW, I HEAR THIS CRASH.
I TURN, AND ALL THESE BOTTLES COME FLYING OFF THE SHELF
AND THIS POOR SON OF A BITCH IS COLLAPSING ON THE FLOOR.
HE'D HAD A HEART ATTACK.
WHAT DID YOU DO?
WELL, I SCREAMED FOR HELP, BUT NO ONE CAME
BECAUSE THEY WERE ALL OVER AT THE MOTOR POOL.
I GOT DOWN...
AND I LOOSENED HIS TIE AND UNBUTTONED HIS COLLAR.
HE GRABBED ONTO MY HAND...
BEGGED ME NOT TO LEAVE HIM...
SO I STAYED...
AND I PULLED HIM INTO MY ARMS
AND I HELD HIM...
JUST THE TWO OF US.
FOR THE NEXT FOUR MINUTES, I WATCHED HIM DIE.
THE LONGEST FOUR MINUTES OF MY LIFE.
BUT IN A CRAZY WAY
FOUR OF THE BEST MINUTES OF MY LIFE.
THERE WAS SOME KIND OF VALUE IN JUST BEING THERE.
THANK YOU, MARK...
FOR BRINGING ME OUT TO THE WATER.
YOU'RE WELCOME, DAD.
SAM...
DR. GREENE.
SAM, I'D LIKE YOU TO MEET MY FATHER.
THIS IS DAVID GREENE.
DAD, THIS IS SAM MacKENZIE, SARAH MacKENZIE'S HUSBAND.
HOW DO YOU DO, SIR?
WHAT THE HELL...?
I KNOW HOW HARD DR. CARTER TRIED TO KEEP ME HERE.
IT'S PRETTY TOUGH WITH THE H.M.O.s
BUT THEY'LL TAKE GOOD CARE OF YOU
AT NEW WESTERN, MR. POOLER.
CAN YOU GET A MESSAGE TO MY WIFE?
SHE'S IN THE I.C.U.
I'LL CALL AS SOON AS I GET SETTLED.
THEY DON'T HAVE PHONES FOR THE ICU PATIENTS
BUT IF YOU CALL THEIR MAIN NUMBER
THEY'LL PUT YOU THROUGH
TO THE DESK AND YOU CAN ASK HOW SHE'S DOING, OKAY?
GOOD, GOOD.
AND THANKS AGAIN, FOR EVERYTHING.
MY WIFE AND I
WE CERTAINLY APPRECIATE IT.
YOU'RE WELCOME, SIR.
HOW'S PAUL DOING?
HE'S AT CHESTER.
I GUESS THAT'S THE MAIN PLACE FOR ILLINOIS.
THEY PUT HIM ON MEDICATION.
WHAT DID YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT, DR. CARTER?
I DON'T KNOW.
I JUST KEEP THINKING ABOUT
WHAT HAPPENED, AND...
YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE.
SOMETIMES, THE THOUGHTS IN MY HEAD
SEEM TO BE AS LOUD
AS THE VOICES PAUL SEEMS TO HEAR.
I LIVED WITH HIM, I SLEPT WITH HIM
I'M ABOUT TO BEAR HIS CHILD...
HOW COULD I NOT SEE IT?
I DON'T KNOW.
( Kovac grunting )
KEEP TRYING.
I AM TRYING.
IT'S NOT STARTING.
KEEP TRYING-- IT'LL START.
IT'LL START...
( mocking ): "KEEP TRYING, IT'LL START."
IT'LL START.
IT'S NOT STARTING.
IT HAS BEEN AN OTHERWISE REALLY NICE DAY, HUH?
( both laughing )
THANK YOU FOR CALLING.
I'M SORRY ABOUT ALL THIS, MRS. LOMAX.
WHERE ARE THEY?
I THINK YOUR EX-HUSBAND WENT UP TO THE CAFETERIA
BUT I CAN TAKE YOU
TO JESSAMYN.
EVERYBODY WANTS THIS, MRS. LOMAX.
A LEMONADE STAND?
YEAH.
ME AND MY FRIENDS, WE WOULD SET UP A CARD TABLE
PUT IT ON THE CURB WITH A SIGN THAT SAID
"LEMONADE, TEN CENTS A GLASS."
OF COURSE, IT WASN'T AS LUCRATIVE AS THE CHICKEN AND COW TRADE.
IF WE MADE $1.50, WE WERE RIDING HIGH.
BUT LESS CLEAN-UP THAN THE COW AND CHICKEN TRADE.
TRUE.
I LOOK FORWARD TO THAT FOR KATE AND TESS.
YOU KNOW, WHEN THAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IN THEIR WORLD.
WHEN ALL THEY THINK ABOUT IS DID THEY PUT IN ENOUGH SUGAR
AND WHEN THE NEXT CAR'S DRIVING BY.
YEAH.
I EXPECTED THE TOW TRUCK TO BE HERE BY NOW.
BUT THEN, NOTHING HAS GONE AS EXPECTED TODAY.
