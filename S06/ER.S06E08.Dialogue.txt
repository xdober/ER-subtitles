GUESS WINTER'S HERE, HUH?
YEAH.
AREN'T YOU FREEZING?
NOT ONCE I GET WARMED UP.
I USED TO BE THAT THIN, YOU KNOW.
THE BITCH STABBED ME RIGHT THROUGH THE BIRD.
EXCUSE ME?
I WAS STUFFING THE TURKEY.
HEY, KERRY. HEY, CAROL.
I THOUGHT YESTERDAY WAS YOUR LAST DAY.
I KNOW, BUT I STILL NEED TO SHOW LYDIA
HOW TO DO THE PRODUCTIVITY REPORT.
SHE TOOK OFF.
WHAT?
YEAH, SHE'S DRIVING TO WISCONSIN.
YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO BE HERE 8:00.
I NEEDED TO SLEEP. I THOUGHT SHE HAD A SHIFT.
YEAH, THE NIGHT SHIFT.
WELL, WHY DIDN'T SHE CALL ME?
I CAME ALL THE WAY IN.
SHE FIGURED YOU'D BAIL.
SHE DIDN'T WANT TO BOTHER YOU. OH, MAN.
DO YOU FEEL ALL RIGHT?
NO. MY BACK IS KILLING ME.
WE'RE ABOUT TO DO THE POT LUCK SOON.
WHY DON'T YOU STAY AND REST A WHILE?
NO, I'M GOING TO GO HOME AND TAKE A NAP.
STORE UP MY ENERGY TO DEAL WITH MY FAMILY.
WAIT A MINUTE. HOLD ON.
I GOT YOU DOWN FOR DESSERT.
OH, SORRY. CASUALTY OF PREGNANCY.
WHAT? NO PIE?
( Chuny giggling )
WAIT! NO FAIR! TIME OUT! TIME OUT!
THERE'S NO TIME-OUTS IN A SNOWBALL FIGHT.
NO FAIR! I'M A GIRL!
A GIRL WHO TRIED TO AMBUSH ME.
THAT'S VERY MATURE, CARTER.
OH, YOU WANT A PIECE OF THIS?
DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT.
OKAY. NOW YOU'RE DEAD.
( Chuny laughing )
WELL, I'M GLAD YOU'RE ENJOYING IT.
( groans )
OH, MY GOD.
CAROL...
CAROL, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
MY WATER BROKE.
HOW LONG AGO?
15 MINUTES.
YOU'RE ALREADY HAVING CONTRACTIONS?
HOW MANY?
TWO.
HOW FAR APART? SEVEN, EIGHT MINUTES.
DID ANYONE CALL AN AMBULANCE?
NO. COUNTY'S JUST ONE STOP BACK.
WHY DIDN'T YOU GET ON THAT TRAIN?
YOU TRY WALKING DURING LABOR PAIN.
YEAH.
HOW FAR ALONG ARE YOU?
OH, 38 WEEKS.
WAS THE AMNIOTIC FLUID CLEAR?
KIND OF HARD TO TELL ON THE EL.
SO, NO MECONIUM THEN, HUH?
I DON'T THINK SO.
GOOD. GOOD.
DON'T WORRY.
I COULD BE AT THIS A WHILE.
TELL YOU WHAT...
WE WAIT FOR THE NEXT TRAIN.
IF IT DOESN'T COME IN FIVE MINUTES
WE CALL AN AMBULANCE, OKAY?
OH, YEAH.
DENIED. THAT AIN'T NO FAIR, MAN.
YOU CAN'T USE YOUR HANDS.
I'M A GOALIE.
IT'S TOO EASY, MAN. USE THE CHAIR.
OKAY, WHATEVER YOU SAY, BRO. I STILL OWN YOU.
HEY, CLEO.
WORKING HARD, DAVE?
YEAH, WHAT CAN I TELL YOU?
OH!
I'M COOL. I'M COOL.
HEY, DR. WEAVER.
FINISH YOUR NOTES, DR. MALUCCI?
OOH, ABSOLUTELY, CHIEF.
I WAS JUST, UM, WAITING ON A PARAMEDIC RUN.
IS IT ALWAYS THIS SLOW ON THANKSGIVING?
IF YOU'RE BORED, YOU CAN START STUDYING
FOR YOUR NATIONAL IN-SERVICE EXAM.
YEAH, WOULDN'T WANT TO BRING DOWN THE AVERAGE.
OUCH. AND I THOUGHT YOU LIKED ME.
WHATEVER GAVE YOU THAT IDEA?
IT'LL PICK UP ONCE PEOPLE START EATING DINNER.
BARF CENTRAL, HUH? ALREADY STARTED.
SHELLY ROBINSON, 18, PERSISTENT VOMITING AND DIARRHEA.
HYPOGLYCEMIC
ALTERED MENTAL STATUS.
I GAVE HER I.V. FLUIDS AND COMPAZINE
BUT HER GLUCOSE IS STILL 42 AFTER D-50.
DID YOU GET AN ENDOCRINE CONSULT?
YEAH. HE'S PROBABLY AT HOME STUFFING HIS FACE RIGHT NOW.
YOU GET A TRAVEL HISTORY?
NOT OUTSIDE THE U.S.
HOW ABOUT FLORIDA?
YEAH, ACTUALLY, SHE JUST GOT BACK FROM THERE. WHY?
ASK HER IF SHE ATE AN OILY YELLOWISH FRUIT
WITH BLACK SEEDS.
WHY? AKEE FRUIT.
POISONOUS BEFORE IT'S RIPE.
INDUCES VOMITING AND LOW BLOOD GLUCOSE
BY INHIBITING HEPATIC GLUCONEOGESIS.
KNOWN AS J.V.S.
J.V.S.?
JAMAICAN VOMITING SICKNESS.
BUT THE AKEE ALSO GROWS IN SOUTHERN FLORIDA.
YOU'RE KIDDING, RIGHT?
BETTER START A D-20 INFUSION
BECAUSE THERE'S A HIGH FATALITY RATE
IF IT'S LEFT UNTREATED.
IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME
JUST CHECK THE DIFFERENTIAL.
HE MIGHT BE A DOCTOR AFTER ALL.
JAMAICAN VOMITING SICKNESS?
LOOK IT UP, JOHN.
JAMAICAN VOMITING SICKNESS.
OKAY, LITTLE STEP.
THANK YOU FOR DOING THIS.
NOT A PROBLEM. IT'S OKAY.
OH, GOD.
WHAT IS IT? A CONTRACTION?
OH, YEAH.
OKAY, SIT HERE. SIT HERE.
OH!
MAYBE STANDING'S BETTER, HUH? YEAH.
CAROL, HAVE YOU TAKEN
A BIRTHING CLASS?
UH, JUST LOOK AT SOMETHING.
TRY TO STARE AT SOMETHING.
STAY FOCUSED ON IT, OKAY?
IS SHE HAVING A BABY?
WE'RE OKAY, SHE JUST STARTED.
ARE YOU SURE?
YEAH, IT'S ALL RIGHT. I'M A DOCTOR.
SHE DOESN'T LOOK ALL RIGHT.
( screams )
I THINK I BETTER PULL THE EMERGENCY CORD.
NO, NO, NO.
THAT STOPS THE TRAIN.
SHE NEEDS HELP.
NO, WE ONLY HAVE TO GO ONE STOP.
IT'S OKAY.
BETTER TO BE SAFE.
NO, DON'T PULL THE CORD! THE SIGN SAYS:
"PULL CORD IN CASE OF EMERGENCY."
NO. THIS ISN'T THAT KIND OF EMERGENCY.
"POLICE, FIRE...
MEDICAL EMERGENCY."
DON'T PULL THE DAMN CORD!
OH, GOD!
David: CAN SHE COOK?
WHAT KIND OF A QUESTION IS THAT?
SO, SHE CAN'T.
I DON'T KNOW. WE EAT OUT A LOT.
MY EXPERIENCE WITH ENGLISH FOOD, IT'S ALWAYS BLAND.
WOULD YOU RATHER I COOKED?
IS SHE PRETTY?
YES, SHE'S PRETTY.
PRETTIER THAN CYNTHIA?
DIFFERENT KIND OF PRETTY.
BEAUTY IS OVER-RATED.
SHE'S PRETTY, ALL RIGHT? GEEZ.
HAPPY THANKSGIVING.
SEE?
WHAT?
NOTHING.
ELIZABETH, THIS IS MY FATHER DAVID GREENE.
NICE HAT.
THANK YOU. COME IN.
THIS IS RACHEL.
HELLO, RACHEL.
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO WEAR THOSE.
THEY'RE FOR DECORATION.
UH, WELL, I SAW IT IN THE DRUG STORE
AND I THOUGHT IT LOOKED CUTE.
I GOT THE WINE.
GREAT, I'LL OPEN IT.
NO, NO, NO, I'LL GET IT.
SCOTCH AND SODA FOR ME, IF YOU HAVE IT.
ACTUALLY, I THINK I MIGHT.
RACHEL, WOULD YOU CARE FOR SOMETHING TO DRINK?
CAN I HAVE SOME WINE?
NO.
I HAVE SODA. OKAY.
MIND IF I TURN ON THE GAME?
OH, UM, MY TELLY'S BROKEN, I'M AFRAID.
DOESN'T WORK?
YEAH.
APPARENTLY, MY NEIGHBOR WAS STEALING HIS CABLE
SO THE COMPANY CAME AND THEY SNAPPED THE WRONG LINE.
ON THANKSGIVING?
NO, NO, THIS WAS A MONTH AGO.
I JUST HAVEN'T HAD TIME
TO RING UP AND COMPLAIN.
NO FOOTBALL?
WE CAN PLAY CHARADES IF YOU LIKE.
LET ME JUST SIT FOR A SECOND, OKAY?
THE CONTRACTIONS ARE TOO CLOSE TOGETHER.
YOU'RE IN ACTIVE LABOR.
OH, GEE, YOU THINK?
I'M SORRY. I'M JUST...
YOU MIGHT HAVE PROGRESSED MORE THAN YOU THINK.
NO... I'M OKAY.
IT JUST HURTS.
HOW DILATED WERE YOU ON YOUR LAST O.B. VISIT?
UH, THREE CENTIMETERS, MONDAY.
ANY BACK PAIN?
YEAH, FOR THE LAST THREE MONTHS.
WORSE LATELY?
THIS MORNING.
OKAY, LET'S GO.
OH, CAN'T I HAVE THE BABIES HERE?
IF YOU WANT TO MAKE THE NEWS.
OH, GOD, THEY FEEL LIKE THEY'RE BETWEEN MY KNEES.
YEAH, THAT'S THE IDEA.
OH, SON OF A BITCH!
OKAY, SIT. SIT HERE. SIT HERE. COME ON.
OKAY, FOCUS.
FOCUS, CAROL... CAROL.
TRY... TRY HUMMING.
HUH? I KNOW IT SOUNDS VERY STRANGE
BUT IT HELPED MY WIFE.
OKAY, JUST HUM LIKE THIS.
( humming )
YEAH. JUST DO IT.
( both humming )
OKAY.
HEY, REMEMBER THAT RENAL FAILURE PATIENT?
FIVE-MINUTE E.T.A.?
LET ME GUESS, DIVERTED TO MERCY?
NOW SHE'S A TRAUMA PATIENT.
SOME GUY PLOWED INTO THE AMBULANCE.
THAT WAS SMART.
HEY, DAVE, GOOD CALL ON THE AKEE FRUIT.
SHE BOUGHT OFF A CURB-SIDE VENDOR.
I WON'T SAY I TOLD YOU SO, BUT...
HOW'D YOU KNOW ABOUT IT?
I'M A GOOD DOCTOR. NO, REALLY.
REALLY. AND I MIGHT HAVE SEEN IT BEFORE.
WHERE? NO, DON'T TELL ME.
YOU, UH, YOU DID THE PEACE CORPS OR SOMETHING?
YEAH. EXACTLY.
I SPENT SOME TIME IN THE JUNGLE.
AND IF YOU'RE NICE TO ME
I'LL EVEN SHOW YOU MY PIRANHA SCARS.
COME ON, WHERE'D YOU SEE IT?
LET'S JUST SAY YOU OWE ME A FAVOR, ALL RIGHT?
WHAT IS THIS? A SECRET?
WHAT? YOU'RE SUDDENLY SENSITIVE, DAVE?
OH, DID YOU, UM, LOSE A PATIENT TO THIS?
FINE. WHATEVER.
I SAW IT IN GRENADA, OKAY?
YOU DID A ROTATION IN GRENADA?
NO, SHERLOCK.
I WENT TO MED SCHOOL IN GRENADA.
OH... OH. YOUR FIRST CHOICE?
I HAD FUN IN COLLEGE, WHAT I CAN REMEMBER OF IT.
MY GRADES SUCKED.
MY MCATs... A LONG STORY
BUT I ALWAYS KNEW I COULD BE A BETTER DOCTOR
THAN THOSE ASS KISSERS WHOSE ONLY HARD-ON
WAS FOR WHAT WAS ON SOME TEST.
GOT YOU. SO, I DID GRENADA.
IT'S THE HARVARD OF THE CARIBBEAN ACTUALLY.
I'M SURE THAT IT IS.
STILL SAYS M.D., CARTER.
SEE? M.D.
I KNOW. I KNOW.
WELL, NOW I CAN APPRECIATE YOU THAT MUCH MORE.
GOOD.
WHAT DID YOU GET ON YOUR MCATs?
ALL RIGHT.
HEY, IT STARTED SNOWING AGAIN.
YEAH. YOU READY?
I THINK SO.
OKAY.
SO, HOW LONG WAS YOUR WIFE IN LABOR?
16 HOURS FOR THE FIRST ONE.
HOW MANY HAS SHE HAD?
TWO, AT DIFFERENT TIMES.
YEAH, WELL.
DO THEY STILL LIVE IN CROATIA?
NO, NOT ANYMORE.
HMM.
OH! WHAT?
OKAY, SIT. SIT DOWN.
DEEP BREATHS. HEY, DON'T WORRY.
IT'S PROBABLY A VAGAL REACTION
TO THE CONTRACTIONS, OKAY?
DEEP BREATHS.
OH... OOH.
I HAVE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM.
WE'RE ALMOST THERE.
NO, I MEAN, I REALLY HAVE TO GO.
WE MUST HURRY. CAN YOU STAND?
WHAT IS IT? WHAT IS IT?
ANOTHER CONTRACTION? ALREADY?
OKAY. OKAY. UH, DON'T PUSH.
DON'T PUSH. LISTEN TO ME, CAROL.
CAROL, DON'T PUSH, OKAY?
CAROL?
CAROL? CAROL?
78-YEAR-OLD WOMAN WITH CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE
IN RESPIRATORY DISTRESS.
MISSED HER DIALYSIS.
ANY OTHER INJURIES FROM THE ACCIDENT?
MAYBE CHEST TRAUMA.
SHE RESPONDED TO TEN LITERS OF O-2
BUT DECOMPENSATED AFTER THE CRASH.
ANYONE ELSE HURT?
THE JERK WHO HIT THEM IS RIGHT BEHIND US.
HE'S FAKING A HEART ATTACK.
KERRY!
OH, MY GOD.
WE NEED A GURNEY OUT HERE!
WHAT HAPPENED?
VAGAL REACTION.
SHE IN LABOR?
OH, YEAH. CONTRACTIONS STARTED ON THE EL.
HOW'S HER PULSE?
A LITTLE WEAK AT 72.
Weaver: CAROL, CAN YOU HEAR ME? CAROL, SQUEEZE MY HAND.
GET A B.P., SHE HAD A SYNCOPAL EPISODE.
HOW FAR APART ARE THE CONTRACTIONS?
ABOUT THREE MINUTES.
ARE THE BABIES MOVING?
ALL DAY LONG.
WHAT'S WRONG WITH HER?
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
WHAT'S OPEN?
TRAUMA ROOMS.
JUST TAKE ME UPSTAIRS
TO LABOR AND DELIVERY.
I WANT TO CHECK YOUR VITALS AND CERVIX.
WHO'S YOUR O.B.?
McLUCAS. PLEASE, KERRY.
JUST TAKE ME UPSTAIRS.
YEAH, IN A MINUTE.
MALIK, CAN YOU PAGE DR. McLUCAS?
IS HE ON THE ON-CALL LIST?
SHE-- O.B. HAS IT.
HEY, DO YOU WANT A FETAL MONITOR?
NO, SHE'S GOING TO CHECK ME...
GET THE DOPPLER SCOPE.
AND THEN I'M GOING UPSTAIRS.
HEY, I CAN USE SOME HELP. I GOT TWO HERE.
LUKA, CAN YOU HELP HIM?
YEAH, UH, SURE. SHOULD I CALL MARK?
HE'S OFF. LUNGS ARE WET.
CAROL, YOU WANT US TO CALL MARK?
NOT MAKING ANY URINE.
WHERE DO YOU WANT THE PERP? NICE AND EASY.
I HOPE IT'S DONE.
I'M NOT USED TO SERVING SO EARLY IN THE AFTERNOON.
WELL, WE NEED TIME TO GORGE OURSELVES
SO THAT WE CAN PASS OUT ON THE COUCH.
IT SAYS 180.
YOU KNOW, YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO DO ALL THIS.
I MEAN, THE TWO OF THEM TOGETHER CAN BE A BIT MUCH.
DON'T BE SILLY.
ALL FAMILIES ARE ECCENTRIC IN THEIR OWN WAY.
I GUESS.
OKAY, EVERYBODY, DINNER IS SERVED.
Rachel: HIT ME.
YOU HAVE 18.
SOFT 18 AGAINST YOUR NINE-- HIT ME.
DINNER'S READY, GUYS.
RACHEL, CAN YOU GET THE MASHED POTATOES?
SMELLS GOOD.
I HOPE IT'S ALL RIGHT.
WHAT'S THAT ON TOP THERE? BACON.
EWW, ON THE TURKEY?
YOU DON'T HAVE IT THAT WAY?
RACHEL, I SAID MASHED POTATOES.
I DIDN'T THINK
YOU CELEBRATED THANKSGIVING.
WELL, IT'S NOT REALLY MY HOLIDAY, IS IT?
THE PILGRIMS CAME HERE TO ESCAPE
PERSECUTION FROM THE BRITISH.
YES. SO THEY COULD GO ABOUT PERSECUTING THE INDIANS.
OKAY, EVERYBODY.
NOW...
I'LL DO THAT.
I GOT IT, DAD.
MARK, I SAID I'D DO IT.
DON'T WORRY. SIT DOWN. RELAX.
MARK DOESN'T THINK I CAN DO THINGS FOR MYSELF ANYMORE.
BE MY GUEST.
DID YOU TELL HER YOU WANT TO PUT ME IN A NURSING HOME?
IT'S A RETIREMENT COMMUNITY.
A RETIREMENT COMMUNITY WITH NURSES.
CAN WE TALK ABOUT THIS LATER?
IT'S ALL YOU WANTED TO TALK ABOUT LAST NIGHT.
( glass breaking )
SORRY.
THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
UH, I THINK I HAVE INSTANT.
( pager beeping )
ARE YOU ON CALL?
NO, NO, IT'S YOURS.
UM, LOOK, LET'S CLEAN THIS UP, SHALL WE?
OKAY, READY AND LIFT.
LUNGS ARE WET, SOME J.V.D.
NOT MAKING ANY URINE.
MRS. OLSON, WHY DID YOU MISS YOUR DIALYSIS?
I WAS HAVING MY HAIR DONE.
OH, IT'S NICE TO LOOK GOOD
BUT YOUR HEALTH SHOULD COME FIRST, HUH?
YOU THINK I LOOK GOOD?
YEAH, BEAUTIFUL.
OH. IT'S FOR MY BIRTHDAY.

YES.
OH. HAPPY BIRTHDAY.
WELL, THANK YOU.
B.P.'s 102/54.

YOU WANT LASIX?
NO. START A NITRO DRIP AND CALL THE DIALYSIS UNIT.
CAN I CALL A FAMILY MEMBER?
NO, THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
OH!
I'M SORRY.
I'M SORRY. STERNAL TENDERNESS.
NOW SEE, THIS IS WHY IDIOTS NEED TO STOP FOR AMBULANCES.
MUFFLED HEART SOUNDS.
CHECK FOR PULSUS PARADOXUS.
HEART?
WHAT'S WRONG WITH MY HEART?
MRS. OLSON, YOU'RE FLUID-OVERLOADED
FROM MISSING YOUR DIALYSIS.
SOME FLUID IS COLLECTING AROUND YOUR HEART.
IT'S PROBABLY FROM THE RENAL FAILURE
BUT IT COULD ALSO BE
AN INJURY FROM THE ACCIDENT.
OH, MY.
ENALOPRIL, 1.25 I.V. PUSH
AND GET ME AN ULTRASOUND.
THEY'RE USING IT NEXT DOOR.

FULLY EFFACED, TWO PLUS STATION.
HALEH, OPEN AN O.B. PACK.

I DON'T WANT TO DELIVER IN THE E.R.
YOU WANT TO DELIVER IN THE ELEVATOR?
HOW CAN I BE TEN CENTIMETERS?
PROBABLY BEEN CONTRACTING ALL DAY.
OH, GOD. CALL PEDES.
LET'S ROTATE THE GURNEY... AND GIVE HER SOME PRIVACY.
NO, NO, NO. NO, KERRY
I'LL JUST HOLD IT, OKAY? I PROMISE.

IT'S A GIRL. CONGRATULATIONS.
HI. HELLO.
OKAY, LET'S CHECK
THE PRESENTATION OF TWIN "B."
YEAH.
IT'S OKAY. IT'S OKAY.
LOOKS LIKE ABOUT SIX POUNDS.
SHE'S SO LITTLE.

BUT THAT'S A GOOD SIZE FOR A TWIN.
OKAY, I HAVE TO TAKE HER NOW, CAROL.
TAKE A GOOD LOOK AT HER.
SHE'S HEALTHY, RIGHT?
SHE'S BEAUTIFUL.
YEAH. OKAY.
OKAY.

HEARD YOU HAD A LITTLE EXCITEMENT DOWNSTAIRS.
ULTRASOUND SHOWED SECOND TWIN IS VERTEX AND HIGH.
JUST RELAX, CAROL.
WE'LL GET YOU THROUGH THIS.
IS THE BAG INTACT?
YES.
HI, MOM. I'M SANDRA.
I HAVE TO TAG YOU AND YOUR BABY
BEFORE I CAN TAKE HER TO THE NURSERY.
CAN'T SHE STAY WITH ME?
Abby: WE'LL GIVE HER A BATH AND BRING HER BACK
AFTER THIS ONE IS DELIVERED.
WHAT IF SHE'S HUNGRY? I'M BREAST-FEEDING.
WELL, WE CAN SUPPLEMENT A LITTLE BIT.
SURE? YES, I'M SURE.
HERE, I NEED YOU TO SCOOT OVER A LITTLE BIT.
NICE AND EASY.
( groans )

THANKS.
35164.
35164. ALL SET.
SAY BYE-BYE, MOMMY.
BYE, HONEY.
BYE.
THANKS, KERRY.
( weak laugh )
ARE THE CONTRACTIONS STILL STRONG?
WELL, THEY'RE A LITTLE SPACED OUT, BUT, YEAH.
WE'LL DO ANOTHER ULTRASOUND
BUT IF THE BABY'S HIGH, IT COULD TAKE A WHILE.
IS DR. McLUCAS ON HER WAY?
Abby: YEAH. WE'RE WORKING ON THAT.
DO YOU WANT AN EPIDURAL?
I CAN STILL HAVE ONE?
ABSOLUTELY.
IF I WASN'T SURE BEFORE, I AM NOW.
WIMP.
MARK.
HEARD I MISSED THE PARTY.
OH, GOD...
I'LL CALL THE ANESTHESIOLOGIST.
MMM.
A GIRL?
MMM, A GIRL.
TROUBLEMAKER ALREADY?
MMM.
YOU HANGING IN THERE?
IT'S BRUTAL, MARK.
ONE DOWN, ONE TO GO.
UH-UH. I QUIT.
I DON'T THINK YOU HAVE MUCH OF A CHOICE.
WELL, YOU KNOW, YOU COULD SHOOT ME.
YEAH, IF IT COMES TO THAT.
OH, I'M SORRY TO PULL YOU AWAY FROM YOUR THANKSGIVING DINNER.
ARE YOU KIDDING?
I'D RATHER BE HERE.
D-DAY, WHOO.
FIVE BEACHES.
THE AMERICANS TAKE UTAH AND...
HERE...
THE POTATOES...
AND OMAHA...
THE SQUASH.
NOW, THE BRITS LAND HERE
AND SHARE JUNO, THE, UH...
THE STUFFING... WITH THE CANUCKS.
THE CANUCKS?
THE CANADIANS.
RIGHT. RIGHT.
ARE YOU WITH ME?
YES, YES, YES, I'M WITH YOU.
ALL THE HEAVY GERMAN RESISTANCE
IS CONCENTRATED ON THE AMERICAN LINES.
MASSIVE CASUALTIES ARE SUFFERED BY THE AMERICANS.
6,000 IN THE FIRST DAY.
THE BRITS HAD THEIR SHARE, TOO, DIDN'T THEY?
SHOULDN'T THE GRAVY GO WITH THE POTATOES?
FINE.
NOW, INSTEAD OF PUSHING FORWARD
AND CUTTING OFF THE GERMANS AT CANNES
MONTGOMERY, THE BRITISH GENERAL...
YES, I KNOW WHO MONTGOMERY IS.
MONTGOMERY SAT ON HIS ASS AND HAD TEA.
I'M GOING TO THE BATHROOM.
WELL, THE BRITISH WERE FIGHTING THE GERMANS
FOR NEARLY THREE YEARS BEFORE THE AMERICANS.
PERHAPS THEY WERE JUST A LITTLE MORE CAUTIOUS.
CAUTIOUS IS ONE WORD FOR IT.
I SUPPOSE TEA-LOVING WOULD BE ANOTHER.
Rachel: THAT'S TWO WORDS!
IT'S A HYPHENATE, ACTUALLY.
WELL, ANYWAY, THE 82nd AIRBORNE DIVISION...
DO YOU HAVE TO USE A STRAIGHT CATH?
THE EPIDURAL NUMBS YOUR BLADDER.
YOU WON'T CONTROL YOUR URINE.
GREAT.
SORRY. WE DO IT FOR EVERYBODY.
NO CATHETER, NO EPIDURAL.
SEEMS LIKE A SMALL PRICE TO PAY, CAROL.
IT'S NOT YOUR BLADDER.
ARE WE DOING THIS?
CAROL?
YES.
ALL RIGHT. ALL SET.
OKAY, CAROL, YOU HAVE TO SIT UP.
( moaning ): OH, CAN'T WE DO IT ON MY SIDE?
NO, IT'S BETTER UPRIGHT WHEN YOU'RE PREGNANT.
I'M A NURSE. TELL ME WHY.
WE GET A CLEAR SHOT AT THE INTERVETEBRAL SPACE.
YOU DON'T WANT HIM FISHING AROUND.
OKAY, COME ON, UP YOU GO.
YOU BETTER GET IT RIGHT THE FIRST TIME.
I GENERALLY DO, IF THE PATIENT COOPERATES.
MARK, YOU SET?
YEAH.
COULD YOU GRAB HER OTHER SHOULDER?
OKAY, CAROL, LEAN INTO US.
A LITTLE BIT MORE.
KEEP YOUR BACK NICE AND ROUND.
( moaning )
AND YOU'LL FEEL A LITTLE PRICK.
CAROL HATHAWAY?
CAROL, IT'S YOU.
DR. COBURN.
MARK... I HAD NO IDEA.
CONGRATULATIONS.
NO, HE'S MY LAMAZE COACH.
OH, I SEE. HOW WE DOING?
SIX CENTIMETERS.
SIX?!
YOU SHRINK DOWN BETWEEN DELIVERIES.
I KNOW, BUT SIX.
AAH!
YOU NEED SOME MORE LOCAL?
OH, NO! CONTRACTIONS.
YOU JUST HOLD ON, CAROL.
YOU'RE DOING GREAT.
CAROL, DR. McLUCAS IS IN WICHITA.
SHE ASKED ME TO COVER HER PRACTICE OVER THANKSGIVING.
IS THAT ALL RIGHT?
I GOT TO LIE DOWN.
HE'S IN THE MIDDLE OF IT RIGHT NOW.
YOU HAVE TO HOLD STILL.
NO, I CAN'T!
YES, YOU CAN. YES, YOU CAN.
HERE, HOLD MY HAND, OKAY?
YOU'RE GOING TO BE MUCH BETTER
ONCE WE GET THROUGH THIS, OKAY?
OH, IT HURTS, MARK!
I KNOW.
NO, I MEAN IT REALLY HURTS!
I KNOW.
HANG IN THERE. HANG IN THERE.
( gasping in pain )
ONE NIGHT, STU AND I WERE ON DECK.
HE ASKED ME FOR A LIGHT, I REACHED IN MY POCKET
AND WHEN I LOOKED UP, HE WAS GONE.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, GONE?
GONE. HE'D FALLEN OVERBOARD.
OH, MY GOD.
DID HE DROWN?
IF THE FALL DIDN'T KILL HIM.
THAT'S TERRIBLE.
YEAH.
ABOUT THE ONLY THING WORSE
THAN THE WORKING CONDITIONS ON THAT CARRIER WAS THE FOOD.
PROBABLY TOOK MORE MEN THAN ANYTHING.
YOU MEAN WORSE THAN THE ENGLISH?
WELL, I WAS KIDDING.
THIS IS GREAT.
I HAVEN'T HAD A MEAL LIKE THIS SINCE...
WELL, FOR A WHILE.
SINCE YOUR WIFE DIED.
YEAH.
I'M SORRY.
I CAN ONLY IMAGINE HOW DIFFICULT IT MUST BE.
AS DIFFICULT AS YOU MAKE IT, I GUESS.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
HOW'S MARK?
YOU KNOW, DEALING WITH IT?
OH...
IN HIS STRIDE, I SUPPOSE.
TO BE HONEST, HE DOESN'T SPEAK OF IT MUCH
AND I'VE LEARNT NOT TO FORCE THE SUBJECT.
THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS HE CARRIES INSIDE.
BUT YOU MUST KNOW THAT.
DON'T ASK ME-- HIS MOTHER WAS THE ONLY ONE
WHO SEEMED TO UNDERSTAND HIM.
HE'S NOT THAT BIG A MYSTERY.
WELL, DON'T GET ME WRONG.
HE'S A GOOD MAN.
IT'S JUST THAT, WITH RUTH GONE...
I DON'T KNOW...
HOW ABOUT SOME PIE?
WITH HIS MOTHER GONE, WHAT?
NOTHING.
JUST SEEMED TO HAVE LOST A BRIDGE, I GUESS.
A BRIDGE?
YEAH.
MAYBE YOU BOTH JUST MISS HER.
I'LL GET SOME PLATES.
HEY, RACHEL! COME GET SOME PIE.
WHAT'S WITH HER?
SHE'S BEEN IN THERE A HALF HOUR.
I'LL CHECK.
RACHEL?
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT IN THERE?
RACHEL?
RACHEL, ARE YOU IN THERE?
GO AWAY!
( TV changes channels )
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR?
I DON'T KNOW.
AM I BORING YOU?
NO!
WANT TO JUST TALK?
SURE.
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT?
I DON'T KNOW.
HEY, THE POST-GAME SHOW'S ON.
WHOO.
HOW YOU FEELING?
I'M IN LOVE WITH THE EPIDURAL MAN.
SOME PEOPLE CALL HIM AN ANESTHESIOLOGIST.
OH, HE WILL ALWAYS BE THE EPIDURAL MAN TO ME.
YOU KNOW, I'M JUST GOING TO GO GET A MAGAZINE.
SO, UH...
I SHOULD CALL ELIZABETH, TOO.
SHE'S PROBABLY CRAWLING OUT ON A LEDGE BY NOW.
HEY, COULD YOU CALL MY MOM?
SURE.
WHAT SHOULD I TELL HER?
WHAT YOU SAID--
ONE DOWN, ONE TO GO.
HER NUMBER'S IN MY ORGANIZER IN MY BAG.
IS THERE ANYBODY ELSE YOU WANT ME TO CALL?
NO, NOT YET.
ARE YOU SURE?
I JUST WANT TO GET THROUGH THIS FIRST.
ALL RIGHT.
( beeping ) WHAT'S WRONG?
NOTHING.
JUST LOSS OF SIGNAL.
WHERE'D IT GO?
HOLD ON.
SANDRA, COULD YOU CALL DR. COBURN AND BRING OVER THE ULTRASOUND?
RIGHT THERE.
GOT IT.
IT'S ABOVE THE UMBILICUS.
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
BABY COULD BE ROTATING.
IT'S FINE. HEART RATE'S 140.
IS AN O.R. CLEAR?
I'LL SEE.
WAIT, I DON'T...
I DON'T NEED A C-SECTION, DO I?
NO, NOT NECESSARILY.
BUT IF THE BABY TURNS BREECH
WE'LL HAVE TO LABOR YOU IN THE O.R.
IT'S JUST A PRECAUTION, CAROL.
OH, MAN.
( post-game show on TV )
WHAT'S GOING ON IN THERE?
SHE STICKING HER FINGER DOWN HER THROAT?
I'M AFRAID SHE'S HAVING HER FIRST MENSTRUAL PERIOD.
MENSTRUAL PERIOD?
SHE'S TEN.
IT CAN HAPPEN AT THAT AGE.
IT'S EARLY BUT NOT ABNORMAL.
ONE OF US NEEDS TO GO TO THE STORE.
DO YOU WANT TO STAY WITH HER
OR SHALL I?
UH, WHAT DO YOU NEED FROM THE STORE?
SANITARY NAPKINS.
YOU DON'T HAVE THAT... STUFF?
I ONLY HAVE TAMPONS, UM...
IT'S NOT REALLY THE BEST FOR A YOUNG GIRL.
OH. RIGHT.
LISTEN, UM...
THERE'S A DRUG STORE JUST ON THE CORNER...
SANITARY NAPKINS.
THAT... THAT'S THE FLAT ONES?
ASK THE CLERK.
MMM.
WHAT IF HE'S A GUY?
HOW ARE WE DOING?
WE'LL MOVE HER RIGHT AFTER THIS CONTRACTION.
BABY'S IN LOTUS POSITION.
WHAT'S THIS FOR?
WE HAVE TO PREP YOU FOR THE O.R.
WHAT, EVEN IF I'M NOT BEING OPERATED ON?
DON'T WORRY. I WON'T TAKE ANY PICTURES.
HA, HA.
UH-OH.

BUT WE'RE GOOD TILL 80, RIGHT?
RELAX, CAROL, I HAVE TO CHECK YOU AGAIN.
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR?
HOLD ON. I HAVE TO WAIT TILL THIS CONTRACTION FINISHES.
Sandra: SEVENTY-FIVE.
WHAT'S WRONG?
DAMN IT. SHE'S GOT A PROLAPSED CORD.
Hathaway: PROLAPSED?
THE CORD GETS PUSHED OUT BEFORE THE BABY.
CUTTING OFF THE OXYGEN?
STAT PAGE COBURN TO THE O.R., PLEASE?
ALL RIGHT, SINGLE HEART RATE 65.
WE HAVE TO GET THIS BABY OUT NOW.
SHE'S ONLY SIX CENTIMETERS.
WE'LL HAVE TO CRASH C-SECTION.
OH, MY GOD!
THE O.R.'s NOT CLEAR YET.
WELL, WE'RE GOING.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
I'M KEEPING THE BABY OFF ITS CORD.
THIS CAN'T BE HAPPENING. THIS ISN'T HAPPENING.
JUST TRY AND STAY CALM, OKAY?
MARK, DON'T LET THIS HAPPEN.
DON'T WORRY, I AM RIGHT HERE, OKAY?
NOW KEEP BREATHING.
IS THE BABY HYPOXIC?
WE'RE OKAY. HEART RATE?
WE'RE NOT ON A MONITOR.
WHAT HAPPENED? PROLAPSED CORD.
HEART RATE'S IN THE 60s.
SCRUB IN, ABBY.
HER HAND'S ON THE CORD. GET SOMEBODY ELSE.
I'VE GOT IT, DR. GREENE.
DON'T LET GO.
WANT TO ASSIST ON A C-SECTION?
NOT REALLY. THEN I NEED TEN SECONDS
FOR HER TO SCRUB IN.
TAKE OVER, SANDRA.
OKAY, EVERYBODY, ON MY COUNT.
NICE AND EASY.
ONE, TWO, THREE.
ALL RIGHT, GET YOUR HAND ON THAT CORD.
MARK, YOU GOT TO SAVE THE BABY.
WE WILL.
NO, PROMISE ME.
I PROMISE. ( shrieks )
I GOT IT. LET'S PREP HER FAST.
OKAY, WHERE'S ANESTHESIA?
I JUST PAGED HIM.

DAMN ICE. I SLIPPED.
IT WAS A PRETTY BAD SPILL.
I SAW IT FROM HERE.

STARTED HER PERIOD.
YOU GOT THIS?
UH, YES.
THANKS FOR BUZZING ME.
RIGHT, WE NEED TO GET YOU TO HOSPITAL AND STITCH THAT UP.
LIKE HELL. IT WILL STOP BLEEDING WITH A LITTLE PRESSURE.
THAT'S A NASTY GASH.

WE DON'T HAVE TEN MINUTES.
OPEN A HYSTERECTOMY TRAY.
A WHAT?
HOLD ON. ARE WE THERE YET?
CAROL, YOUR UTERUS IS ATONIC.
IT'S NOT FIRMING. YOU'RE LOSING LOTS OF BLOOD
IN SPITE OF ALL THE MEDICATION WE'RE GIVING YOU.
DON'T DO A HYSTERECTOMY.
WE MAY NOT HAVE A CHOICE.
NO, DON'T, PLEASE.
MARK.
WHAT ELSE CAN WE DO?
UTERUS IS STILL BOGGY.
ANOTHER 500cc's OF BLOOD LOSS.
OKAY, BOVIE. THERE MUST BE SOMETHING SHORT
OF A HYSTERECTOMY.
YES, LOSING THE PATIENT.
CAN'T YOU CLAMP OFF AN ARTERY?
PLEASE STEP OUT, DR. GREENE.
AT LEAST TRY IT. IT'S ONLY 30 SECONDS.
YES, 30 SECONDS SHE MAY NOT HAVE.
Greene: SHE DOESN'T WANT IT.
