HEY.
DOUG...
HI.
WHAT TIME IS IT, HUH?
IT'S ALMOST 6:00.
IT'S VERY STRONG.
HOW'S RICKY?
HE'S STILL ALIVE.
HOW'S JOI?
SHE'S NOT SO GOOD.
IT'S AMAZING HE MADE IT THROUGH THE NIGHT.
I'VE GOT TO GET TO WORK.
WHAT TIME'S YOUR SHIFT?
7:00.
I'LL SEE YOU THERE.
DOUG...
HMM?
THANKS.
FOR WHAT?
FOR STAYING LAST NIGHT.
HEY.
I LOVE THIS TIME OF NIGHT, JUST BEFORE DAWN.
SO QUIET, PEACEFUL.
WHEN THEY'RE BABIES
IS THE BEST TIME.
YOU COMPLAIN ABOUT IT
BUT IT'S WHEN YOU'RE CLOSEST TO THEM--
SINGING TO THEM IN THE DARK AND NURSING.
DID YOU GET ANY SLEEP?
I MUST HAVE.
I CLOSED MY EYES FOR A MOMENT AND HE WAS LAUGHING.
HE WAS GETTING UP TO GO TO SCHOOL.
HE WAS KIDDING ME ABOUT HOW MUCH I WORRY.
HE ALWAYS USED TO DO THAT.
TRY TO CHEER ME UP, MAKE ME LAUGH.
( Ricky moaning )
OH, GOD.
WHEN WAS HIS LAST BOOSTER?
ABOUT AN HOUR AGO.
THEY WON'T GIVE ME ANY MORE.
MOMMY...
GO BACK TO SLEEP, SWEETHEART.
I'M THIRSTY.
I'LL GET YOU A DRINK OF WATER, OKAY?
( wheezing )
IT'S OKAY, BUDDY.
I'LL TAKE CARE OF YOU.
( wheezing subsides )
( beeping )
I INCREASED THE DILAUDID.
IT'S GOING TO MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR HIM TO BREATHE.
I...
I DON'T KNOW HOW...
HOW MUCH MORE OF THIS I CAN TAKE.
WOULD YOU PLEASE...
HELP US?
PLEASE.
I...
I CAN'T WATCH HIM SUFFER ANYMORE.
HE'S SUFFERED ENOUGH.
NO MORE.
NO MORE.
Man: You know about the storm.
It was out west. It's heading our way.
AH, MAN.
I'M SUPPOSED TO BE GOING ICE FISHING TONIGHT.
ICE FISHING?
AL AND I ARE SUPPOSED TO BE DRIVING TO WISCONSIN TO SKI.
SKIING IN WISCONSIN? THAT'S AN OXYMORON.
NO, CROSS-COUNTRY.
YOU SHOULD TRY IT. IT'S GREAT EXERCISE.
YOU'RE THE MORON.
SITTING ON LAKE MICHIGAN
IN THE MIDDLE OF WINTER WITH YOUR LITTLE POLE.
"OXYMORON." IT'S A FIGURE OF SPEECH
IN WHICH OPPOSITE OR CONTRADICTORY
TERMS OR IDEAS ARE COMBINED.
I KNOW WHAT IT MEANS.
I JUST THINK YOU'RE A FOOL
FOR FREEZING YOUR BUTT OFF OUT ON A LAKE.
WHO GAVE HIM THAT DAMN "IMPROVE YOUR VOCABULARY" CALENDAR IN THE FIRST PLACE?
I DID. BROADENS HIS HORIZONS.
WHAT'S TODAY'S WORD, JERRY?
TODAY'S WORD IS...
"RATIO... CINATION."
OH, YEAH, THAT'S GOING TO COME IN HANDY
IN DAILY CONVERSATION.
HAS ANYONE SEEN CAROL?
IT'S RATIOCINATION.
AND IT'S TO RECKON, TO REASON
ESPECIALLY TO REASON USING FORMAL LOGIC.
JESUIT HIGH SCHOOL.
HATHAWAY'S IN SUTURES.
Greene: ROCKET ROMANO?
YEAH, IT'S ONLY TEMPORARY
UNTIL YOUR COMMITTEE FINDS A PERMANENT DEPARTMENT HEAD.
WHY ROMANO?
WHAT? WHAT ABOUT ROMANO?
ANSPAUGH'S MADE HIM ACTING CHIEF.
OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE?
HEY, I'M NOT HAPPY ABOUT IT EITHER.
HE'S AN EGOTISTICAL, ARROGANT, MEAN-SPIRITED
SEXIST LITTLE BULLET-HEAD.
GOOD MORNING, DOCTORS.
NEWS OF MY RECENT APPOINTMENT
PRECEDES ME, I TAKE IT?
WHAT, NO POPPING OF CHAMPAGNE?
NO TICKER TAPE?
EXCUSE ME. I HAVE A PATIENT.
LOOKING FORWARD TO WORKING TOGETHER AGAIN, MAGGIE.
I TOOK THE LIBERTY OF REASSIGNING A FEW MINOR TASKS.
GREENE, YOU'LL HANDLE CHART REVIEW
RESIDENT AND MEDICAL STUDENT SUPERVISION
TIME CARD SCHEDULING AND ANY PATIENT COMPLAINTS.
DR. WEAVER...
JOINT COMMISSION REPORT IS DUE.
AND I'D LIKE A WEEKLY CENSUS
DIVIDED INTO SURGERY, PEDES AND MEDICINE.
I'D ALSO LIKE A DAILY LIST
OF CONSULTS AND THEIR OUTCOMES.
YOU'LL SIT ON THE BUDGET COMMITTEE
AND HANDLE BILLING QUESTIONS AND INSURANCE APPROVALS.
WHAT DO YOU DO?
I SUPERVISE YOU.
DELEGATION-- ONE OF THE EIGHT HALLMARKS
OF EFFECTIVE LEADERSHIP, OR DIDN'T YOU
READ THAT BOOK?
WELL, IF YOU NEED ME, I'LL BE IN SURGERY.
OH, UM...
BULLET-HEAD.
I'M OFFENDED.
AREN'T YOU, DR. GREENE?
DEEPLY, DEEPLY WOUNDED
BY YOUR CALLOUS AND UNCARING REMARK.
IN FACT, I MIGHT HAVE TO START AN INVESTIGATION
AND INTERVIEW OTHERS WHO MIGHT HAVE BEEN HURT
BY YOUR VICIOUS INVECTIVE
IN THE PAST.
THIS IS GOING TO BE FUN.
DOUG.
JUST GET HIS COAT AND SWEATER OFF.
I'LL BE RIGHT IN.
THAT TWO-YEAR-OLD
EATS NOTHING BUT FRENCH FRIES AND PIZZA.
THE MOM DOESN'T UNDERSTAND WHY HE'S CONSTIPATED.
SO HOW WAS RICKY WHEN YOU LEFT?
ALIVE.
I BETTER GET GOING.
I'M BEHIND ALREADY.
LUNCH?
SURE.
YOU SURE LOOK BEAUTIFUL.
HOW DO YOU DO THAT WITHOUT ANY SLEEP?
GOOD GENES.
YOU LOOK LIKE HELL.
( chuckles )
IT'S A CHICK FLICK.
IT'S ROMANTIC.
ISN'T IT, LIKE, FOUR HOURS LONG?
YEAH, BUT THE SPECIAL EFFECTS ARE GREAT.
KATE WINSLET GETS NAKED.
OH, WELL, THAT'S ENCOURAGING.
WHAT YOU GOT?
FENDER BENDER. TENDER ABDOMEN.
YOU EVER SEEN TITANIC, CARTER?
NOPE. CHICK FLICK.
THAT'S WHAT I SAID.
LUCY JUST RENTED IT.
WANTS ME TO WATCH IT WITH HER.
LEONARDO DiCAPRIO, HOOPSKIRTS AND TRAGIC LOVE
IS MY IDEA OF HELL ON EARTH.
YOU GUYS ARE NEANDERTHALS.
WHATEVER HAPPENED TO THE SENSITIVE '90s MALE--
THE ONES WHO LOVE ROMANTIC DINNERS AND CANDLELIGHT?
THEY'RE ALL GAY, AREN'T THEY, CARTER?
EVERY LAST ONE.
I DON'T WANT TO RUIN THE MOVIE FOR YOU, DALE
BUT IN THE END, THE SHIP SINKS.
I HATE YOU BOTH.
NICE PACKAGE, HUH?
SO YOU TWO GETTING SERIOUS?
SHE IS.
UM... HAVE YOU TWO...?
CONSUMMATED?
I COULDN'T DISCUSS IT IF I HAD.
I WOULDN'T WANT TO DAMAGE LUCY'S REPUTATION.
TELL YOU THIS MUCH, THOUGH--
THONGS.
DON'T TAKE MY WORD FOR IT.
WHEN THE LIGHTING'S RIGHT, YOU CAN SEE THROUGH HER SCRUBS.
"E"... "S"...
MAKE IT A LITTLE ROUNDER.
YEAH. "E."
REESE.
THAT'S HARD.
YOU'LL GET THE HANG OF IT.
HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE?
OH, IT DEPENDS ON HOW MUCH YOU PRACTICE.
YOU'RE LEARNING A NEW LANGUAGE.
REESE IS ALREADY GETTING IT.
HE'S A KID. IT'S EASIER.
HE WANTS TO COMMUNICATE.
YEAH.
THAT'S IT FOR TODAY.
UM... HOW OFTEN SHOULD WE...?
YOU AND ME?
I WOULD RECOMMEND THREE TIMES A WEEK.
150 BUCKS A WEEK?
THERE'S GOOD VIDEOS AVAILABLE
BUT I THINK ONE ON ONE IS BETTER.
MR. EKABO, HOW ARE YOU?
FINE.
HOW DID IT GO AT THE UROLOGIST?
DID YOU SEE THE DOCTOR?
YEAH, EVERYTHING'S GOOD NOW.
IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT A PROCEDURE
OR WHAT THE DOCTOR'S TELLING YOU
I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER THEM.
NO QUESTIONS.
YOU DIDN'T GO SEE THE UROLOGIST
DID YOU, MR. EKABO?
WHY NOT?
I'VE NOT TOLD MY WIFE ABOUT MY NEEDING A DOCTOR.
SHE WILL BE FRIGHTENED.
WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO EXPLAIN IT TO HER?
YOU WILL DO THAT?
I'D BE HAPPY TO.
Malik: DR. GREENE, WE'VE GOT
AN EIGHT-YEAR-OLD COMING IN, FULL ARREST.
HOW LONG?
COMING UP NOW.
BRING YOUR WIFE AROUND.
WE'LL TALK.
THEN WE CAN GO AHEAD AND SET UP THAT UROLOGIST APPOINTMENT.
OKAY?
WHERE'S THAT BAD-ASS SNOW WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE GETTING?
IT'S SUMMERTIME OUT HERE.
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY--
IT'S THE CALM BEFORE THE STORM.
EIGHT-YEAR-OLD MALE
FOUND UNRESPONSIVE IN BED AT HOME.
ASYSTOLE, BEGAN CPR IN THE FIELD.
JOI?
WHAT DO WE GOT?
END-STAGE A.L.D. HE'S DOUG'S PATIENT.
HOW LONG'S HE BEEN DOWN?
Man: DON'T KNOW.
WE SCOOPED HIM UP 15 MINUTES AGO.
HE WASN'T EXPECTED TO MAKE IT THROUGH THE NIGHT.
HIS MOTHER WANTED HIM TO DIE AT HOME.
JOI, WHY DID YOU CALL THE PARAMEDICS?
Joi: I DIDN'T.
MRS. ABBOTT, DO YOU WANT US
TO USE EXTRAORDINARY MEASURES TO KEEP YOUR SON ALIVE?
NO, I DON'T.
BUT I DO.
Greene: WHO ARE YOU?
RICKY'S FATHER.
SIR, YOUR SON IS AT THE END STAGES
OF A PAINFUL TERMINAL ILLNESS.
EXTENDING HIS LIFE WILL PROLONG HIS AGONY.
DOCTOR, PLEASE DON'T LET HIM DIE.
INTUBATION KIT.
Ross: HER LEG ISN'T BROKEN...
DOUG, I NEED YOU.
THEY'RE MUCH TOUGHER THAN YOU THINK.
YEAH?
RICKY ABBOTT'S BACK
AND HIS FATHER IS INSISTING WE TRY AND RESUSCITATE HIM.
HIS FATHER?
CAROL, WHAT MEDS IS HE ON?
WHERE'S CAROL?
Chuny: SHE LEFT TO GO GET DOUG.
Joi: HE'S ON DILAUDID FOR THE PAIN.
TWO MILLIGRAMS OF NARCAN.
CHUNY, WHY DON'T YOU TAKE
MR. AND MRS. ABBOTT TO CHAIRS.
WHAT'S GOING ON?
MR. ABBOTT ASKED US TO TRY
TO RESUSCITATE HIS SON.
STILL FLAT LINE.
ATROPINE AND TWO OF EPI.
HE SHOULDN'T HAVE MADE IT THROUGH THE NIGHT.
WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?
DR. ROSS. HE WAS IN MY CARE...
SON OF A BITCH!
Greene: GET HIM OUT OF HERE!
GET HIM OUT OF HERE!
GET YOUR HANDS OFF ME!
Weaver: STILL FLAT LINE.
PLEASE.
PLEASE.
SORRY, MR. ABBOTT.
TIME OF DEATH, 9:42.
( sobbing )
YOU'RE GOING TO NEED A COUPLE OF SUTURES.
WANT ME TO GET PLASTICS DOWN HERE?
YOU CAN DO IT.
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT ALL ABOUT?
I HAVE NO IDEA.
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THERE WAS A FATHER.
IS HE GOING TO BE OKAY?
COUPLE OF STITCHES ADD TO HIS RUGGED CHARM.
WHERE'S MIKE TYSON?
HE WENT TO MAKE A PHONE CALL.
TOOK THE LITTLE GIRL WITH HIM.
DID JOI EVER MENTION
THERE WAS A FATHER IN THE PICTURE?
SHE TOLD ME THEY WERE SEPARATED.
YOU WENT DOWN LIKE A BRICK.
CHEAP SHOT.
GUY CAUGHT ME OFF-BALANCE.
I DIDN'T REALIZE YOU HAD SUCH A GLASS JAW.
CHILD SUPPORT, MY MED SCHOOL LOANS--
MAN, I DON'T KNOW HOW I'M GOING TO SHAKE IT.
Corday: AND HOW MUCH DO YOU HAVE TO PAY IN SCHOOL LOANS?
UH, OVER 120 GRAND.
OH, THAT'S BARBARIC!
PAYMENT'S $700 A MONTH.
THAT'S A QUARTER OF MY TAKE-HOME PAY.
MONEY WOES, PETER?
EVERY RESIDENT'S CHIEF COMPLAINT.
I'LL NEVER UNDERSTAND THIS COUNTRY'S INSISTENCE
ON FORCING ITS HIGHLY TRAINED RESIDENTS
TO LIVE IN ABJECT POVERTY.
SLAVE LABOR.
ONLY WAY THE PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM CAN AFFORD
TO PROVIDE CARE FOR ALL THE FREELOADERS.
BY FREELOADERS, YOU MEAN
PEOPLE WITHOUT EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES, JOB TRAINING
CHILDREN AND THE INFIRM.
LIKE I SAID
FREELOADERS.
YOU'RE A DESPICABLE HUMAN BEING.
DO YOU KNOW THAT?
SO, HAVING TROUBLE MAKING ENDS MEET?
THINGS ARE A LITTLE TIGHT.
WHY DON'T YOU DO WHAT I DID?
APPLY TO A LOCUM TENENS PROGRAM.
A "LOCUM" WHAT?
TENENS. FILLING IN FOR VACATIONING SURGEONS
IN RURAL HOSPITALS IN MINNESOTA, THE DAKOTAS
ON YOUR VACATION.
THESE PLACES DON'T HAVE ENOUGH STAFF
TO COVER WHEN SOMEBODY'S OUT
AND THEY PAY YOU A BUNDLE TO STEP IN.
OH, YEAH? WHAT'S A BUNDLE?
EIGHT, TEN GRAND FOR A COUPLE WEEKS.
WHERE'S THE BIG STORM?
SHOULD BE ANY MINUTE NOW.
THEY'RE CLOSING ALL THOSE SCHOOLS AT LUNCH
RECOMMENDING PEOPLE LEAVE EARLY.
THEY REALLY EMPHASIZED THAT LAST POINT--
THE IMPORTANCE OF PEOPLE LEAVING EARLY
SO THEY CAN GET HOME SAFELY.
NO, JERRY.
THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE IS SAYING...
I SAID NO.
SPOKE WITH ANSPAUGH THIS MORNING.
HE SAID IT MIGHT BE MONTHS BEFORE WE GET
A NEW CHIEF.
MONTHS WITH ROMANO?
DID WE DO SOMETHING HEINOUS
IN A PAST LIFE TO DESERVE THIS?
THERE'S VIKING IN MY FAMILY.
MAYBE I RAPED AND PILLAGED NORTHERN EUROPE.
PILLAGED? COOL.
YOU MUST HAVE LOOKED GREAT
IN ONE OF THOSE BIG HORNED HATS.
MAYBE YOU SHOULD CONSIDER
REAPPLYING FOR THE CHIEF'S JOB.
ONCE FOOLISH, TWICE STUPID.
DON MIGHT ENTERTAIN RENEWED INTEREST.
I SPOKE TO HIM ABOUT YOU THIS MORNING.
REALLY? OH, GOD, I DON'T KNOW
IF I COULD GO THROUGH ALL THAT AGAIN.
CAN I AT LEAST TELL HIM THAT YOU SEEMED INTERESTED?
HOW ABOUT INTRIGUED?
EXCUSE ME.
I'M LOOKING FOR MR. ABBOTT.
WHO? RICHARD ABBOTT.
HIS SON RICKY DIED HERE THIS MORNING.
HI, I'M DR. GREENE.
I WAS WITH MR. ABBOTT EARLIER
BUT I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM AROUND.
I'M DAN SULLIVAN.
I WORK WITH RICHARD
DOWN AT THE STATE ATTORNEY'S OFFICE.
HE'S ASKED US TO OPEN AN INVESTIGATION
INTO THE CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING HIS SON'S DEATH.
HAVE THE POLICE ARRIVED YET?
HEY.
HOW ARE YOU?
I'M FINE.
I'M SORRY RICHARD HIT YOU.
WE'VE BEEN SEPARATED SINCE MICHAEL DIED.
I CALLED HIM YESTERDAY TO TELL HIM THAT RICKY...
THAT, THAT HE SHOULD PROBABLY TRY TO COME SEE HIM.
HE WAS AT A CONFERENCE IN HOUSTON
SO I LEFT A MESSAGE
AND WHEN HE ARRIVED THIS MORNING
AND SAW THAT RICKY WAS GONE, HE KIND OF LOST IT.
HE JUST WASN'T READY.
JOI...
IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO LET THE NURSES
FINISH UP WITH RICKY.
YOU MADE ARRANGEMENTS FOR HIM?
OH, UH...
I-I THINK I'LL GO TO THE SAME FUNERAL HOME
THAT TOOK CARE OF MICHAEL.
I'LL CALL THEM.
GIVE ME THE NUMBER.
I'LL CALL.
THANKS.
DOUG, GOT A MOMENT?
YEAH.
WHAT'S UP?
THE POLICE ARE HERE.
MR. ABBOTT IS ACCUSING YOU OF MURDERING HIS SON.
SHE WAS HIT IN THE FACE WHILE KICKBOXING.
NOT KICKBOXING. TAE-BO CLASS.
IT'S LIKE AEROBICS, BUT ONLY BETTER.
I HEARD ABOUT THAT.
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE GOOD FOR LOSING WEIGHT.
YEAH, I LOST 16 POUNDS.
16 POUNDS, WOW.
I HAD EVERYBODY IN THE CLASS SPREAD OUT ENOUGH
BUT THIS NEW GUY SHOWS UP
AND SHE GOT KICKED.
DID YOU LOSE CONSCIOUSNESS?
NO, BUT I WAS PRETTY DIZZY.
HOW LONG DID IT TAKE TO LOSE THE WEIGHT?
JUST MELTED OFF.
HOPE THIS WON'T KEEP ME FROM GETTING BACK TO CLASS.
FUNDUS IS SHARP.
NO PAPILLEDEMA.
WANT TO PALPATE THE ORBIT?
NO, THAT'S OKAY.
IS IT EXPENSIVE?
NOT TOO BAD.
IT'S WORTH IT.
YOU FEEL THIS?
MM, YES.
NO. ANY NUMBNESS?
DO YOU HAVE EARLY CLASSES?
I HAVE TO BE HERE BY 7:00.
ANY VISUAL CHANGES?
SHAPES, THINGS OUT OF FOCUS?
I TEACH A 5:30 CLASS. IF YOU BUY 20
YOU GET FIVE FREE.
NO KIDDING?
KNOW WHERE A PHONE IS?
THERE'S A PAY PHONE OVER THERE.
NO STEP OFF.
I'M CONCERNED ABOUT YOUR BLURRED VISION
SO LET'S GET SOME FACIAL FILMS
AND A VISUAL ACUITY.
LUCY, IF YOU CAN TEAR YOURSELF AWAY
FROM FITNESS BARGAIN HUNTING
FOR FIVE MINUTES, STITCH HER UP.
YOUR WISH IS MY COMMAND, DR. CARTER.
IRRIGATE AND SUTURE.
I DON'T USUALLY GET A LUNCH BREAK, SO I END UP EATING
OUT OF THE VENDING MACHINES
AND IT'S HARD TO KEEP THE POUNDS OFF.
FIRST LIDOCAINE
TO NUMB THE AREA AND THEN YOU'LL FEEL
A LITTLE BIT OF WETNESS AS I IRRIGATE THE WOUND.
DR. CARTER.
YEAH.
UH, THE CUT'S PRETTY DEEP.
SHOULD I DO A FEW SUBCUTANEOUS FIRST?
YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.
WELL, I'LL CHECK BACK WITH YOU IN A LITTLE BIT.
WAS HE STARING AT MY ASS?
HMM.
CORONER'S COMING OVER
TO GET THE BODY AND DO AN AUTOPSY.
ROGER JULIAN'S COMING DOWN FROM GENETICS.
HE'S HOPPING MAD.
SAYS RICKY WAS ON HIS SERVICE.
WANTS TO KNOW WHERE THE HELL
THE MOTHER GOT DILAUDID AND A P.C.A. MACHINE.
THE BOY WAS DYING.
YOU PROMISED KERRY AND I THAT YOU WOULDN'T PRESCRIBE
ANY MORE CLASS TWO NARCOTICS.
HE WAS IN EXCRUCIATING PAIN.
YOU PROMISED US YESTERDAY!
THE MOTHER WAS BEGGING ME.
WHERE'D YOU GET THE MACHINE?
GENETICS DIDN'T PRESCRIBE IT.
I KNOW WE DIDN'T.
I GOT IT FROM CAROL'S CLINIC.
COME HERE.
CAROL'S CLINIC DOESN'T HAVE P.C.A.s.
SHE CALLED IN A FAVOR.
GOT IT FROM ONE OF HER SUPPLIERS.
THE POLICE ARE ON THEIR WAY
TO JOI ABBOTT'S HOUSE RIGHT NOW.
THEY HAVE A WARRANT TO IMPOUND THE P.C.A.
ARE THEY GOING TO FIND ANYTHING OUT OF THE ORDINARY?
LIKE WHAT?
LIKE THE MACHINE
SET TO ADMINISTER ENOUGH DILAUDID
TO KILL TEN GROWN MEN?
I DON'T KNOW.
YOU DON'T KNOW?!
YOU SET IT!
THIS BOY WAS SUFFERING, MARK.
END-STAGE A.L.D.
IN AGONY.
THE MOTHER WAS WATCHING THIS CHILD DIE.
DID YOU HELP HIM ALONG?
I GAVE THE MOTHER THE CODE.
I SHOWED HER HOW TO CHANGE THE DOSAGE.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT SHE DID.
YOU WOULD HAVE DONE THE SAME THING
IF YOU WERE THERE.
ANSPAUGH'S COMING DOWN WITH ROMANO AND JULIAN.
DOUG PRESCRIBED THE P.C.A. MACHINE AND THE DILAUDID
THROUGH CAROL'S CLINIC.
WHAT? WHEN?
RIGHT AFTER HE TOLD US HE WOULDN'T.
UH!
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO TELL ANSPAUGH
ABOUT DOUG VIOLATING THE PAIN-STUDY PROTOCOL
AND OUR COVERING IT UP.
THEY'RE GOING TO SCRUTINIZE
EVERYTHING HE'S PRESCRIBED, MARK.
IT'S BOUND TO COME OUT.
WHAT THE HELL'S WRONG WITH YOU?!
WE TRUSTED YOU AND YOU IMMEDIATELY CHOOSE
TO BETRAY THAT TRUST.
I'M DONE DEFENDING YOU.
DEFENDING ME?
YOU'VE TRIED TO NAIL ME FOR YEARS.
I DON'T NAIL COLLEAGUES.
YOU WANT TO DESTROY YOUR OWN CAREER
THAT'S FINE
BUT YOU STAY THE HELL AWAY FROM MINE.
HAVE YOU CALLED AN ATTORNEY?
I DON'T NEED AN ATTORNEY.
IT WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO, MARK.
Man: GO AHEAD AND TAKE HIM OUT.
RICKY HAD A DEGENERATIVE GENETIC DISORDER.
HIS BROTHER DIED OF THE SAME DISEASE
SEVERAL YEARS AGO.
I HAVE A 16-YEAR-OLD.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'D DO UNDER SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCES.
LOOK, I KNOW MR. ABBOTT IS UPSET
BUT HIS SON DIED.
THERE'S NOTHING DR. ROSS
OR ANY OTHER PHYSICIAN COULD DO ABOUT IT.
THIS P.C.A. MACHINE--
IT DELIVERS PAIN MEDICATION TO THE PATIENT?
A STEADY DOSE THROUGH AN I.V.
CAN THE PATIENT OR THE PATIENT'S PARENT
PROGRAM THE MACHINE TO INCREASE THE DOSAGE
IF THE PATIENT IS STILL IN PAIN?
NO. THEY CAN GIVE A BOOSTER EVERY HOUR
BUT THEY NEED A KEY OR A CODE
TO CHANGE THE DOSAGE.
THAT WAY THEY CAN'T SCREW IT UP.
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT, SO I WAS SURPRISED
WHEN MRS. ABBOTT TOLD HER HUSBAND
DR. ROSS HAD GIVEN HER THE CODE
AND SHOWED HER HOW TO CHANGE THE DOSAGE
BEFORE HE LEFT.
WHY DO YOU THINK HE WOULD DO THAT?
Anspaugh: YOU TWO TOOK IT UPON YOURSELVES
TO COVER UP A SERIOUS BREACH OF A FEDERALLY FUNDED PROGRAM?
Weaver: WE THOUGHT IT WAS IN THE HOSPITAL'S BEST INTEREST
TO KEEP THE INCIDENT FROM BECOMING PUBLIC.
WELL, IT'S GOING TO GO PUBLIC NOW
AND IN CONNECTION WITH A HIGH-PROFILE EUTHANASIA CASE.
WHERE THE HELL DID ROSS GET A P.C.A.?
Greene: FROM THE CLINIC.
GOD, WHAT A FIASCO!
WHAT ABOUT ROSS?
TAKE HIM OUT BACK AND SHOOT HIM.
WE'LL CONVENE A MEETING
OF THE DISCIPLINARY COMMITTEE IMMEDIATELY
AND BEGIN AN INVESTIGATION.
BEGIN THAT PROCESS BUT DON'T CONCLUDE IT
UNTIL WE KNOW WHETHER THE FATHER'S GOING TO SUE.
SO ROSS KEEPS WORKING?
YOU CAN HAVE HIM
DISPENSE ASPIRIN IF YOU WANT TO.
I DON'T CARE.
BUT DON'T TAKE ANY FURTHER ACTION.
WHAT ABOUT HATHAWAY'S CLINIC?
CLOSE IT.
ALL RIGHT, PUBLIC RELATIONS WILL HANDLE
ALL THE PRESS INQUIRIES
AND DR. ROMANO AND I WILL TALK TO THE STAFF
AND MAKE SURE THEY COOPERATE WITH THE POLICE FULLY.
THAT'S IT.
KERRY, MARK.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.
WHEN THE DUST SETTLES
I WILL PERSONALLY CHAIR
AN INVESTIGATION INTO THIS MATTER
AND THE APPROPRIATE DISCIPLINARY ACTION
WILL BE TAKEN.
AND ON A MORE PERSONAL NOTE...
I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER BEEN MORE DISAPPOINTED
IN TWO PEOPLE IN MY LIFE.
KERRY, SORRY THIS...
I THINK I JUST BEAT IT IN.
THE ROADS ARE GETTING REALLY SLICK.
TOOK ME FOREVER TO NAVIGATE THE KENNEDY.
TRAFFIC WAS BACKED UP FOR MILES.
WHAT'S THE MATTER, SOMEBODY DIE?
SOMEBODY WE KNOW?
DR. ROSS LOST THAT A.L.D. KID.
THE POLICE ARE IN TRAUMA TWO.
THE BOY'S FATHER ACCUSED DOUG OF GIVING HIM AN OVERDOSE--
CALLED THE COPS. OH, MY GOD.
CORONERS TOOK THE BODY.
POLICE ARE INTERVIEWING EVERYBODY.
WHERE'S DOUG? IN THE PEDES ROOM.
CHUNY, HAVE YOU SEEN THE LABS ON THAT DRUNK WITH THE HEAD LAC?
NO, BUT HE MANAGED TO THROW UP ON ME AGAIN.
THIRD SCRUB TOP TODAY.
YEAH, WE SHOULD WIRE A BUCKET TO HIS HEAD
LIKE ONE OF THOSE FEEDBAGS FOR HORSES.
YEAH, RIGHT. HEY, ANY WORD ON DOUG ROSS?
UH, POLICE ARE STILL INTERVIEWING DR. GREENE.
HAVE YOU SEEN LUCY?
DR. EDSON KEEPS CALLING LOOKING FOR HER.
LAST TIME I SAW HER SHE WAS WORKING...
HEY, WHERE'S MY KICKBOXER?
DR. WEAVER MOVED HER INTO EXAM TWO
WHEN THAT RULE-OUT M.I. CAME IN.
LUCY WAS STILL WORKING ON HER ABOUT TEN MINUTES AGO.
SUTURING? YEP.
THAT SHOULD'VE TAKEN TWO MINUTES.
I HAVEN'T SEEN HER COME OUT.
...TWO, THREE, FOUR... MY HEART'S REALLY PUMPING.
FIVE... SIX...
SEVEN, EIGHT, AND...
OH, MAN...
DR. CARTER, ARE YOU OKAY?
DON'T MOVE, DON'T MOVE.
CHUNY, BACKBOARD AND A HARD COLLAR.
( coughs ) WELL, I DON'T SEE ANY OTHER BLOOD.
NICE KICK. DAMN.
WHAT HAPPENED, MAN?
I KICKED HIM IN THE CHEST. WHY?
I WAS PRACTICING MY TAE-BO.
WE'RE GOING TO ROLL HIM...
BACK UNDER THERE. ONE...
WAIT...
GREAT. ROLL BACK.
ON MY COUNT-- ONE, TWO, THREE.
SO IT'S GOOD, HUH?
OH, IT'S TERRIFIC.
I'M DEFINITELY GOING.
MAYBE I'LL COME WITH YOU.
HEY, DOUG, I JUST HEARD.
YOU OKAY?
YEAH.
DIDN'T ANYONE EXPLAIN RICKY'S MEDICAL CONDITION TO THEM?
AND THEY'RE STILL PURSUING IT?
APPARENTLY SO.
I DON'T BELIEVE THIS.
WELL, CAN I DO ANYTHING FOR YOU?
DO YOU NEED ANYTHING?
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE THE FIRST PERSON
TO ASK ME THAT ALL DAY.
NO, I'M FINE, THANKS.
I'M SUPPOSED TO WORK FAST TRACK
BUT I CAN GET SOMEONE TO COVER.
STAY HERE, HELP YOU OUT.
WELL, NOT MUCH TO DO.
WEAVER PULLED ME AWAY FROM SEEING PATIENTS.
TOLD ME TO SIT HERE AND CATCH UP ON PAPERWORK.
FOR HOW LONG?
FROM THE TONE OF HER VOICE
I'D GUESS MAYBE FOREVER.
( sighs )
WHAT DID MARK SAY?
THEY'RE CLOSING RANKS, COVERING THEIR ASSES.
DR. ROSS, YOU HAVE A COUPLE OF MINUTES?
SURE.
I'M GOING TO GRAB SOME COFFEE. YOU SET?
YEAH, I'M FINE.
I'M DOWN THE HALL IN 117.
MEET YOU THERE IN FIVE?
'KAY.
DR. GREENE?
I'M SORRY.
IS THIS NOT A GOOD TIME?
NO, IT'S FINE. COME ON IN.
DO YOU REMEMBER MY WIFE, KUBBY?
SURE. HI.
DID YOU TWO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY
TO TALK ABOUT THIS?
HIS BACK, IT IS WORSE?
HIS BACK IS BETTER NOW.
I SUGGESTED THAT HE SEE A UROLOGIST
FOR HIS OTHER PROBLEM.
IT'S POSSIBLE THAT, UH, HE MAY NEED SURGERY.
SURGERY?
IF THIS IS UNCOMFORTABLE
FOR YOU TO HAVE THIS DISCUSSION
ABOUT THESE ISSUES IN FRONT OF ME
I CAN LEAVE FOR A FEW MINUTES.
NO, PLEASE. STAY.
HOW YOU DOING?
HEY. HI.
HAVE A SEAT, DOCTOR.
ARE YOU SURE YOU DON'T WANT SOME COFFEE?
I GOT AN EXTRA ONE.
NO, I'M FINE.
I GUESS I'LL DRINK IT MYSELF.
WHO'S THAT?
THAT'S DETECTIVE BRANNIGAN.
HE'S PART OF THE FELONY REVIEW TEAM.
WE INVESTIGATE ALL THE FIRST-DEGREE MURDER CASES.
( exasperated sigh )
I'M NOT TRYING TO HANG YOU OUT TO DRY
OR RUIN YOUR CAREER.
BUT, UM...
IF YOU SHOWED MRS. ABBOTT HOW TO ALTER THE P.C.A
TO DELIVER A, UH... A FATAL DOSE OF DILAUDID
YOU CAN BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR RICKY ABBOTT'S DEATH.
NOW, MISS HATHAWAY SAID
THAT RICKY WAS GETTING, UH, 80 MIKES OF DILAUDID AN HOUR
THROUGH THE P.C.A.
MIKES IS, UH, MICROGRAMS?
AND THAT RICKY'S MOTHER COULD GIVE HIM
A BOOSTER OF AN ADDITIONAL 120 EVERY TWO HOURS.
THAT'S RIGHT.
BUT SHE WAS UNCERTAIN AS TO HOW MUCH DILAUDID
YOU ORIGINALLY PLACED IN THE MACHINE.
IT WAS EMPTY WHEN DETECTIVE BRANNIGAN EXAMINED IT
A FEW MINUTES AGO.
MR. SULLIVAN...
I'VE DEDICATED MY LIFE TO PEDIATRIC MEDICINE.
I'VE CARED FOR DOZENS OF DYING KIDS--
KIDS IN AGONY, PAIN... YOU AND I CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE.
RICKY ABBOTT WAS GOING TO DIE.
NOT IN A MONTH... OR A WEEK OR A DAY--
IN HOURS--
AND NOTHING I DID OR-OR COULD HAVE DONE
WAS GOING TO CHANGE THAT.
HIS MOTHER HAD ALREADY WATCHED ONE SON DIE FROM THE DISEASE
AND SHE WAS SITTING THERE
WATCHING HER SECOND SON DYING A HORRIBLE DEATH
FROM SOMETHING THAT SHE PASSED ON TO HIM.
SOMETIMES IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO SAVE A KID'S LIFE
AND THE ONLY THING WE CAN DO...
IS SAVE THEM FROM SUFFERING...
LEAVE THEM WITH A LITTLE DIGNITY.
IN THE END, THAT'S ALL THEY HAVE.
TELL ME, WERE YOU RELIEVING THE, UH... THE CHILD'S SUFFERING
OR... WERE YOU RELIEVING YOUR OWN?
IF YOU WERE SO CERTAIN YOU WERE DOING THE RIGHT THING
WHY DIDN'T YOU ADMINISTER THE, UH, LETHAL DOSE YOURSELF?
YOU'RE THE DOCTOR.
YOU COULD HAVE STAYED
AND YOU COULD HAVE MADE SURE THERE WERE NO COMPLICATIONS...
THAT HE REALLY DID DIE WITH DIGNITY.
BUT YOU LEFT.
YOU KNEW THAT KILLING THAT CHILD WAS WRONG.
THAT'S WHY YOU...
YOU SNUCK OUT OF THE HOUSE BEFORE DAWN, ISN'T IT?
YOU DIDN'T WANT TO BE THERE, DID YOU?
YOU DIDN'T WANT TO BE THERE...
BECAUSE YOU KNEW KILLING RICKY ABBOTT WAS WRONG.
I DON'T SEE A BROKEN RIB.
MAYBE A HAIRLINE FRACTURE.
I FEEL LIKE AN ELEPHANT SAT ON MY CHEST.
WELL, JUST STAY SEATED, OKAY?
DON'T GET UP.
HOW DID YOU GET THAT CUT ON YOUR FOREHEAD?
I THINK I HIT IT WITH THE CHART.
( laughs )
YOU'VE TAKEN MARTIAL ARTS BEFORE.
KARATE WHEN I WAS, LIKE, SEVEN.
OUCH.
IT CAN'T HURT THAT BAD.
IT DOESN'T EVEN NEED A STITCH.
OUCH!
BABY.
HERE.
BETTER?
MUCH.
I'M A DOCTOR, YOU'RE A STUDENT.
MM-HMM.
SO WE SHOULDN'T BE DOING THIS.
MM-HMM.
THE STORM'S FINALLY HERE.
ROMANO CLOSED MY CLINIC.
WHY?
BECAUSE I HELPED YOU GET THE P.C.A.
WELL, RICKY WAS DYING.
I WAS THERE.
I KNOW HE WAS DYING.
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE GOING TO HELP HIS MOTHER
USE A PIECE OF MY EQUIPMENT
TO ADMINISTER A LETHAL DOSE OF DILAUDID.
I DIDN'T WANT TO GET YOU INVOLVED.
OH... BUT DOUG, I WAS INVOLVED.
I MEAN...
WERE YOU PLANNING ON TELLING ME...
ANY OF THIS, EVER?
I DON'T KNOW, YOU KNOW.
HADN'T DECIDED.
WHAT ABOUT YOU PROMISING MARK
NEVER TO PRESCRIBE NARCOTICS?
I MEAN, HAD YOU DECIDED
ON SHARING THAT INFORMATION WITH ME?
I DID WHAT I THOUGHT WAS RIGHT.
DAMN THE CONSEQUENCES
OR WHOEVER ELSE GETS HURT, RIGHT?
I WAS WILLING TO LIVE WITH THE CONSEQUENCES.
MARK AND KERRY ARE FACING DISCIPLINARY ACTION.
MY CLINIC HAS BEEN CLOSED
WHICH MEANS HUNDREDS OF PATIENTS
HAVE NO PLACE ELSE TO GO.
THE POLICE... ARE QUESTIONING THE ENTIRE E.R. STAFF.
YOUR ACTIONS CARRY CONSEQUENCES, DOUG.
IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT YOU.
DO YOU EVEN GIVE A DAMN?
( groans in disgust )
HEY, DON'T DO THAT. DON'T WALK AWAY.
WHY NOT?
YOU DON'T NEED ANYBODY ELSE.
YOU ARE A COUNTRY UNTO YOURSELF.
YOU KNOW, YOU JUST MAKE DECISIONS
RUIN PEOPLE'S LIVES.
NARCISSISM ELEVATED TO A HIGH ART.
CAROL, CAROL...
WHAT?
I'M SORRY.
THAT'S WHAT YOU ALWAYS SAY.
Some of the roadways are nearly impassable
as you can see from this video we've taken.
Both the airports-- Midway and O'Hare-- are closed.
I'LL NEVER GET HOME NOW.
SOMEBODY BEEP ME?
I DID. WHERE YOU BEEN? I'M GETTING BURIED HERE.
UPSTAIRS WITH LEGAL.
WE ARE STACKED UP.
WHEN ROMANO CLOSED CAROL'S CLINIC
ALL HER CASES GOT DUMPED ONTO OUR SERVICE.
MOST OF THEM ARE STILL WAITING OUT IN CHAIRS.
JERRY, STOP WATCHING TV
AND GET YOUR TAIL OVER HERE.
HOW LONG WILL THE POLICE KEEP TRAUMA TWO TIED UP?
I DON'T KNOW. I'LL FIND OUT.
WHY DOES CARTER HAVE SO MANY OLD CASES?
HE GOT KICKED IN THE CHEST.
LUCY'S WORKING ON HIM DOWN IN SIX.
COULD THIS DAY GET ANY WORSE?
CONNIE, GO TELL THE CLINIC PATIENTS WE'RE SORRY
BUT WE'RE NOT GETTING TO THEM TODAY
SO THEY MIGHT AS WELL GO HOME.
CHUNY, GO SEE HOW CARTER'S DOING.
IF HE CAN'T WORK TODAY
WE'LL HAVE TO CALL THE JEOPARDY RESIDENT TO HELP OUT.
YOU GOT IT.
DAMN IT, JERRY, STOP WATCHING THAT TV
OR I'LL RIP IT OFF THE WALL WITH MY BARE HANDS
AND BEAT YOU TO DEATH WITH IT!
Carter: WAIT. WAIT.
Knight: I ALMOST GOT IT.
NO, I MEAN REALLY WAIT.
UM... YEAH.
THIS ISN'T RIGHT.
WE CAN'T BE DOING THIS.
WHY NOT?
WELL, BECAUSE THERE ARE RULES.
YOU MEAN WE COULD GET IN TROUBLE?
NOT WE. ME.
( knocking on door )
Marquez: DR. CARTER, YOU IN THERE?
YOU, UH... YOU LOCKED THAT DOOR, RIGHT?
YEAH. ABSOLUTELY.
BOTH OF THEM?
DR. CARTER, YOU OKAY?
Lucy: JUST A SECOND.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
YOU LOCKED THE DOOR IN HER FACE.
SHE KNOWS SOMEBODY'S IN HERE.
HOW YOU FEELING?
MUCH BETTER, THANK YOU.
LUCY?
OH, HE DIDN'T NEED ANY STITCHES.
THAT'S GOOD.
I'M GOING BACK TO WORK.
YOU'RE INSIDE OUT.
YOUR SWEATER--
YOU'VE GOT IT ON INSIDE OUT.
WHEN DID IT STOP SNOWING?
A FEW MINUTES AGO.
WE DON'T LOOK MUCH LIKE DANGEROUS FELONS.
SPEAK FOR YOURSELF.
I'M SO SORRY ABOUT ALL THIS.
YOU OKAY?
ARE YOU?
I'VE HAD BETTER DAYS.
YEAH.
YOU KNOW, WHEN...
WHEN MICHAEL DIED, I CRIED FOR DAYS.
I FELT THAT... THAT I'D DIED, TOO.
THAT I'D...
NEVER FEEL LOVE OR JOY AGAIN.
AND THEN...
RICKY CAME AND READ TO ME.
HE'D SIT ON THE END OF THE BED AND...
TELL ME THESE STUPID JOKES
THAT HE'D HEARD IN SECOND GRADE
AND HE'D SMILE.
GOD, I...
I WISH YOU'D SEEN HIM LIKE THAT.
JOI...
YOU STILL HAVE YOUR DAUGHTER.
YEAH.
I SHOULD GO BACK INSIDE
AND SEE IF MY EX-HUSBAND'S READY TO LET ME TALK TO HER AGAIN.
YEAH.
THANK YOU
DR. ROSS...
FOR EVERYTHING.
YEAH.
Carter: THE 92-YEAR-OLD
DISLOCATED ANKLE IN EXAM ONE HAS BEEN REDUCED.
LYDIA, GIVE HER A VICODIN
AND TELL HER TO STAY OFF HER SKATES.
92 YEARS OLD AND SHE'S STILL...
YOU GOT SOMETHING ON YOUR NECK.
WHERE?
RIGHT THERE.
LOOKS LIKE SOMEBODY BIT YOU.
YEAH. I THINK I MIGHT HAVE HIT SOMETHING
WHEN I FELL DOWN.
YOU BIT ME.
WHAT? NO, I DIDN'T.
OH! GUESS I MUST HAVE GOTTEN CARRIED AWAY.
MMM! MMM! MMM!
NOW, THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. MMM!
ROXANNE CALLED TWICE.
SO?
SO?
SO WHAT, JERRY?
SO, LUCY.
YEAH. COME ON, MAN. EVERYBODY KNOWS.
I HEARD IT FROM THE CASHIER IN THE CAFETERIA.
SHERI FROM RADIOLOGY CALLED ME.
I'M NOT HAVING THIS CONVERSATION.
CAN SOMEBODY ANSWER THE M.I.C.N., PLEASE?
NOTHING HAPPENED.
MARK, I GOT TO TALK TO YOU.
I GOT PATIENTS.
LISTEN, I'M GOING TO ANSPAUGH.
I'LL TELL HIM THAT I COERCED YOU AND KERRY
TO GO ALONG WITH ME IN THIS DRUG PROTOCOL THING.
COERCED HOW?
I BEGGED YOU NOT TO REPORT IT--
THAT I PROMISED I WOULD DO IT MYSELF--
AND THAT'S THE ONLY REASON YOU DIDN'T REPORT IT.
I THINK THERE'S BEEN ENOUGH LYING, DOUG.
WHY DON'T WE ALL STICK TO THE TRUTH FOR ONCE?
I'M TRYING TO HELP.
I DON'T WANT YOUR HELP.
I MADE DECISIONS OF MY OWN FREE WILL
AND I'M READY TO STAND BEHIND THEM.
YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO BELIEVE.
YOU LIE TO ME
UNDERMINE MY AUTHORITY EVERY CHANCE YOU GET
BEND THE RULES TO FIT YOUR NEEDS.
"THAT'S HOW WE DO IT.
I'LL JUST LIE MY WAY OUT OF IT."
I WAS JUST TRYING TO DO YOU A FAVOR.
HEY, MARK!
I'LL BE LUCKY IF I SURVIVE THE FAVORS
YOU'VE ALREADY DONE FOR ME.
MARK, WE GOT A SCHOOL BUS FLIPPED OVER BY A SNOWPLOW.
BUNCH OF KIDS ARE TRAPPED.
FIREMEN NEED A DOCTOR ON THE SCENE.
WHERE? DOWNTOWN SOMEWHERE.
COUPLE OF THE KIDS MAY EVEN DIE BEFORE WE CAN GET THEM OUT.
I WANTED TO GO, BUT WEAVER THOUGHT IT SHOULD BE YOU.
UNIT 62 IS WAITING FOR YOU IN THE BAY.
HOW MANY?
15. NINE ARE STILL TRAPPED.
THE SNOWPLOW BLADE INTRUDED RIGHT INTO THE BUS.
WHERE THE HELL DO YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING?
YOU NEED A PEDIATRICIAN.
YOU ARE OFF THE SERVICE.
I'M COMING.
THE HELL YOU ARE.
READY TO GO, DOC?
YEAH. LET'S DO IT.
GET BACK INSIDE.
I'M COMING WITH YOU.
YOU GOT KIDS DYING OUT THERE.
MAYBE YOU'LL THINK ABOUT THAT NEXT TIME.
HEY, DOUG, WHERE YOU GOING?
DRIVING MYSELF.
I'M GOING WITH YOU.
YOU DON'T HAVE A COAT.
I'LL GET ONE. JUST WAIT... WAIT FOR ME!
WE GOT FIVE OUT.
WE GOT THE JAWS WORKING THE FORWARD SECTION
BUT WE GOT THREE KIDS
TRAPPED INSIDE UNDER THE PLOW BLADE.
I WAS AFRAID THEY'D BLEED OUT
BEFORE WE COULD GET THEM OUT.
I GOT A CRANE COMING TO LIFT THAT SNOWPLOW OFF.
DRIVER TRIED TO STOP, BUT IT'S PURE ICE.
PLOW HIT HIM DEAD ON.
WE GO IN THROUGH THE SIDE WINDOW--
CLIMB DOWN TO REACH THEM.
DOC, IT'S PRETTY BAD IN THERE.
WATCH YOUR STEP.
SKIPPER, WE'RE GOING TO NEED O-NEG, LOTS OF IT, OKAY?
AND GET SOME PROPANE HEATERS.
LET'S BLOW SOME HEAT IN HERE
BEFORE THESE KIDS FREEZE TO DEATH.
HEY, TURN THIS UP.
I LOVE THIS SONG.
EARTH, WIND & FIRE?
MM-HMM. MY DAD USED TO LOVE THEM.
YOU'RE DATING ME.
JUNIOR HIGH.
SO YOU NEVER ASKED ME IF I DID IT.
I HOPE YOU DID.
I WOULDN'T WANT
TO SUFFER THE WAY THAT LITTLE BOY SUFFERED.
I THOUGHT ABOUT THAT A LOT.
YOU KNOW, JEANIE, YOU NEVER TALK ABOUT YOUR HIV.
NOPE.
DOUG.
Ross: HOLD ON.
