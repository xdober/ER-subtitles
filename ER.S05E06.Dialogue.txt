PREVIOUSLY ON E.R.:
DR. CARTER, HI.
NORMALLY, I WOULD, BUT AS OF TODAY, I'M ONLY AN INTERN.
I HEARD ABOUT THAT.
KERRY, THIS IS DR. DAN LITVAK.
JUST HERE TO GET A FEW TIPS?
I JUST HAD MY SECOND INTERVIEW FOR THE CHIEF POSITION.
PETER, HAVE YOU NOT TOLD EVERYONE?
MY SON IS DEAF. I KNOW THAT, OKAY?
AREN'T YOU SUPPOSED TO BE SETTING POLICY?
I'M HERE FOR THE RIDE-ALONG.
( raucous yelling )
HE COULD DIE OF ASPIRATION PNEUMONIA.
TWO OF YOUR CLASSMATES ALMOST DIED TONIGHT.
IT WAS STUPID OF ME
TO THINK YOU WERE MATURE ENOUGH
TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY.
( mumbling )
DOUG, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? IT'S 5:00.
I'M A WEEK BEHIND ON MY Q & A REPORTS
AND THAT IS THE GOOD NEWS.
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN UP?
I HAVEN'T BEEN TO SLEEP.
OH, GOD. ANYTHING I CAN DO?
GO BACK TO BED.
THERE'S NO USE BOTH OF US BEING MISERABLE.
NO. IT'S LONELY THERE WITHOUT YOU.
YOU KEEP THAT UP, I'M NEVER GOING TO FINISH.
MMM... SORRY.
NOW I KNOW HOW YOU FELT WHEN YOU OPENED YOUR CLINIC.
IT'S PRETTY SCARY, HUH?
YEAH.
ARE WE BOTH NUTS?
YEAH.
BUT IT'S WORTH IT.
( mumbled agreement )
OH, DR. CARTER.
I DIDN'T THINK YOU'D BE UP YET.
I LEFT YOU A NOTE.
MM-HMM.
UM, I JUST WANTED TO TELL YOU HOW SORRY I AM
THAT YOU LOST YOUR R.A. JOB BECAUSE OF THE HALLOWEEN DANCE.
YEAH. ME, TOO.
AND, UM, I WAS WONDERING
IF YOU THOUGHT IT MIGHT HELP IF I WROTE THE DEAN A LETTER.
THANKS, BUT I THINK YOU'VE DONE ENOUGH ALREADY.
WELL, AT LEAST I COULD HELP YOU PACK.
I'M NOT ON UNTIL 7:00.
NO, I CAN MANAGE. IF YOU DON'T MIND...
WHERE ARE YOU GOING TO LIVE?
OW! THAT'S MY LEG.
OH, I'M SORRY. I, UH, I DIDN'T REALIZE YOU HAD COMPANY.
I'LL SEE YOU AT THE HOSPITAL.
I'M VERY GLAD YOU'RE MOVING.
Greene: SO YOUR BEEF IS WITH NURSES
ASKING INAPPROPRIATE QUESTIONS OVER THE RADIO.
YEAH. I'LL SAY.
PATIENTS FREAK OUT WHEN SOMEONE ASKS IF THEY GOT TRACK MARKS.
ALL RIGHT. I'LL TALK TO THE NURSES.
UH, YOU KNOW, THEY ASKED ME TO REMIND YOU
NOT TO RESTOCK YOUR RIG WITH THEIR SUPPLIES.
OH, MAN
THAT IS SO LAME.
NOTHING IS GOING TO CHANGE
UNLESS WE ALL THROW OUR GRIPES OUT ON THE TABLE.
YOU GUYS WANT TO GET SOME BREAKFAST
BEFORE WE HEAD BACK TO THE STATION?
DEFINITELY. I COULD USE AN OMELET AND, UH...
( gunshots )
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?
GUNFIRE. IT CAME FROM BEHIND US.
Morales: LOOKS LIKE BANGERS.
HEY, SOMEONE'S DOWN.
Audia: UNIT 62. WE HAVE A POSSIBLE G.S.W.
IN THE 1600 BLOCK OF HALSTED.
GUNFIRE IN THE VICINITY.
WHY AREN'T YOU BACKING UP?
WE HAVE TO WAIT FOR THE AREA TO BE SECURED.
I DON'T HEAR ANY GUNFIRE.
THAT DOESN'T MEAN IT WON'T START AGAIN.
WELL, I'M NOT GOING TO WAIT IN HERE.
PROTOCOL SAYS WE WAIT FOR BACKUP.
WAIT!
DAMN IT!
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?
( gunfire )
YOU HEAR THAT?
WE SHOULD NOT BE OUT HERE.
IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THEY'RE COMING BACK. GIVE ME A HAND.
IS HE SHOT?
THERE'S NO ENTRANCE WOUND. HE'S JUST BEAT UP.
READY TO ROLL HIM?
ALL RIGHT. GO.
( glass breaking )
HE'S NOT BREATHING. WE HAVE TO INTUBATE.
NOT HERE. IN THE RIG. NOW.
AH, THERE'S TOO MUCH BLOOD. SUCTION.
MORALES, GURNEY!
I CAN'T SEE THE CORDS.
YOU WANT ME TO CRANK HIS HEAD BACK?
WE HAVEN'T CLEARED HIS C-SPINE.
HE'S STILL NOT BREATHING.
EXTEND HIS NECK.
YOU E.R. GUYS ARE NUTS.
YES. I'M IN.
OKAY.
LET'S MOVE HIM AND BAG HIM.
ONE, TWO, THREE.
I'M LOSING HIS PULSE.
YEAH. WE'LL HAVE TO START TWO LARGE-BORE I.V.s.
YOU WANT TO DO THAT HERE, TOO?
NO. WE'LL DO IT WHILE WE'RE ROLLING.
NEXT TIME YOU DECIDE TO DO A RIDE-ALONG
I'M TAKING A DAY OFF.
LIGHTS AND SIRENS. LET'S GO.
WHAT DO WE GOT?
16-YEAR-OLD MALE FOUND BEATEN IN THE STREETS.
SUSTAINED A CONCUSSION
AND MULTIPLE CONTUSIONS TO...
HEAD, NECK AND EXTREMITIES.
B.P.'s 140/80, PULSE 110 AND REGULAR.
GOOD AIR ENTRY BILATERALLY
NO EVIDENCE OF PNEUMOTHORAX.
ANY I.D.?
NO. JUST A COUPLE OF BUCKS.
OKAY, EVERYBODY. ON MY COUNT: ONE, TWO, THREE.
COWBOY GREENE TO THE RESCUE.
BABINSKI'S NORMAL.
B.P. 120/78.
REGULAR RATE AND RHYTHM.
SPONTANEOUS EYE OPENING.
OKAY. CAN YOU WIGGLE YOUR TOES?
YUP. FOLLOWS COMMANDS.
HOW'S HE DOING?
STABLE. NO APPARENT NEURO DEFICITS.
THAT WAS SOME CRAZY STUNT.
YOU LUCKED OUT THIS TIME.
WHAT WAS THAT ALL ABOUT?
UH, PARAMEDICS GOT A LITTLE PERTURBED
BECAUSE I TUBED HIM IN THE FIELD.
RADIOLOGY'S HERE.
SO, WORD IS DAN LITVAK TURNED DOWN E.R. CHIEF.
WHAT HAPPENED?
I HEARD HE PLAYED
YOUR COMMITTEE FOR PATSIES--
USED THE OFFER TO NEGOTIATE A BIGGER SALARY BACK HOME.
I PROBABLY SHOULDN'T BE TELLING YOU THIS
BUT YOU'RE THE ONLY OTHER CANDIDATE ON THE SHORT LIST.
REALLY?
OKAY. "CAT LOVER SEEKS LIKE-MINDED ROOMMATE."
FORGET IT.
WOULD YOU CONSIDER JOINING A COMMUNAL VEGETARIAN HOUSEHOLD?
ALL RIGHT. HERE'S ONE.
UH, "FURNISHED APARTMENT IN OLD TOWN HOME
ACCESS TO FULL KITCHEN, MANY AMENITIES."
WELL, THAT SOUNDS PROMISING.
YEAH, AND NOT TOO FAR FROM THE HOSPITAL.
LOOK. I CAN TALK TO MY REALTOR
AND SET UP AN APPOINTMENT FOR YOU AFTER WORK.
BYE. RIGHT. SEE YOU LATER.
TAKE A DEEP BREATH. ALL RIGHT, BLOW HARD.
HARD.
( coughing )
OKAY.
YOU ALL RIGHT?
YEAH.
PULSE OX HOLDING AT 98.
I'M DR. GREENE.
DO YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?
I WAS WITH A JOHN.
BANGERS TRIED TO ROB US. MY JOHN PULLED A GUN.
THAT'S WHERE I GO BLANK.
WE FOUND YOU ON THE STREET; BROUGHT YOU HERE BY AMBULANCE.
WHAT WERE YOU DOING CRUISING IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD?
SOMETIMES I RIDE ALONG WITH PARAMEDICS.
UH-HUH.
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE THE FIRST GUY WHO'S EVER SAVED MY LIFE.
WELL, I DON'T GO OUT IN THE STREET FOR JUST ANYBODY.
HMM...
I GUESS I GOT TO GRANT YOU A WISH NOW, HUH?
WHAT?
YOU KNOW...
LIKE IN I DREAM OF JEANNIE
WHEN MAJOR NELSON RESCUED HER FROM A BOTTLE.
WHY DON'T WE JUST START WITH YOUR NAME AND AGE.
KEVIN DULANEY. I'M 16 YEARS OLD.
LILY, WHY DON'T YOU FIND KEVIN'S LABS
AND SEE IF YOU CAN GET US AN OPEN EXAM ROOM.
SURE.
WHERE DO YOU LIVE, KEVIN?
PRETTY MUCH WHERE YOU FOUND ME.
ANY FAMILY?
NONE WHO WANT TO KNOW ME.
WHY IS THAT?
A YEAR AGO
MY OLD MAN CAUGHT ME HAVING SEX WITH MY GYMNASTICS COACH
AND HE KICKED ME OUT OF THE HOUSE.
ANY OTHER SAD DETAILS YOU WANT TO HEAR?
SO... YOU SURVIVE BY HUSTLING.
YEAH. WELL, SOMEONE'S GOT TO PAY THE BILLS, RIGHT?
USE CONDOMS?
SOMETIMES.
CUSTOMERS PAY MORE TO RIDE ME BAREBACK.
WE HAVE A NEW RAPID HIV TEST.
YOU CAN GET RESULTS IN 20 MINUTES.
HOW ABOUT IT?
YOU WANT TO BET I'M POSITIVE?
WELL, IF YOU ARE, WE CAN TREAT YOU.
SURE.
HEY, IT LOOKS LIKE A GOOD TURNOUT
FOR THE B.P. SCREENING, HUH?
I POSTED SIGNS AT THE SENIOR CENTER.
IF IT EVER STOPS RAINING, WE'LL BE JAMMED.
OW! NOT SO TIGHT.
I'M SORRY, MR. LEVY, BUT IN ORDER TO GET
AN ACCURATE READING, IT HAS TO BE SNUG.
I TELL YOU IT'S TOO DAMN TIGHT.
OKAY. TAKE IT EASY. I'LL LOOSEN IT A BIT.
MY ARM'S GOING TO BLOW OFF.
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT WE SHOULD DO NEXT TIME?
EXTEND THE OUTREACH-- GO INTO THE COMMUNITY
TAKE B.P.s, CHECK FOR GLAUCOMA. WHAT DO YOU THINK?
THAT'S NOT A BAD IDEA.
OKAY. YOUR PRESSURE'S FINE.
NO THANKS TO YOU.
Ross: CAROL, YOU PAGE ME?
OH, YEAH. I WILL BE RIGHT BACK.
WHAT'S UP?
THIS'LL JUST TAKE A MINUTE.
WE'RE SWAMPED HERE. I KNOW, I KNOW.
HAH...
A LAB COAT.
YES. IT'S WHAT EVERY WELL-DRESSED DIVISION HEAD SHOULD WEAR.
I GUESS THERE'S NO BACKING OUT NOW.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
COME HERE.
I THOUGHT YOU SAID YOU WERE BUSY.
NOT THAT BUSY.
NO?
( both laughing )
CARTER, YOU PAGED ME?
YEAH, YEAH.
68-YEAR-OLD MALE WITH A HISTORY
OF PREVIOUS ABDOMINAL SURGERY.
I'M THINKING SMALL BOWEL OBSTRUCTION.
HMM... YOU DO A THREE-WAY?
RIGHT HERE.
AIR FLUID LEVELS AND HE'S GOT A STEPLADDER PATTERN.
HMM... GOOD CALL.
I MUST'VE DRIVEN YOU CRAZY.
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
MY STUDENT... SHE'S DRIVING ME NUTS.
MAKES STUPID MISTAKES, ASKS TOO MANY QUESTIONS...
SHOWS POOR JUDGMENT.
HOW'D YOU EVER PUT UP WITH ME?
I NEVER GAVE YOU ANY THOUGHT, CARTER.
YOU DIDN'T?
CARTER, MEDICAL STUDENTS DON'T KNOW ANYTHING.
IT'S YOUR JOB TO TEACH THEM, NOT BE THEIR FRIEND.
EXHALE, MRS. DELPIT
LIKE YOU'RE BLOWING OUT BIRTHDAY CANDLES.
AH, AH, AH. BEFORE LISTENING WITH A STETHOSCOPE
TEST FOR TACTILE FREMITUS...
BY PLACING YOUR HAND ON THE PATIENT'S BACK
AND ASKING HER TO REPEAT THE WORD "99."
I HAVEN'T TESTED FOR TACTILE FREMITUS
SINCE I WAS A FIRST YEAR.
I HAVE TO BE SURE THAT YOU CAN DO A COMPLETE EXAM.
ALL RIGHT.
MRS. DELPIT, WILL YOU PLEASE REPEAT "99" FOR ME.
99, 99
99, 99... 99.
BLOOD ALCOHOL LEVEL CAME BACK.
DID IT SET A RECORD?
NO, BUT IT'S UP THERE.
.16.
THAT'S NOTHING.
LAST TIME I GOT PICKED UP, I SCORED A 26.
I ALSO HAVE YOUR HIV RESULTS.
IT'S AIDS, RIGHT?
NO. IT'S GOOD NEWS. YOU'RE NEGATIVE.
SO I GUESS MY JOHNS DON'T NEED RUBBERS AFTER ALL.
I'M GOING TO CHARGE THEM A FORTUNE.
YOU'RE NOT GOING
TO STAY NEGATIVE LONG IF YOU DON'T
PROTECT YOURSELF.
MAYBE IT'S TIME YOU STARTED GETTING YOUR LIFE TOGETHER.
YEAH. I DO KIND OF STINK.
HEY, DO YOU THINK I COULD GET A SHOWER?
MAYBE SOME CLEAN CLOTHES?
I'LL HAVE THE NURSES COME
AND TAKE YOU TO THE SHOWER ROOM.
CARE TO JOIN ME?
NO, THANKS.
I HAD ONE THIS MORNING.
PETER, HOLD ON.
HAVE YOU GOT A MOMENT?
UH, NO. WE GOT A SMALL BOWEL OBSTRUCTION.
I KNOW. I'M OPERATING WITH YOU.
MEET YOUR NEW INTERN.
SINCE WHEN?
THIS MORNING, IF YOU'LL HAVE ME.
GO AHEAD. BRING HIM IN.
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA. WAS THIS ANSPAUGH'S IDEA?
ACTUALLY, IT WAS MINE, BUT ANSPAUGH SUPPORTS IT--
ENTHUSIASTICALLY, I MIGHT ADD.
MMM... I DON'T KNOW, ELIZABETH.
COME ON, PETER. DON'T BE SUCH A WET BLANKET.
JUST THINK-- NO MORE OF DALE'S SCUT
AND YOU HAVE THE CHANCE
OF WORKING WITH AN ALLURING INTERN.
I DON'T THINK I FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH THAT.
WHY NOT? WE'VE ALWAYS MADE A GREAT TEAM.
YEAH, BUT THAT'S WHEN WE WERE BOTH RESIDENTS.
NOW, I'D HAVE TO BE YOUR BOSS.
YEAH. WELL, UH, I DON'T MIND IF YOU DON'T.
LOOK. THEN I'LL BE ACCUSED OF PLAYING FAVORITES
IF I DON'T TREAT YOU LIKE AN INTERN.
I'M NOT ASKING FOR SPECIAL TREATMENT
JUST THE CHANCE TO DO SOMETHING MORE THAN PULL DRAINS.
ELIZABETH, I DON'T THINK IT'LL BE, YOU KNOW...
I DON'T THINK IT'LL BE GOOD FOR US. I...
ALL RIGHT. I'LL THINK ABOUT IT, OKAY?
YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU DON'T HAVE TO.
I ALREADY HEARD YOUR ANSWER.
YOU WANT ORANGE JUICE, REESE?
HUH? IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT?
COFFEE, PLEASE.
YOU WANT TO TAKE A SIP?
HEY, YOU GUYS TAKING A LUNCH BREAK?
HEY. YEAH.
FIGURE WE'D COME OUT HERE AND GET SOME FRESH AIR
SINCE IT STOPPED RAINING.
YEAH, ME, TOO.
OH, HE'S GETTING SO BIG.
YOU'RE GOING TO BE TALL
LIKE YOUR DADDY, AREN'T YOU, HUH?
YEAH.
I WASN'T AWARE THAT REESE HAD A HEARING PROBLEM.
YEAH, WE JUST FOUND OUT RECENTLY.
HE'S DEAF.
COME ON, MAN.
COME ON.
WHAT APPROACH ARE YOU USING FOR LANGUAGE ACQUISITION
IF YOU DON'T MIND MY ASKING.
WE'RE WORKING WITH AN AUDIOLOGIST.
TEACHING HIM TO VOCALIZE.
HAVE YOU LOOKED INTO SPEECH READING AND SIGNING?
HE STILL HAS RESIDUAL HEARING.
ACTUALLY, I'M LOOKING FOR AN AGGRESSIVE E.N.T.
WHO'LL CONSIDER HIM A CANDIDATE FOR A COCHLEAR IMPLANT.
WELL, THEY WOULD HAVE TO DESTROY HIS RESIDUAL HEARING.
YEAH, BUT THE TECHNOLOGY IS VERY ADVANCED.
YOU SHOULD TALK TO LISA PARKS AT U. OF C.
SHE'S AN OUTSTANDING PHYSICIAN
AND HAS EXPERTISE IN THIS FIELD.
SHE'S A FRIEND OF YOURS?
I'LL GIVE YOU HER NUMBER.
SHE'S ON THE CUTTING EDGE.
OKAY.
THANKS.
E.R.
YEP. HOLD ON.
DR. ROSS.
I'M BUSY HERE, JER.
WELL, THEY SAID IT WAS URGENT.
OH... ALL RIGHT.
THIS IS DR. ROSS.
( chuckles ): ME, TOO, KIDDO.
WHERE ARE YOU?
I WAS JUST THINKING ABOUT YOU.
NURSE, I HAVE TO HAVE MY SUGAR CHECKED.
GOT TO GO.
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?
THAT OTHER NURSE SAID I HAVE TO COME BACK TOMORROW.
I HAVE SUGAR DIABETES.
I SCHLEPPED ALL THE WAY OVER HERE
ON A BUS IN THE RAIN
AND SHE TELLS ME I NEED TO MAKE AN APPOINTMENT.
NOW, WHAT IS THAT?
OKAY, HANG ON.
DID YOU TELL MR. LEVY HE NEEDED AN APPOINTMENT
TO HAVE HIS GLUCOSE CHECKED?
DID HE GIVE YOU THAT SONG AND DANCE
ABOUT TAKING THE BUS IN THE RAIN?
YEAH.
HE'S GOT A BUNCH OF OTHER COMPLAINTS.
LADIES, I HATE TO INTERRUPT
BUT I HAVEN'T HAD A BITE TO EAT ALL DAY.
I HAVE SUGAR DIABETES.
HELLO!
OKAY, MR. LEVY.
I'M GOING TO TEST YOUR BLOOD GLUCOSE JUST THIS ONCE
WITHOUT AN APPOINTMENT
AND THEN WE'LL ORDER YOU SOMETHING TO EAT.
YOU'RE AN ANGEL.
HOPE YOU GOT ALL AFTERNOON.
HOW DID THE ACCIDENT HAPPEN, KATE?
I... I LOST IT ON WET GRAVEL COMING DOWN THROUGH A TURN.
ON THE TRIAGE NOTE
YOUR DAD SAID THAT YOU HIT A CURB AND THEN FELL.
WELL, SHE FELL ONTO THE CURB AFTER SHE SLIPPED... ON GRAVEL.
OKAY. HAVE A SEAT.
YOU MIGHT HAVE A FRACTURE.
I'LL CALL ORTHO AFTER WE GET AN X RAY.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
CALL MEDICAL RECORDS.
HAVE THEM SEND UP ANY OLD CHARTS.
GOOD IDEA.
YOU FEEL ANY PAIN WHEN I PRESS HERE?
OW. YEAH.
( clears throat ): A LOT.
WHEN DID YOU FIRST FEEL THE PAIN?
UM, WHEN I WAS IN THE SHOWER.
YOU HAD QUITE A BLOW TO YOUR LEG.
COULD BE A BLOOD CLOT.
THAT'S NO BIG DEAL.
I'VE HAD THEM BEFORE.
YOU HAVE?
YEAH, YEAH, SURE.
I GOT A PROTEIN "S" DEFICIENCY.
MY BLOOD CLOTS ALL THE TIME.
SHOULD HAVE SEEN THE MOTHER I HAD ABOUT A YEAR AGO.
I WISH YOU WOULD HAVE TOLD ME YOUR HISTORY BEFORE.
I CAN'T TAKE CARE OF YOU IF YOU'RE NOT STRAIGHT WITH ME.
I CAN'T BE STRAIGHT.
GUESS YOU WANT TO ORDER A COAG PANEL
AND CLOTTING STUDIES AND START ME ON A HEPARIN DRIP, RIGHT?
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU WERE HOSPITALIZED?
RIGHT BEFORE I TOOK OFF FROM HOME.
ALL RIGHT.
I'M GOING TO START YOU ON THE HEPARIN.
THEN WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TO THE COUMADIN
JUST BEFORE YOU'RE READY TO BE DISCHARGED.
NO WAY.
I'M NOT TAKING COUMADIN.
WHY NOT?
YOU HAVE A DISEASE THAT REQUIRES YOU
TO TAKE A BLOOD THINNER FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.
COUMADIN AND THE STREETS DON'T MIX.
YOU OUGHT TO KNOW THAT.
YOU DON'T WANT ME COMING BACK IN HERE
BLEEDING MY BRAINS OUT BECAUSE I GOT DRUNK AND HIT MY HEAD.
YOU'D RATHER DIE OF A BLOOD CLOT?
I DON'T SWEAT IT.
WHY SHOULD YOU?
HOW MUCH INSULIN DID YOU TAKE, MR. LEVY?
I'M NOT SURE.
THE LADY WHO USED TO COME OVER ALWAYS GAVE IT TO ME.
SHE ALSO USED TO TRIM MY TOENAILS.
I THINK ONE OF THEM IS INFECTED.
DO YOU... OW!
I GOT THIS PAIN...
OH, MR. LEVY'S STILL HERE.
HAVE YOU NOTICED...
APPARENTLY, HE TOOK TOO MUCH INSULIN THIS MORNING.
HIS BLOOD SUGAR'S 61.
I TOLD YOU I NEEDED TO HAVE MY BLOOD CHECKED.
LOOK, UM, YOU WERE RIGHT.
I'M REALLY STUCK.
HIS HOME HEALTH AIDE TOOK A NEW JOB.
ANY FAMILY?
NO. HIS WIFE DIED LAST YEAR.
NO ONE ELSE IN TOWN.
WE COULD TRY TO GET HIM
A TEMPORARY NURSING HOME PLACEMENT
TILL WE CAN SET HIM UP WITH A NEW AIDE.
I'M NOT GOING TO A NURSING HOME.
JUST TEMPORARILY, MR. LEVY.
THE GUY AT THE DESK SAID MR. LEVY WAS IN HERE.
YOU GOT MY KUNG PAO CHICKEN?
YES, SIR.
EGG ROLLS?
YES, SIR. ALL RIGHT HERE.
THAT'LL BE $8.50.
VERY REASONABLE.
YOU ORDERED CHINESE?
SHE SAID I NEEDED TO EAT.
I'LL GET MY WALLET.
WHY DON'T YOU MAKE IT AN EVEN $10.00?
WHERE'S MY FORTUNE COOKIE?
I WAS JUST WONDERING.
AM I GOING TO GET TO WORK
WITH ANY OTHER RESIDENTS HERE IN THE E.R.?
WHY? IS THERE A PROBLEM?
NO, I JUST THOUGHT I MIGHT LEARN MORE
BY WORKING WITH A VARIETY OF TEACHERS.
WELL, THAT'S UP TO THE ATTENDINGS.
WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME ABOUT THIS PATIENT?
UM, BRAD ENLOE, 12.
HISTORY OF RECURRENT LEUKEMIA.
RELAPSE AFTER SECOND INDUCTION OF CHEMO
AND HE'S HERE TODAY FOR A FEVER AND A SORE THROAT.
THAT POOR KID'S BEEN THROUGH A LOT.
WELL, IT'S OUR JOB TO TREAT THE PATIENT
NOT FEEL SORRY FOR HIM.
HI, BRAD. I'M DR. CARTER.
THIS IS MY MEDICAL STUDENT, LUCY KNIGHT.
I HEAR YOUR THROAT HURTS.
YEAH. IT STARTED THIS MORNING.
HE HAD A TEMP OF 101.
CHECK FOR CERVICAL ADENOPATHY
AND LOOK FOR INFECTION
PARTICULARLY IN THE EARS AND THROAT.
DOES THAT HURT?
KIND OF.
IT'S PROBABLY JUST A VIRUS, MRS. ENLOE.
I'M GOING TO GIVE BRAD SOME IBUPROFEN
AND CHECK HIS BLOOD COUNT.
I SEE HE'S A CANDIDATE FOR IMMUNOTOXIN THERAPY.
YES, BUT, UNFORTUNATELY
BRAD HAS TO BE HOSPITALIZED TO GET THE DRUG
AND OUR INSURANCE COMPANY TURNED HIM DOWN.
THEY WON'T PAY FOR EXPERIMENTAL TREATMENTS.
IF HIS NEUTROPHIL COUNT
COMES BACK UNDER 500, WE'LL ADMIT HIM FOR I.V. ANTIBIOTICS.
MAYBE HE COULD GET THE IMMUNOTOXINS ON THE SIDE.
IS THAT A POSSIBILITY?
WELL, WHY DON'T WE CROSS THAT BRIDGE
WHEN THE WHITE COUNT RESULTS ARE BACK?
CAROL, DOES YOUR CLINIC HAVE ANY INFORMATION
ABOUT SHELTERS FOR RUNAWAYS?
IS THIS FOR THE KID YOU SAVED?
YOU HEARD, HMM?
EVERYONE HAS.
I THOUGHT YOU WERE SUPPOSED
TO SMOOTH THINGS OUT BETWEEN THE E.R. AND PARAMEDICS.
I GOT A LITTLE CARRIED AWAY.
WELL, IT DOESN'T MATTER.
YOU'RE STILL A HERO.
YEAH, IF I DON'T KILL HIM.
WHAT?
HE'S GOT A CLOTTING DISORDER.
IF I TREAT HIM WITH A BLOOD THINNER
HE COULD BLEED TO DEATH ON THE STREET
AND IF I LET HIM GO WITHOUT TREATMENT
HE COULD DIE OF A BLOOD CLOT.
OH, GOD, BETWEEN A ROCK AND A HARD PLACE, HUH?
ALL RIGHT, HERE'S A PAMPHLET FOR A SHELTER
THAT TAKES IN STREET KIDS.
THINK YOU CAN CONVINCE HIM?
WE'LL SEE.
GOOD LUCK.
THANKS.
MR. PRESTON, CAN I TALK TO YOU FOR A SECOND?
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
I ORDERED UP KATE'S OLD MEDICAL RECORDS.
THERE'S A PATTERN THAT NEEDS EXPLAINING.
OH, OKAY. SHE WASN'T RIDING A BICYCLE
BUT IT'S NOT WHAT YOU'RE THINKING.
WHAT IS IT?
UM...
SHE WAS RIDING A... A UNICYCLE.
A UNICYCLE.
BACKWARDS WHILE PLAYING THE VIOLIN.
I DIDN'T WANT TO SAY ANYTHING.
WE WERE TRYING TO BREAK A GUINNESS WORLD RECORD
AND I DIDN'T WANT WORD TO GET OUT.
MM-HMM.
AND HER SPLIT LIP TWO MONTHS AGO?
BALANCING PINT GLASSES ON HER CHIN.
KNIFE CUTS TO THE HAND?
WE BROKE THE POTATO PEELING RECORD.
UH... LOOK
KATE AND I WERE GOING THROUGH SOME TOUGH TIMES.
I STARTED LOOKING FOR SOMETHING SHE AND I COULD DO TOGETHER.
I KNOW THIS SOUNDS CRAZY
BUT I FOUND A THREE-LEGGED MARATHON
THAT SHE AND I COULD ENTER.
WE WON AND WE KIND OF GOT HOOKED.
STARTED BREAKING ALL KINDS OF RECORDS.
MAY I HELP YOU?
YEAH. I'M PETER BENTON FROM COUNTY.
KERRY WEAVER REFERRED ME.
OH, I'M SARA JACKSON, DR. PARKS IS IN WITH A PATIENT.
COME ON, I'LL INTRODUCE YOU.
EXCUSE ME.
NOW, ON THE DOOR, IT SAYS "FAMILY MEDICINE."
I THOUGHT SHE WAS A HEAD AND NECK SURGEON.
NO, SHE HAS A FAMILY PRACTICE.
HI, HI, HI.
I'M DR. BENTON.
LISTEN, DON'T LET ME INTERRUPT YOUR PATIENT.
NO, THAT'S NOT A PROBLEM.
I'M HAPPY THAT YOU CAME OVER.
UM, I'M SORRY.
THERE MUST BE SOME MISUNDERSTANDING.
OH, NO.
KERRY TOLD ME ABOUT YOUR SON.
I'D BE REALLY HAPPY TO DISCUSS COCHLEAR IMPLANTS
AND ABOUT OTHER OPTIONS, TOO.
I GUESS SHE DIDN'T TELL YOU I WAS DEAF, HUH?
NO, SHE DIDN'T.
DR. BENTON, DR. PARKS ASKED THAT WHEN YOU SPEAK TO HER
YOU LOOK DIRECTLY AT HER, SO SHE CAN READ YOUR LIPS.
OH, I'M SORRY.
I SAID I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE DEAF.
THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
CAN WE TALK?
DO YOU HAVE TIME FOR SOME COFFEE?
YEAH, YEAH, ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT.
JUST LET ME FINISH UP WITH THIS PATIENT HERE
AND THEN WE'LL ALL GO.
OKAY.
I KNOW YOU MUST BE VERY CONFUSED
TRYING TO DECIDE WHAT'S BEST FOR YOUR SON.
LOOK, I WANT MY SON TO BE ABLE
TO FUNCTION IN THE WORLD.
AS YOU CAN SEE
I FUNCTION PRETTY WELL WITHOUT AN IMPLANT.
YEAH, BUT IF AN IMPLANT CAN HELP HIM TO HEAR
WHY NOT GET ONE?
WELL, THERE ARE OTHER OPTIONS.
YEAH.
LOOK, I DON'T WANT MY SON TO HAVE TO DEPEND ON OTHERS.
NO OFFENSE.
DO YOU KNOW ANY DEAF PEOPLE, DR. BENTON?
NO. NO, I DON'T.
HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT THAT BEING DEAF MIGHT NOT BE SO TERRIBLE?
SO YOU'RE SAYING THERE'S NO PROBLEM?
YOU CAN NEVER KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE BEING DEAF
JUST LIKE I CAN NEVER KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE BEING BLACK.
I DON'T LOOK AT ME BEING BLACK AS A BURDEN.
THAT'S WHO I AM.
AND I DON'T LOOK AT MY DEAFNESS AS A BURDEN.
THAT'S WHO I AM.
IF YOU TURN AWAY
FROM YOUR SON'S DEAFNESS
YOU WILL BE ROBBING HIM OF HIS IDENTITY.
MY SON HAS A MEDICAL PROBLEM.
I'M NOT TURNING AWAY FROM ANYTHING.
I'M TRYING TO FIX IT.
AREN'T YOU LATE FOR A BUDGET MEETING?
YEP, IF I CAN EVER GET THROUGH
THIS ADMINISTRATIVE HELLHOLE
MAYBE I'LL GET TO SEE A FEW KIDS AGAIN.
YOU'RE DOING GREAT, DAD.
BEATS JUGGLING CANTALOUPES.
TWO HOURS HE'S BEEN AT IT.
HE HASN'T DROPPED ONE YET.
HEY, KATE, THE ORTHOPEDIC SURGEON'S GOING TO COME DOWN
AND EXAMINE YOUR WRIST.
IS IT ALL RIGHT IF I WATCH MY DAD
TILL THE OTHER DOCTOR GETS HERE?
HE'S TRYING TO BREAK THE JUGGLING RECORD.
KATE, DID YOUR DAD
FORCE YOU TO RIDE THAT UNICYCLE?
FORCE ME? OH, NO. IT WAS MY IDEA.
YOU'VE HAD A LOT OF INJURIES.
DAD AND I ALWAYS TAKE GUINNESS-APPROVED PRECAUTIONS.
IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE A RECORD BREAKER
YOU'VE GOT TO TAKE CHANCES.
PLAY IT SAFE AND LIFE'S BORING.
HERE'S WHEN WE BROKE THE THREE-LEGGED MARATHON.
THAT'S ME AND DAD. WE'RE IN THE BOOK.
I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU ACCUTANE FOR THE ACNE
BUT YOU'LL NEED TO TAKE BIRTH CONTROL PILLS.
BIRTH CONTROL PILLS?
ACCUTANE IS A VERY EFFECTIVE MEDICATION
BUT IF YOU WERE TO GET PREGNANT WHILE TAKING IT
IT COULD CAUSE TERRIBLE BIRTH DEFECTS TO THE BABY.
OH, I WON'T HAVE SEX. I PROMISED MY MOM.
I BELIEVE YOU, NAVA
BUT IT'S MY POLICY TO GIVE BIRTH CONTROL PILLS
TO EVERY GIRL WHO TAKES ACCUTANE, OKAY?
I DON'T THINK MY MOM WILL LET ME TAKE THEM.
HAVE HER CALL ME. I'LL EXPLAIN IT TO HER.
I DON'T THINK SHE'LL CHANGE HER MIND.
OKAY, THEN, UM...
I'M AFRAID I CAN'T GIVE YOU THIS MEDICATION.
I BROUGHT YOU THESE.
HEY, THANKS.
WHAT'S THAT?
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT WANT TO READ UP
ON THE LATEST TREATMENT ADVANCES
ON PROTEIN "S" DEFICIENCY.
HEY, LOOK, I LIKE YOU, BUT I'M REALLY NOT WORTH IT.
THERE'S A LIST OF HOMELESS SHELTERS IN THERE.
IF YOU CAN'T GO HOME, YOU MIGHT AS WELL GO TO ONE
'CAUSE THERE, YOU COULD TAKE YOUR COUMADIN.
AND THEN WHAT?
MAYBE I CAN GET A JOB AT McDONALD'S?
YOU'RE A SMART GUY.
YOU GET A G.E.D.
MAYBE GO TO COLLEGE.
HEY, LOOK, WHAT'S THE USE?
WOULD YOU RATHER DIE ON THE STREETS?
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE CUTE WHEN YOU GET ANGRY.
IS THAT THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN RELATE TO ME
BY TURNING ME INTO A CUSTOMER?
YEAH, OKAY, I'LL READ THEM.
ANYTHING FOR YOU.
HEY.
CAN YOU WRITE ME A SCRIPT FOR BIRTH CONTROL PILLS?
THAT YOUNG LADY DECIDED TO TAKE THEM AFTER ALL?
YEAH, SHE SAID SHE WOULD.
YOU KNOW, UH...
YOU HAVE NO BUSINESS GIVING HER BIRTH CONTROL PILLS
BECAUSE SHE AND HER MOM DON'T WANT THEM, YOU KNOW?
AND, UH, WHAT IF SHE GOT PREGNANT?
WELL, YOU HEARD HER.
SHE'S NOT SEXUALLY ACTIVE.
SHE'S A TEENAGER. THAT DOESN'T GUARANTEE
SHE'S NOT GOING TO HAVE SEX.
YOU... YOU ARE UNDERMINING HER CHOICE.
GIVING HER BIRTH CONTROL WILL NOT MAKE HER HAVE SEX.
LISTEN, HOW WOULD YOU FEEL IF YOU WERE THAT GIRL
AND A WHITE NURSE CAME IN AND SAID
SHE DIDN'T TRUST YOU.
I WOULDN'T LIKE IT NO MATTER WHAT COLOR THE NURSE WAS.
ALL I'M SAYING IS YOU DON'T KNOW THAT GIRL
AND YOU DON'T KNOW HER MOTHER.
ARE YOU VOLUNTEERING TO TALK HER INTO IT?
NO. UH-UH.
I THINK IT'S WRONG FOR YOU
TO TRY TO FORCE BIRTH CONTROL ON THE GIRL.
WELL, MAYBE
BUT I'M NOT GOING TO TAKE ANY CHANCES.
OH, DR. CARTER
LABS ARE BACK ON BRAD ENLOE.
YOU SHOULD LOOK AT THEM.
HIS NEUTROPHIL COUNT'S OVER 1,000.
WE CAN'T ADMIT HIM.
WELL, AT LEAST HE'S NOT SEPTIC.
RIGHT. HE'S ONLY DYING OF LEUKEMIA.
HE VOMITED AFTER I GAVE HIM IBUPROFEN.
REALLY?
YEP.
WHEN?
A COUPLE OF MINUTES AGO.
HE'S DEHYDRATED.
WE'RE GOING TO ADMIT HIM AFTER ALL.
MALIK, WOULD YOU CALL UPSTAIRS AND TELL THEM
WE HAVE AN ADMIT FOR PEDES ONCOLOGY?
HE ONLY VOMITED ONCE.
I KNOW. MAKE THE CALL?
HE NEEDS TO BE REHYDRATED.
I CAN START AN I.V.
I DON'T THINK THAT YOU SHOULD DO ONE ON A KID.
I CAN DO IT.
HE'S BEEN THROUGH CHEMO. HIS VEINS ARE SCLEROSED.
NOT THIS ONE.
HEY, DOUG.
WRITE ME A SCRIPT FOR BIRTH CONTROL PILLS?
I THOUGHT WE WERE SWEARING THAT STUFF OFF.
IT'S FOR A PATIENT.
WHEN DID YOU HEAR?
A HALF HOUR AGO.
HEY, MARK.
UH, WHENEVER YOU HAVE A MINUTE?
UH, YEAH. I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.
KERRY KNOWS THIS E.R.
BETTER THAN ANYBODY WE COULD HIRE.
I AGREE
BUT THE COMMITTEE WANTS A STAR WITH A NATIONAL REPUTATION
WHO CAN BRING IN RESEARCH GRANTS.
A TRAUMA'S PULLING UP.
I'LL TELL HER.
YOU SURE? MARK?
NO SENSE IN TELLING KERRY SHE WAS OUR SECOND CHOICE.
IT WOULD ONLY DISAPPOINT HER EVEN MORE.
RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT, FORWARD, FORWARD.
HERE WE GO. HERE WE GO.
WHAT THE HELL?
TWO WACKO BROTHERS
GOT IN AN ARGUMENT ON THE EXPRESSWAY
AND LOST CONTROL OF THE VAN.
I'VE NEVER SEEN SUCH A HOLY MESS.
IDIOT, I SAID "TURN LEFT."
I'M SORRY, MARCUS.
YOU'RE A JACKASS.
I CAN'T BELIEVE I LET YOU DRIVE.
YOU NEVER WATCH THE ROAD.
EDDY AND MARCUS HANEY, CARPET LAYERS.
SEVERAL CANS OF CARPET CEMENT SPILLED.
THEY'RE STUCK TO THEIR SEAT.
WATCH YOURSELF. YOU GET STUCK, YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN.
YOU'RE A MORON, EDDY.
JUST RELAX. I KNOW, MARCUS.
HOW CAN I RELAX WHEN THAT IDIOT DID THIS?
OKAY, PULSE IS STRONG, PUPILS REACT TO LIGHT.
LYDIA, GIVE ME A GLOVE CHANGE OVER HERE.
THIS STUFF IS LIKE TAFFY.
HOW'S HE DOING?
WHOA.
WHAT IS IT?
UH... WE GOT AN IMPALEMENT OF SOME KIND.
OH, MY GOD.
IT LOOKS LIKE SOME KIND OF TOOL
WITH SHARP PRONGS.
OH, NO. NOT THE HAND STRETCHER.
FOUR-BY-FOURS.
EDDY...
DON'T MOVE SO MUCH.
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF HIM.
OH, MAN.
WE'VE GOT A BLEEDING MAN HERE.
LET'S TAKE HIM TO TRAUMA.
GENTLY.
MALIK, TRY AND GET SOME MONITOR LEADS ON.
HOW?
GET A TONGUE DEPRESSOR
SEE IF YOU CAN SCRAPE OFF A FEW SPOTS.
WHY'D EDDY STOP TALKING?
HOLD STILL.
MOVE ANOTHER INCH, YOU COULD KILL HIM.
PULSE OX IS FALLING.
STAND BY WITH INTUBATION.
I'LL GET A TRAY AND AN 8.0 E.T. TUBE.
( chuckling ): WOW!
I'M COVERING FOR DR. BENTON. NEED A CONSULT?
WE'VE GOT AN IMPALEMENT. WATCH OUT FOR THE GLUE.
LUCY, HAVE YOU EVER INTUBATED?
NO, BUT I'D LIKE TO.
UH, PRETTY TOUGH INTUBATION.
CARTER, YOU'LL TALK HER THROUGH IT.
GREAT.
UH, RUNS OF P.V.C.s WHEN HE'S JOSTLED.
PROBABLY FROM THE IMPALED TOOL AGAINST THE HEART.
CARTER, GET THE CRASH CART.
UH, LYDIA? THANK YOU.
MALIK, WE NEED A SAUERBRUCH CUTTER HERE
AS FAST AS YOU CAN.
HANG IN THERE, EDDY, ALL RIGHT?
YOU'RE GOING TO BE OKAY.
CARTER, I NEED YOU TO COME OVER HERE
AND CAREFULLY PULL MARCUS AWAY
SO THAT LUCY HAS ROOM TO INTUBATE.
OW.
CAN YOU GET IN THERE?
YEAH, JUST A LITTLE MORE.
LYDIA, GRAB THE CAMERA AND SNAP SOME PICTURES.
NEW POLICY: WE'RE DOCUMENTING OUR INTERESTING TRAUMAS.
TAKE HER THROUGH IT, CARTER.
ALL RIGHT, NOW PASS THE TUBE.
NOT TOO FAR.
ALL RIGHT, TAKE OUT THE SCOPE
PULL THE STYLET...
CONFIRM YOUR POSITION.
I'M IN, I THINK.
GOOD JOB.
LET'S CALL RESPIRATORY FOR A VENT.
I HEAR GOOD BREATH SOUNDS.
HE'S IN S.V.T.
WE NEED TO SHOCK HIM. NOT WHILE THEY'RE ATTACHED.
TRY SIX OF ADENOCARD.
PLEASE SAVE MY BROTHER.
CARTER, LET GO.
I'M STUCK!
CHARGING, 200.
CARTER, GET OUT OF YOUR GLOVES AND GOWN.
NO. MY BEARD IS STUCK.
Malik: GOT THE CUTTERS.
PULL BACK, CARTER.
Weaver: I NEED SOME EXPOSED SKIN!
( grunting )
I'M STUCK!
OKAY, READY? AND...
( yelling )
CLEAR!
GOT A PULSE.
GOOD JOB, EVERYBODY.
LET'S GET HIM TO THE O.R.
STILL WANT PICTURES?
MIGHT AS WELL.
CARTER?
CARTER, YOU ALL RIGHT?
YEAH, I THINK SO.
THANK YOU FOR SAVING MY BROTHER.
JUST DOING OUR JOB.
WE NEED TO EXTRICATE DR. CARTER
SO LUCY, WHY DON'T YOU START WITH HIS BEARD?
( snipping )
YOU MEAN HE WAS JUGGLING WHILE ON A POGO STICK?
YEAH, A GUY IN ZURICH.
WHAT ABOUT WHILE SKYDIVING?
ISABELLA RISHI FROM TANGIERS
HOLDS THE RECORD FOR JUGGLING FIVE BALLS.
NO WAY.
HOW LONG HAS HE BEEN AT IT?
UH, OVER THREE-AND-A-HALF HOURS.
WHAT'S THE RECORD?
11 HOURS, FOUR MINUTES, 22 SECONDS.
IT'S IN THE BOOK.
KATE'S DOCUMENTING THE EVENT.
THIS COULD BE OUR FIRST TIME ON TV.
LESS THAN EIGHT HOURS TO GO.
DAD!
JERRY, WATCH OUT!
HEY, CONGRATULATIONS.
I NEVER THOUGHT YOU'D UNSTICK
THE TWO GLUE BROTHERS.
( sighs )
I GUESS YOU CAN FIX ABOUT ANYTHING, HUH?
WE TRY.
BY THE WAY, I GOT A CALL
YOU PICKED UP A KID, KEVIN DULANEY?
WE GOT A WARRANT FOR HIS ARREST.
WHAT FOR?
PAROLE VIOLATION, PROSTITUTION. THE USUAL.
HOW LONG DO YOU EXPECT TO KEEP HIM?
IT'S HARD TO SAY.
WE'RE TREATING HIM FOR A BLOOD CLOTTING DISORDER.
GIVE ME A CALL WHEN YOU'RE READY TO RELEASE HIM.
I'LL HAVE A UNIT PICK HIM UP.
YEAH, I'M A DOCTOR. I'M NOT A COP.
HE NEEDS A SECOND CHANCE.
I'M A COP, NOT A SOCIAL WORKER.
YOU'RE DOING YOUR JOB; I'M DOING MINE.
IF THIS KID GETS BEAT UP IN JAIL, HE COULD BLEED TO DEATH.
IF I DON'T PICK HIM UP, SOMEBODY ELSE WILL.
NOW, I'LL HAVE A SITTER TO GUARD HIM
UNTIL YOU GIVE HIM A CLEAN BILL OF HEALTH.
YOU CAME PRETTY CLOSE.
AH, WE'LL TRY AGAIN LATER, HUH?
HEY. HI.
IS KATE READY TO BE DISCHARGED?
YEAH. JUST BRING HER BACK IN A WEEK FOR A CAST CHECK.
OKAY. NO JUMPING AROUND, THOUGH, RIGHT?
NOT FOR AT LEAST SIX WEEKS.
OKAY. I WANT TO THANK YOU
FOR BEING SO KIND. YOU'RE WELCOME.
THANKS. OKAY. BYE.
BUT I'LL MISS TONIGHT'S EVENT AT THE PIER.
I'M SORRY, SWEETHEART.
YOU WANT TO GO WATCH?
I GUESS. OKAY.
BRAD'S BED IS READY.
I'VE WRITTEN ORDERS FOR THE ONCOLOGY UNIT
TO CONTINUE TO REHYDRATE HIM.
THANK YOU, DR. CARTER.
YOU SHOULD FEEL FINE
IN A COUPLE OF DAYS.
GOOD LUCK WITH
YOUR NEW TREATMENT. THANKS.
MALIK, CAN YOU TAKE HIM OUT?
YEAH. SURE.
HE ISN'T DEHYDRATED, IS HE?
HE VOMITED. I GAVE HIM FLUIDS.
WHAT WILL ONCOLOGY SAY?
ALL THEY WANT IS A DIAGNOSIS TO JUSTIFY BRAD'S ADMISSION.
I GAVE HIM ONE. DEHYDRATION.
CAN YOU GIVE HIM AN I.V. EVEN IF HE DOESN'T NEED ONE?
IT WAS THE ONLY WAY TO GET HIM ADMITTED.
SO, YOU LIED?
TECHNICALLY, YEAH.
SOMETIMES YOU GOT TO WORK THE SYSTEM.
YOU LIED?!
MRS. ENLOE, I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE THERE.
DR. CARTER, IS IT TRUE BRAD'S NOT DEHYDRATED?
LOOK, IT'S A WAY FOR HIM TO GET THE CHEMO.
WHAT IF MY INSURANCE COMPANY FINDS OUT?
I SEE NO REASON WHY THEY SHOULD. I DO.
THEY ALREADY CHALLENGED THREE OF OUR CLAIMS
AND IF THEY FIND OUT ABOUT THIS
BRAD COULD LOSE HIS COVERAGE.
THEN WHAT DO WE DO WHEN HIS LEUKEMIA GETS WORSE?
MRS. ENLOE, I DON'T SEE ANY OTHER WAY
OF GOING ABOUT DOING THIS.
I'LL TALK TO YOU LATER.
COP STOPPED BY EARLIER.
HE WANTS TO TAKE YOU IN AFTER I DISCHARGE YOU.
WHAT DID YOU TELL HIM?
THAT YOU WERE SICK.
ARE THEY GOING TO PUT ME IN JUVIE?
THEY WANT TO.
I CAN'T GO BACK TO THAT PLACE.
I'M LIKE A PUNCHING BAG FOR THOSE GUYS.
I KNOW.
I GOT TO TELL YOU--
GETTING HEPARINIZED IS THE BEST TREATMENT.
THAT'S GREAT.
LISTEN, I CAN'T STICK AROUND HERE IF THE COPS ARE COMING.
I FIGURED YOU'D SAY THAT.
ARE YOU SETTING ME UP?
IF YOUR LEG STARTS TO HURT OR GETS SWOLLEN
YOU HAVE TO COME BACK.
HERE'S 50 BUCKS AND MY PAGER NUMBER.
COUMADIN AND A LIST OF SHELTERS.
I NEVER PROMISED YOU I'D TAKE THAT STUFF.
I KNOW.
MAYBE I'LL SEE YOU AROUND, HUH?
HEY, PETER, YOU MISSED A GREAT TRAUMA.
YEAH? I WAS OUT TALKING TO DR. PARKS.
WHAT DID YOU THINK OF HER?
WELL, YOU KNOW, SHE HAD THE AUDACITY TO TELL ME
THAT REESE NEEDS TO BE AROUND OTHER DEAF KIDS
MORE THAN HE NEEDS TO BE WITH ME.
YEAH. I, UH...
YOU KNOW, I SHOULD HAVE WARNED YOU.
LISA HAS VERY STRONG OPINIONS.
OPINIONS?
WELL, SHE DOESN'T MIND BEING DEAF.
SHE DOESN'T WANT TO BE CURED.
BUT I THOUGHT YOU'D WANT TO SEE WHAT SHE'S ACHIEVED.
LOOK, I DON'T WANT MY SON TO LIVE WITH A DEFECT
IF HE DOESN'T HAVE TO.
DEFECT?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?
IT MEANS, WHAT I DO WITH MY SON IS MY BUSINESS, ALL RIGHT?
BE SURE AND LET ME KNOW HOW THINGS WORK OUT, OKAY?
GOD BLESS YOU, SWEETHEART.
I, UH, THOUGHT THE NURSING HOME SAID THEY WOULDN'T
HAVE A BED AVAILABLE UNTIL TOMORROW.
WELL, STAN'S NOT GOING THERE.
WHAT YOU SAID EARLIER WAS RIGHT.
YOU NEED TO KNOW THE PATIENT'S COMMUNITY.
SO, I CALLED HIS TEMPLE.
ANOTHER DIABETIC MEMBER SAID HE'D STAY WITH STAN
UNTIL HE FOUND A NEW HEALTH AIDE.
GOOD IDEA.
DOESN'T HURT TO DO A LITTLE OUTREACH.
MR. KLONER WILL BE STAYING WITH YOU.
WHAT'S THAT SON OF A BITCH DOING HERE?
I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN.
( makes spitting sound )
I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE!
I'LL SEE YOU DEAD FIRST!
YOU OWE ME 20 GRAND
FOR THAT TIME SHARE IN FLORIDA!
IT'S A SHACK IN THE SWAMP.
THERE YOU ARE.
I'VE BEEN LOOKING EVERYWHERE FOR YOU.
I'M KIND OF LATE FOR AN APPOINTMENT, SO...
WHAT HAPPENED WITH BRAD?
HIS MOM TOOK HIM HOME.
SHE DECIDED NOT TO RISK IT.
I'M SORRY TO HEAR THAT.
ME, TOO.
I WOULDN'T HAVE ASKED SO MANY QUESTIONS
IF YOU HAD TOLD ME WHAT YOU WERE DOING.
WELL, I'M SORRY THAT YOU THOUGHT
IT WAS YOUR BUSINESS TO ASK ME.
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN?
HE'S GOING TO DIE.
HEY...
HEY, MARK...
I WAS JUST PUTTING TOGETHER
A YEAR-LONG COVERAGE SCHEDULE FOR THE E.R.
GOOD.
KERRY, I WANT TO TALK TO YOU.
IS IT ABOUT THE CHIEF POSITION?
THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE HAS DECIDED TO REOPEN THE SEARCH.
OH.
THE COMMITTEE FEELS
THAT THEY NEED A CANDIDATE WITH A NATIONAL REPUTATION.
PERSONALLY, I THINK IT STINKS.
WELL... THAT'S THAT.
YOU'RE NOT OUT OF THE RUNNING, KERRY.
IT'S... IT'S JUST REOPENED THE SEARCH.
NO.
AND I'M NOT INTERESTED
IN CONTINUING AS INTERIM CHIEF.
WHO'S GOING TO DO IT?
NOT MY PROBLEM.
I KNOW I SHOULDN'T HAVE YELLED AT HIM
BUT HE'S JUST SO DAMN SENSITIVE.
HOLD STILL, MARCUS.
HEY, WELCOME BACK.
I HEAR I MISSED QUITE A TRAUMA.
YOU CERTAINLY DID.
IT'S ALL MY FAULT.
EDDY WAS DRIVING AND I UPSET HIM, AND...
I WAS JUST UPSTAIRS.
THEY FINISHED THE SURGERY.
THEY REPAIRED THE WOUND
TO YOUR BROTHER'S HEART. HE'LL BE FINE.
OH, THANK GOD!
IT WAS DR. CORDAY HERE WHO FREED HIM JUST IN TIME.
AH... WELL, THAT DOESN'T SURPRISE ME.
SHE'S AN EXCELLENT DOCTOR.
LISTEN, WHEN YOU'RE FINISHED WITH MARCUS, WE'LL GRAB DINNER.
I BEG YOUR PARDON?
YOU'RE MY NEW INTERN.
I JUST GAVE YOU AN ORDER.
WOULD YOU EXCUSE US FOR A MOMENT?
PETER, ARE YOU SURE?
ELIZABETH, YOU'RE NO INTERN.
YEAH, YOU'LL STILL
HAVE TO DO SOME SCUT WORK
AND TAKE CALL EVERY THIRD NIGHT
BUT YOU'LL STILL HAVE YOUR OWN PATIENTS
AND YOU GET TO OPERATE WITH ME.
THANK YOU.
YEAH.
DON'T MENTION IT.
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.
AREN'T YOU ON TONIGHT?
YEAH.
I AM.
HEY.
HMM.
ARE YOU SURE YOU DON'T WANT ME TO GET YOU SOMETHING TO EAT?
I CAN RUN OVER TO DOC MAGOO'S.
NO. IT'S ALL RIGHT.
I GOT INDIGESTION THERE AT LUNCH.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
WELL, I MADE THE MISTAKE OF OPENING MY BIG MOUTH.
I TOLD ANSPAUGH THAT PEDES E.R. WAS RUNNING AT PEAK CAPACITY
SO NOW HE WANTS ME TO GIVE A DETAILED ANALYSIS
OF THE DAILY CENSUS.
WHEN WILL YOU BE HOME?
UH... AROUND APRIL.
I WON'T WAIT UP THEN.
GO HOME. GOOD NIGHT.
GOOD NIGHT.
HEY, DOC... WHERE YOU HEADED?
HOME. YOU?
BACK TO THE FIREHOUSE. WE'RE OFF DUTY.
LISTEN. UH...
SORRY I BROKE PROTOCOL THIS MORNING.
I THINK THE ADRENALINE GOT THE BEST OF ME.
USUALLY HAPPENS TO ME IN A COUPLE OF HOURS.
MY KNEES WON'T STOP SHAKING.
YOU GOT ANY CASH ON YOU?
I'M TAPPED OUT.
A BUNCH OF US ARE PLAYING POKER TONIGHT. WANT TO COME?
SURE.
WE'LL STOP BY THE READY TELLER.
HOP IN.
RIGHT.
( engine starting )
WHAT'S THE TIME WE HAVE TO BEAT?
UH, SIX HOURS AND 29 MINUTES.
WE'RE TRYING TO SET A NEW WORLD RECORD.
YOU'RE DOING GREAT, JEANIE.
THANKS FOR STEPPING IN.
MY PLEASURE.
ONLY SIX HOURS
24 MINUTES TO GO, RIGHT?
THAT'S RIGHT.
WHOO! COOL.
WHOO-HOO!
DR. WEAVER?
CARTER.
UH...
WHAT ARE YOU...
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
I CAME TO SEE ABOUT A ROOM FOR RENT.
IS THIS THE RIGHT ADDRESS?
IT IS.
I... I RENT OUT MY APARTMENT.
I HAVE A BASEMENT.
WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE IT?
UM, SURE.
YOU KNOW, I DON'T USUALLY ADVERTISE AT THE HOSPITAL
BECAUSE I ALWAYS THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE KIND OF, UM...
YOU KNOW, AWKWARD.
AH... SURE.
WELL, HEY, IF YOU'D... IF YOU'D RATHER NOT...
NO.
I WAS JUST...
JUST, UH, HAVING A DRINK.
WOULD YOU LIKE ONE?
SURE.
GOOD. GOOD.
DID YOU DO SOMETHING TO YOUR HAIR?
( phone ringing )
HELLO.
HEY, BABY.
OH, YOUR CENSUS REPORT.
NO. I...
YEAH, I THINK IT'S ON THE KITCHEN TABLE.
YOU WANT ME TO GET IT FOR YOU?
NO. NO. NO. NO. I CAN DO IT.
IT'S JUST GOING TO TAKE ME A MINUTE.
OKAY... SO JUST HOLD ON.
DON'T GET OUT OF THE TUB.
YOU LOOK ALL HAPPY.
DOUG!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
I CAME IN WITH THIS
BUT THEN I WAS THINKING
THAT I WAS WORKING ALL NIGHT LAST NIGHT.
YOU WERE?
MM-HMM.
AND I'M GOING TO BE WORKING ALL DAY TOMORROW.
YEAH?
SO, MAYBE I SHOULD TAKE TONIGHT OFF.
I THINK THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.
YOU LIKE THAT?
MM-HMM.
IS THAT A BUBBLE BATH?
WANT TO COME IN?
MM-HMM.
( laughing )
