GOOD. BUT KNOW WHEN TO ASK FOR HELP.
I WANT YOU TO TOAST THE NEW PEDES E.R. ATTENDING: ME.
I HAVE HEARD OF FOREIGN DOCTORS
WHO WERE WILLING TO START OVER AS INTERNS.
IF THEY AMPUTATE, IS IT CERTAIN I'LL LIVE?
IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S STOPPED LIKE TWO-AND-A-HALF BLOCKS.
MAYBE WE SHOULD HOOF IT FROM HERE.
I DON'T KNOW.
AREN'T YOU SUPPOSED TO BE SETTING POLICY?
I'M HERE FOR THE RIDE-ALONG.
I HATE ONE-WAY STREETS.
THIS IS NOTHING.
I ONCE RESPONDED TO A CELL PHONE CALL
FROM THE MIDDLE OF A METALLICA CONCERT.
TRY GETTING AN ANAPHYLACTIC HEAD BANGER

GUY DROPPED SOME ACID STARTED HIM COUNTING CROWS.
I LIVE WITH THIS EVERY DAY.
YOU GOT ANY PULL WITH CREW ASSIGNMENTS?
HEY, HEY, HEY.

HIS CHEST IS MOVING.

YOU'RE ASKING ME?
UNIT 57 TO O.C.D., OVER.
A LITTLE PUPPY VALIUM?
WE NEED ANIMAL CONTROL AT FOURTH AND ORCHID.
DOG BARRING ACCESS TO AN M.V.A. VICTIM, OVER.
IT'LL TAKE TOO LONG. LOOK AT THIS.
HE'S RIGHT. WE'VE GOT TO GET IN THERE.
WHAT DO YOU SUGGEST?
I GOT A GUN IN THE RIG.
I'LL KEEP HIM BUSY.
YOU'RE KIDDING, RIGHT?

THAT'S OKAY. I'LL PASS.
IT COULD BE WORSE. YOU COULD HAVE RABIES.
I WOULDN'T RULE IT OUT.
THINK WE'D NOTICE A DIFFERENCE?
( chuckling )
SO, HOW MANY INTERVIEWS TODAY?
TWO. YOU AND ONE OTHER.
I'M STILL INTERESTED
BUT I DECIDED NOT TO PUSH SO HARD.
I MEAN, IF I GET IT
YOU KNOW, I GET IT.
GOOD IDEA.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
IT'S JUST NOT A GOOD IDEA TO GET WORKED UP
OVER THESE THINGS.
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?
UGH, LONG STORY.
RACHEL'S SLEEPOVER?
GOOD GUESS.
THANKS, KERRY.
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?
TAGGERS WENT CRAZY LAST NIGHT.
YEAH?
YOU'RE ON?

COLOR-COORDINATED CHARTS?
WELL, WHOEVER SAID DOUG ROSS ISN'T ORGANIZED?

YEAH, WELL, PEDES NEEDS NURSES, RIGHT?
SO I'M BILLING YOU.
HEY, GET THIS.
19-YEAR-OLD, THIRD PREGNANCY
SAYS SHE DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO USE A CONDOM.
SO, DID YOU TEACH HER?
OH, NO, WE'RE WAY PAST THAT.
I'M TALKING HER INTO A NEWER PLAN.
ARE YOU SURE?
I'D TIE HER TUBES MYSELF, IF I COULD.
I DON'T KNOW, THE DRAWBRIDGE IS UP
YOU CAN'T STORM THE CASTLE.
EXCUSE ME?
TRY A DIAPHRAGM. THEY WORK.

SO HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN ON?
OH, JUST NOW.
YEAH? WHO'S YOUR RESIDENT?
OH, WELL I SUPPOSE I'LL FIND OUT IN A MINUTE.
WHY? DID YOU VIE FOR ME?
( laughs )
YOU'RE TOO MUCH FOR ME TO HANDLE.
( laughs )
HOPEFULLY, WHOEVER I GET FEELS THE SAME WAY.
NO, I SUSPECT I'LL BE SIDELINED AS A CONSULTANT
MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE.
YEAH.
HEY, DO ME A FAVOR.
REACH IN HIS BAG AND HAND ME HIS HEARING AID.
IT'S IN THE BLACK CASE, ON TOP.
IS HE HAVING TROUBLE WITH THESE?
NO.
SO WHY ARE YOU PUTTING THEM ON NOW?
I WAS RUNNING LATE.
PETER, HAVE YOU NOT TOLD EVERYONE?
TOLD WHO?
LOOK, ELIZABETH, I DON'T HAVE TIME
FOR A WHOLE BUNCH OF REPETITIVE QUESTIONS AND... AND SYMPATHY.
YOU SURE THAT'S IT?
MY SON IS DEAF. I KNOW THAT, OKAY?
OKAY. OKAY.
WELL, WISH ME LUCK.
JEFF WHITCHER, 38-YEAR-OLD MAGICIAN, INHALED FLASH POWDER.

TRAP DOOR DIDN'T OPEN.
A LITTLE MORE COMPLICATED THAN THAT.

YOU CAN'T SMOKE THAT HERE.
WASN'T PLANNING TO.
( coughing )
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?
GET A BLOOD GAS AND CHECK A pO2.
LOOKS LIKE YOU GET TO LEARN A NEW PROCEDURE.
I JUST HAPPEN TO HAVE A BLOOD GAS KIT RIGHT HERE.
HEY, PRETTY GOOD, DOC.
TRADE SECRET.
LILY, CAN YOU GET US A CUP OF ICE?
SURE.
WE'RE OUT OF GLOVES. I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
TRY YOUR POCKET.
HEY, HOW'D YOU DO THAT? HE'S GOT YOUR ARM.
IT'S NOT WHAT THEY SEE
IT'S WHAT THEY THINK THEY SEE.
BUT YOU DIDN'T EVEN MOVE.
LUCY? YES.
A BLOOD GAS.
THIS ONE YOU WATCH, NEXT ONE YOU DO.
DON'T PANIC, DOUG. IT'S JUST A COUPLE OF DAYS.
HONEY, YOU SAID THREE DAYS.
YOU SAID THREE.
TWO, THREE, WHATEVER.
YOU TOLD ME YOU WERE REGULAR AS A SWISS WATCH.
YEAH, I'M REGULAR, NOT A MACHINE.
ARE YOU GOING TO DO A PREGNANCY TEST, OR...?
YOU'RE REALLY SWEATING THIS.
AREN'T YOU, A LITTLE?
I'M NOT PREGNANT. I DON'T FEEL IT.
HAVE YOU BEEN PREGNANT BEFORE?
I SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID ANYTHING.
( woman speaking Spanish )
UH, CUANTO TIEMPO TIENE FAINTED... UM...
WHAT'S UP? WHAT HAPPENED?
SYNCOPE. FOURTH EPISODE.
SEIZURE? I DON'T THINK SO.
I THOUGHT YOU WEREN'T ON TODAY.
I'M NOT. LET'S USE THE PEDES ROOM, NO WAITING.
HERE WE GO... HEY, WHAT'S THIS?
COULD BE CARTER'S. THEY WERE BACKED UP.
CARTER! IS THIS YOUR BODY IN HERE?
YEAH, SORRY.
TRANSPORT'S TAKING FOREVER. YOU NEED THE ROOM?
YEAH, I NEED THE ROOM.
GIVE ME A HAND?
I DIDN'T THINK THE PEDES E.R. WAS OPEN UNTIL TOMORROW.
DON'T LEAVE YOUR STIFFS IN HERE.
LUCY, TAKE HIM TO THE MORGUE.
WE'VE BEEN WAITING ON A TRANSFER FOR THREE HOURS.
IS THIS THE PRINCE ALBERT? WHO?
HIS DING DONG'S PIERCED.
HE'S SUPPOSED TO HAVE A DIAMOND. IN HIS PENIS?
HALEH SAYS IT WAS TRICKY GETTING IN THE FOLEY.
WANT TO TAKE A PEEK? I'VE SEEN ONE.
I BET. HEY, WATCH IT.
I GUESS IT'S YOUR LUCKY DAY.
IT SEEMS I'M YOUR INTERN.
I KNOW. YOU MISSED ROUNDS.
OH, IT'S THE FIRST DAY.
I WASN'T SURE HOW THIS WAS GOING TO WORK.
YOU NEED TO BE HERE AT 5:00 A.M. SHARP.
I HOPE YOU DON'T EXPECT ANY SPECIAL TREATMENT.
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'VE BEEN TOLD
BUT THIS IS MORE OF A FORMALITY THAN ANYTHING ELSE.
MAYBE FOR YOU, BUT YOU'RE THE ONLY INTERN I HAVE.
I NEED YOU TO FINISH PRE-ROUNDING BEFORE 6:00.
I NEED ALL THE VITALS.
T-MAX, MENTAL STATUS, Is AND Os.
AFTER ROUNDS, CHECK THE LABS AND RUN DOWN ALL X RAYS.
GO OVER THE X RAYS YOURSELF.
DON'T TRUST THE RADIOLOGIST.
BUFF THE ELECTROLYTES AS NEEDED.
YOU TAKE ALL FLOOR CALLS.
IF WE HAVE CLINIC THAT DAY, YOU DO H&Ps
AND OF COURSE, ALL PRE-OP ORDERS:
C.B.C., LYTES, U.A., E.K.G., P.T.
I DO KNOW HOW TO PRE-OP A PATIENT, THANK YOU.
WELL, GOOD, BECAUSE IF SURGERY'S CANCELED
BECAUSE YOU MISS A LAB, IT'S YOUR ASS.
WE'LL START WITH MR. ANDERSON.
I REDUCED HIS O2.
REDRAW AN A.B.G. IN 30 MINUTES.
MONITOR URINE OUTPUT Q ONE HOUR.
ADVANCE DRAINS ON BEDS THREE AND FIVE.
ONE, TWO AND SIX NEED WET-TO-DRY DRESSING CHANGES.
( laughing ): YOU'RE SERIOUS.
THIS IS HOW IT WORKS.
AS THIRD YEAR, I'M BUSY OPERATING.
THIS STUFF IS NOT MY JOB
BUT THE SCUT HAS TO BE DONE...
BY AN INTERN.
I HAVE THREE CASES TODAY.
IF YOU FINISH, YOU CAN SCRUB IN FOR ONE.
OH, AND THIS IS FOR YOU.
INTERNS WEAR SHORT COATS.
Old Man: HOLD THE ELEVATOR!
HOLD IT!
YOU ALL RIGHT?
I SAID HOLD THE ELEVATOR.
Policeman: WHAT WAS HE WEARING?
I DON'T KNOW.
WHERE ARE WE?
MULTIPLE DEFENSIVE STAB WOUNDS TO THE EXTREMITIES.
A DEEP ONE TO THE FOREARM AND ONE TO THE CHEST.
B.P.'s 120/75. PULSE OX 99.
DID THE GUY HAVE FRIENDS WITH HIM?
BOTH LUNGS ARE CLEAR.
FOUR PLUS RIGHT RADIAL AND ULNAR PULSES.
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
BO.
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF YOU.
YEAH, YOU'RE VERY LUCKY.
THE CHEST WOUND IS SUPERFICIAL.
I WANT YOU TO DO THIS WITH YOUR HAND.
HOW ABOUT A CAR, BO? DID YOU SEE A CAR?
SPREAD YOUR FINGERS AND DON'T LET ME CLOSE THEM.
I'M TIRED OF THIS GAME.
JUST TELL ME WHO IT WAS.
DOES HE HAVE TO BE HERE?
WHY DON'T YOU WAIT OUTSIDE?
IT WAS BROAD DAYLIGHT.
YOU DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING?
YOU KNOW WHAT? WAIT OUTSIDE.
OKAY, LET'S ROLL HIM.
HE'S GOING TO GO OUT AND TRY AND SETTLE THIS ON HIS OWN.
RIGHT NOW WE HAVE TO TREAT HIM.
YOU KNOW WHAT? FORGET IT.
HAVE IT YOUR WAY.
YOU COULD HAVE PRESSED THAT HOLD BUTTON.
DAMN, THESE ELEVATORS ARE SLOW.
I'M GOING TO CATCH THAT LUNCH TRAFFIC
I KNOW IT.
YOU DRIVE?
A LOT. ( pager beeping )
MY SON USED TO HAVE ONE OF THOSE.
GAVE HIM A HEART ATTACK.
NOTHING BUT STRESS.
COME ON. COME ON.
BUT THE PART I SAW LOOKED PRETTY BENIGN.
IT WAS MY FAULT. SORRY.
WELL, YOU DID. THANKS.
PROBLEM?
DID YOU KNOW THAT ROMEO AND JULIET IS RATED PG-13?
I WASN'T AWARE OF IT, NO.
WELL, IT IS, AND I SHOWED IT AT RACHEL'S SLUMBER PARTY
AND NOW ALL THE MOTHERS ARE CALLING ME.
OH, YEAH.
ELIZABETH?
ELIZABETH!
CAN YOU COME TAKE A LOOK AT A PULSELESS FOOT?
I'VE BEEN WAITING 40 MINUTES FOR A SURGICAL CONSULT.
NORMALLY I WOULD, BUT AS OF TODAY I'M ONLY AN INTERN.
I HEARD ABOUT THAT. I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT.
I DON'T WANT TO BELIEVE IT MYSELF.
I ALREADY HAVE FIVE ADMISSIONS.
LAB TURNAROUND TIME IS PATHETIC
AND RADIOLOGY HAVE ALREADY LOST THREE OF MY FILMS.
MEANWHILE, DALE HAS ME SITTING FOR A BLEEDING TIME
ON YOUR EWING SARCOMA AMPUTATION
WHICH IS A COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME.
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT DANA ELLIS?
YES. SHE DOESN'T HAVE A CLOTTING PROBLEM.
IS THAT TODAY?
SURGERY'S SCHEDULED FOR 4:00 P.M.
FIVE MINUTES. 54-YEAR-OLD MALE
PERIPHERAL VASCULAR DISEASE, CATH PAIN AT REST.
I'M THINKING ARTERIAL THROMBOSIS.
DID YOU GET A DOPPLER PULSE?
YEAH. MR. DARCY, THIS IS DR. CORDAY OUR SURGICAL RESIDENT.
HOW LONG WILL THIS KEEP ME OUT OF COMMISSION?
I'M SUPPOSED TO CHOREOGRAPH A MUSIC VIDEO NEXT WEEK.
WELL, LET ME EXAMINE YOU FIRST
AND I'LL HAVE A CLEARER IDEA.
ARE YOU A SMOKER?
YES, BUT WHAT HAS THAT GOT TO DO WITH MY LEG?
THIS THE VASCULAR CONSULT?
YEAH. I ASKED DR. CORDAY TO EXAMINE.
I'LL TAKE OVER. DID YOU GET THE LABS
ON THE PERFED DIVERTICULUM?
NOT READY YET.
BETTER GO DOWN THERE AND SIT ON THEM.
YOU KNOW ROMANO-- GOT TO START ON TIME.
OF COURSE.
COME ON.
LUCY?
WHAT?
IS SOMETHING WRONG? NOPE.
CAN YOU WORK UP THIS GUY WITH VERTIGO FOR ME?
YOU KNOW HOW TO CHECK FOR NYSTAGMUS AND CEREBELLAR FUNCTION?
YEAH? ALL RIGHT.
COME FIND ME WHEN YOU'RE DONE.
WE'LL DISCUSS THE DIFFERENTIAL.
GOT IT.
WHAT'S THE EXTENSION FOR THE MORGUE?
5001.
SEE THIS GUY?
HE'S LOOKING FOR DR. CARTER.
CAN I HELP YOU?
YEAH. MY BROTHER DIED LAST NIGHT.
THEY GAVE ME HIS VALUABLES
BUT THERE'S SOMETHING MISSING.
I NEED TO GET A...
WELL, SOME JEWELRY OFF HIS BODY.
OH, RIGHT. RIGHT.
OH, YOUR BROTHER'S DOWN IN THE MORGUE.
LAST NAME NAUGHTON? YES, YES.
DEFINITELY DOWN IN THE MORGUE.
OH... CAN YOU TELL ME HOW TO GET THERE?
YEAH. NO.
UH, THEY DON'T ALLOW FAMILY DOWN THERE.
IT'S, UH...
THEY MAKE YOU WAIT.
IT TAKES FOREVER.
IT'S CHILLY.
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M GOING TO DO?
I'M GOING TO GO DOWN THERE AND I'M GOING TO GET IT.
YOUR BROTHER. GET YOUR BROTHER
AND BRING HIM BACK UP HERE FOR YOU.
GREAT.
THAT'D BE GREAT. THANK YOU.
DON'T MENTION IT.
HEY.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
JUST CAME IN TO CHECK IN ON YOU.
HOW YOU FEELING?
WELL, THEY'RE CHOPPING MY LEG OFF.
YEAH.
YOUR DECISION?
YOU COULD CALL IT THAT.
I WOULDN'T HAVE HAD A SAY AT ALL IF IT WASN'T FOR YOU.
GOT TO GO WITH THE ODDS, RIGHT?
YOU SCARED?
I THOUGHT, "OKAY, I'LL JUST GET USED TO IT."
BUT...
YOU IN PAIN?
A LITTLE.
YEAH. OKAY, I'LL TALK TO THEM AND INCREASE YOUR DOSAGE.
THAT'S OKAY. I SORT OF...
LIKE TO FEEL IT.
IT'LL BE GONE IN A FEW HOURS.
( door opens )
HI, MR. ELLIS.
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?
JUST CAME IN TO CHECK IN ON DANA.
SHE'S BEING TAKEN CARE OF, THANK YOU.
MM-HMM. LISTEN, I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT HER PAIN MANAGEMENT.
DANA'S HAVING SURGERY IN A FEW HOURS.
IF YOU DON'T MIND
DR. ROMANO IS GOING TO HANDLE EVERYTHING FROM HERE.
OKAY.
EXCUSE ME.
ARE YOU IN CHARGE OF TRANSPORT?
DEPENDS WHO'S ASKING.
I KNOW THIS IS GOING TO SOUND REALLY WEIRD
BUT I WAS JUST WONDERING IF YOU, BY ANY CHANCE, FOUND A BODY.
( phone rings )
TRANSPORT.
YEAH, WHAT FLOOR?
OKAY.
I DON'T KNOW. HALF HOUR.
DAMN!
WHAT DID YOU WANT?
I LOST A BODY.
RIGHT. DID YOU TRY TO MOVE IT YOURSELF?
WELL, YEAH, YOU GUYS WERE TAKING TOO LONG.
WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED TO DO?
SO NOW IT'S OUR FAULT.
NO, IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.
I JUST WANT TO FIND THE BODY.
I'LL CALL THE MORGUE.
I ALREADY CHECKED THE MORGUE; HE'S NOT THERE.
YO, GERALD!
YO, IT'S TONY.
YOU HAVE ANY UNCLAIMED BODIES DOWN THERE?
YEAH, SHE'S HERE NOW.
HOLD ON, I'LL ASK.
WOULD THIS BODY FIT DOWN THE INCINERATOR CHUTE?
THE INCINERATOR?
YEAH, THAT GOT HER.
YO, THANKS, G.
OKAY, I'LL BE RIGHT DOWN.
YOU'RE IN LUCK. SOMEONE STUFFED
SOME FAT STIFF IN THE CLOSET OF THE I.C.U.
WHY? WHY DO YOU HAVE TO GO?
I JUST GOT TO.
WELL, WHAT'S THE HURRY?
DOCTOR SAID IT WAS OKAY.
WELL, IT WILL BE OKAY.
HE HAS TO STITCH IT UP FIRST.
BESIDES, I LIKE HAVING YOU AROUND.
THERE'S NOT VERY MANY INTERESTING PEOPLE HERE TODAY.
SO, MAYBE... I'LL COME BACK.
COME ON, YOU'VE GOT TO HELP ME OUT.
YOU DON'T WANT TO GET ME IN TROUBLE, DO YOU?
I'LL WRITE YOU A NOTE.
BESIDES, YOU DO NOT WANT TO GET THAT INFECTED, BELIEVE ME.
LOOK, JUST A FEW MINUTES.
I'LL GET A DOCTOR, WE'LL TAKE CARE OF IT.
ALL RIGHT.
GOOD.
HEY, LYNETTE. YEAH.
COULD YOU GET THIS BOY'S MOTHER FOR ME?
OH. HE'S 18.
YEAH, BUT HE'S A GANGBANGER-- GOT STABBED.
I'M AFRAID HE'S GOING TO BOLT TO SETTLE THE SCORE. MARK.
YEAH, HOLD ON A MINUTE.
YOU ADMITTING THAT THROMBOSIS?
HE'S GOT A HIGH-GRADE LESION IN THE FEMORAL ARTERY.
I KNOW. YOU TAKING HIM UP?
WELL, I NEED TO PRESENT HIM TO ROMANO
AND THEN WE'LL BRING DOWN THE WHOLE TEAM.
WHEN? AS SOON AS I CAN.
MARK, CAN YOU STITCH UP MY GUY?
HE'S GETTING ANTSY. I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.
LOOK, JEANIE, CAN YOU CLEAR THIS NECK FOR ME?
HE LOOKS OKAY. SINGLE VEHICLE M.V.A.
I ORDERED A TRAUMA PANEL. SURE, YOU GOT IT.
THANK YOU. SURE.
HOW WE DOING IN HERE?
VITALS ARE NORMAL.
I'M FINE.
DID YOU LOSE CONSCIOUSNESS, MR. LIPSON?
NO. LISTEN, I TOLD THEM THIS REALLY WASN'T NECESSARY.
ANY CHEST OR ABDOMINAL PAIN?
CAN I GO HOME?
NO. WE NEED TO GET AN X-RAY OF YOUR NECK FIRST.
HAVE YOU EVER HAD HEPATITIS?
I DON'T THINK SO. WHY?
YOUR EYES ARE A LITTLE YELLOW.
ON ANY MEDICATION?
PREDNISONE, CYCLOSPORIN, IMURAN.
THOSE ARE TRANSPLANT MEDS.
WELL, I HAD A NEW LIVER TWO YEARS AGO.
OKAY. LET'S GET A PROTIME
L.F.T.s AND A CYCLOSPORIN LEVEL.
SOMETHING'S WRONG?
DOCTOR, DOCTOR, POR FAVOR VENGA.
JUST ONE MINUTE. YOU'RE JAUNDICED.
HUBO UN EQUIVOCACION. LO TIENE QUE COMPONER.
WE NEED TO DO THOSE TESTS NOW.
I'LL BE BACK.
LE DIJERA A LA SENORA QUE NO TENIA MI NUMERO.
PERO MI PRIMA ME TRAJO MI TARJETA.
EL NIÑO LO NECESITA PARA RECIBIR TRATAMIENTO.
OKAY, JUST...
THANKS.
NO TE PREOCUPES, CARMEN. YA LLEGUE.
UM, THIS-THIS IS YOUR CARD.
ROSA MUÑOZ.
SI. ES SOCIAL... SOCIAL SECURITY CARD.
SHE SAID HER NAME WAS CARMEN.
ROSA CARMEN, SI.
AND YOUR NAME?
LUISA.
HER SISTER?
PRI... UM, COUSINS.
OKAY. I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU'RE CONCERNED
FOR ANGEL'S HEALTH, BUT THIS WOULD BE FRAUD.
IT DOESN'T MATTER IF HE'S ILLEGAL.
OH, NO, NO, NO. THAT'S HER NUMBER.
NO, THIS IS YOUR CARD.
NO.
NO. DILE QUE EL NECESITA DOCTOR ESPECIAL...
NO. UM...
SHE SAY THAT HE NEED A SPECIAL DOCTOR?
A CARDIOLOGIST. THERE COULD BE A PROBLEM WITH ANGEL'S HEART.
PLEASE TAKE THIS NUMBER.
PLEASE. OTHER HOSPITAL NO TAKE HIM...
MRS. MUÑOZ, WE'RE A COUNTY HOSPITAL.
WE TREAT ALL EMERGENCIES.
TRUE?
TRUE.
SOMETIMES WHEN WE'RE SHORT ON BEDS
WE STICK THE BODIES IN THE STORAGE ROOM.
WHY DIDN'T YOU CALL US? WE DID.
YOU GUYS, I GOT TO GET BACK.
WELL, DO YOU WANT TO TAKE HIM BACK OR SHOULD I?
HE'S BLACK.
THAT A PROBLEM?
DANA ELLIS-- WHAT ABOUT HER?
WELL, I'M WORRIED ABOUT PHANTOM LIMB PAIN.
WELL, DON'T BE-- SHE'S ON MORPHINE.
THAT'S NOT GOING TO DO IT.
I WANT TO PUT HER ON A PREEMPTIVE ANALGESIA TO REWIRE THE MOTOR NERVES.
I DIDN'T REALIZE SHE WAS STILL YOUR PATIENT.
DR. ROMANO, DR. GREENE IS ON LINE THREE FROM THE E.R.
WAITING ON A CONSULT ON AN ISCHEMIC LEG.
DOES HE HAVE A PULSE BY DOPPLER?
I'LL CHECK.
IT'S A SIMPLE LUMBAR EPIDURAL.
IT'S ONLY GOING TO HAVE TO PUT THE SURGERY OFF A FEW DAYS.
LOOK, I HATE TO BE THE ONE TO TELL YOU
BUT ONE NIGHT COURSE DOES NOT A PAIN MANAGEMENT SPECIALIST MAKE.
YES, THE PATIENT HAS A DOPPLER PULSE.
DR. GREENE WANTS AN E.T.A.
WHEN I GET THERE.
THERE'S NO REASON NOT TO TRY IT, ALL RIGHT?
I DON'T KNOW THAT SHE'S PSYCHOLOGICALLY READY FOR THE SURGERY.
THREE DAYS ISN'T GOING TO MAKE MUCH DIFFERENCE.
DALE, HOW'S THAT NEW INTERN WORKING OUT?
SHE'LL GET THE HANG OF IT.
WHY DON'T YOU GIVE HER A BREAK
AND LET HER SCRUB IN ON THIS PERFED TIC.
I'M GOING TO TALK TO THE FAMILY. HEY, NO, YOU'RE NOT.
THAT GIRL HAS A TUMOR IN HER LEG AND I WON'T SIT IDLY BY
SO YOU CAN EXPERIMENT WITH SOME TECHNIQUE
YOU JUST READ ABOUT LAST WEEK. I'M WORRIED
THAT SHE'LL FEEL PAIN IN A LEG THAT ISN'T THERE.
DR. ROMANO. WHAT?!
MAYBE YOU SHOULD TALK TO DR. GREENE.
HE WANTS SOMETHING MORE DEFINITIVE.
IF THE GUY'S GOT CALF PAIN, TELL HIM TO DO AN ULTRASOUND.
HEY, DON'T GO ANYWHERE.
AND RULE OUT D.V.T.
THAT'LL SHUT HIM UP FOR A WHILE.
LEAVE IT ALONE, ROSS!
HEY, CAROL, I HAVE TO HEAD UPSTAIRS TO THIS INTERVIEW.
WILL YOU PAGE ME THE SECOND ROMANO DECIDES
TO GRACE US WITH HIS PRESENCE?
HEY, DON'T HOLD YOUR BREATH.
HOLD STILL. YOU'LL TEAR YOUR STITCHES.
WOULD YOU LET ME OUT OF HERE?
I GOT TO GO. WHY? WHY?
SO YOU CAN TAKE CARE OF THE GUY THAT DID THIS TO YOU?
HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON?
BO HERE WANTS TO RETALIATE.
YOU SAID THAT DOCTOR STITCHED ME UP AND THEN I CAN GO!
WE JUST WANT YOU TO BE SAFE, BO.
YEAH, WELL, SAVE IT LADY.
LOOK, MA'AM, THANKS FOR FIXING ME.
I'M GOING. HEY, WAIT!
IF YOU WANT ME TO SIGN SOMETHING, I'LL SIGN IT!
DON'T DO THAT! YOU'LL RIP YOUR VEIN OPEN.
I DON'T WANT TO HAVE YOU BLEEDING ALL OVER THE PLACE.
THEN TAKE IT OUT. OKAY.
YOU WANT TO LEAVE THAT BAD? THAT'S FINE.
LET ME GET THE RIGHT INSTRUMENT, I'LL TAKE IT OUT
YOU CAN GO ABOUT YOUR BUSINESS.
PLEASE JUST WAIT HERE. JUST WAIT ONE MINUTE.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
WHAT'S GOING ON?
WE CAN'T LET HIM LEAVE.
WELL, WHEN'S THE MOTHER GETTING HERE?
HAVEN'T REACHED HER YET.
I'M CALLING DOWN PSYCH.
HE'LL BE GONE BY THEN.
WHAT IS THAT?
VERSED. I'M GOING TO HAVE TO SEDATE HIM
TILL THE MOTHER GETS HERE.
THAT MIGHT BE AN OPTION IF IT WASN'T TOTALLY UNETHICAL.
OH, NOT WITH SOMEONE'S LIFE AT STAKE.
YOU CAN'T RESTRAIN SOMEONE WITH DRUGS.
HE WAS AGITATED.
TO FINISH THE TREATMENT, WE HAD TO SEDATE HIM.
SECURITY CAN KEEP HIM DOWN HERE UNTIL PSYCH PUTS HIM ON HOLD.
THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO PROVE
THAT THE KID IS A DANGER TO OTHERS.
HE KNOWS THE SYSTEM. HE'LL JUST LIE.
WELL, MAYBE WE'LL FIND HIS MOTHER BY THEN.
I'M GOING TO MAKE SURE.
NOT WITH THAT.
YOU HAVE A BETTER IDEA?
I'LL HANDLE IT.
YOU KNOW WHAT HE'LL DO
IF YOU DON'T.
I UNDERSTAND YOUR MOTIVE
AND I KNOW I ASKED FOR YOUR HELP.
WHY DON'T YOU STICK WITH THE CLINIC PATIENTS.
LEAVE THE E.R. ONES TO ME, ALL RIGHT?
GOOD LUCK.
WELL, I DON'T WANT YOU ENDING UP HERE AGAIN... MAYBE DEAD.
IF IT GOES DOWN LIKE THAT, IT GOES DOWN LIKE THAT.
IT WOULDN'T BE THE FIRST TIME.
YOU DON'T MEAN THAT.
YO! WHAT'S THE RENT-A-COP DOING HERE?
I WANT YOU TO BE ABLE TO TALK TO SOMEBODY.
DAMN! I TRUSTED YOU.
HEY, I'M JUST TRYING TO HELP YOU.
SAVE IT, LADY. I AIN'T TALKING TO NOBODY.
OKAY. WE'LL JUST WAIT UNTIL YOUR MOM GETS HERE.
MY MOM? WHAT, YOU CALLED MY MOM?
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
DON'T LET HIM LEAVE.
Romano: PAY ATTENTION, DALE.
PETER IS ONE OF THE FASTEST COLON DISSECTORS AROUND
NOW THAT LIZZIE'S GUN'S IN THE HOLSTER FOR A WHILE.
ALL RIGHT. WE'VE GOT AN OPEN ABDOMEN, PEOPLE.
LET'S TURN UP THE HEAT, PLEASE.
ELIZABETH, WOULD YOU RETRACT THE DESCENDING COLON
WHILE I FREE UP THE PERITONEAL REFLECTION?
MY PLEASURE.
UH, ACTUALLY, DALE, WHY DON'T YOU RETRACT THE BOVIE
AND GIVE LIZZIE THE SUCKER.
RIGHT. LIZZIE, SUCK OUT THIS OOZING AREA, WOULD YOU?
IF YOU DON'T MIND, I'VE NEVER CARED FOR BEING CALLED LIZZIE.
Dale: DR. ROMANO CALLS YOU THAT ALL THE TIME.
Benton: DALE, WHAT STRUCTURE AM I DISSECTING?
UH, ILEOINGUINAL NERVE.
OH, BOY.
ELIZABETH, WOULD YOU
HELP HIM OUT, PLEASE?
OWING TO THE SLIGHT PERISTALSIS
IT'S THE LEFT URETER.
BETTER GET A LITTLE FASTER
WITH THAT SUCTION, LIZZIE.
Benton: OKAY. I'VE FREED THE SIGMOID.
ELIZABETH, WOULD YOU LIGATE THE PROXIMAL SIDE
WHILE I CLAMP THE VESSELS FROM BELOW, PLEASE?
CERTAINLY.
DALE, MOVE OVER. LET ME IRRIGATE.
Romano: I'D PREFER DALE DO ANY LIGATING.
SORRY TO BOTHER YOU, DR. ROMANO
BUT DR. GREENE IS CALLING AGAIN.
OOPS. LIZZIE, I THINK YOU JUST
CONTAMINATED YOURSELF.
I DID NOT.
BETTER BE SAFE; CHANGE GOWNS.
I DIDN'T CONTAMINATE MYSELF.
I SAW IT. SHE'S CLEAN.
THANK YOU. SO DON'T PICK ON HER.
LIZZIE, SCRUB OUT
AND GO PACIFY GREENE, WOULD YOU?
Weaver: HEY. YOU'RE STILL HERE.
YEAH.
YOU'RE PUTTING A LOT OF EFFORT
INTO THIS PEDES E.R., I'LL GIVE YOU THAT.
WELL, I'LL TAKE IT.
HEY, GUYS. HEY.
THIS IS OUR NEW PEDES E.R. ATTENDING
AND FULL-TIME DELIVERY BOY, DOUG ROSS.
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT FOR US?
YOU'RE CUT OFF. HE'S A BAD TIPPER.
Greene: THIS IS CLAUDIA OLSEN. SHE'S ONE
OF THE CANDIDATES FOR CHIEF OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE.
Ross: OH, A MASOCHIST?
Olsen: YEAH.
KERRY WEAVER.
THE INTERIM CHIEF.
YEAH. IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU.
I TAKE IT YOU'RE INTERVIEWING TODAY AS WELL.
( laughing ): HOW DID YOU GUESS?
WELL, AT LEAST I GOT TO GO FIRST.
IT WAS NICE TO MEET YOU.
YOU, TOO.
Jeanie: IT COULD BE HEPATITIS
BUT OUR MAJOR CONCERN IS THAT YOU'RE REJECTING THE LIVER.
WELL, I FEEL FINE; A LITTLE TIRED.
DO YOU EVER FORGET TO TAKE YOUR MEDS?
NO. I SET MY WATCH DAILY.
MY CYCLOSPORIN LEVEL'S THERAPEUTIC, ISN'T IT?
MM-HMM. I THINK WE SHOULD ARRANGE FOR A LIVER BIOPSY.
IF IT'S ALL THE SAME TO YOU
I WOULD REALLY RATHER SEE MY OWN DOCTOR.
I UNDERSTAND, BUT HE HASN'T SAID ANYTHING TO YOU
ABOUT YOUR ABNORMAL L.F.T.s?
NO. I GOT BUSY; MISSED A COUPLE OF CHECKUPS.
WELL, I'M SURE YOU KNOW HOW IMPORTANT FOLLOW-UPS ARE
AFTER ORGAN TRANSPLANTATION.
I THINK PART OF ME ALWAYS SUSPECTED
BUT DIDN'T WANT TO KNOW FOR SURE.
NOW I DO.
YOU CAN ALWAYS PUT YOURSELF ON THE UNOS LIST AGAIN.
I DON'T THINK SO.
SECOND TIME AROUND?
YOU QUALIFIED THE FIRST TIME.
YOU NEVER KNOW. YOU COULD GET LUCKY AGAIN.
HI.
YOU HAVE THE MUNOZ KID?
I DO. YES. EXCUSE ME ONE MORE TIME. EXCUSE ME.
IS IT CARDIOMYOPATHY?
THE BOY'S GOING TO NEED A FULL E.P. WORKUP.
DID HE HAVE AN ECTOPY?
NO, AND THE ECHO RULED OUT AN OUTLET OBSTRUCTION.
SO THE CAUSE OF HIS FAINTING...?
Together: IT'S PROBABLY ARRHYTHMIA.
I'M GOING TO TRY TO INDUCE IT IN THE CATH LAB
AND IF SO, HE'S GOING TO NEED
AN INTERNAL CARDIOVERTER DEFIBRILLATOR RIGHT AWAY.
OKAY. I'M GLAD WE CAUGHT IT.
YEAH. I'LL CALL A CARDIAC SURGEON. CAN YOU GET CONSENT?
SURE. THANK YOU.
DON'T THANK ME. THE KID NEEDS IT.
YEAH.
MUCHISIMAS GRACIAS, MUCHISIMAS GRACIAS.
POR FIN VA RECIBIR EL TRATAMIENTO QUE NECISITA.
QUE DIOS LA BENDIGA.
IT'S ABOUT TIME. WHERE'S ROMANO?
JUST ME, I'M AFRAID.
SO, CAN YOU ADMIT HIM?
BASED ON MY OTHER RESPONSIBILITIES, I'D SAY NO.
SO YOU'RE HERE TO STALL ME?
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
THAT'S ALL RIGHT. I'LL PASS HIM THROUGH RADIOLOGY.
HE NEEDS AN ANGIOGRAM ANYWAY
BUT TELL ROMANO YOU ONLY BOUGHT HIM 20 MINUTES.
DON'T LEAVE THE PATIENT THERE TOO LONG.
RADIOLOGISTS SNATCH THE PROCEDURES FOR THEMSELVES
IF THE SURGEONS ARE SLOW ON THE UPTAKE.
NOTED. THANK YOU.
YEAH? UH, JEANIE?
ON WHO? HERE'S THE B.A. ON YOUR M.P.A.
LIPSON; TRAUMA TWO.
I DIDN'T ORDER A B.A.
I DID. IT'S PART OF THE TRAUMA PANEL. RANDI PUT IT IN MY BOX.
HEY... IS SOMETHING WRONG?
BLOOD ALCOHOL'S .04.
THAT'S WELL BELOW THE LEGAL LIMIT.
IT STILL MEANS HE'S BEEN DRINKING.
I FINISHED MY WRITE-UP ON THE VERTIGO--
I THINK IT'S JUST A VIRUS-- AND I GOT YOU SOME COFFEE.
YOU DON'T NEED TO DO THAT.
WELL, I WAS DOWN IN THE CAFETERIA
LOOKING FOR SOMETHING ANYWAY.
ALL RIGHT. THANKS. I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.
WHY DON'T YOU START THE I.V. ON THE FOUR-YEAR-OLD
WITH GASTROENTERITIS IN CURTAIN ONE--
500cc BOLUS OF SALINE-- BUT BE CAREFUL.
SHE'S DEHYDRATED. COULD BE TRICKY.
RIGHT.
HEY, THANKS A LOT. I FEEL SO MUCH BETTER.
GLAD TO HEAR IT.
CALL ME IF YOU'D LIKE SOME FREE TICKETS TO MY SHOW.
THANK YOU.
OOH!
ARE YOU OKAY?
HOW'D THAT GET THERE?
THERE YOU GO.
I JUST DIDN'T WANT THINGS DISAPPEARING ON YOU. SEE YOU.
SAY, YOU HAVEN'T, BY ANY CHANCE, SEEN A BOD...?
OH, CAROL, COULD YOU HELP ME START AN I.V.?
SHE'S DEHYDRATED. I DON'T WANT TO HURT THE KID.
NOT YET. HAVE YOU TRIED?
SO YOU HAVEN'T EVEN STARTED AN I.V. YET?
HONESTLY? NO.
THIS IS RIDICULOUS, LUCY. EVERYONE THINKS YOU CAN.
I KNOW. I'M GOING TO TALK TO DR. CARTER TODAY.
WELL, IF YOU DON'T, I WILL.
HEY! HEY!
WHAT HAPPENED?
HE TOOK OFF.
I CAN SEE THAT. YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO STOP HIM.
THERE WAS NO TALKING HIM DOWN.
YOU WEREN'T SUPPOSED TO NEGOTIATE.
YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO STOP HIM FROM LEAVING.
I CAN'T KEEP HIM HERE UNTIL YOU GET THE HOLD.
HE DIDN'T KNOW THAT.
SORRY.
Ross: HOLD STILL. I WANT TO SECURE THIS CATHETER.
HANG ON. DOING GREAT.
HOW MUCH LONGER?
A LITTLE BIT. JUST A SECOND HERE.
OKAY. NOW, YOU'RE GOING TO ROLL BACK OVER ON YOUR BACK, OKAY?
NICE AND EASY.
HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO WORK?
ABOUT 20 MINUTES FOR THE FULL EFFECT.
YOU'RE GOING TO START FEELING THINGS PRETTY SOON, THOUGH.
I'M GOING TO PUT YOU ON A SIX-DAY CYCLE--
THREE DAYS BEFORE THE SURGERY, THREE DAYS AFTER, FOR THE DRIP.
DR. ROMANO.
DR. ROSS.
HI, DANA.
I DECIDED I WANTED THE EPIDURAL.
YOU DID?
YOU WERE IN SURGERY
SO I EXPLAINED THE PROTOCOL.
AND THE PARENTS?
THEY'RE ON BOARD.
TERRIFIC.
YOU GOT A SECOND?
SURE. ALL RIGHT.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
YOU DID GREAT.
CONGRATULATIONS. YOU JUST POSTPONED THE SURGERY.
YOU DIDN'T GIVE ME A LOT OF OPTIONS.
THAT PEDES ATTENDING THING JUST BARELY HAPPENED.
I VOTED FOR IT BECAUSE I THOUGHT
"THE GUY'S A MAVERICK; SHAKE THINGS UP EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE."
BUT IF YOU WANT TO PLAY JOHN WAYNE
DO IT DOWN IN THE E.R. AND NOT UP HERE WITH MY PATIENTS.
THIS GIRL IS IN A VERY VULNERABLE PLACE.
THREE DAYS IS NOT A LOT TO ASK...
YOU'RE NOT HEARING ME, ROSS.
THIS IS NOT ABOUT BEING RIGHT.
HELL, WE ALL THINK WE'RE RIGHT.
IT DOESN'T MAKE YOU SPECIAL.
FINE.
DID YOU GIVE THE KID A CHEESEBURGER
BEFORE OR AFTER THE PARENTS AGREED TO THE PROTOCOL?
I THOUGHT I MIGHT NEED 24 HOURS TO TALK THEM INTO IT.
ARE YOU SURE YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING?
HOLD ON. LET ME GET A SMALLER GAUGE.
OH, HEY, YOU.
HI.
I HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR YOU ALL OVER.
WHAT HAPPENED? YOU FORGOT ABOUT ME?
WELL, I, UH...
NO, I DIDN'T FORGET ABOUT YOU.
I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THREE HOURS.
UM... OKAY, I WENT TO THE MORGUE.
ME, TOO. HE'S NOT THERE ANYMORE.
NO, HE IS NOT THERE.
WHERE'D YOU PUT HIM?
UH, I DON'T KNOW HOW TO...
HOW TO WHAT?
HOW TO TELL YOU HOW SORRY I AM ABOUT YOUR LOSS.
THANK YOU, BUT WHERE DID YOU PUT HIM?
WHERE DID I PUT HIM?
YOU DON'T REMEMBER.
OF COURSE I REMEMBER.
UM... I COULDN'T FIND YOU.
I GOT VERY BUSY HERE
SO I PUT YOUR BROTHER...
WHERE DID I PUT HIM?
RADIOLOGY.
I PUT HIM IN RADIOLOGY
BUT HE WAS KIND OF IN THE WAY THERE, SO...
I LEFT HIM... HERE...
IN THE HALL.
I'M SORRY.
NO PROBLEM.
I CAN'T BELIEVE I DIDN'T SEE HIM THERE. HMM.
HE'S EASY TO MISS.
( sighing )
WHAT'S WRONG?
NOTHING. THERE AREN'T ANY PREGNANCY TESTS.
HOW COULD WE BE OUT OF PREGNANCY TESTS?
I DON'T DO INVENTORY.
IT WASN'T AN ACCUSATION.
OOH! WHAT IS THAT ALL ABOUT?
WHAT?
THE SCARF. WHERE'D YOU GET IT?
GOT IT AT THE GIFT SHOP. YOU DON'T THINK IT WORKS?
WHAT WAS WRONG WITH YOUR JACKET?
I WANTED TO TRY SOMETHING DIFFERENT.
LOSE THE EARRINGS. IT'S THROWING THE WHOLE THING OFF-BALANCE.
CAROL, CAROL.
IT'S ONLY MY SECOND STICK. I THINK I CAN GET IT.
I CAN'T HAVE STUDENTS STARTING I.V.s ON KIDS UNDER TEN YEARS OLD.
SURE. CAN YOU DO IT FOR ME?
IS THERE A PROBLEM?
I JUST WANT EXPERIENCED STAFF STARTING I.V.s
ON KIDS.
THIS IS STILL A TEACHING HOSPITAL, ISN'T IT?
UNTIL THEY INFLICT PAIN ON CHILDREN.
Carter: LUCY'S GREAT AT I.V.s. SHOW HIM.
THIS IS NOT ABOUT LUCY.
IT'S A POLICY I'M SETTING.
OH, YOU'RE SETTING A POLICY.
WELL... FIRST TIME FOR EVERYTHING.
I'D BE IN A HURRY TO GET OUT OF HERE, TOO.
WHAT?
WE FOUND OUT WHY YOUR TRANSPLANTED
LIVER'S FAILING-- YOU'VE BEEN DRINKING.
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BELIEVE ME.
ONE TIME.
YOU'RE RIGHT. I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.
I CHECKED WITH UNOS
AND YOU'VE BEEN ON THE LIST FOR ANOTHER TRANSPLANT
FOR TWO MONTHS.
WHAT? THAT YOU DRANK THROUGH THE FIRST ONE THEY GAVE YOU
AND NOW YOU WANT ANOTHER ONE?
COME ON. IT WASN'T LIKE THAT. IT WAS JUST A DAY.
MY SON PASSED HIS BAR EXAMINATION.
I KNEW I WAS REJECTING, SO I FIGURED WHAT COULD IT HURT?
WE HAD CHAMPAGNE AT BRUNCH. THAT'S IT. I SWEAR.
WELL, YOU'VE BEEN LYING EVER SINCE YOU CAME IN HERE.
PLEASE... YOU CAN'T TELL UNOS.
I REALLY DON'T HAVE A CHOICE.
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT. PLEASE, YOU'RE DOING THIS TO ME
OVER ONE GLASS OF CHAMPAGNE?
THERE ARE PLENTY OF PEOPLE ON THAT LIST
WHO HAVEN'T HAD ANY CHAMPAGNE.
IF I LOSE MY PLACE, I WON'T LAST SIX MONTHS.
YOU REPORT ME
I'M DEAD.
I'M BEGGING YOU.
YOU TAKE THE EL.
WHO'S ON?
WEAVER. SHE'S UPSTAIRS
INTERVIEWING FOR CHIEF OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE.
I THOUGHT SHE WAS CHIEF.
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?
DR. GREENE?
HE'S UPSTAIRS INTERVIEWING HER.
SO WE HAVE NO ATTENDINGS.
HEY, WATCH IT, JERRY.
SORRY, DR. ROSS.
IS HE AN ATTENDING?
HEY, LISTEN, UH, NORMALLY I WOULDN'T SAY ANYTHING
BUT DON'T YOU THINK THAT ATTIRE IS A LITTLE INAPPROPRIATE?
IT'S BUSINESS.
I WAS HELPING OUT DR. WEAVER.
IT WAS A GREAT JOB, KERRY.
WE'D BE LUCKY TO HAVE YOU.
THANK YOU.
I KNOW IT WAS A FORMALITY, BUT THANKS FOR COMING IN.
WELL, I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY.
YOUR PRESENTATION WAS EVERYTHING WE EXPECTED.
THANK YOU.
HEY, I'LL WALK YOU DOWN.
WENT GREAT, KERRY.
YOU DON'T THINK THE PIE CHARTS WERE TOO MUCH?
NO, CHARTS ARE GOOD.
YEAH? DID ANYBODY ELSE USE THEM?
YOU'RE THE FIRST.
IF I CAME ACROSS AS TOO EAGER...
NO, IT WENT TERRIFIC, KERRY.
THANK YOU, MARK.
I NEVER KNOW HOW TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION
ABOUT MY WEAKNESSES AND...
WELL, I COULD HAVE HELPED YOU OUT THERE.
THAT'S A NICE LEATHER JACKET.
NO, I SAID I WANTED TO RUN SOME TESTS
BUT I CAN'T WITHOUT MEDICAID.
WHAT'S WRONG?
AH.
DIDN'T YOU KNOW THIS PATIENT WAS ILLEGAL?
YES, I DID, BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER.
OH, YES, IT MATTERS.
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS WORTH OF TESTS.
THE STATE WON'T PAY.
SO YOU WON'T TREAT HIM?
I'LL GIVE HIM SOME BETA BLOCKERS.
HE COULD HAVE A SUDDEN CARDIAC ARREST.
WE'VE BEEN MONITORING HIM FOR THREE HOURS.
HE'S HAD NO ARRHYTHMIAS.
THAT'S WHY WE NEED THE E.P. STUDIES.
HIS FATHER AND BROTHER HAVE ALREADY DIED FROM THIS.
DID YOU DOCUMENT AN ARRHYTHMIA?
NO, BUT...
THERE IS NOTHING ELSE THAT I CAN DO.
DR. KAYSON, THIS BOY COULD DROP DEAD AND YOU KNOW IT.
WELL, SO COULD A LOT OF PEOPLE.
HE'S NOT EMERGENT.
I'M SORRY.
PERO ELLA PROMETIO.
YOU SAID HE WAS STABLE.
SINGLE G.S.W. TO THE ARM.
HE WAS.
HE'S INTUBATED AND HYPOTENSIVE.
THINGS CHANGE EN ROUTE, OKAY?
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?
BOTCHED GANG SHOOTING.
THEY WERE READY FOR HIM.
IS THIS THE GUY FROM THIS MORNING?
YEAH, HIS NAME'S BO.
WE THOUGHT IT WAS JUST HIS ARM.
HE CRASHED IN THE RIG.
CARTER, WE NEED YOUR HELP.
COME ON.
ALL RIGHT, WELCOME BACK, BO.
OKAY, EVERYBODY, ON MY COUNT.
ONE, TWO, THREE.
WHY DIDN'T YOU RECONTACT?
THINGS GOT PRETTY CRAZY.
CAROL, PUT HIM ON THE MONITOR.
Weaver: WHAT DO WE GOT?
THROUGH AND THROUGH G.S.W.
MID-TRICEP AREA.
RUN IT, CARTER.
DECREASED BREATH SOUNDS ON THE RIGHT.
TRACHEAL SHIFT TO THE LEFT.
TENSION PNEUMO.
B.P.'s DOWN TO 70.
PULSE OX 89. NEED A 14-GAUGE NEEDLE...
DAMN IT! ...ON A 20cc SYRINGE.
AND THEN I'M GOING TO NEED A 36 FRENCH.
ALL RIGHT, YOU WANT TO DECOMPRESS
IN THE SECOND INTERCOSTAL SPACE, MID-CLAVICULAR LINE.
OKAY, PULSE IS GETTING STRONGER.
LUCY, GET A BLOOD GAS.
I'LL DO IT.
NO, THAT'S OKAY.
I SHOWED HER HOW TO DO IT THIS MORNING.
TEN BLADE.
GET THE PRESSURE BAG ON THE LINE.
ENTRANCE WOUND
RIGHT MID-AXILLARY LINE.
BULLET WENT THROUGH THE ARM INTO THE CHEST.
WHY COULDN'T YOU UNDRESS HIM?
WE HAD TO SCOOP AND RUN.
Carter: WHERE'S THAT CHEST TUBE?
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU DIDN'T SEE THIS CHEST WOUND.
NOT NOW, CAROL.
I CAN'T GET THE BLOOD GAS.
I'LL DO IT.
ALL RIGHT, CHEST TUBE IS IN.
THAT'S OKAY, LUCY.
THOSE CAN BE TOUGH.
COME AROUND HERE, HELP ME WITH THE SECOND LINE.
OKAY, 50cc's OUT.
I NEED FOUR BY FOURS.
I NEED ELASTOPLAST.
Greene: LET'S CALL X RAY AND GET A PORTABLE CHEST DOWN HERE.
I GOT THE BLOOD GAS.
B.P.'s UP TO 100/70.
HOW'S THAT SECOND LINE COMING?
I CAN'T.
MOVE THE DRAPE. YOU GOT MORE ROOM.
NO, I CAN'T DO IT.
COME ON, LUCY, FOCUS.
I REALLY CAN'T.
IT'S LIKE ANY OTHER I.V.
I HAVEN'T STARTED AN I.V. I DON'T KNOW HOW.
I NEVER HAVE.
I'M SORRY.
WHOA! HE'S BRADYING DOWN.
CHEST TUBE IS POURING OUT BLOOD.
LET'S GO.
GET TWO UNITS OF O-NEG IN AND CALL THE O.R.
YOU COST ME A PROCEDURE.
AM I SUPPOSED TO ASK HOW?
YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO BABY-SIT THAT PULSELESS FOOT FOR ME.
GREENE LET THE RADIOLOGISTS AT HIM.
I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT WAS PART OF MY JOB DESCRIPTION.
HMM. WELL, YOU'RE STILL LEARNING.
MM-HMM.
HOW WAS YOUR FIRST DAY?
AS EXPECTED.
YOU ARE EITHER A MASOCHIST
OR THE STUBBORNEST WOMAN I'VE EVER MET
BUT I HAVE TO SAY I ADMIRE YOUR FORTITUDE.
I COULDN'T HANDLE TAKING ORDERS FROM A WEASEL LIKE DALE.
IS THAT SUPPOSED TO BE A COMPLIMENT?
SOUNDED LIKE ONE TO ME.
OH, AND YOU CAN WEAR THE LONG COAT.
IT LOOKS BETTER ON YOU.
Hathaway: 700cc's OUT THE CHEST TUBE.
TAKE HIM UP, CARTER.
THEY KNOW HE NEEDS A THORACOTOMY?
YEAH. O.R. THREE.
HAVE THE BLOOD BANK SEND UP FOUR UNITS TYPE SPECIFIC.
YUP. WE WERE NOT PREPARED FOR A MAJOR TRAUMA.
YOU SHOULD HAVE CALLED WHEN HE CRUMPED.
WE WERE A LITTLE BUSY PROTECTING HIS AIRWAY.
TIME OUT.
YOU GUYS SHOULD HAVE CALLED.
THERE WAS NO WAY...
AH... YOU GUYS SHOULD HAVE CALLED
AND WE HAVE TO BE PREPARED FOR ANYTHING.
I WOULD HAVE BEEN PREPARED...
NOBODY'S TO BLAME.
WE TREATED THE PATIENT.
LET'S MOVE ON.
YOU WANT TO STICK AROUND AND REVIEW THE RUN TAPE?
NO. NO.
DOGGY. YEAH.
YOU WANT TO PET THE DOGGY?
MMM.
OH, THAT IS GOOD.
YOU WANT HIM TO RESPOND IN SOME WAY, YOU KNOW?
TO POINT OR TO MAKE SOME KIND OF SOUND.
( imitating wind )
( meowing )
KITTY SAYS, "MEOW.
MEOW."
DO YOU WANT TO PET THE KITTY?
( whines )
OH.
DON'T LIKE THE KITTY?
THAT'S OKAY.
ONE QUICK HUG, THEN BACK TO WORK.
WHAT?
HE'S GOT TO LEARN TO FOCUS.
OH, COME ON, GIVE HIM A BREAK.
HE'S ONLY A YEAR OLD.
YOU CAN'T GIVE HIM A BREAK.
HE'S NOT LIKE OTHER ONE-YEAR-OLDS.
HE NEEDS CONSTANT VERBAL STIMULI.
( growls )
HEY, YOU TRY.
ALL RIGHT, MAN.
UM... HERE WE GO.
DOGGY. DOGGY.
ARF.
HEY, DOGGY. ARF.
ARF, ARF, ARF.
ARF, REESE. ARF.
I CAN'T DO THIS.
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO LEARN.
COMING HERE TWICE A WEEK ISN'T GOING TO DO IT.
LISTEN, I MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABLE
TO KEEP THAT KID HERE THIS AFTERNOON
BUT HE WOULD HAVE GONE OUT AND DONE THE SAME THING TOMORROW.
UH, HIS MOM'S IN CHAIRS.
YOU WANT ME TO GO TALK TO HER?
NO, NO. I'LL DO IT.
FORGET A NUMBER?
UH, NO.
YOU STILL HERE?
YEAH, I GOT SIDETRACKED.
HEY, YOU COULD USE SOME HELP.
OKAY, TAKE RASHES.
I WAS THINKING OF SOMETHING MORE PERMANENT.
UH, ALLERGIES?
ACTUALLY, I MEANT BEING YOUR FULL-TIME P.A.
YEAH. I BEEN THINKING ABOUT IT.
I'D LOVE TO JUST WORK WITH KIDS FOR A WHILE.
I'M GOOD AT IT AND, SOMEHOW, IT SEEMS MORE WORTHWHILE.
WELL, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT.
WELL, AT LEAST YOU KNOW WHOSE SIDE YOU'RE ON.
YOU KNOW, I'D... I'D LOVE TO.
I JUST THINK I'VE USED UP ALL MY CHIPS WITH ANSPAUGH.
I'VE GOT SOME PULL.
I THINK I COULD WORK IT OUT.
GREAT. I'D LOVE THAT.
EXCELLENT.
GOOD.
( clears throat )
YEAH, HI.
MAY I HAVE THE TRANSPLANT COORDINATOR FOR UNOS, PLEASE?
OKAY.
I PAGED YOU TWICE.
I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT YET.
THAT'S TOO BAD, 'CAUSE I THINK I DESERVE AN EXPLANATION.
IF YOU WANT ME TO FEEL BAD, I DO.
I'M REALLY DISAPPOINTED IN MYSELF.
YOU SHOULD BE
AND THAT'S NOT AN EXPLANATION.
I DON'T KNOW HOW IT STARTED.
I... YOU THOUGHT I COULD DO IT.
I WANTED TO IMPRESS YOU
AND IT SPUN OUT OF CONTROL.
I'M SORRY.
WHAT DID YOU THINK YOU WERE GOING TO ACCOMPLISH?
I DON'T KNOW.
I THOUGHT I COULD LEARN ON MY OWN.
OH, GREAT. YOU CAN LEARN ON YOUR OWN.
WELL, YOU DON'T NEED TO BE HERE THEN.
YOU ENDANGERED PATIENTS, LUCY.
YOU DON'T NEED
TO MAKE ME FEEL BAD-- I FEEL HORRIBLE.
WELL, THAT WOULD WORK IF THIS WAS ABOUT YOU
BUT RULE NUMBER ONE
DOWN THERE IS IT'S NEVER ABOUT YOU.
YOU KNOW, GO HOME.
DON'T COME BACK UNLESS YOU'RE SERIOUS ABOUT LEARNING SOMETHING.
AND IF YOU EVER LIE TO ME AGAIN
YOU CAN LOOK FOR ANOTHER ROTATION.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING BACK HERE?
I'M WAITING FOR THE GRILL TO HEAT UP.
I THOUGHT THIS WAS FEND-FOR-YOURSELF NIGHT.
WELL, I'M SICK OF FEND-FOR-YOURSELF.
I GOT US SOME STEAKS.
STEAKS SOUND GOOD.
YOU GOT ANOTHER ONE OF THOSE FOR ME?
YUP.
WHAT'S IN THE BAG?
IT'S A, UH... PREGNANCY TEST.
TO BE SURE.
NO NEED. I STARTED MY PERIOD.
WELL, I GUESS I WASTED $17.50.
WELL, SAVE IT FOR NEXT TIME.
I'M KIDDING.
THAT WAS A JOKE.
WE DODGED THE BULLET THERE, DIDN'T WE?
YUP.
THAT'S GOOD, RIGHT?
YEAH, YEAH.
THOUGH, ALL DAY, I KEPT THINKING, "WOW, A KID."
YOU KNOW, THAT WOULD REALLY...
CHANGE MY LIFE.
OUR LIFE.
IT WOULD CHANGE OURS.
OKAY, OUR LIVES.
THAT WOULD BE BAD, RIGHT?
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I CHANGED MY MIND.
I DON'T WANT TO JOKE ABOUT IT.
YEAH.
MAYBE I'M NOT JOKING.
