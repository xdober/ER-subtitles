Previously on E.R.:
Well, yeah, I had a life before John Carter.
If you want someone with no history
you're gonna have to find yourself a virgin.
No, I'll settle for someone
who isn't hung up
on somebody else.
I am not going home.
I am taking you home right now
or I'm ratting you out to Weaver.
What's it going to be?
Are you moving? Yeah.
That freak who hit me moved back in.
You need a place to stay, let me help.
( clattering )
KOVAC: Sorry.
Did I wake you?
No.
Did you sleep well?
( clears throat )
Yes, it was great.
You should have let me take the couch.
It's not very comfortable.
No, it was. It was.
It was fine, really.
Were you cold?
I should have turned up the heat.
I started some coffee.
Oh, right, that Turkish mud that you like.
It'll get you going.
It'll eat a hole in your stomach lining.
It's all right if, um...?
Yeah, uh, you can use the bathroom.
I was just going to take a shower.
I'll only take a minute.
( whistling )
Oop.
( humming )
( singsong ): Susan. It's John.
Carter?
Time to get... Carter?
Hey, I was just trying to wake you up on your machine.
I'm up.
I brought coffee. I brought bagels.
We were going to catch the 7:30 yoga, right?
Uh, oh, I forgot. I'm sorry.
You're out early.
I was over at Mark's.
Mark Greene?
He's having some trouble.
I spent the night.
On the couch.
Come on up.
I'll take a shower
and then we'll go, okay?
Are you coming?
LEWIS: He's a friend.
CARTER: Good friend, I guess.
Oh, would you drop it.
Lonely, too, I bet, with Elizabeth moving out.
Nothing happened.
Were you even going to tell me that you went over there?
Well, I hadn't thought about it.
Sounds like there's something you don't want me to know.
Something you don't want to tell me.
This petty, sarcastic side of you is not appealing.
Oh, right, you'd be cool if I spent the night over at...
Abby's?
Not Abby's. I was going to say Darla's.
Darla? Who the hell is Darla?
Radiology.
The one with the collagen lips
and the fake...?
They're not fake, are they?
( sighs )
You were going to say Abby.
No, I wasn't. Yes, you were.
So, now you can read my mind?
Well, it's not much of a challenge.
But if you spent the night at Abby's
I'd kill you. See, that's a double standard.
No, it's not. I'm not attracted to Mark.
You're attracted to Abby.
You were attracted to Mark. No, he was attracted to me.
And thanks for not denying you're attracted to Abby.
How did this suddenly become about me?
You're the one who spent the night
over at an old boyfriend's house.
He's not my old boyfriend.
He's like an older brother.
And I don't want to sleep with him.
Well, I don't want to sleep with Abby.
Susan, John.
Take this one.
Got a head injury...
Not on for ten minutes.
Tell me this is an easy one.
Cruella De Vil here had this guy
trussed up in some sort of love swing
suspended from the ceiling.
He swore to me he weighed 275.
The torture swing is guaranteed
to 350 pounds.
He pulled the eye screws right out of my ceiling.
MAN: He's 400, if he's a pound.
Look, guys, grab on. I think I ruptured
a disc getting him on the ride.
Hey, Gallant, get over here!
LEWIS: Just when you think you've seen it all
working in the ER.
( muffled ): It hurts...
CARTER: What's he trying to say? He said it hurts.
Why is he still wearing a mask?
Refused to take it off.
40-year-old male
six-foot fall to his buttocks
complains of pelvic pain, can't walk.
BP's 160/95; pulse 110.
LEWIS: What's your name, sir?
No, no names.
Do you know where you are?
A hospital? CARTER: Frank, what's open?
Trauma One.
Everything he's wearing is mine.
You cut it, you buy it.
Hey, Malik, Abby, you guys free?
LEWIS: CBC, dip a urine, portable chest and pelvis.
What is that? A tail.
Careful, it's attached.
Pure horsehair.
That's mine, too.
Check his chest.
I need you to take your hood off, sir.
No!
I need to check your eyes and ears.
Use the little flaps.
You have any pain here, sir? No.
MALIK: Sinus tach.
How about in here?
( man yelling )
No hemotympanum.
Pulse ox is 98 on room air.
Pupils equal and reactive.
Chest is clear, no rhonchi.
( grunting ): Knees up. ( man groaning )
Buck up, wimp!
Am I paralyzed?
No, you probably bruised your butt.
We'll take some x-rays to make sure.
We have to take your outfit off, sir
the zippers screw up the x-ray.
Could I keep my hood?
Sure.
What's going on in here?
Titrate 10 of morphine.
Ouch!
Careful!
Is that a tail?
LOCKHART: Pure horsehair.
It's attached.
Is your hand all right?
Fatso fell on me.
Well, that's dislocated.
Should get an x-ray of this before I try and reduce it.
Thank you. I'm not leaving.
He's got $2,000 worth of my stuff.
I can do it here
but it's going to hurt like hell
and you'll probably have to wear a splint
for about six weeks.
Can I wear it over my glove?
You could always file for workman's comp.
It's a job-related injury.
Sure, it'll fit over your glove.
Then do it.
This is really going to hurt.
All right, here we go.
One, two, three.
Ooh.
All yours. What about my hood?
You can go with him.
We'll get an x-ray of that finger
make sure there's no fracture.
Malik, hand series.
Show's over, people.
Go back to work.
So, what was the tail attached to?
Believe me, you don't want to know.
We should have sold tickets.
Hey, what's this?
I think it's hers.
Who, the mistress of pain?
What, after all that bitching about her stuff
she left it here.
What does she have in this thing?
I don't want to know.
I do.
Come on. I'll take it to her.
Let's take a little look first.
No, just take a peek. No.
Not particularly.
You guys are boring.
GALLANT: Hey, you need me anymore, Dr. Carter?
( gasps )
Whoa! Oh, my God.
Nobody could ever actually use that
could they?
What is that?
Is that a...? Yeah, I think so.
What? What? ( laughing )
Ooh, whoa...
Come on, guys.
This is a patient's personal property.
Oh, God. No kidding.
What's this for?
( air hissing )
( screams )
Oh! That is disgusting.
That is disgusting.
( chuckles ): Eww...
Gallant, catch.
( Lewis laughing )
Uh...
What is that big purple thing?
Oh, no.
God, is that an on-off switch?
( Lewis gasps )
Wow...
That does not occur in nature.
Oh, this is scary.
Oh, Carter.
Come on. Try it on.
Get away from me with that thing.
No, I promise I won't tighten the straps.
What do you think?
Should I quit my day job?
Dr. Kovac...
WEAVER: Do you have any idea what kind of financial liability
you could have opened this hospital up to?
What if I'd been a patient who just happened to walk in?
Kerry, we were just blowing off a little steam.
Yeah, well, do it on your own time.
And with a medical student in the room?
Wh-What were you thinking?
Were you thinking at all?
Who does this belong to?
Did someone bring th-this... this thing into the workplace?
I think that we're all aware
that our behavior was inappropriate....
Inappropriate, unprofessional
offensive.
Who does this belong to?
Huh?
A patient.
A patient.
We treated her for a dislocated finger
but, uh, she left her bag.
So you decided it would be fun
to pilfer through a patient's belongings.
Dr. Kovac, you're a senior attending.
Do you have anything to say for yourself?
Dr. Lewis?
Abby?
Uh, we're all sorry...
Damn right, you're sorry.
I'll contact Human Resources.
I'll try to get them not to convene a hearing
which, I might add
this department can ill afford right now.
But I'm putting you all on notice
I will not tolerate another episode
of inappropriate behavior
from anyone.
Is that clear?
Is that clear?!
Yes. Yeah. Absolutely. Yes.
Get this thing back to its rightful owner.
And let's hope she doesn't notice
her belongings have been disturbed.
Thanks a lot, girls.
What?
I asked you not to touch that bag.
You could have left.
No one was keeping you here.
Carter's right.
We didn't want to open it; you two did.
I wonder what she's saying to him in there.
Well, we should have told her
that Gallant wasn't involved.
You should have told her
that Luka and I weren't involved.
Oh, you were that kid in elementary school
who always told, right?
You all right?
Yeah, I'm great.
( doors slams open )
She moved out?
Yeah, that's the rumor.
No rumor-- Shirley told me.
Wait. How does Shirley know?
She changed her phone number
on the surgical emergency contact sheet.
It over what happened with their little girl?
That is so sad.
Did she move all her stuff out?
She's too much woman for him.
Hey, if you ladies are done
with the stitch and bitch
can I get some work done?
I'm surprised it lasted this long.
Poor Mark.
Yeah, it's really too bad.
Has Psych been down to see the woman in Six?
The barker?
No, but she tried to bite one of the Salvadorean sisters
from housekeeping.
"Chandra" from Human Resources called.
Said she'd be upstairs for an hour.
Tell Dr. Kovac I'll be upstairs.
He can page me if he needs me.
Uh, Kerry, can I talk to you for a minute?
It's about what happened this morning.
I'm heading up to Human Resources right now.
Well, I think it's only right to tell you
that I was, uh, really the instigator.
Carter, Gallant, Kovac
they were all opposed to me opening that bag.
Well, what about Abby?
I-It was me.
If there's going to be
any disciplinary consequences
I should be the one held responsible.
Susan, I appreciate you coming forward
but they're all adults.
They could have chosen to leave the room
or refuse to participate.
I mean, when I entered, it was clear
that everyone present was involved.
Anything else?
No, that's it.
Oh!
Excuse me. Do you know where Room 224 is?
End of the hall, on your left.
Thank you. Mm-hmm.
( sighs )
I thought I was late.
You are late.
LEWIS: Does anyone know how long this is supposed to last?
KOVAC: All day, I think.
What are they going to do, show us videos, or something?
Sexual harassment videos.
Role playing and long lectures is what I heard.
KOVAC: Role playing?
Acting out inappropriate behavior.
You two should excel at that.
Would you drop it.
No, I won't drop it.
Yeah, well, at least I'm not the one
who put that thing in her locker.
( scoffs ): Right.
I didn't.
( chuckles ): Don't look at me.
Luka?
( laughing )
But you should have seen her face.
God, I wish I had a camera.
This isn't funny.
Sure, it is.
No, it's not.
( chuckling softly )
This is going to be a very long day.
LEWIS: I think that's Whitman.
What?
Well, somebody erased most of it
but "...to be surrounded
by a beautiful, curious, breathing, laughing..."
That's "I Sing the Body Electric."
Oh, yeah. I know that one.
You know Whitman?
Don't sound so surprised.
No, it's just... most people don't.
Yeah, well, Fame.
You know, the movie, it was in that.
Please! I love Fame.
I've seen it, like, 30 times. I wanted to be Coco.
* I sing the body electric, I celebrate *
* The me yet to come...
( cup rattling )
How long are we
going to wait?
This thing was supposed to start at 8:00.
Probably got held up by the snow.
We all got here.
I say we go.
I say we wait.
He speaks.
So what if he's late? We were told to report
to room 224 at 0800.
I'm here, and I'm going to stay here
until someone in charge
tells me to do otherwise.
And I suggest you all do the same.
"0800."
This ain't the Marines, Gallant. At ease.
It's the Army, Dr. Carter.
Yeah? Well, I don't think
anybody's going to court-martial you
because a guy didn't show up for a lecture.
KOVAC: Gallant's right. We should wait.
I don't want to have to come here again next Saturday.
GALLANT: Abby, please!
We're in a public building.
I know.
Nobody's here.
I'm here.
LEWIS: Maybe this is the punishment.
Sitting in this room.
Maybe they're watching us
to see how we all respond.
Like a test?
Sure. Hidden cameras recording us
for research or something.
Watching to see how we react to the stress.
How alliances grow
how our social structures break down under pressure...
Like on Survivor.
You watch Survivor?
Yeah. It's a great show.
( scoffs )
All the backbiting and the lying.
It's human nature at its most venal.
Reality television: It's one of
the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse.
Have you ever watched it?
No.
Then shut up.
I have a confession to make.
You put the dildo in Weaver's locker?
I watch Fear Factor.
Oh, my God. I love that show.
Did you see the last one
where they were bobbing for apples
with the...? And the snakes...
were climbing into their hair
and their mouths.
I thought that television was just a vast wasteland.
Oh, I'm sorry. I meant to watch La Boheme on PBS last night
( in affected voice ): but I had to go to the symphony.
( Lewis laughs )
I watch television, just not that dehumanizing crap.
I mean, seriously, what's next?
Televised executions?
Bear baiting?
Torture Channel?
What is your problem today? What are you so pissy about?
You know what my problem is.
You are kidding me? Still?
What? You are still mad about that?
You know what, John? Grow up.
What? Oh, come on, say it.
I spent the night at Mark's the night before last
and he won't let it go.
I slept on the sofa. I was on the couch.
He thinks I slept with Mark.
Can we not talk about this here?
Several years ago, Mark had a crush on me.
Now we're friends, friends
which is more than I'm going to be able
to say about us if you keep it up.
All right, okay, yeah, a harmless night
spent in a recently single man's apartment
who's still desperately in love with you.
Mark is not in love with me.
KOVAC: Who's recently single?
Green. Corday left him.
When did that happen?
Couple weeks ago. Where was I?
over there if he didn't really need me.
Well, if he really needed you...
He's a friend. I helped him out.
I'm sure you did. I'm not discussing this
with you anymore.
What kind of emergency?
None of your damn business.
Are they getting a divorce?
I don't think so.
You know, when you find out why I was over there
you are going to feel very small.
So, tell me.
Very, very small.
So, tell me.
Abby's been sleeping on my couch.
Nothing's happened.
Yeah, I needed a place to stay until I found a new apartment
and Luka... said I could stay with him.
LEWIS: You're probably more upset about that
than my staying at Mark's.
What? No. Right.
I'm not. Carter's still stuck on you.
All right, can we change the subject, please?
Uh, now you want to change the subject.
How 'bout them Bears, huh?
What?
Football?
I don't watch American football.
Well, they need to beef up their defense.
But I think they'll be real contenders next year.
KOVAC: I watch basketball.
Let's talk about the Bulls.
Bulls stink.
How long were you in the Army, Gallant?
I'm still in the Army.
Reserves.
They're paying for my med school.
So, they can call you up
at any time?
Yeah, they can.
I don't think they will, not yet.
You're not worried?
I'd be fine if they did.
With everything that's going on?
I wish they'd give me a gun
put me someplace where I could use it.
I'm ready to go if my country needs me, yes, ma'am.
Luka was in the Army, right?
Yeah?
All Croatian men are required
to serve in the military.
Hmm.
My brother Eric's in the Air Force.
He's in Saudi Arabia.
He a pilot?
No, he's an air traffic controller.
I worry anyway.
My brother Gavin's in the Air Force, munitions specialist.
Is he overseas?
No, Texas
but he, uh, thinks they're going.
My younger brother Frank is in the Marines out of Pendleton.
My sister Carol's on the Carl Vinson.
How many brothers and sisters do you have?
Six.
All in the service?
Everybody who's old enough.
Steve, he's only 14.
Patriotic bunch.
Ah, it's the family business.
My father's got 26 years in as an NCO.
That's only five.
You only named five kids.
You said there were six in your family.
Yeah, my twin sister, Susan.
She's the black sheep of the family.
Teaches Head Start in DC.
That's disgraceful.
Yeah, we try to hide her when company comes around.
How did she manage to stay out of the military?
Sounds like a prerequisite in your family.
Well, she has cerebral palsy.
What does your dad do, Dr. Lewis?
My dad?
Yeah.
He's a test pilot
for Barcalounger.
( laughing )
He sits on his ass all day
in front of the television
trying to get his cholesterol level over 400.
Oh, is he succeeding?
He's dedicated.
He'll get there or die trying.
Hmm.
What does your dad do, Dr. Kovac?
My father's a painter.
Not houses. Art.
Abstracts, mostly.
He's good.
Really?
Yeah.
I mean, not that
he's ever made a living at it...
He's a train conductor in Zagreb, so that pays the bills.
I didn't know that.
You never asked.
GALLANT: Abby?
Oh, I have absolutely no idea what my father's doing.
Dr. Carter?
What?
What does your dad do?
Oh.
Spends the family trust fund.
He manages several of my family's investment funds.
Sits on some corporate boards.
The family investment funds?
Carter's loaded.
Really?
How loaded?
Think Bill Gates.
Not that rich.
Okay, Paul Allen, then.
How much are you worth, Carter?
Me, personally? Almost nothing.
Okay, your family, then.
I have no idea.
Guess.
I don't know.
A lot.
50 million?
Hundred million?
200 million?
500 million?
Honestly, I don't know.
Oh, my God. I knew you were rich.
I didn't know you were that rich.
Gamma's money.
How old are you, 30?
Thirty-one.
How'd you manage to last this long
without some girl marrying you?
( laughs )
Uh, we come with a built-in gold digger alarm.
My grandmother installs them at birth.
And I didn't set it off?
You better have that thing checked.
It's embarrassing. You know, everybody assumes
when you grow up with money, everything's great.
Yeah, it must have been hard
growing up in the mansion.
Was Gamma too cheap to heat the pool?
( laughing )
Money isn't everything, Susan.
That's easy for you to say.
KOVAC: We never had much, you know.
Always struggled, but we were happy.
Yeah, same here. I never knew we didn't have money.
I always had everything I needed:
presents at Christmas, clothing, food.
700 million?
Hey, I didn't ask to be born into this.
( knocking )
( door opening )
Is this the sexual harassment group?
Yeah.
Dr. Taylor called. He is coming.
He's having car trouble.
He asked you to wait. He'll be here as soon as he can.
( door closes )
Great.
I wonder what's in there.
What are you doing?
This worked in college
when I locked myself out of my dorm room.
They didn't have much.
Candy and sodas, no coffee.
Anybody want the root beer?
It's all yours.
Peanut butter crackers, I love those.
Want to share?
Sure.
What's he doing?
LEWIS: Breaking and entering.
Why?
What's that play?
What play?
The one where the two clowns are sitting around waiting
for that guy who never shows up.
Waiting for Godot.
Yeah, I saw that at the Goodman years ago.
I didn't get it.
Well, it's about the futility of life
and human enterprise.
We're all waiting.
For what?
For fulfillment?
Love? Validation? Approval?
It's a waste of time.
Life is an empty, hollow
exercise filled with pain, loss, and grief
and the only thing we can expect
to achieve in our lives
is our own inevitable death.
( chuckles )
LEWIS: Wow.
That is the most depressing thing
I've ever heard.
Aren't you glad you didn't grow up in the Balkans?
Croatia is beautiful.
Zagreb, Dubrovnik, you should go.
CARTER: Yeah, kind of a high chance of getting
blown up, though.
Always discourages me
from adding a country to my travel itinerary.
It's very safe now.
Then why are you here?
Barbecue.
You just can't find good ribs in Zagreb, you know?
Not to mention spoon bread and sweet potato pie.
Carson's.
Exactly.
So how did you get into Weaver's locker, Luka?
It was locked.
Oh, it wasn't me.
No, I wish I thought of it.
I really do, but...
I didn't.
Gallant.
CARTER: Clever.
Very clever to accuse the rest of us
to throw suspicion away from yourself.
You still haven't said you didn't do it.
Whitman was writing about slavery.
He was an abolitionist.
The poem, "Body Electric."
I, uh, I minored in English Lit at Howard.
Oh, yeah? I was English Lit.
Where?
Penn State.
Really, you went to Penn State?
Yes.
What, did you assume I went to community college
because I'm a nurse?
No, I didn't mean that.
I think you did mean it.
You did it before, too, about the poem.
It's all right; it's all of you, all doctors.
You all think you're smarter than nurses
because you have an MD.
Don't drag me into this, okay?
I, I don't assume that.
Well, you're still a med student.
You'll learn to be condescending and dismissive.
It's a test you have to take before you can graduate.
I got an "A." LOCKHART: You got an "A+."
Does anybody have a penknife or anything like that?
I don't think that's true of all doctors.
LOCKHART: Sure it is.
It's a class thing.
It's part of the educational caste system
we have in this country.
with black leather trench coats
and the collapse of central planning.
LOCKHART: You all look down
on Gallant's family because they're military.
Like there's something vaguely pathetic about volunteering
to defend our liberties with their lives for crappy pay.
Yeah, that's true.
I don't feel that way.
LOCKHART: Really?
I quit med school halfway through my third year.
I was second in my class when I quit.
CARTER: Second?
Really? I didn't know that.
So, why'd you quit?
See, that's what I mean.
You can't imagine why anybody wouldn't want to be you.
CARTER: They tossed you out
'cause your ex-husband didn't pay
your tuition.
Yeah, but I chose not to go back.
LEWIS: Halfway through your third year?
Why not finish? Hell, you were over the hard part.
It was just starting to get fun.
Because I realized I was proud of what I do.
I make a difference in my patients' lives.
But you can do so much more as a doctor.
No, see, that's where you're wrong.
I would be doing less
as a doctor.
I mean, you guys don't get to spend
any time with your patients.
How many do you see a day, 30? 40?
I mean, you don't get to hold a little kid's hand
or teach a new mother how to nurse.
How many patients do you have to see in a day?
Ten, maybe 12
and I'm not running around all day
trying to clear the board.
I made a choice.
You just can't understand it
because it's not one that you would have chosen.
I can't believe you won't let me smoke this.
I got it.
Great, now we're felons.
Oh, cool.
What?
There's a bunch of fencing gear in here.
I used to fence in school.
LEWIS: Of course you did.
I fence. LEWIS: Fencing?
LOCKHART: You going to eat this cracker?
LOCKHART: No.
You really only see ten patients a day?
I learned when I was acting.
When were you an actor?
In college.
I should warn you, I'm good.
Okay.
En garde.
They really say that?
That's a nice parry.
You think they're trying to impress us?
If they are, it's not working.
LEWIS: Ouch!
Doesn't that hurt?
They really are a couple of freaks.
( chuckling )
And to think you slept with both of them.
I never slept with Carter.
Did he tell you that?
I thought you had.
No...
that was a rumor Carter started.
Oh, God.
That is low.
I thought so.
I haven't slept with Carter either.
How long have you guys been going out?
Couple months.
Wow, that definitely violates the second date rule.
What second date rule?
My friend has this theory
that you should sleep with a guy by the second date
because if the sex isn't good, you shouldn't waste your time
with somebody you don't have any chemistry with.
Mm, I don't know if Carter and I have chemistry or not.
There have been some almost spark moments.
I think it's either there or it's not.
You can't force it.
Believe me, I've tried.
LEWIS: I think part of the problem with Carter and me is you.
He denies it, but he's not very convincing.
Why didn't you two happen?
Timing.
Ouch.
You okay?
Yeah.
If you're hurt we should stop.
No.
Come on.
Come on. Let's go.
This is not going to end well.
Hey
aren't you guys tired yet?
Ow!
( shouts )
Hey.
Carter.
Knock it off.
Dr. Carter...
Cut it out, Carter.
All right, all right...
You maniac!
You started it.
Look at this, look at this.
You went for my face!
After you hacked at my side.
I always thought fencing was a finesse sport.
Sorry.
Mali seronja je popizdija...
Okay, let me see.
Ouch!
Don't be a baby.
Crazy bastard.
Ow, ow, ow.
He was trying to kill me.
It looked like it was mutual.
I'm I going to need stitches?
No, you barely need a Band-Aid.
I didn't know you had a temper.
I can ask Abby to come over here
and check you out if you prefer.
What? That man is a menace.
That
and I could have lost my eye.
What was that for?
Just checking.
For what?
Second date rule.
What?
What?
How did you get Weaver's combination, Michael?
Sneak a look over her shoulder
when she wasn't looking?
When she was opening it?
It is Michael, isn't it?
Yeah, Michael.
You knew the combination
so you snuck into the lounge when no one was looking
and you put it in there.
Why would I do that?
She said something that pissed you off so much
you wanted revenge.
You quiet ones are always the most dangerous.
I'm a student and I could get expelled.
Still waters run deep.
It-It wasn't me.
( sighs )
Where were you living before?
Scottsdale, Arizona-- land of sun.
And you decided to move back to Chicago?
Mmm... I don't know.
The desert, 120 degrees in the shade
never a cloud in the sky--
kind of depressed me.
I needed to be back where the sun doesn't come out for weeks.
Bitter cold and overcast skies
better suit my temperament.
But mostly I was running away.
From what?
A guy, what else?
Chemistry?
Tanker truck full. Too much.
What was his name?
Charlie Dixon Dix. He's a cowboy.
Can you believe it?
An honest-to-God cowboy.
He has the horse, the pickup truck, the whole deal.
I'm a walking cliché.
Was he cute?
What happened?
Mmm... it's complicated.
I'd rather not talk about it
if you don't mind.
Cowboy?
( both snickering )
So, you were in the army.
Yeah.
You see some action?
All right, sorry.
It's not what you think it is.
Well, what do you think I think it is?
Noble, romantic.
A crucible upon which to test your young manhood.
No, I'm not that naive.
Sure, you are.
LOCKHART: Luka.
How old were you when you became a man?
What?
When you lost your virginity.
How old were you?
LOCKHART: Come on. We're playing a game.
How old?
I don't want to play.
Oh, come on.
We made a bet which one
of the five us was the first
to lose their virginity. Who'd you pick?
Not telling.
I picked Kovac.
No, she didn't.
( laughing )
Luka...
I don't want to play.
LEWIS: I told you they wouldn't want to play.
All right, I'll go first.
I was 16. Howie Thomas.
( snickers )
He was on the lacrosse team...
What's wrong with... what?
Howie...
What's wrong with Howie?
He sounds like a plumber or something.
I was terrified.
So was he.
It was the longest 20 seconds of my life.
( guffawing )
20 seconds?
Yeah, if you counted foreplay.
Okay, my turn.
Mark Greene.
( shrieking )
I'm just kidding.
Just kidding, Carter.
Floyd Walker. I was 15.
Floyd? I can't believe you gave me a hard time about Howie.
In the shed behind his father's radiator repair shop.
Very romantic.
The smell of antifreeze still turns me on.
Gallant.
You don't need their approval.
Come on. Give it up.
( clears throat )
Okay, uh...
Tanya McBride in the balcony of our church after choir practice.
Wow. Your church?
Yeah, I know.
How old?
Let's see, I was in ninth grade, so I was about 14.
All right, we have a new leader.
Carter.
Come on.
Oh, my God, you're still a virgin.
I was 11.
Eleven years old?
Really?
How old was she?
I don't know. 25.
You're kidding me.
Oh, my God.
She was one of the maids.
Did you pay her?
My parents did.
To have sex with you?
To be a maid.
( laughing )
Hope you gave her a hell of a Christmas bonus.
All right.
Luka, 11.
It's going to be very tough to beat.
Come on. You don't have to say how old you were.
Just confirm you were older than 11.
We can award the prize to Carter.
I get a prize?
Don't let your imagination
run away with you. My wedding night.
I lost my virginity on my wedding night.
It's okay.
It's a good memory.
Hadn't thought about that in years.
We were very young
and she was religious, so we waited.
We loved each other very much.
It's okay. It's okay.
What were you in?
You said you were an actor in college.
What plays were you in?
Uh, we did Hamlet.
I did Hamlet.
I played Horatio.
LOCKHART: Who did you play, Luka?
Um, Hamlet.
In English or Croatian?
Why would we do it in English?
Were you any good?
My mom thought so.
( chuckling )
Do you remember any of it?
Aw, it's been a long time.
I think I remember some of it.
( clears throat )
To be or not to be:
That is the question:
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind's eye
to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune
or to take arms against a sea of troubles
and by opposing end them?
That's the easy part.
To die: to sleep; no more;
And, by a sleep to say we end the heartache
and the thousand natural shocks...
I don't remember the rest.
To die, to sleep... to sleep...
to sleep
perchance to dream:
aye, there's the rub.
To je ono sto trpnju nasu stripljivom
Tako cini, jer tko bi podnio
Bic I katno vremena zlocinstva silnika
Prezir oholica, bol...
neuzvracene ljubavi
ezobzirnost vlasti, sporost pravde
Kad bi sam uzmogao sve to skratiti
Tek jednim jedinim ubodom
Be all my sins remember'd.
Sorry I'm so damned late.
Spent half an hour digging my car out
and then the battery was dead.
I appreciate your waiting for me.
I didn't expect anyone to still be here.
I'm John Taylor.
Please, would everybody move down front.
I won't have to yell.
Come on. Come on. I won't bite.
Raise your hand when I call your name if you would.
John Carter?
Here.
Michael Galant.
Uh, Gallant, yes, sir.
Uh, Luka...
Oh, boy, help me out.
Kovac.
Dr. Kovac. Thank you.
Susan Lewis?
And that leaves Abigail Lockhart.
Abby.
So, uh, let's begin by reviewing
current state and federal law
for what is appropriate and inappropriate behavior in the workplace.
Hey, it stopped snowing.
Yeah, it's about time.
Anybody need a ride?
I've got my car.
I'm on in 20 minutes.
You're working tonight?
Yeah? Me, too.
Well, that was fun.
Let's try to never do it again.
Want me to give you a lift to the hospital?
It's just a couple of blocks.
Gallant will walk me, right? Sure.
Have your keys?
Yeah. I'll try not to wake you when I come in.
See you guys later.
I had fun talking.
We should have coffee sometime.
Sure. I'd love that.
Ready? Yep.
Good night.
Night.
She's pretty great.
Who?
Abby. I didn't really know her before.
I didn't think I'd like her, but I do.
You want to get something to eat? I'm starving.
You know, you really made a fool of yourself today.
What?
If you're worried about Abby living with Luka
don't be. I don't think anything's going on.
How did I make a fool out of myself?
Well, you participated in a duel, for one thing.
Kiss me.
Just kiss me.
Was it there for you?
It was nice.
Wasn't there for me either.
Okay, go before I change my mind.
You sure?
I regret it already.
You know, that gold-digger alarm
should be clanging like a school bell.
This isn't because Mark Greene
just suddenly became available, is it?
You know when I said you were making a fool of yourself?
Well, you're doing it again.
You should tell her.
Who?
Tell her what?
That you're desperately in love with her
and can't live a moment without her.
Really?
You're hopeless.
You'll figure it out.
Friends?
No, I hate you.
Hey...
I used to have Weaver's locker.
She never changed the combination.
It was you!
