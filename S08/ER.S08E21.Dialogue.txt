(male narrator) Previously on "ER.."
Hey, Rhachel.
You search my room and go through my private things?
I was looking for drugs.
I have a baby with an amphetamine overdose.
Oh, God.
She may never open her eyes again.
Either she's out of the house by the time I take that baby home
or I'm not taking that baby home.
I'm afraid it's definitely tumor regrowth.
'You should have been dead a year ago, Mark.'
How much time?
(Carter) 'Mark died this morning'
at 6:04 AM.
"The sun was rising, his favorite time of day.
' I sent this on so that you might know'
'he was thinking of you all.'
(Mark) 'You set the tone, Carter.'
What?
Work on your jump shot.
[sirens wailing]
[engine revving]
[exhaling]
[knocking on door]
[music on stereo]
Mark?
Hey.
What are you doing?
I'm feeling sorry for myself.
I'll make you some soup.
Uh, no, thanks.
Do you want me to put some drops in your eye?
Just did it.
I'm just making a list.
Things I've always wanted to do
but I never found time for.
What? Too morbid?
A bit.
You want to hear it?
Sure.
Got a little carried away.
Mm-hmm.
"Sail around the world.
"Climb Mount Kilimanjaro.
"Play third base for the Cubs
"and hit a sacrifice fly to drive in the winning run
in the seventh game of the World Series."
- They get better. - Uh-huh.
"Start a garage band and end up on the cover of Rolling Stone.
'Do you even play an instrument?'
No, but I've always wanted to trash a hotel room.
"Jump out of an airplane.
"Have noisy sex in a public place.
I can help you with that one.
"Smoke hand-rolled Cuban cigars
"while drinking dark Caribbean rum in a sidewalk cafe
"overlooking the Havana seawall.
That's a really good one.
"Get towed in to Mavericks on a big gun
"and live to tell about it.
"Find Jerry Walker and beat the living crap out of him.
And who's he?
'Tenth grade. Long story.'
"Take the kids to Disney World.
"Teach Ella how to ice skate
"at Rockefeller Center at Christmas time.
"Teach Rachel how to drive.
Be there to give them both away at their weddings."
Told you I was sitting down here feeling sorry for myself.
We could all go to Disney World.
I'd like that.
I haven't been a very good father.
- Yes, you have. - No, I haven't.
I wasn't there when she needed me.
I was 400 miles away.
Phone call on Saturdays.
A couple of weeks in the summer.
You know what the last thing on my list is?
"Fix Rachel."
[theme music]
[birds chirping]
[crowd crescendo]
Rachel?
[car door shuts]
'Rachel?'
See ya. Bye.
Hey.
Breath mint?
For that cigarette?
I was just holding it for a friend.
In your mouth?
- What are you doing here? - Picking you up.
Is there anything in your locker you need?
What?
Is there anything you need, like, right away?
- No. - Okay. Come on.
Where are we going?
Honestly, Rachel, I don't know.
[plane engine rumbling]
(male #1) 'Here we go!'
[air turbulence]
(male #2) 'Is that your dad?'
Yeah.
Mid-life crisis?
Something like that.
[relaxing Spanish guitar music]
- Aloha. - Mornin'.
[indistinct conversation]
'Hey.'
- What? - 'You hungry?'
- What time is it? - It's almost 8:00.
[scoffs] Oh, God.
'Told you not to stay up late watching that movie.'
'Come on, time's a-wastin'.'
- 'Gotta go.' - Go where?
'History lesson.'
What?
My history.
[radio playing Todd Rundgren's "Hello, It's Me"]
What's with this music?
You don't like Todd Rundgren?
Can we change the station?
No, I like this.
This is where everything blew up?
Yeah, that's Battleship Row.
See the white building?
That's the Arizona memorial.
When I was a kid, there wasn't a bridge here, though.
Used to have to take the ferry back and forth
'to school, to movies, to shop.'
It was kind of cool.
'I loved living in Hawaii.'
Mom had flower gardens everywhere.
That's what she used to do when Dad was gone
to keep busy, garden.
I hated it.
She used to make me weed, fertilize, mow the lawn.
The last ferry was at 11 o' clock.
So Navy kids mostly just stayed on the base.
The golf course, the pool
bowling alley, youth center..
- You were a bowler? - Yeah.
Mostly just rode our bikes around.
Went to the beach.
Got in trouble trying to sneak into restricted areas.
How long were you here?
Three years.
Longest time we ever spent in one place.
All the good kids were JROTC
hoping to get into Annapolis.
I hung out with the troublemakers.
A couple of teenagers..
...acting dangerous, tough.
I had my first job here.
You were a lifeguard?
No. Junior janitor.
I'd get here at 6:00 AM, sweep up
mop the locker rooms, skim the pool..
$1.25 an hour.
That's slave wages.
It was enough to keep me in new records and good weed.
What? You know, records?
'LP's, vinyls..'
Those funny big black things that your hip-hop heroes
are always ripping off for their songs.
Come on.
'Come on, I want to show you something.'
It's just a couple blocks away.
16-inch guns could lob a 2,000-pound shell at 23 miles.
When a bombardment commenced, you could hear it 40 miles away.
Up there is where the Japanese surrendered. Tokyo Harbor.
[ship horn blows]
Your grandfather took me up to the bridge once.
N-not here on the "Missouri"
but on a sub-tender that he was the XO of.
They used to let sailors bring their families on board
steam around the harbor.
Kind of a "take your kid to work day"
only Dad's office was a warship.
He introduced me to all the sailors on watch.
Stuck a hat on me.
One of those white Gilligan things?
Yeah.
Held me up so I could man the helm.
Showed me what everything was for.
I was about your age.
Sounds like you liked it.
I did.
So, why didn't you join the Navy?
I was mad at my dad.
For what?
Never being around, I guess.
We used to fight all the time.
About the music I listened to.
My clothes, my friends, the length of my hair.
[Rachel chuckles] Don't laugh.
I used to have hair, lots of it.
Down to my shoulders.
He resented my politics. I hated his.
I used to try and provoke him, you know
just try to piss him off.
I was good at it.
I hated everything that he stood for..
...and I made sure that he knew it.
What did he stand for?
Patriotism
responsibility, authority, honor..
Navy, most of all.
I'd take it all back now if I could..
...but I can't.
He rode me pretty hard when he was around.
I think he was worried about me.
He was worried about the choices I was making
and the things that I was interested in.
Like what?
Like, uh..
...girls, for one.
Bruce Lee flicks.
Rock and roll.
Surfing.
- Surfing? - Yeah.
Don't look so surprised.
Surfing?
You're doing great.
You almost stood up on that last one.
Okay, lie down.
Now I'll push you. Ready?
Okay. Yeah.
And..
- You ready? - Yeah.
Paddle, paddle, paddle, paddle! Go, go!
'Stand up!'
Go, go, go, go, go, go!
[Rachel exclaims excitedly]
Oh, yes!
[laughs]
[Abandoned Pool singing "The Remedy" on TV]
* And we can go and live as nothing *
[whimpering]
* Then you can be the wannabe
* And I can be the remedy
* And we can go to hell..
[sniffling]
* Say this world is not so shallow *
* When you can't beg, steal or borrow *
* Save your breath, your soul is hollow *
* And it's all too much to swallow *
Dad?
Dad?
* ..for all I care
* Say this world is not so shallow *
* When you can't beg, steal or borrow *
* Save your breath, your soul is hollow *
* And it's all too much to swallow *
[car engine revving]
[John Lennon's "Imagine" playing on radio]
* Imagine there's no heaven
* It's easy if you try
You know this one, right?
* No hell below us
You got to know who this is.
* Above us only sky
[birds chirping]
What is this place?
It's a retreat house.
I rented it for a week.
A what?
Relax, you're gonna love it.
There's no TV in my room.
- Right. - Where's the TV?
I don't think there is one.
Is there a pool?
Ocean.
Hotel was getting too expensive.
The mini bar charges alone were starting to add up.
Once you're done unpacking
you can help me with dinner.
Is there a phone?
Should be around here someplace.
- What are we supposed to do? - 'I don't know.'
Swim, walk on the beach..
...surf.
[door slams]
[cutlery striking plate]
(Greene) 'Put your right foot on the brake'
left foot on the clutch.
Good. Clutch all the way in.
Okay. Now put it in first gear.
Remember where that is?
Straight up. Good, good.
Okay, now you want to ease your right foot
'off of the brake and onto the accelerator.'
Okay, ease off on the clutch.
'Little gas, ease off on the clutch.'
[engine revving] Hey, there we go.
[engine sputters out] Oh. Oh.
What'd I do?
It's just a balance thing, you know.
It's a-It's kind of a balance between the clutch
and the accelerator.
'It's a feel thing'
It just takes a little practice.
Alright, let's try it again.
Okay, make sure it's in neutral.
Good. Put that clutch in.
'Put the brake on.'
Okay, turn the ignition over.
[ignition grinds] Ah!
Okay, make sure that clutch is pushed all the way in.
- Okay, got it in neutral? - Okay.
'Turn the ignition over again.'
[engine turns over]
Okay, now put it up into first.
[sighs]
'Okay, right foot off that brake.'
Put it on the accelerator.
'Ease off the clutch.'
Whoa!
[engine grinds]
[sighs]
Maybe I should try an automatic.
No, no, no, no, it's best to learn with a stick.
Mom has an automatic.
Come on, put it in neutral.
I-I don't want to.
Rachel, you fall off the horse, you got to get right back on.
The horse?
Come on, you almost got it. Let's go.
'There you go, right foot on the brake'
'left foot on the clutch.'
'Neutral...start it up.'
[engine turns over]
There you go. There you go.
- Uh. - Okay, let off that clutch.
Let it off.
There you go, nice and easy.
Hey, hey!
We're going, we're driving. We're driving!
- We're driving. - Oh..
- Okay, now shift. - What?
Shift, shift. Just put it into second.
- How? What? - 'Put the clutch in.'
Pull it down to second.
Second, yeah, yeah, that's it.
Good, yes.
We're driving.
Woo-hoo! We're driving.
Dad?
Dad?
- 'Dad?' - Huh?
'Are you okay?'
Yeah.
Your headache back?
I'm alright.
Well, I was gonna go to the beach.
Okay.
Are you coming?
Be down there in a minute.
Beautiful, isn't it?
Hey.
It's beautiful, huh?
Your headache better?
Yeah. Thanks.
What are you listening to?
You wouldn't like it.
[music stops]
When did you start getting high?
I don't.
I was loaded most of the eighth grade.
I'm no fool, stop treating me like one.
I don't get high.
I'm missing three Vicodin.
Any idea what happened to them?
Maybe you took them and forgot.
What else are you doing?
We know about the Ecstasy, now the Vicodin.
Huffing? Speed?
I already told you, nothing.
Crystal meth, what?
You don't believe me, fine.
Rachel.
Rachel..
Rach.
You're only 14.
What the hell are you going to be putting in your body
when you're 16, hmm?
We're going to talk about this.
Rachel, damn it. Stop.
I love you.
Please don't do this. I don't..
I don't know what to do.
I don't have time to work this through.
I'm not gonna be here in a year to help.
You've got a bastard of a father
who was never around
and then went off and had a new baby.
Your mom got remarried to a creep
and she works too much.
You got a raw deal, alright?
Why not get high?
No one gives a damn about you anyway.
I know how that feels.
I remember being 14 and pissed off at my dad
and the world.
What are you gonna do when I'm not here, Rach?
'Who is gonna keep you from killing yourself?'
I'm scared.
'Scared about what's gonna happen to you.'
Look, it sucks.
I'm your father and I'm gonna die.
You know what? I think it sucks, too.
'No.'
It's..yeah.
No, it's fine.
I'm great.
No, I'm feeling good.
How's Ella?
Really? That's great.
She's fine.
You know...fourteen.
[acoustic guitar music]
You want to go out to dinner or just eat here?
I think we have some of that "ono" left.
Vegetables...I..
I want pizza. Can we get some pizza?
There's that place down by the surf shop
looked pretty good.
[thud] Oh!
Dad!
God, Dad?
Dad? Dad!
[acoustic guitar music]
[car door opens]
Mark?
Mark!
Oh, my goodness, look at this.
[acoustic guitar music continues]
Mark?
Hi.
Hi.
We were out driving around
and saw the vacation rental sign.
It must cost a fortune.
You only live once.
There's a lady named Janet.
She lives up the road, takes care of children.
She said she'd be happy to help out.
Huh? What's this?
Herbs. I got a whole bunch of them.
I take them in the morning, afternoon.
Boost my immune system.
Is this snakeskin?
'Could be.'
The lady who does my acupuncture
gave them to me.
Couldn't hurt.
I can't find a corkscrew.
How about a beer?
Sure.
So where's Rachel?
She's out surfing.
She found you in a grand mal seizure.
It's no big deal.
'She was scared to death'
when she called me.
What did the neurologist say?
Upped the Dilantin to 400.
- 'You didn't see a doctor?' - No.
Well, how do you know what your level is?
I'm fine.
Mark, you need a CAT scan and a full work-up.
No, thanks.
Take my hand.
Go on.
Squeeze my fingers.
How about your wrist?
Your elbow?
Right. We're going home.
You need an MRI
and to see the neurologist.
No.
I don't wanna go back home.
[acoustic guitar music]
It's beautiful here, isn't it?
Come on, lemme-lemme show you the beach.
What's she going to do with a surfboard in St. Louis?
She can let it gather dust in the garage.
Has she been like this the whole time?
Pretty much.
Lucky you.
Hey, I never knew they were so tall.
Some are, some aren't.
Hey. We're looking for a longboard
for my daughter, she's 14.
How long are you thinking?
Nine, nine-one, maybe a Hamilton.
What's she doing?
It's okay.
Does she even want a surfboard?
Watch this.
Who's he?
Don't stare. It'll upset her.
Well, does she know him?
He works here. His name's Kai.
Kai?
Kai. Means ocean.
She's made up a new excuse
'why we had to come back here'
'for the last three days.'
- How old is he? - I don't know.
He looks only 16.
Could be.
Maybe 17.
'I have some boards she might like'
a PapaSan and a Sunburn.
Good.
* Where troubles melt like lemon drops *
* Away above the chimney tops
* That's where you'll find me
* Somewhere over the rainbow
* Bluebirds fly
* Birds fly
* Over the rainbow
* Why, oh, why
* Can't I?
Rachel, can you come help me?
[Mark Greene gasping]
Remember when I used to sing you to sleep?
No.
You made me do it for years.
You watched "The Wizard of Oz"
and "The Little Mermaid" over and over again.
Drive me crazy.
We had that apartment
off of Division
with the big iron gates out front
and that funny-looking mutt next door, Dudley.
Dad.
There was a playground across the street.
Remember the big slide?
I don't. I don't remember, okay?
I don't remember any of that stuff.
It's not important and you just
keep talking and talking about it.
- It is important. - No, it's not.
Where you used to live, where we used to live
'and Grandmom's stupid garden'
'and Granddad's cousin Dave or whatever.'
Rachel, keep your voice down. The baby's sleeping.
I'm trying to tell you about us
about our family. Our history.
It's stupid, boring, useless crap.
- It's not crap. - Some dog named Dudley?
You loved that dog.
'I don't care about these things.'
'I don't want to hear this stuff'
so just stop talking to me about it.
[door slams]
[baby cries]
I'll go.
[waves crashing on shore]
How long are you planning on keeping this up?
He's not perfect.
Far from it.
But he's trying.
You've got to grow up faster
than you should have to.
You don't get to be a child anymore.
Your father's dying.
I know that.
He's going to die soon, very soon.
And if you keep going on like this you're gonna miss
what little time you have left with him.
This is it, Rachel.
This is your last chance
and if you blow it, you're gonna end up
hating yourself for the rest of your life.
[sniffing]
[grunts]
Shit!
[Mark coughing]
I'm a bit worried about that cough.
It's okay.
We could go to the hospital
and get a CBC and a chest x-ray.
No, thanks.
Mark, the decadron is suppressing
your immune system.
No kidding.
Did you up it again?
Okay, well, if it turns to pneumonia
we can give IV antibiotics.
- Pneumonia, huh? - Uh-huh.
That's not a bad way to go.
Oh!
There we go.
Where's Rachel?
'She's at sunset with Kai.'
Hmm.
Nice offshore breeze.
Waves should be great.
They're spending a great deal of time together.
He's a nice kid.
So you're not worried?
About what?
About what they might be doing in all that time.
Nope.
I think it's great.
I need you to do something for me.
- Mm-hm. - It might be kind of hard.
I want to write letters..
...to Rachel and Ella.
I tried to do it myself but..
...I can't read my own writing now.
I want them to..
...open letters on special days.
High school graduation..
...college..
...their wedding days.
Think that's cruel?
[clears throat] Reaching out from beyond the grave
on days when they should be happy?
I think they'll cherish every single word.
Told you it might be hard.
I'm okay.
[gasping]
Is he asleep?
Yup.
He sleeps a lot now.
Yeah.
He's in a lot of pain.
It won't be long now.
Hi.
Hi.
I was just dreaming about you.
You were?
When you used to love balloons.
You remember how much you loved balloons?
No.
I used to buy them for you.
And right when I handed them to you..
...you let them go.
Drive your mother crazy.
Sit with me...sit down.
Sit.
I was trying to figure out..
...what I should have already told you
but I never have.
Something important.
Something every father..
...should impart to his daughter.
I finally got it.
Generosity.
Be...generous.
With...your time.
With your love..
With...your life.
Okay.
I'm sorry, Rachel.
I'm so tired.
That's okay.
Don't...cry for me.
I won't.
Be generous.
Always.
I will.
Daddy?
I remember the lullaby.
I remember you used to sing it to me every night.
I remember.
