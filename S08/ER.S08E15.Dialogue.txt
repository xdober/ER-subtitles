Previously on E.R.
It's an isolated dysfunction of the right hypoglossal nerve.
It's a recurrence.
I know there's nothing
I can do to make it right. You can leave.
You can pack up your things and leave my house.
Either she's out of the house by the time
I take that baby home, or I'm not taking that baby home.
Brian. Brian!
I won't mess with Abby again.
I won't even talk to her.
If you touch her again...
I'll kill you.
( clanging )
I apologize
for how late he's running.
It's okay.
I'm sure he'll be with you any moment.
I can wait.
I'll see you
in two weeks.
Oh, Judy will give you all
your pre-op instructions. before you leave.
Thank you.
You've come to the right place, Mary.
Mark.
You look good.
You, too.
How was your flight?
Uneventful.
The best kind.
Elizabeth with you?
Not this time.
DOCTOR: See this area?
It's called "ring enhancement."
It encircles the cavity where we removed your tumor.
Could it be inflammation from a vaccine?
No.
How about a side-effect from radiation?
The Spec MRI shows a peak of creatine and choline
with a depressed NAA, which rules out radiation necrosis.
I'm afraid it's definitely tumor regrowth.
Don't you need a biopsy?
Spectroscopy was conclusive.
How soon can you operate?
I can't.
Not this time.
The tumor's invaded the eloquent areas
of the brain that control speech and motor function.
If I start digging around in there now
the side effects would be devastating.
You wouldn't be able to walk, talk, feed yourself....
Which is exactly what'll happen as the tumor grows.
Some of the cells must have been radiation-resistant.
So what are my options?
I mean, other than sticking a shotgun in my mouth?
Well, your best bet now is Stereotactic Radio Surgery.
The Gamma knife's safe and effective
and they can do it in Chicago.
And if it works?
The average is four, maybe five...
Years?
Months.
So, I'm back where I started.
You should have been dead a year ago, Mark.
You got married, saw your daughter be born.
I'd say that was time well spent.
Dad?
Dad!
Don't you have work today?
I'm up.
I made you some coffee.
Thanks.
You want some breakfast?
No. I'm good, thanks.
I'll be down in a minute.
Elizabeth called while you were in the shower.
You should have come and got me.
Did she leave a number? No.
How am I supposed to call her back?
Oh, she just wanted you
to bring some things for Ella to work.
I wrote them down.
Oh.
I can get all that stuff and put it
in a bag or something if you want.
No, no, no. I'll do it.
I don't mind.
How'd it go?
What?
The conference in New York.
Oh, good. You know.
Usual.
Boring.
So, everything's set for staying tonight at Kelly's?
Hmm-hmm. Yeah.
Are you sure you should be doing this?
This?
Working a double shift.
You still seem a little tired from your trip.
I'll be fine.
Iverson in Four needs about another hour of monitoring.
Dunn, also in Four, is probably going to need a walking cast.
The foot X-rays are pending.
Dr. Lewis is crashed out in Three.
Susan?
Yeah, she, uh, she worked a double, so don't wake her up.
And last, but not least
is the lovely but kind of spooky Miss Armstrong in Two.
Was waiting on a psych consult
before the sewer people come and get her.
What sewer people?
She's crazy, Deb, hence the psych consult.
There's a bad burn trauma coming in, so have fun.
Mm, right. He called again.
Ugh, Randall?
Mm-hmm, five calls in 18 hours.
Sounds like a stalker.
You want me to talk to him?
No. Thanks.
What are you looking at?
WOMAN: Theresa Matthews, comatose for over a year following an MVA.
Mom takes care of her at home.
She called 911 because she thought
her daughter was in discomfort.
How could she tell? That was my question.
Abby.
Dr. Kovac wants you to meet him
in the ambulance bay
with Mrs. Tartaglia's X-rays.
Really?
Said it was an emergency.
Tartaglia from last night?
She's the one with the whiplash.
Just telling you what he said.
You know, a little bit more information
might have been helpful.
Am I talking to you?
Could you guys knock it off and help me find it?
Is that it?
Yeah.
Who's your friend?
Would you mind telling me what's going on?
Uh... he was going to give me a ticket.
Excuse me?
I told him I had an emergency.
Oh, so you used me to get out of a ticket.
It would have been a big ticket.
( engine starts )
I owe you one.
CARTER: Nice car.
Did he get the leopard-print interior?
You off?
Not till 10:00.
What did you do to deserve that?
I asked.
This way I'm never home when my neighbor is.
He's out on bail?
Mm. Until the trial.
Then I can get my life back.
How's his wife?
She's good.
Safe.
How are you?
How's the eye?
It's good.
I think my Good Samaritan days are over, though.
Probably saved her life.
Steady midnights, that can be tough.
You getting enough sleep?
Yeah? Eating okay?
Feeling depressed or anxious?
I have to get back.
Call if you want to talk.
I'm good.
Coffee and pie on me, if you change your mind.
Hey!
What does a girl have to do
to get a cup of coffee around here?
Mark?
Hey.
Hey, I just worked two shifts.
I'm the one that's supposed to be a zombie.
A little slow getting started this morning.
How was New York?
Well, I didn't see as many Broadway plays as I'd hoped.
My tumor's back.
Oh, God, Mark, I'm sorry.
I do Gamma knife today.
Today? What are you doing here?
It's best to stay busy.
How's Elizabeth taking it?
I haven't told her yet.
What?! Why not?
Mark, you shouldn't be going through this alone.
I'll see her this afternoon.
What time's your treatment?
1:30.
I'm going to go home and get some rest
but after, I'll come by and see if you're okay.
No, no, you don't have to. No, I want to.
Excuse me, Dr. Greene, Dr. Weaver needs some help.
All right, I'll let you go.
Bye. Good luck.
What patient?
She's got an elderly woman in CHF
and explosion trauma just rolled in
and there's a multiple MVA with a possible spinal injury
ten minutes out.
Mark, they need you in Trauma Two-- burn victim.
Okay.
I'm firing that new guy.
What new guy?
Jerry.
Jerry was here before you, Frank.
So was the Neanderthal Man
but he didn't last either.
You can't fire anybody.
Either he goes, or I go.
You, you'll be hearing from my lawyer.
What'd I do?
Mark, coffee.
( grunting )
GREENE: Did you pass out?
No.
Full trauma panel, portable c-spine, chest and pelvis.
Start a second IV with LR.
Add an ABG with carboxyhemoglobin and a CK.
Sats 94, pulse 120.
Can I give him something for pain?
Uh, titrate ten of morphine
but watch his pressure
keep him above 90.
Carbonaceous material around his nose and lips.
He's not moving much air.
That's cause he's in too much pain to breathe.
How much fluid?
One liter per hour for the first eight hours.
MARQUEZ: I'll ask my super, but
I think there's a waiting list for my building.
Hey, there's been an old lady
who's been sick on my floor.
I don't know if I want to live in an apartment where somebody died.
Well all you need is some Lysol and some air freshener--
it's all good.
Are you moving? Yeah.
The freak who hit me moved back in.
You can stay at my place till you find something else.
Thanks.
I don't know if that's a good idea.
Why not?
Yeah, Abby, why not?
Don't you guys have something to do?
You shouldn't have to leave your own place.
He should be forced to move.
Mm, he'll be in jail soon.
I just don't know if I want
to live there after all this.
What's with the car?
Like it?
Kind of flashy.
Well, you only live once.
Not if you keep driving like a maniac.
You look kind of tired.
Yeah, I was up late.
Oh, really? What's her name?
Who?
It's a joke, Luka.
No, seriously, if you need a place...
Thank you.
You can stay as long as you need
and you only have to sleep with me on the weekends.
Excuse me?
It's a joke, Abby, it's a joke.
Who called for a consult?
Uh, burn patient, Trauma Two.
What doctor?
Greene.
Make it stop hurting.
GREENE: We're trying, Ian.
How's his PO2?
89 on ten liters.
That's pretty borderline.
I don't want to tube him yet.
Why the hell not? He's hypoxic.
He needs intubation, then I can assess him
for escharotomy.
Dr. Greene, his wife's here.
That's why I've been waiting.
Keep an eye on him.
Mrs. Nevinger.
I'm Dr. Greene...
Can I see him?
The surgeon's in with him now.
The surgeon?
The burns caused
constrictive tissue swelling around his chest.
He may need a procedure
to relieve that so that he can breathe easier.
You have to do an escharotomy?
Maybe.
You in the medical professional?
Yeah, I'm a nurse at Mercy.
Is he intubated?
Not yet.
What's the surface area?
Over 50%
Oh, God.
Do you know how it happened?
Uh, he was in the garage painting
some new furniture for our son's bedroom.
Did he have a heater on in the garage?
No, he paints cars.
He knows he has to be careful around that stuff.
Well, we're going to do everything we can.
CORDAY: Repeat the blood gas in 20 minutes
and have a fiber-optic scope standing by.
Elizabeth.
How is he?
In need of intubation.
I brought the things you asked me to bring.
Thank you.
What are we doing?
I miss you and Ella, I need you to come home.
I can't.
You have every right to be angry with me
but staying in a hotel isn't going to solve anything.
Mark, I'm not trying to punish you.
I'm just trying to do what's best for Ella.
Don't you think what's best for her
is to be with her mother and father?
Yes, I do.
So, when are you coming home?
I don't know.
How many lights do you see?
One. There's nothing wrong with my eyes.
It's my arms and legs.
Aaron, we need you to lay absolutely still.
No sign of cranial nerve impaction
or blowout fracture.
Bilateral TM's clear.
No blood.
Does it hurt when I press here
or just on the sides? Both.
Foreface is stable.
No dental fractures.
( moaning )
Okay.
We're going to leave the collar on
for a while.
Let's tape down his head
and use sandbags to stabilize.
Can you feel this?
No.
DARCEY: How's he doing?
It's too early to tell.
Can he tell me what happened?
I thought it was a sledding accident.
Yeah, his father got smashed
and was pulling him and his friend on the sled
behind a snowmobile.
You smelled alcohol on his breath?
No, but he seemed out of it.
Maybe drugs.
Lungs are clear, bilaterally
normal heart tones.
You going somewhere? What?
That's the third time you've looked
at the clock.
Aaron, can you feel this?
No.
How about now?
No.
Anything?
No.
Why can't I feel my arms?
Just relax, Aaron. We're tying to help you, okay.
I'm going to go out and speak with the father.
Prep the Solu-Medrol, hold the scanner.
Okay, give me a reflex hammer.
Mr. James, I'm Dr. Greene.
I'm treating your son, Aaron.
He got hurt.
We're sending him for X-rays and an MRI
and we'll have better idea of what we're looking at
once the neurosurgeon's
had a chance to assess his injuries.
This is all my fault.
You were pulling him and his friend
behind a snowmobile?
I-I knew it was wrong.
Have you been drinking?
You mean booze?
No.
I-I told them.
Told who?
Aaron and Chris, that we shouldn't.
But they kept bugging me to.
Well, that's where adult judgment comes in.
MAN: Hey, idiot!
GREENE: Is there a problem?
Yeah, my son's got a broken arm
thanks to dumb and dumber here.
You could've killed both of them!
I didn't mean to. It was an accident.
You need to settle down, sir.
I'll settle down after he's arrested.
Look, he shouldn't be allowed
to operate a motor vehicle.
He's only got half a brain.
I'm serious.
His wife even left him because he's lost it.
DARCEY: Let's go over here and talk, sir.
Sorry about that.
It's okay. He's kind of right.
I-I would've never done something like this
before I was stupid.
Sit down.
Wh-What happened?
July 17, 1997. It was very hot.
I-I took off my hard hat
so I could wipe the sweat off my forehead
and a pipe fell loose from the fitting above me
and... boom.
Head injury.
My brain doesn't work as good as it used to.
Does Aaron live with you now?
Sometimes.
We're buddies now.
We don't fight like we used to.
He's going to get better, right?
I hope so. LOCKHART: Dr. Greene.
Mrs. Nevinger's wondering
about an update on her husband.
Um, sit tight. I'll come back
and tell you about your son. Thank you.
Can you get a red top on Mr. James? Sure.
Nobody's telling me anything.
He's still in with the surgeon.
Why don't you sit down here
and I'll find out.
Oh, Abby.
District Attorney's office called.
Your subpoena's been revoked.
Revoked?
Trial's been canceled.
What?
Why?
I don't know, some legal snafu, I guess.
You know about lawyers--
they're half as smart as doctors but twice as sneaky.
Ian, your wife's here.
She wants to come in and see you.
( strained ): Is she alone?
No, your sons are with her.
I don't w-want them to see me like this.
I'm going to have to put a tube down your throat
to protect your airway.
Once I do that
you won't be able to talk to them.
I don't care.
You urine tested positive for amphetamines.
Want to tell me why?
( quivering ): I've been working two jobs.
Sometimes, I need a little help to keep me going.
How do you take it?
You smoke it?
Did you light up
with all those fumes in the garage?
I wanted to finish the dresser.
Birthday's on Saturday.
ROMANO: Hey, where have you been?
Elizabeth!
I was down in the E.R.
Uh-huh, let me guess
rule out appy on a corpse?
No. Well, you're lucky.
I'm beginning to think
E.R. stands for Everyone's Retarded.
I mean, I know your hubby's
one of the big giant heads down there
but honestly, it's a wonder
they all find their way to work every day.
Excuse me, Dr. Corday.
Your nanny called.
Said they're just leaving the hotel.
Thanks.
That sounds kinky.
Do you need something, Robert?
Yes, actually.
Your buddy, Benton, left us
with eight delinquent operative reports.
Yeah, well, he said he was stopping by
sometime this week. Yeah, right.
He wouldn't be caught dead in this hospital
which means they are now your problem.
I'm not the operating surgeon.
I don't give a damn.
I just want a dictated op note
on every chart before
( pager beeps ) our JAY-COE review.
I'm being paged to the E.R.
If I don't have them by tomorrow
I'm going to report him to the state medical board.
Someone is very popular today.
Oh, Jerry, give me a break.
FRANK: You know, I could have
one of my old buddies on the force
do a background check on this Randall character.
Isn't that nice to know.
Now what's that supposed to mean?
It means that the continuing invasion
of personal privacy by law enforcement is appalling
not to mention immoral.
Well, you have nothing to worry about
if you don't have anything to hide.
Malcontent.
( scoffs ): Psycho fascist.
Now that's it! Hey, settle down, you two.
No, do if you want to start something, tough guy?
Bring it on, gramps. Gramps?
Who the hell are you calling...?!
CHEN: Hey, guys, stop it!
Both of you stop it! Hey, hey!
Ow!
Now look what you did!
You did it!
Will you both shut up!
Are you okay?
WOMAN: Can I get a doctor here?
What happened?
Dennis Cooper, 32. Multiple GSWs to the chest.
I got his eight-year-old daughter, too.
Was she shot?
Not that I could see.
Dad arrested about a minute out.
No BP, but good pulse with CPR.
All right, somebody page Corday
and open a thoracotomy tray.
CORDAY: Spreader.
Okay, crank it open.
Suction.
What do you need?
Oh, no, it slipped. I need to reset the lift.
Could use a subclavian.
Eight French, Cordis introducer.
Gallant's next door with the daughter.
Paramedics didn't think
she was injured, but she was covered in blood.
I've got it, Kerry.
Open up the pericardium.
Pickup.
What's her status, Gallant?
She has a couple superficial abrasions.
No evidence of any penetrating injuries.
I don't think any of this is her blood.
Hey, who's your friend?
The first officers on the scene found her hiding under a table.
But by the looks of it, she saw everything
including who shot her father.
So, what's your name?
I couldn't get her to say anything.
Her name is Brianne Cooper.
Brianne?
I'm Dr. Weaver.
And we're trying to make your daddy better, okay?
Okay.
( quietly ): All right.
Now, are you hurt?
I don't think so.
Did you see who shot your father?
Do you mind?
I need to know.
Yeah, and I need to make sure that she's all right.
You can wait outside until we're finished.
Her father is known for...
Outside means outside.
Should I call DCFS?
Mm-hmm.
Don't worry, Brianne.
You and your daddy are safe here.
Nobody's going to hurt you now
okay?
WATKINS: She wasn't hurt.
Physically, no.
But she's already showing signs
of post-traumatic stress disorder.
You have to wait
until the pediatric psychiatrist
is finished with her.
How long is that going to take?
Hey, look, this little girl just saw somebody
put five bullets into her father.
Yeah, and I need to know who did it.
Her father's a well-known drug dealer
and a murder suspect, in his own right.
If whoever did this finds out that she is the only witness
they may decide to finish the job.
What about her mother?
She's a junkie.
And a possible suspect.
All right, post an officer
outside her room, and, uh
I'll try to speak with her.
Okay, fine.
We did the best we could.
But the bullet passed through
Mr. Cooper's aorta.
How's the little girl?
She's still shock.
Would you like me to speak to her for you?
No, I... you know
I think I should do it, but thanks.
Sorry about the delay.
We got a little backed up.
GREENE: No problem.
The whole procedure only takes about 40 minutes
once we get started.
Okay? Okay.
This frame provides reference points
so we can pinpoint the tumor
with 201 separate gamma rays.
Hope you're a good shot.
Well, the machine's accurate up to .3 millimeters.
What if I sneeze?
Just try not to.
Could vaporize all the brain matter
in your skull cavity.
I'm kidding, Dr. Greene.
You won't be able to move
once we lock the frame down, okay?
Any last questions?
Nope.
All right, see you in a few minutes.
( machine humming )
Just try and relax
Dr. Greene.
I'm ready.
Has anybody seen Dr. Greene?
He left. Already?
Did he say where he was going?
Sorry.
( sighs ): We have an appointment.
I can page him.
You should take it easy for the rest of the day.
No problem.
A few people report headaches, nausea and vomiting.
What about seizures?
Less than 10% experience seizures in the next 24 hours
but you're on Dilantin and we gave you some Decadron
to reduce the risk of brain edema.
Is there someone here to drive you home?
I took the L.
But do you have someone staying with you tonight?
My daughter.
It would be better if it's an adult.
Rachel's a teenager.
Okay. Well, just have her check on you
and call if there any problems, all right?
Reschedule Jenna Kline for Thursday
and fax Dr. Horton Brook Young's MEG results.
I'm Dr. Greene. My daughter has an appointment.
Ella.
Yeah. My wife should be bringing her.
You just missed them.
LOCKHART: Well, what does that mean, exactly?
It means in the interest of legal efficiency
we cut a deal.
A deal for what? For jail time?
No. One year parole
40 hours of community service.
Community service? This guy attacked me.
This is his first offense.
Yeah, but he's pathological.
I've had to call the police on him before.
He has no prior arrests.
We're also insisting he undergo mandatory therapy.
Oh, that's great.
So, what, he counts to ten
before he hits somebody now?
I'm sorry. This is the best we could do.
The best you can do? Let's not overlook the fact
that someone beat the hell out of Brian Westlake
a couple of hours after you were attacked.
What?
But you didn't know anything about that, right?
No.
GREENE: Wiggle your toes.
Fingers.
I'm not paralyzed?
You're showing signs of improvement.
It's only going to get better
as the swelling in your spinal cord goes down.
You are lucky.
Let me put this behind you.
Your dad is going to be glad to hear this.
The police think that he was drinking.
My dad doesn't drink.
Pretty angry about what he did.
Pulling you behind a snowmobile.
Your dad should know better.
He does.
Then what happened?
It wasn't your dad's idea
to pull you behind the snowmobile, was it?
It was Chris's idea.
We were just trying to have a little fun.
Elizabeth.
Where were you?
I'm sorry. Something came up.
Something more important than our daughter?
I was there. I just missed you.
I talked to the doctor.
Everything's going to be okay.
Yeah, well, any long-term effects
remain to be seen, don't they?
Dr. Greene, Ian Nevinger's sats are down to 78.
I'm down for a GSW.
You better hope you can still intubate him.
You still awake in here?
A little.
Um, Brianne, I have some bad news
about your father.
The surgeons did their best to help him
but one of the bullets hit his heart
and damaged it.
They couldn't fix it.
He died.
I know it's hard and you feel really sad
but it's very important that you talk with the police.
No.
They just want to make sure that they find out
who did this so that they don't hurt anyone else.
Did you see who shot your father?
Yes.
And do you know who they were?
Yes.
Will you tell the police?
I can't.
Honey, you don't need to be afraid.
Was it your mother?
No.
Then who?
Me.
You?
You shot your father?
He fell asleep on the couch
and left the gun on the coffee table.
Why did you shoot him?
Brianne, was he hurting you?
Honey, was he doing things to you that he shouldn't be?
He wouldn't let me watch TV.
So you shot him?
He said if I turned on the TV while he was asleep
he'd shoot me, so I shot him first.
We can't protect his airway much longer.
Can we go in before you intubate him?
He'd prefer if you didn't.
This is the last chance we'll have to speak with him.
He doesn't want you to see him
in his present condition.
I've seen worse.
This is your husband.
Yes, he is.
If they stay here.
Okay. Brendan, watch your brother.
I have to talk to the doctor.
Carboxyhemoglobin's 30.
I said no.
I said yes.
You're going to be okay, Ian.
How does my hair look?
You might want to get a wig till it grows back.
Maybe I can get an afro.
Haleh, suction.
Uh, I can do that. I'm an RN.
I'm sorry.
Shh. Don't talk.
Burn unit have any beds? Still holding.
He's going to need a Swann-Ganz catheter.
These his labs?
Some of them.
He tested positive for amphetamines?
Were you smoking up?
It was an accident.
You lied to me. You told me you were going to stay clean
You promised me you'd quit.
I did.
Was it good? Did you get
nice and stoned?
I just wanted to finish the dresser.
No, Ian, you just wanted to get high!
( splutters )
Chuny, have you seen Mrs. Nevinger?
No. Sorry.
What's going on?
We're trying to decide what to do with Aaron.
We can't reach the mother.
The father's blood-alcohol level was negative.
Yes, but what he did was still reckless.
I don't want to split up this family
but the father is as much a kid as his son.
The boys talked him into it.
They should take some of the blame.
You need to talk to them.
I did, and they didn't say anything.
Did you talk to a social worker and the police?
Yeah.
What'd you tell 'em?
What do you care?
You worried about getting in trouble?
No.
What is it then?
You want your dad to get arrested?
Maybe it'll smarten him up.
What?
My dad's always doing stupid stuff
and saying things that are totally embarrassing.
Every teenager thinks that about their parents.
Yeah, but my dad's really a moron.
Well, you won't have to worry about that
once Child Services puts you into a foster family.
He could have said no.
Could he?
You think your father likes what happened to him?
He lost his wife, he lost his job.
He lost himself.
You're the only thing he has left.
And he still thinks that you two are buddies.
We are.
Well, then you need to grow up and start acting like one.
Are the cops still here?
They might be.
Well, can I talk to them again?
I'll see what I can do.
And...
could you tell my dad I'm sorry?
No... but you can.
( exhaling )
( sighs )
( footsteps approaching )
Why are you still here?
I'm on till 8:00.
You shouldn't be on at all.
Do you have a headache?
Just a... little stress.
Yeah, that and several hundred beams of radiation
zapped into your brain this afternoon.
You need to go home.
There's just a half an hour left.
Did you tell her?
Who?
Mark...
You said you were going to talk to her.
Does Rachel know?
Mark, they're going to figure it out.
Let them figure it out.
So, you're going to keep this a secret
act like nothing's wrong
until you pass out in public?
The moment you tell them
they start treating you differently.
They start giving you that look.
What look?
That look that looks like you're half there.
Like you're already gone.
Believe me, I've seen it before.
Yeah, well, you're still here.
Good night.
Whoa.
What is it?
Nothing.
Mark...
I'm so nauseous.
You know, that's it. I'm taking you home.
No, I am not going home.
You know what? You have two choices.
I'm taking you home right now
or I'm ratting you out to Weaver.
What's it going to be?
You better not vomit in my car.
The burn unit is ready for Nevinger, Dr. Corday.
Haleh, do we have Marcaine?
Right in front of you.
Right.
Can you take him up?
I don't want to lose his airway in the elevator.
Who?
Nevinger-- the surface burn.
I thought he was intubated.
He stabilized on the heliox
but he's drifting down again.
Well, he's Dr. Greene's patient.
Why don't you ask him?
Dr. Greene went home.
He did?
Half hour ago.
Says "Corday" on the chart.
Fine.
Mr. Nevinger, how's your breathing?
Didn't you find her?
Who?
My wife.
Uh, she wasn't here?
( gags )
Um, .8 of Pav
prep 20 of Etomidate, 120 of SUX.
Mr. Nevinger, we're going to have to intubate you for transfer.
You might not be able to talk for a few days
but your wife will be able to talk to you.
I let her down.
HALEH: Tested positive for amphetamines.
I promised her.
Well, all you need to worry about now is getting better.
8-0 ET tube.
Even if I live
she'll leave me.
Oh, I'm sure that's not true.
( sputtering )
( laughs )
Wouldn't you?
I mean, look at me.
Things might be difficult
for both of you for a while, yes
but, uh... you just need to give her some time.
Could you find her?
Meds are in.
Tell her I love her.
I'm sorry.
Yes, of course.
Yankauer tip and a 3 mac.
No, I had Debbie pick up the kids.
Okay.
Thanks, Evelyn.
No, I will. I will.
Yeah, 'bye.
Mrs. Nevinger?
I'm Dr. Corday.
I helped work on your husband.
Uh, they told me you were in Chairs.
I couldn't find you.
I was afraid you'd left.
No, I'm leaving now.
I just called Ian's mom. She's coming.
I didn't tell her about the drugs.
I should.
I should let the boys see him
show them what drugs did to their father.
Well, they'll see that soon enough.
Yeah, assuming we're still around when he gets out.
We've just moved your husband up to the burns unit.
Look, I know what he did was wrong
and obviously you have some things to work out.
But he really needs you right now.
Yeah?
What about me?
What about my sons?
They really need a father, but they don't have one now.
Yes, they do.
No, they have a drug addict in a hospital bed
with burns over 50% of his body.
He's still their father.
He's still your husband.
( sighs )
Look, you do know that he could succumb
to infection, and he could die within the next week.
That is not my fault.
I begged him to stop using drugs.
And I'm certain he's sorry for what he did.
Is he?
Mrs. Nevinger, he's in unbelievable pain.
He'll be permanently disfigured.
He'll never look like the father your sons remember.
I think he's suffered
enough punishment, don't you?
You two can go home.
You're both suspended until Monday.
For what?
For fighting.
( chuckling ): We weren't fighting.
I was told you two got into a fistfight.
I'm afraid somebody's pulling
your leg there, Chief... so to speak.
Yeah, I-I love this... old guy.
( Frank laughs )
Dr. Chen, did you or did you not witness
these two getting into an altercation?
What altercation?
You were knocked to the floor.
No, I tripped over a phone cord earlier
but, uh, that was my own fault.
Hey, knock it off, you two.
Carter! Ah! Just the man I want to see.
Ooh, look, I got six patients for you.
I'm not on for eight minutes.
Yeah, but you're here.
But I'm eating.
Oh, well, too bad.
Jing-mei?
Randall.
Hey, I've, uh, been calling you all day.
Did you, uh, did you get my flowers?
Um, yes.
Thanks.
So, are you off?
Um, you know, actually, I have a...
Aren't you supposed to be covering Dr. Greene?
Yes. Yes, I am.
Oh, what about after that?
( sighs )
Um, you know...
Look, Randall, you're a nice guy and all, but, uh...
I just don't think this is going to work out between us.
Well, I had fun.
Yeah.
Sorry. I've got to get back to work.
Well, can I call you?
No.
Bye.
Don't tell me you just broke up with that guy.
It was hardly a breakup.
I mean, we just went out once.
One date and he's buying you flowers?
Yeah, can you believe it?
You know, you give a guy a hand release
during Harry Potter and he wants to marry you.
( chokes )
You okay?
Thank you.
( music plays )
Hi.
Hi.
Can I help you?
Nope.
Hey, Abby?
Hey.
Come on in.
No, I di... I di... I just wanted to say hi.
I didn't want to bother you.
I didn't know you had... company.
No, just a couple of friends.
I'll see you tomorrow.
No, you need a place to stay. Let me help.
It's okay, really.
Please? For me.
I need you.
They're kicking my ass in Pictionary.
Come on!
Three lap choles, two inguinal hernias
LeFort III Reduction
vagotomy and a pancreaticoduodenectomy.
I only assisted on the LeFort.
Daniels was the primary.
Growing demand for breast implants, apparently.
Yeah, well, I guess I should have moved further away myself.
This doesn't have to be so clandestine, Peter.
You won't burst into flames
if you actually step inside the hospital.
I know, I just... I just wanted to make a clean break.
Yeah, well, finish those and you'll be free of us.
Oh, and you owe me $27 for Xerox.
How's the baby?
Normal background rhythms.
Low amp activity.
Make sure you get SSEPs.
You seem to be holding up okay.
Yeah.
What?
What?
I think I may have left my husband.
You think?
Well, I moved out.
I'm living in a hotel.
What happened?
( sighs )
I've never made demands on him.
Not real ones, anyway.
The only time I ask him
to put his family first, he can't do it.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Back up. Um, you lost me.
He won't send Rachel away.
It's like he has to prove he loves her.
And you want him to prove he loves you?
Yes.
No.
I don't know.
I don't know if I'm protecting my daughter
or if I'm just angry.
Look, Elizabeth, I'd be angry, too.
At Mark.
You see, I think
I do blame him for what happened.
And I think I've found a way
to avoid being with him because I blame him.
He's different.
It's like he's...
It's like he's disconnected from us somehow.
Or-or maybe it's me, you know?
I just don't have the energy to figure it out.
What happens if he sent Rachel home tomorrow?
MAN: Usually about this time of year
when Chicagoans are tired of the cold and snow
wondering if winter will ever end...
You're out of mustard.
...as more on the January...
I told you I'm not hungry.
You have to eat.
Oh, that's right.
Starve a cold, feed a tumor.
You need to keep your strength up.
I need to take a nap.
Well, I'll help you upstairs if you have some soup.
No, I mean, right now, right here.
What if Rachel comes home?
She'll see you're sick.
She's sleeping over at a friend's.
Mark, you have to have someone watch you
following gamma knife therapy.
Oh, great.
What?
I can't close my eye.
I've heard of cowboys who sleep with one eye open.
I'm glad you think this is funny.
Okay.
Hold still.
You're going to have to start using artificial tears.
How's that?
It's good, thanks.
Don't let the soup get cold, huh?
