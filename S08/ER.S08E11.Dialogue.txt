Previously on ER:
How long have you been sober?
Almost five years.
Your mother's not coming.
John, we're getting divorced.
Stop, please! Paul, Paul...
Please stop!
Check the stylet.
We believe he may have schizophrenia.
Paul wouldn't hurt anyone.
He couldn't.
I'm not deformed!
Temperature's 95. No!
Don't stick me!
Get off of me!
Get pregnant.
I was pregnant.
I had an abortion.
You never even told Richard, did you?
( man and woman yelling next door )
( arguing continues )
Both of you, shut up.
WOMAN: You want to know what your problem is, Brian?
( phone ringing )
MAGGIE ( on machine ): Hello, Abby?
Abby, are you there?
Hello? Abby?
I thought I'd catch you
before your shift.
Anyway, I wanted to wish you a happy birthday.
Hi, Mom.
No, I was just getting up.
Thank you.
( shivering )
Ooh! Your feet are like ice!
Sorry.
I put on some coffee.
What time is it?
It's about 7:30.
You sleep okay?
Yeah. You?
Mm. Except for the snoring.
I don't snore.
Oh, yeah, right.
Like a truck driver.
I don't snore.
( snoring )
Stop it.
( snoring )
( laughing )
Oh, yeah?
Oh, wait a minute.
( laughing )
I've arranged a nurse's aide for you
for while I'm at work.
A nurse?
Just for a couple weeks.
I've got half a dozen people in this house every day.
Well, then one more isn't going to hurt.
If it gets any colder
I'm going to winter in the Bahamas.
Alone.
I thought I heard someone.
Is it just me
or is it freezing in here?
Mom, what are you doing here?
I assumed you could use a hand
while your grandmother recovered.
How are you feeling, Millicent?
I've been better.
Where's Jack?
Uh, Kansas City, I think.
You don't know?
He's on an extended business trip.
We missed the pleasure of your company at Christmas.
You know how the holidays can be.
Where are you staying?
I was hoping to stay here.
In the house?
Yes, if that's all right.
Yeah.
It is freezing in here.
Would somebody please turn up the furnace.
I will go get Alger on it.
WOMAN: It won't start.
MAN: Did you flood it?
No, it won't even turn over.
Did you leave your lights on again? No.
You probably did.
Excuse me. No, I didn't.
Hi. Hi.
Do you have any jumper cables?
No, sorry. I take the El.
I guess you're not the only one today.
Give me the keys.
My husband's not really a morning person.
Hi, I'm Joyce.
We just moved here a few weeks ago
from Virginia. Hi. Abby.
We're in 205.
I think you guys are right beside me.
Nice meeting you.
So, I guess we're neighbors.
Just a wall between us.
Well, maybe, uh, you could come over
for coffee or something sometime.
Sure.
Hey, can we give you a ride somewhere?
No, thank you.
Are you sure?
It's really cold out there.
I'm fine.
I told you. You flooded it.
Welcome to Chicago.
Oh!
Oh, son of a bitch.
You're leaving?
I phoned the Pediatric Cancer Society
to inform them she wasn't coming to their luncheon
and they managed
to corral me.
You don't really have to do that.
She wasn't planning on going.
She just does that for effect.
I'm aware of her behavior.
But they actually were expecting her.
You'll be back tonight?
You're really staying?
Yes.
Unless I'm not welcome.
No, no, it's just...
I thought you were covering.
Dad's in Denver, actually.
Your father told you.
Well, it was pretty obvious.
He was here for two days at Christmas without you.
You thought he was still here.
Uh, we, uh, left it a little open-ended.
Really?
I'm sorry, John.
I should have phoned you
and let you know that I was coming.
Yeah, well.
It's good to see you.
( door opening and closing )
Sanitation guys found him in a dumpster.
Minimally responsive to deep pain
thready pulse in the 50s.
You sure he's not dead?
He's still moving air.
Barely.
Abby, can you bring this guy in?
I haven't even clocked in yet.
I know, but you have a coat on.
Hey, I know this guy.
Oh, man!
Is this great, or what?
Empty chairs, empty racks.
Nothing like sub-arctic temperatures
to keep the freaks at home.
Yeah, except it's freezing in here.
Maintenance is checking the furnace.
This is what we get for punching holes in the ozone layer.
Uh, isn't the greenhouse effect
supposed to make it warmer?
Greenhouse effect, my ass.
It's 40 below out there.
What's this?
This is Icicle Andy.
You want him, he's yours.
I thought he froze to death last year.
The Iceman cometh back.
Okay, Trauma One's open.
Get his core temp
pump in some warm saline
and throw a heating blanket on him.
Oh, I'd keep that on if I were you.
He's bradying down.
No, look, now it's a-fib.
Sounds like rhonchi on the right.
Probably pneumonia.
I think he's decreased on the left.
Do you want to put in a chest tube?
Uh, not if I can help it.
This guy's got bad vascular disease.
We'll never get a line in him.
Fine, prep for lavage.
Oh, man, look at this dude's hands.
Ew.
Can you get a pulse ox?
I don't know.
Can barely get the monitor...
( groan )
What's wrong?
It snapped off.
Ah, he gave you the finger, huh, Abby?
Can they reattach that?
Not without superglue.
Okay, let's get
a central line kit, betadine and some
warm blankets to start.
No, you can't come in here.
You have to go back.
Where's my mom?
She's not in here.
Yes, she was.
You got this?
Yeah.
You lost your mom?
It's not one of these two ladies right here?
She was in there.
Okay, well, maybe she's all finished.
Do you want to see if we can find her?
I'm Abby. What's your name?
Douglas.
Douglas what?
Douglas Leeman.
Okay, Douglas, right this way.
What's your mom's name?
B.
B?
Is that short for Beatrice?
Barbara?
Betty?
Just B.
Just B, okay.
Abby, can you help me?
Uh, sure.
Frank, this is Douglas Leeman.
He's lost his mom.
This is Frank.
He's very good at finding people's moms.
Douglas, you like doughnuts?
When did the chest pains start?
This morning.
But I've been feeling crappy for...
a couple of days.
I thought it was just a cold or maybe the flu.
Bibasilar rales.
Have you experienced any shortness of breath?
Yeah.
I thought I'd step outside, catch a breath of fresh air.
I got so dizzy I fainted.
Three plus pitting edema on both feet.
Have you ever had anything like this before?
Never.
Do you have a heart condition?
No.
Are you on birth control pills?
No, I'm trying to get pregnant.
I've been taking fertility drugs.
FSH.
For how long?
Um... what's today?
Uh, the tenth.
Yeah, then I'm on my tenth.
All right.
Let's get a CBC
chem-20, a DIC panel, and a d-dimer.
Am I having some sort of reaction
to the drugs?
It's possible
but we need to run some more tests
to know for sure.
You've got fluid in your lungs
which could be a sign of a blood clot.
A blood clot?
It's unlikely, but I just want to make sure.
It could be a possible side effect of the medication.
Let's do a doppler.
I'll be back.
Do you want me to call your husband?
I'm not married.
Oh, boyfriend?
I decided to have a baby on my own.
Got tired of waiting around for Mr. Right.
I know that story.
Chest x-ray and an EKG?
Yeah.
And set her up for a VQ.
Haven't seen you around lately.
I've been working nights.
How was your Christmas?
Quiet.
What'd you do for New Year's?
I worked.
That's always fun.
Did you make any resolutions?
Uh, I'm going to help out more.
Help out more where? Here?
Uh, no, Europe.
I've, uh, volunteered to go to Bosnia
for two months with Doctors Without Borders.
Bosnia?
Yeah, I speak the language.
What brought this on?
I don't know.
Change of scenery.
FRANK: Good, huh?
Hey, nice hat, Snoop.
Hey, Frank, I thought you said
you were going to get the heat turned up.
They're working on it.
Oh, really?
Is that why the thermostat in the lounge says 56?
Get used to it.
We're heading into another ice age
like the one that killed the dinosaurs.
Cold didn't kill the dinosaurs, Frank.
Cholesterol did.
Mr. Ellis in Curtain Three can go home.
Miss Renfrew in Four needs to be admitted.
Got a minute?
Uh, no, not really.
I hope your day's
shaping up better than mine.
Doubt it.
I was picking up Rachel's laundry after you left
and this fell out of her jeans.
She's smoking.
I don't think she uses it to light campfires.
What are you going to do?
I don't know.
Did you find anything else in her pockets?
No.
Mark, what if it's not cigarettes?
Her boyfriend tested positive for marijuana.
Ex-boyfriend.
I should search her room.
You think that's wise?
Well, if she's doing drugs, I want to know about it.
You know, asking her doesn't guarantee
I'm going to get the truth.
Yeah, but searching her room--
that's such a violation of her privacy.
You suggested that I rifle through her pockets.
In the course of doing laundry.
HALEH: Dr. Greene.
EMT: Ian Nevinger, 29, burned in a garage...
We'll talk about this.
Looks like some fumes ignited.
Ha, this is adorable.
Don't you think?
It's pretty cute.
You want to buy it?
No, they won't let me send him any gifts.
He must be getting pretty big now, huh?
Yeah.
Oh, they sent a video of him walking
just before Christmas.
It won't be long now
before he's asking to borrow the keys to the car.
( chuckling )
( sighing )
You know, I'm starting to wonder
if I'm making any right decisions lately.
Eh, it's mid-year.
Something will open up by the spring.
Yeah, well, maybe they'll open back up at County.
Hey, cool.
Have you seen these?
These are really neat.
John, um...
What would you say if I told you
I asked the waitress at Doc Magoo's
if she remembered Weaver being paged
the night we lost the Marfan case?
I'd say that place is full of people with pagers.
I know. I was desperate.
So, what, she didn't remember?
Not about Weaver getting paged.
But she remembers Weaver coming back in
looking for her pager
and finding it in the bathroom.
She couldn't answer my page, John
because she didn't have her pager.
Are you sure?
I believe it.
Don't you?
Yeah, that explains it.
What are you going to do?
He die?
Yup.
Did you know him?
Only as Icicle Andy.
I think he was a Vietnam vet.
I heard bums are reincarnated as pigeons when they die.
Really?
I think it's the other way around.
Check it out.
Tickets to tonight's Blackhawks game.
And they're good seats, too.
Whoa.
Where'd he get those?
Any ID?
Mm-hmm.
Just two dollars, some change and matches.
Are you going to keep the tickets?
No.
Can I have them?
No. Why not?
I think it's called grave-robbing.
He ain't using them.
Well, somebody might come to claim the body.
( laughing )
I'm serious.
Yeah, right.
Seriously, I need them. No.
Look, the tickets are only for tonight, Abby.
Ain't nobody coming for this guy.
Forget it.
Oh, come on, Abby.
Abby, look, he's straight-up dead.
Abby, can you take a look at something?
What patient?
Uh, Mr. Paninski-- unstable angina.
I called CCU.
I just wanted to make sure I didn't miss anything.
Did you do a rectal?
No.
You better. Because...
Because if his stool is heme-positive...
The heparin, right.
Thank you.
Frank?
Yeah?
You said you were going to find his mother.
I tried.
No B. Leeman checked in today.
I'm beginning to think somebody dumped him.
He said his mother
was in Trauma One with a headache.
Can you double-check it with the admit log?
Sure.
MAN: Abby.
Hi.
Richard. How's it going?
What are you doing here?
It's colder in here than it is outside.
You look great.
( chuckling )
So, how are things?
They're good.
Good. That's good.
You seeing anyone or...
Oh, yeah.
I'm breaking hearts all over town.
What do you want, X?
X?
Yeah.
Can I call you X?
'Cause it's almost like sexy
so people might think it's short for ecstasy or triple-X
which stands for porn, uh, now
except for in cartoons where it stands for poison
which I always thought was funny, but...
What do you want?
Oh, look, I, um...
Well, I wanted to talk to you in person
so you didn't hear this through the grapevine.
Oh, my God.
What?
Are you going to jail?
No.
Uh...
I'm getting married.
( chuckling )
Married.
Yeah.
You'd think I would have learned my lesson.
I'm glad one of us did.
What is she, rich?
Hardly. She's a teacher.
Not that one you had at the museum.
No, no... no.
Her name's Corrine.
She's, uh, she's really great.
She's really down to earth.
I think you might even like her.
How old is she?
She's 34.
She has a six-year-old son, Adam.
Really great kid.
You're going to be a father?
Stepfather, yeah.
It's kind of hard to believe, huh?
Yeah, uh...
Instant family.
I always wanted kids, so...
Since when?
Uh, you know, just a while.
I guess we just never talked about it, you know?
And you, uh, felt that today was the day
you had to tell me about all this?
Is today a bad day?
Nope.
Um... so, what?
Am I supposed to give you my blessing?
That's up to you.
Well, I have to get back to work.
Richard.
I hope that it works out this time.
Thanks.
Oh, Aspen's great. Mm.
There's three separate mountains
so you don't have to be an expert.
Mm-hmm.
What is that?
What?
I don't know.
Yeah, they've got runs for every level.
Is that your jaw?
What?
That click, click, click sound.
Oh, my God. You can hear that?
Yeah.
I can't help it.
I think I have this TMJ happening thing.
Here, chew.
No.
Come on. Just chew so I can hear it.
No!
LEWIS ( giggling ): Get out of here.
I'm going to get back to work.
I'm going to take care of this.
You should see a dentist about that jaw.
Yeah, either that
or you should find someone else to eat lunch with.
I'm sorry about that.
What?
I should have said something to you sooner.
It just sort of snuck up on me.
I hate it when that happens.
Yeah.
It's really more about friendship than anything else.
Really?
( slams locker door )
Abby...
Don't sweat it, Carter.
Where's Frank?
Hey, Douglas.
Did you find your mom?
Are you getting hungry?
Yeah.
Would you like to eat pizza?
A hamburger?
My mom says fast food isn't good for you.
Well... she's right
but the fast food we serve here at the hospital
is specially formulated to be nutritious.
So would you like some French fries?
Okay.
Sit tight.
Frank!
I'm working on it.
Well, work harder.
He's been here for a couple of hours.
If I find his mom, can I have the hockey tickets
you pinched off that stiff?
No. Has anyone seen Dr. Kovac?
What do you need?
Mrs. Stipes' pressure's down.
Frank, find Luka.
What happened?
She got dizzy. Systolic's at 80.
I opened up the saline.
How you doing, Merril?
GALLANT: Is it a PE?
I don't know.
Crank her oxygen up to 15 liters
and grab some dopamine off the crash cart.
She's got muffled heart sounds and JVD.
Malik, we need a pericardiocentesis tray
and a sonosite. Okay.
Pressure's down to 70. You think it's tamponade?
Unless you got any better ideas.
What happened?
Hypotensive
signs of pericardial infusion.
You thought she had a clot from hyperstimulation?
You can third space anywhere, even around the heart.
There it is.
Here you go, Abby.
Okay, glove up. You can assist.
Lidocaine's ready.
Abby, I think I found that kid's mom
if she doesn't have the same last name as him.
I don't know. Maybe.
Okay, hook up the alligator clip.
Belinda Matheson, she came in last night with a headache.
Turned out to be a brain bleed.
Insert subxyphoid, 45-degree angle. Last night?
Yeah, they admitted her to neurosurg.
Watch for injury current.
I can't believe that little boy sat
in Chairs all night, and nobody noticed. There it is.
Can you take him upstairs to his mother?
Uh, that could be difficult. She's dead.
What?
Blood pressure's back up to 90.
She stroked out a few hours ago.
KOVAC: Second syringe.
What do you want me to do?
Abby?
Um, well, just try to find his dad.
Systolic's 110.
And get him some French fries.
KOVAC: Okay.
Good pickup.
ABBY: Did you get in touch with the father?
He said he lives in Los Angeles.
He doesn't know the number.
It wasn't in here?
I couldn't find it.
Did you call his school?
No.
Well, I'm sure they have a number, Frank.
I thought you used to be a cop.
I was. Well, act like a cop.
Track the guy down.
Did someone from neurosurg come down and talk to him?
Not yet.
Which ER doc treated his mother?
Weaver. She's working a half shift today, so she's not in yet.
Do you want me to page somebody from neurosurg?
I don't know. I think somebody should come down
and tell the little boy his mother died.
No, she didn't.
Douglas, I need to talk to you about your mom's headache, okay?
Let's sit down.
All right, um...
It was pretty bad.
Um... it was caused by
a blood vessel in her brain
that... ruptured.
It broke
and the doctors tried really hard
but they couldn't fix it.
Can she go home now?
No, Douglas, I'm sorry.
She died.
My mom has a headache.
She's not sick. I want to see her.
Where is she? Douglas?
Mom! Mom!
Douglas! Mom!
Mom! Mom, where are you?
Douglas...
Mom!
Mom! Douglas...
Mom!
Mom! Douglas.
She's dead. Stop saying that.
Why do you keep saying that?
I know it's hard for you to understand. I want my mom.
I know you do. I just want my mom.
( sobbing )
Shh.
Shh, it's okay.
FRANK: He finally went down?
ABBY: He's exhausted.
Poor kid.
I finally got a hold of his dad.
He's in Australia on a business trip.
Australia?
The soonest flight he can get is a redeye tomorrow night.
So, Social Services are going to have to take him till then?
Sorry. I'll call them.
That's all right. I'll do it. Thanks.
Can you grab me the minute he gets up?
Sure.
Abby, do we do psychiatric transfers to other hospitals?
What?
I have a patient in Curtain Three.
He was admitted with a tiny scalp lac from a slip-and-fall.
And he's insisting he be moved out of Curtain Three
and he wants me to call his caseworker from some private hospital.
Is he altered from the fall?
No, but he seems pretty agitated.
Did you... get a psych consult?
Not yet.
It probably wouldn't hurt.
The paramedics brought me to this hospital.
I didn't want to come here.
Can you just please call my caseworker
and move me to another room?
SOBRIKI: You don't have to do that.
You don't have to do that.
It's just a precaution.
What happened?
I slipped. That's all.
Is this your patient?
Yeah. I saw him in the hallway.
Brief LOC after he slipped on some ice.
History of migraine. That's not his only history.
What's with the restraints?
I don't want to cause any trouble.
Just, please, just call my caseworker.
We will. Dr. Lewis.
Can you please just get me out of this room?
Don't worry. We'll move you.
What kind of caseworker?
SOBRIKI: Psychiatric.
He's monitoring my conditional release.
He has the card.
Release from where?
Dr. Lewis, now.
Okay, two of IV Ativan
five of Compazine, and a trauma panel.
He's schizophrenic.
He's been here before?
He stabbed Carter and killed a med student
two years ago.
Him? Yeah.
He stabbed Carter? Yes.
What's he doing out?
I don't know. The police are on their way
but I think we should transfer him
before Carter sees him.
No. I need to get a CT.
He can get a CT at Mercy.
He has a head injury...
He stabbed two people in that room...
...loss of consciousness, vomiting...
And killed one of them.
I'm not transferring
a man at risk for an intracranial bleed.
I don't care what he did.
Am I calling this psychiatrist or not?
No. I'll call him.
We'll find out his status, we'll get the CT
and then we'll take it from there, okay?
Abby, the morgue called.
They're ready for you.
Move him to the Suture Room
close the blinds, and don't let
I got it. Dr. Carter see him.
And get his name off the board.
She looks like Snow White.
Hi...
Mom.
I drew you a picture.
( whispering )
WEAVER: You took him to the morgue?
He didn't believe his mother was dead.
Well, then you call Psych.
Advice you might have given yourself
18 hours ago.
Hey, hey, hey.
She vagalled in Triage.
No one even told me she had a kid with her.
Well, she did.
Not yet.
Why not? Abby, why not?
Because we're trying to find another family member.
Who's we?
Me.
That's not your job.
But I don't want him
to go to another strange place.
Their holding facility
is a lot more comforting
than the ER or the morgue.
He'll just be passed
from one stranger to another stranger.
They have the personnel
and resources to deal with it.
Call them now.
WOMAN: "You're honest, forthright
"and a judge... a good judge of character.
"You often ramble incoherently when agitated.
Even your dog doesn't like you."
My dog died a year ago.
It's a joke, Frank.
This amuses you?
Carter, what's your sign?
Gemini, why?
Oh, horoscopes from the Internet.
"You're open to new ideas, compassionate, a risk taker..."
That's true.
"You tend to overstay your welcome at parties
and you often smell like cheese."
Don't you have some work to do?
Abby, your turn.
No, thanks.
What's your sign? Come on.
"Out of Order."
CARTER: Who moved Libertique out of the Suture Room?
The hand surgeon is stuck in surgery
for the next 40 minutes, and we needed the room
for an extensor tendon repair.
Oh, I'll do that.
No, no, no. The-the... surgical intern's got it.
Can you take a look at this...
explosive watery diarrhea?
You need to start an IV?
Maybe. I don't know.
He's... he's pretty miserable.
She.
She.
You okay?
Yeah. Mm-hmm.
Abby, the light source
on the fiber-optic is down.
Get me a spare.
Okay.
MAN: Can I see a doctor this century?
Hang on.
I hang on any longer, I'll be dead.
If you're talking, you're not dying.
He was found not guilty by reason of insanity.
Shouldn't he be in a state forensic hospital?
He was. He was.
He was stepped down
to a less restrictive facility
about ten months ago
and now he's on conditional release.
Bradying down with 60.
Mig of atropine.
I need that scope.
I've got it.
Pulse ox 78.
I need a smaller tube. Number seven. Suction.
He's agitated.
He's nervous.
The guy's out of board and care
less than a week
he hits his head on some ice
and the paramedics bring him here
of all places?
He got out in two years?
Who are you?
I was working when he attacked my friends.
I'm sorry.
He was a law student.
A professor there got some colleagues
to do some pro bono work.
They filed a writ
of habeas corpus and won.
That's unbelievable.
But I can't say I disagree.
Most schizophrenics are nonviolent.
Well, this one was, wasn't he?
And when they are, they rarely are twice.
He's not a danger to himself or others.
Really.
Not on his meds.
There are safeguards in place.
He needs to be supervised
taking his medication
every day.
Did he get his head CT?
They're almost ready for him.
Abby, can you check this foley?
I think it's overflowing.
Clamp it.
I did. It's overflowing.
Just get him out of here.
Anyway, I want those restraints removed.
Uh... no.
He is coherent and lucid.
I have been working with him for over a year.
Abby. No.
Susan, I swear to God
if you take off those restraints...
You keep somebody posted outside his door.
He needs reassurance and respect right now.
Respect?
Yes!
I'm sorry.
He needs our respect?
Abby, go.
Looks like over a liter in the last hour.
BP's 110/70 and her sats are up.
Good. You need to send out her repeat potassium.
Right. Thanks.
He said something about the ICU.
Yeah, maybe for a couple of days
just for safety.
It's the fertility drugs, isn't it
that's doing this to me?
The doctor has to review your labs.
I could try to find him now, if you like.
I'm sorry. It just...
It must be the damn hormones.
I'm not usually a crier.
It's okay.
Thanks.
Sometimes being a woman
sucks, you know?
( sighing ): It has its moments.
You grow up praying you don't get pregnant
every time you have sex.
And then, when you finally do want to have a baby, you can't.
It's so unfair.
You been trying for a long time?
I just keep thinking
that maybe I had my chance and I blew it.
You don't know that.
No, I've been pregnant.
A few years ago.
It was an accident.
I had just started a new job and this new relationship.
It didn't seem like the right time.
It happens.
I only waited till I was ready
so that I could be the best mother I could be.
I'm sure you're going to be.
Unless I waited too long.
( sighing )
Weaver's looking for you.
What?
She wants to know why you didn't call
Family Services on that boy.
I am. I will.
The on-call social worker for the ER, please.
Did someone claim them?
What?
The tickets.
Oh. No.
Lewis was asking for one.
Mmm!
Thank you!
No, just have him paged. Thanks.
Abby, when you get a chance, I need
a thick-and-thin smear
and a culture in Curtain Three.
And your diarrhea patient was heme-negative.
Just a little PO-challenged.
I sent him home with some Immodium. Carter, I have
a five-year-old with abdominal pain
and I'm worried about intussusception.
Is there any blood in the stool?
No, but he had a... a palpable mass.
SOBRIKI: Hey, sweetheart.
WOMAN: Here's Daddy.
SOBRIKI: Hey... mmm! Hey. Hi.
I'm okay. I'm okay.
Daddy slipped
and fell and he hit his head
but I'm okay.
WOMAN: They put you in restraints?
Yeah. It's just a precaution.
They're a little paranoid.
Oh, it's you.
I'm sorry.
What happened? What's he doing here?
He slipped and fell
outside his office building.
His office building?
He's on conditional release.
You're out.
I'm better.
I'm sorry.
That wasn't me who did that to you...
...to your friend.
You know that, right?
You're a doctor.
You know it's a disease.
I'm being treated.
I'm okay now.
Great.
I'm glad you're okay.
Whoo.
( vomiting )
I'm starting to get it.
Although that little puck is hard to keep track of.
They should give it a color so your eye can follow it.
What, the puck?
Yes, I mean, like bright pink or red
or flashing lights or something like that.
Okay, a flashing pink puck.
( laughing ): Why not?
'Cause it's hockey.
I love the Hawks. You got the tickets?
MALIK: You got the tickets.
LEWIS: You have the tickets!
Hey, what's wrong?
Uh, nothing.
I hugged him. You what?
Oh, yeah, I'm the Bruce Lee of love, girl!
( laughing )
Maybe I just need some fresh air.
Ho ho...
Wait a minute. You're not out?
Huh? Who are you hiding from?
I'm not hiding.
Then what the heck was that?
You don't want your friends to see us together?
They're not my friends.
They work for me.
How do you think that makes me feel?
I'm sorry.
You came on to me.
You are not out.
I am not out at work...
Well, you need to be.
Sandy...
I'm sorry.
I don't got time for this.
Okay... Okay.
Bye, Dad.
He'll be here tomorrow.
Great.
Have you ever been to Los Angeles?
Once.
Disneyland.
Oh.
I think you'll like it there because it's sunny.
Not cold like it is here.
Excuse me.
Can you give this
to Dr. Carter?
I think you'd better do that.
Well, they're discharging Paul.
I have to drive him home.
They wouldn't have released him if he weren't better.
He's taking his meds.
He's in therapy.
He has a disease but it's being treated.
I mean, that's what you do here.
You treat disease
so people can try to move on with life.
Yep.
He's my husband.
We're his family.
I can't give up on him.
Good luck.
Hey.
Um, Lewis discharged Sobriki
and his wife asked me to give you this.
Guess you couldn't protect me from her either, huh?
Uh, yeah, I'm sorry about that.
I just, I... Don't worry about it.
Forget it.
Are you off already?
Half shift.
I'm off in a half hour
if you want to get something to eat.
I should get home.
Or maybe just... coffee and pie?
I had a pretty crappy day myself.
Gammie just got out of the convalescent hospital.
I should go home and check on her.
Are you going to be okay?
Yeah, I'm going to be fine.
Thank you for asking.
Any time.
No!
I have a real nice place for you to stay...
No, I want to stay here!
You can't, Douglas.
Abby!
I want to stay here...
But this is a hospital.
And you have to go someplace
where you can get some sleep.
No!
And get something
to eat and maybe take a bath.
I'll stay with you!
Douglas, I don't...
No!
I don't stay here all the time, honey
but you can come visit me
whenever you want, okay?
I promise. No!
I've got you. Abby!
WOMAN: Come on.
DOUGLAS: Abby!
WOMAN: We'll get you some ice cream.
You'll be fine, Douglas.
Wait! I'll stay with you!
Abby!
Please! Abby!
( door closing )
Abby, my cellulitis patient is allergic to penicillin...
No. Can you give IV erythromycin?
No.
What about vancomycin?
No! I'm not your attending.
I'm not a resident. I'm a nurse.
You want me to assess a patient
you want me to push meds
you want me to check vitals
explain a situation to a family member
that's fine.
What I will not do is carry you through med school.
You want to be a doctor?
Start acting like one.
Rachel, can I talk to you?
RACHEL: What are you doing?
I was picking your stuff up.
You're searching my room.
It's a pigsty.
That doesn't give you the right
to go through my things.
You mean these things?
I can't believe you did this!
Are you smoking now?
I asked you a question.
Hey, Rachel!
Are these your cigarettes?
I bought that pack like a month ago on a dare.
To see if I could pass for 18.
And the condoms? What kind of a dare is that?
They gave those out in health class.
And you decided to keep them?
You'd rather I not have them?
You need to stop lying.
You don't believe me anyway.
You go through
my private things.
I was looking for drugs.
You said you were picking up!
Who's lying now?
You're right.
The truth is I was searching your room
because I don't know if I can trust you.
Then fine!
Believe whatever you want.
I'm smoking! I'm on drugs! I'm having sex!
Lots of sex with lots of guys
because I'm the school slut.
Are you happy?
( door slamming )
Yes, this is John Carter.
I have a private duty nurse for my grandmother
who was supposed to start today.
She's not here.
Yeah.
ELEANOR: I sent her home early.
What?
She was aggravating Millicent
so I sent her home early.
She'll be back at 6:00 a.m.
It's a 24-hour service.
I'll get up... if there's a problem.
What are you doing?
Pardon?
I mean, you show up unannounced, uninvited...
Uninvited?
And now you're making health care decisions?
Your grandmother asked me to ask her to leave.
I was trying to be helpful.
Well, do me a favor. Don't try to be helpful.
It's not one of your strong suits.
Excuse me, John.
I've had enough abuse from my mother-in-law today.
I don't need any more from my son.
I'm sorry?
I'm sorry
but I have helped Gamma through this.
I have tended to her medical needs.
I have made her health care arrangements.
So you need to consult with me
before you do anything like this.
Fine.
Call them back.
Yeah, you bet I will.
But I'm not leaving this house.
And I don't care if I'm uninvited.
I'm not going to let your father break up this family.
Family, huh?
What family would that be?
Don't be sarcastic.
You checked out
of this family 20 years ago.
Excuse me. I'm going to bed.
No. I'm not going to let you put
some kind of revisionist spin on this
with you as the injured party, no.
Step aside...
No, I got stabbed!
I got stabbed in the back!
Where the hell were you?
You were in the same place you've been my entire life.
You were someplace else.
We came back.
Three weeks later.
We were stuck in Tokyo
and you said you were fine.
Well, I wasn't fine and it wasn't okay.
Are you going to blame me for taking drugs?
No, I am blaming you for not being my mother!
Bobby died.
And I lost a mother.
May I go to bed now?
Yeah, run away...
( sniffling )
Oh... Oh, God!
Thank you.
We've got to call the super about that, too.
It gets stuck in the cold.
And I'm guessing it's going to stay cold for a while.
Hopefully not this cold.
Good. I told Brian
January wasn't the best time to move
but that's when the semester starts.
He's in law school.
Did you get locked out?
We had a fight.
So I went to the store.
Another half hour, he'll be asleep.
Are you from Chicago?
For a while now, yeah.
Originally?
Minnesota. You?
Idaho. The potato part, not the white supremacist part.
You want a beer?
No, thanks.
Come on. Have a seat.
You look like you've had
a long day.
Thank you.
Mmm, you got a card.
Mm-hmm.
It's nice to get one personal piece of mail
mixed in with all the bills and junk.
Your birthday?
Huh?
Is it your birthday?
Yes.
( chuckling )
Today?
Mm-hmm.
8:03 p.m.
Well, congratulations.
You've made it.
Happy birthday.
( bottles clink )
Thank you.
