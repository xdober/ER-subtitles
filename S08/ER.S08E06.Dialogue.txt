Previously on ER
He wasn't getting in fights when he was living with us.
Maybe he needs to live in one home for a while.
He's my stepson.
We've got an agreement.
Well, we need to think about what's best for Reese.
Oh, no, no, no. How much?
Our treat. We want to make sure you're going to come back.
He fired me after a year of working there
seven nights a week.
Okay, that's it. I'll call the family.
Not that I'm keeping score, but isn't this
your third post-op death this week?
His death triggered a formal investigation by my department.
Excuse me?
You need to be cultured
in case you're body's carrying bacteria
that's infecting your patients.
Come on. One more shot.
One more shot. Come on, dribble. Dribble.
Come on, come on.
Come on, come on, come on.
Five, four, three, two
one.
( applause and cheering )
Slam dunk.
( laughs )
We're going to see Joanie on campus.
Oh, yeah? That's good. Yeah.
Glad to see you're getting out.
What time are you getting him?
Roger's going to pick him up at 4:30.
Roger? Yeah.
Why?
His cousin's having some kind
of birthday party or something.
His cousin on Carla's side?
No, on Roger's.
So it's not his real cousin.
Well, anyway
he wanted him there, so...
So he's setting his schedule now.
Jackie, we've already had this argument.
It's important to the guy, all right?
I'm sure he misses Reese.
But more importantly, Reese misses him.
But you're just confusing him.
Roger isn't part of his family
anymore.
Jackie, I'm just giving him time.
That's something you should understand.
I didn't mean...
Jackie?
Say bye-bye to Daddy.
That's right.
I'll have him ready at 4:30.
CORDAY: Keep her pressure above 90.
When did she spike the fever?
Dad, how do you program numbers?
Read the instructions.
When was her last dose of Imipenem?
Well, find out.
That's a pretty big hammer for post-op fever.
Her kidney's are shutting down.
I missing Algebra, you know.
Just testing.
So, Rachel
Katherine has to leave to 5:00.
Yeah.
So, Ella should nap until 6:30
but, if she wakes up crying, you got to give her
four ounces of breast milk from the fridge.
You put it in the Avent warmer.
Yeah.
For two minutes on low, I know.
CORDAY: Yeah.
Yeah, who's the ID fellow on call?
What?
You're sparkling.
So?
You're starting a trend?
Dad, everyone wears glitter.
I'm pulling up right now.
CORDAY: Mix some dopamine.
I'll be there in five minutes.
Okay.
GREENE: Good luck.
Thanks.
Sorry about the detour, Rachel.
Which entrance?
What?
Your school-- North or South?
Oh, um... how about a few blocks away?
I thought you were late.
I am, but...
You just don't
No. It's just...
You know, the van.
I'm not even breaking a sweat.
Aerobic activity is a secondary benefit.
Primary effects are strength and balance.
WOMAN: Good, Warriors.
Now down to cat and cow.
This is doing nothing for my back.
Did you try some Tylenol?
No. Take some.
I avoid pain medication.
If you're going to be macho about pain
then you can't whine about it.
Downward Facing Dog.
How's your grandma?
Her doctor did an MRI, MRA, stress echo, carotids.
Everything was fine.
He did all that in one day?
Rich lady service.
She's been very smug about the whole thing.
Straighten your legs and exhale.
( exhaling )
Good.
I got singled out.
If it's too hard, don't push it.
No. It's no problem.
So what's the deal with you and the nurse?
Nurse?
Abby.
What do you mean? It just seems
like there's something there.
No. We're friends.
( whispering ): You're shaking.
I know.
I'm going back to cow.
( sighs )
It's actually kind of undefined with Abby.
She just broke up with Luka.
I get it.
What?
You don't want to be the rebound guy.
Not exactly.
Good.
Downward Facing Dog
now with your leg extended in the air.
( groans )
This is sadistic.
Pretend like you're playing Twister.
Oh.
Are you breathing?
( laughs )
Are you seeing the colors?
Oh, boy.
Carter?
Carter!
I've got three people heaving.
We're out of emesis basins.
Central Supply's a little slow today. A new runner.
What happened to the old one?
County General on Bravo One.
Go ahead.
I twisted my knee doing that damn Locust position.
No, it's Lotus-- like the flower.
Oh, well, that explains why it hurts.
I was doing the grasshopper.
I give up.
Good morning.
Is it raining?
Uh, no.
Susan dragged me to this torture session.
JARVIK: We've got an apartment fire.
One major, four minors.
It's mostly smoke inhalation.
ETA is ten to 15.
Page the burn unit.
Tell the Fellow we got one sick player.
Abby, can you clear the Trauma rooms?
Yup. Well, they're going to have to puke on the floor.
Well, there she is.
Who?
Central Supply.
Hi.
Excuse me, we're completely out of emesis basins
and I need at least ten liters of...
Hi.
Hi, Abby.
Oh, Luka got me a job.
Oh, he did.
Yes. He knew I was out of work
so he called me last week about this opening and...
It was so nice of him.
He's-he's nice.
Yeah.
Do you know where these go?
Yeah. The linen closet.
It's down the hall to the left.
Thank you.
And, oh, I'm sorry.
Do you need something?
Yeah. I'll get the Ringers.
Could you just bring down some emesis basins?
What are those?
Barf bins.
Vomit buckets.
Okay.
Systolic BP is 70, febrile to 104.
Bolus a liter of saline
and change all the IV and central lines.
You did that yesterday.
We need to do it again
in case they're the source of the infection.
I've never seen her so bad.
CORDAY: It's reversible, but we will need to start her
on cardiac medication and dialysis immediately.
Put her on a machine?
Her kidneys aren't removing the toxins
from the bloodstream as they should.
No, no.
If this is her time...
It's not.
Not yet.
Jacy, start the dopamine
and titrate to systolic above 90.
She's a DNR, you know.
She never wanted
to end up the way my dad did.
I understand.
She always said
push me over a cliff before you put me on any tubes.
April, her kidney failure is temporary.
She could bounce back after a few treatments.
It's worth trying.
Page the nephrologist
and the dialysis nurse.
You really want to do that?
Yes. Now.
WOMAN: The fire was right
outside our door.
Eden was choking.
She was holding her daughter.
Broke the fall for both of them. And my legs.
We got a deformity of the right tib-fib.
Left femur looks open.
Surgery and ortho? Yup.
Took your daughter inside, ma'am.
She'll be okay. I'm sorry.
It's all right. I know you wanted me to wait.
Everyone is safe. Here. Lean on me.
I'm good.
That ankle doesn't look so good. I don't want to crush you.
It's okay. I'm used to it.
So, how is it so far?
Great. Everyone's been very friendly.
Yeah, we like her.
Has someone showed you around?
I keep getting lost.
Yeah. Don't be afraid to ask for help.
LOCKHART: I need some help.
KOVAC: Oh, sorry.
You want to have lunch?
NICOLE: But you're busy.
No. 1:30. Find me.
I was halfway up the ladder
and the lady just panicked and jumped.
I think I would panic, too.
Can you bear weight on it at all?
I'm fine. Just give me a bag of ice.
You've got some burns, too.
Yeah. Occupational hazard.
No blistering, skin's intact.
Polysporin then dress with kerlix.
We'll probably need a splint for him.
Oh, we're out of fiberglass.
I might have to call Central Supply.
I was going to tell you.
Whoa.
Ow!
Tenderness
of the fifth metatarsal.
Thought firefighters were tough guys, right?
You're secret's safe with me.
Let me take a look, Eden.
Can you tell me if your throat hurts?
Trauma panel, C-spine, chest and pelvis.
I want a C-spine, chest, AP pelvis and a Foley.
Is that Eden? Who?
Is that my daughter? Yeah.
Is something wrong?
I don't think so.
Hey, Connie, can you have Dr. Greene come in here
and talk to Miss Mintry when he gets a chance?
What do we have?
Got a two-story fall without LOC.
Multiple Fractures.
Who's this?
This is Carmen.
Follow the light with your eyes.
MALIK: Systolic's 90.
CARTER: All right. Let's run another liter of NS.
Pupils equal, round and react to light.
I'm going to do an ultrasound
to check for signs of internal injury, okay?
Miss Mintry? Yes.
Eden inhaled some smoke.
I think she has some scrapes, that's all.
Can I see her?
Wait. What?
Your stethoscope.
You haven't cleaned it
since using it upstairs.
Alcohol wipe, please.
GREENE: We want to keep her on oxygen
for a while.
Eden seems more concerned about your dog than anything.
Okay?
He jumped out the window before we did, then ran off.
Mm-hmm.
I'm sure he'll make his way home soon.
Breath sounds clear bilaterally.
Dr. Carter, could you start the ultrasound, please?
Mm-hmm. ABG, carboxy-hemoglobins.
Titrate ten of morphine
and ten liter humidified 02 by mask.
How's Mrs. Wilson?
Not good.
She's not responding to antibiotics or pressors.
Did you try Ampho?
She's still in multi-organ failure.
Do you mind?
I'm talking with my husband.
I need to watch you at all times.
Fine. Watch.
I'd like to deck that woman.
Infection control?
They feel the need
to follow me around at all times.
Mark, I can't lose another patient like this.
I know.
When's the last time
you cleaned your stethoscope between patients?
She's justifying her job.
( pager beeps )
ICU?
Damn it.
I can't let this happen again.
You can't save everyone.
I shouldn't kill everyone, either, should I?
MAN: No, that's okay.
I-I'm going to wait for the doctor.
LOCKHART: Don't be embarrassed.
Uh-uh. I really messed it up.
Let me see.
No!
No. I need the doctor.
After you've been seen by a nurse.
Believe me, miss.
What I got to show you, you don't want to see.
Yes, but I can't help you
unless I see what the problem is.
The problem is is that...
I got a bum pair of scissors.
Take the towel off.
I'm not going to be shocked.
You can't say that.
You haven't seen it.
I'm a professional.
I'd never agree to this
if I didn't think I might bleed to death.
Wow!
( sighs )
The pain is, like, wrapped around my head.
LEWIS: Did you drink last night?
There were a lot of parties on campus.
Is that a yes?
I never felt this way from being hungover.
I woke up all achy, and I keep getting the chills.
Sounds like the flu, Lara.
That's what he said.
MAU: So Dr. Kovac has countersigned
my orders for Mrs. Ridley.
I picked up her CT scan
and her X-rays...
You saw Dr. Mau?
He asked me, like, a thousand questions.
Okay, I'll be right back.
Sophomore at U of I
woke up with a "hatband headache"
subjective fever and myalgias.
History includes childhood chicken pox
ER visit for food poisoning two years ago.
LEWIS: What are you doing?
In this position, there's hardly any pain at all.
Tylenol, I'm telling you.
Yeah. We need to talk.
Stand up. Let me see.
( groaning )
You know, I can help you with that.
Pass.
Uh, hold still.
Patient carries an EpiPen for allergy to hymenoptera.
History of recurrent yeast infections
now in remission.
Cut to the chase, Stanley.
What's the diagnosis?
I'd say a viral illness of unknown etiology.
The flu. I agree.
Ibuprofen and drink plenty of fluids?
Sounds like a winner.
Next time sign up for it, Stanley.
Sorry.
How does this feel?
Mm, not as good as squatting.
Hi.
Fresh pot.
Great.
Did you do the splint in Two?
Not yet, but I'm going to.
So, um...
Listen, um, about Nicole.
You don't have to explain.
I want to.
No, really.
It's none of my business.
It just seems like you're going way out on a limb
for someone you barely know.
She lost her job.
Yeah, but is that your problem?
Why not help?
Is she, like, your girlfriend now?
I got her a job, that's all.
So it's not like she's living with you?
She's living with you?
Just until she can save some money
for her own place.
Luka.
She was staying at a hostel.
So?
So, she's a sweet girl.
I'm trying to help.
You don't have to help everybody.
CARTER: What's your problem?
Nothing.
Still fighting?
No.
Luka has a new project.
Oh, like what? Coin collecting?
Nicole. That cookie girl.
She works here now.
Why do you care?
Well, I don't.
What? I don't.
I... Okay.
BP's holding at 80.
Another run of ectopy on the monitor.
Seven beats.
Lidocaine, 70 milligrams IV push.
Start a drip at four cc's an hour.
Have the crash cart nearby.
Are you sure?
Stop saying that and do as I ask.
Run a V-tach.
Pressure's dropping.
Systolic 59.
After the Lido, get ready with Procainamide.
Elizabeth, what are you doing?
Treating my patient.
What are you waiting for?
Do I have to push the drug myself?
She's a DNR. I can save her.
You have to respect her wishes.
If we can just support her until I find the source.
Map down to 40.
Start CPR.
No. Jacy, hold compressions.
Peter, this is none of your business.
V-fib.
Look at that woman.
Look out the window.
That woman wants
to sit with her mother, let her.
I can help her. You can't help her.
Agonal.
Hi. How you doing?
Is it still wet?
Yeah.
What do I do when my foot itches?
You live with it.
Can I get you something?
Uh, water? Popsicle?
How about a soda?
Sure.
Will your boyfriend get mad if I buy you one?
Well, I'm not thirsty, but thank you.
Come on, live it up.
Is this the surgical consult?
Uh, yeah.
It's-It's a delicate, um...
BENTON: All right, so, what's the problem?
She didn't tell you?
Rick tried to circumcise himself.
All right.
Ice and sponges.
Let's have a look.
I'm not nuts, okay?
You didn't consider having a doctor do this?
I thought I could take the pain.
You know, just snip, snip-- done deal.
You know
there is no medical reason for circumcision.
There's a personal reason.
Here you go. All right.
Apply direct pressure.
Laceration's two inches. No damage to the glans.
So, what now?
Well, you're halfway done.
I can finish the job, or sew it up.
Can I ask my girlfriend?
Would that be the "personal reason"?
Well, she's a-a neat freak, and foreskin
just didn't do it for her.
Sure. Why don't you call her?
Either way, we can do it upstairs.
Treat it as plastic surgery.
Do you want me to get a psych consult?
No. I just think he's stupid.
Not to mention devoted.
You passed out.
Someone called 9-1-1.
People can't mind their own business.
Sorry. Am I too early?
No. Have a seat.
Your blood doesn't seem to be clotting.
I have a Factor IX deficiency.
Do you get regular doses of Factor somewhere?
At Children's.
I guess I missed a couple of rounds.
Mary, call Heme-onc.
Sure.
It's very important
that you go every time.
I know. I just couldn't get there lately.
What's your dose?
2100 units.
See if the pharmacy has that much.
I'll go check.
Do they have bag lunches here?
I don't know.
Some hospitals do.
Okay, after the Factor
I want to clean and irrigate that hand.
Is there someone we can call?
No.
Parents?
No.
Okay. Let's start an I.V.
I have a porta-cath.
For how long?
Two years.
Couldn't stand the needles every day.
Okay. We'll use that.
I'll bring you a sandwich.
Thanks.
Oh, that thing.
Yeah, it ate my dollar.
You want to borrow one?
No, I got it, thanks.
So, is it hard working with Dr. Kovac?
( chuckles )
Carter told me.
Oh.
Sorry. Am I not supposed to know?
No. No, don't worry about it.
Yeah. Dating at work can be messy.
Yeah.
WOMAN: Abby?
Yeah? Want some change?
Uh, the girlfriend of the guy is here.
What guy?
The self-circumcision.
Your patient?
Yes.
Sepsis.
Bad luck you've had.
Did you find any nidus of infection?
Well, not so far.
No abscesses or localized infection
anywhere obvious.
Would you check the bowel anastomosis?
You have any reason to believe there was a leak?
I'm just trying to find the source of these infections.
Do you mind?
No. I'll check.
( sighs )
She was a very nice woman.
For the record, Dr. Corday
I don't agree with what people are saying about you.
You know, all this talk
about the breast-feeding and the sleep deprivation.
That part's true.
Well, I mean...
motherhood's interfering with your work.
That's sexist crap.
Yeah, well, it's not a woman's world, is it?
Not until they perfect cloning.
Right.
I thought you went to the bathroom.
I'll let you know what I find.
I can't believe you did this.
What do you mean?!
You said that you wanted me...
I know what I said, but it's so extreme.
So, are we repairing or removing?
What do you say?
I don't know.
Whatever is less traumatic.
Well, it's 50/50 now.
Well, I...
I mean, might as well finish what I started...
don't you think?
I guess.
BENTON: Okay.
Well, we'll get you up to the O.R.
as soon as there's a room available.
Nurse, do you have a second?
Sure. What is it?
Outside.
Wh-What are you doing?
I'll be right back.
He'll be okay, right?
Oh, yeah, they'll fix it.
You'll never know.
I mean, except for the foreskin.
This should never have happened.
I thought this was what you wanted.
Not really.
I only said that because I wanted to break up with him
and didn't want to hurt his feelings.
MALIK: Abby, we need you!
Okay, hold on, I'll be back.
Got a gag, B.P. 130/70, pulse 100.
Did he take anything?
Nothing in the dorm room.
This is his roommate.
Does he use drugs?
No. He drank a little at a party last night
but he was okay when he went to bed.
Did he say anything today?
Just that he felt sick
and his neck hurt.
Stiff?
Yeah. He thought he slept on it funny.
Okay, on my count. One, two, three.
Skin feels hot.
Let's get a rectal temp.
Did you see this? LEWIS: What?
Petechiae.
They don't blanche.
Oh, my God.
Sats are dropping to 91.
This is meningococcus.
What's that?
Get T.B. masks
and post-exposure meds for everyone.
CBC, Chem 20, Accu check
blood cultures times two.
This could be all over his dorm by now.
Where do you go to school?
Uh, U. of I.
Get an L.P. tray.
Where's Carter?
He's in Exam Three.
Get him. Get him now.
Give me a 16 French triple lumen.
Carter, Carter, Lewis needs you.
( inhaling deeply ): What is it?
Some kid has menigococcus.
All right, take 'em out
Stanley.
Okay.
Ceftriaxone going up.
Meningococcemia?
Can you intubate?
28 of Dexamethasone.
Did you induce yet?
No.
20 of Etomidate.
Give me 120 of Sux.
Did our flu girl go to U. of I.?
Who?
Uh, yes. Lara Avery. I presented her to you.
LEWIS: She needs to be tapped immediately.
If she's been exposed
as long as this kid has
we're out of time already.
Uh, she was discharged.
What?!
You said she had the flu.
We need to find her.
I'll do it. Tube him.
Prep a Swan-Ganz catheter.
She was in Chairs, waiting on a ride.
Mau. CARTER: Okay, he's loose.
Give me some cricoid pressure, Malik. Got it.
Go check triage, find out the name of her dorm
and send an ambulance.
CARTER: Talk to the unit?
Yeah. What'd they say?
An hour, at least.
I found the introducer but not the catheter.
Well, get one. We need to monitor his pressure down here.
Well, nothing's where it's supposed to be.
Frank, where's the girl that was in Curtain Two?
Mm, pretty college girl?
Yeah.
She asked where she could buy
some orange juice.
Where did you tell her?
The cafeteria. Where else?
Oh, oh!
KOVAC: Hey. Slow down.
Sorry. Sorry.
( speaking softly )
( laughing )
Where did you put the Swan-Ganz catheters?
The what?
Swan-Ganz catheters.
Uh, they told me in the trauma room.
Well, they're not there, and we need them right now.
I thought that's where I put it.
Well, show me. Okay.
You got it?
Not yet. Here. There's the Cordis.
You want me to set up an art line?
Either. I'll take either.
NICOLE: Got it!
No. That is the introducer.
It looks like a big, yellow snake.
Oh. CARTER: Forget it.
Call Central. Get me somebody who knows the difference.
She is new, Carter, it's her first day.
This kid is dying here.
I'm sorry. CARTER: Don't be sorry.
If you don't know what you're doing
just get the hell out of here!
Here it is. Don't yell at her.
We're losing time here.
It's not her fault he is sick.
Flush the ports.
Damn it.
Lara!
Lara!
Lara!
( groans )
Lara!
Hold on!
What is it?
Stay right there. I'm coming down.
If she left a note, then you shouldn't have been late.
I did tell her about the party.
You know what, take it up with her.
I don't have time for this.
Nanny?
No, Roger.
He's my new shadow.
He should meet Carmen.
What do you have?
Revision of a failed circumcision.
25-year-old.
Don't ask.
You?
Splenectomy and a pilon tib/fib.
Hmm.
Listen, uh... I'm sorry about earlier.
Oh, it's okay.
Uh, I thought I could beat the odds.
Look, I know you're stressed out--
the new baby and everything.
It's okay.
What does that have to do with it?
Not to mention the head trip
that's going on around here.
My fuse would be short, too.
Have you ever seen me do anything wrong?
Lazy? Sloppy?
No.
Look, I think you're just having a bad run.
( sighs ): It's not very comforting to my next patient.
Elizabeth
if I needed surgery, or Reese did...
I'd come to you.
ABBY: BP's down to 60.
CARTER: How much fluid is in?
Eight.
We're going to put him into pulmonary edema.
Dopamine's maxed out.
Levo's at 20 mikes.
No place left
to put the pulse ox.
God, this kills fast.
V-fib.
Crash cart. Charge at 300.
He's young.
Let's give him a chance.
Come on, Andy!
Clear.
Charge at 360.
Go get the conducting pads.
And clear.
Okay, Lara.
You're going to feel pressure in your lower back.
Can I call my mom?
As soon as we're done.
It's long distance.
Omaha.
Uh, is he going to be okay?
Andy?
They're working on him.
You know him well?
Everyone knows him.
He's on the soccer team.
Really popular.
Spend time with him lately?
Lara?
Fluid's clear.
Lara?
W-We sort of kissed last night.
Did you kiss anyone else?
Why?
Andy has a very contagious
bacterial infection.
We need to know who might have been exposed.
Usually I only kiss one guy a night.
Do you think Andy
shares the same policy?
I don't know.
Last night was the first time I talked to him.
Dr. Lewis?
What? What is it?
WES: I can't pay for this.
KOVAC: Don't worry.
Half of our patients can't pay.
And if there's a follow-up or anything
I don't even know where I'll be.
Your tox screen is positive for opiates.
My joints bleed. It hurts.
What drugs do you do?
Demerol, if I can get it.
And if not, heroin?
I don't see tracks.
It's not a regular thing.
Do you use your porta-cath to shoot?
All right, look, you know, I didn't ask to come here.
That's not what a porta-cath
is for.
Hold on. Hold on.
Let...
Let me call somebody for you.
( scoffs ): There's no one to call.
Let's talk about rehab.
I don't think so.
I'm not done with your hand.
You can't leave it open like that.
Please?
Is ham and cheese okay?
I'm not picky.
There's fruit in there, too.
Thanks.
Wait here.
I need to get another suture kit.
Why were you fighting?
He's using his catheter to shoot drugs.
It has to be removed.
Can you do that?
You all right?
Me? Yes.
Dr. Carter was under pressure.
It's okay.
Don't you think that guy would find some other way to do drugs?
He was given the catheter for clotting factor, not heroin.
This is Dr. Lewis again, from the E.R. in Chicago
regarding your daughter, Lara.
Please call me right away.
CARTER: Okay, I'm in. Bag her.
Where's the vent?
MALIK: It's on its way up.
MAU: Her pressure's dropping.
More dopamine?
No, we're running in the antibiotics.
There's nothing else to do.
Portable chest?
Sure, check the tube.
Not that it makes much difference.
It's a waiting game now.
Not so fast.
You don't want to give her a pneumo.
I missed it.
I missed it, too.
You didn't see her.
Well, it presented like the flu.
You call the college?
Mm-hmm.
Student health is going to give antibiotics
to everybody in the dorm.
And the people at that party.
Anyone sharing glasses, kissing...
No, they'll get the word out.
They don't want an outbreak.
Abby.
600 milligrams of Rifampin
for anyone who worked on either meningitis case.
It made me sick last time.
Better than dead.
Here you go.
There she is.
Sorry, I got busy.
Thanks.
Now all you need are crutches.
Do I have to?
Mm-hmm. Nurse's orders.
Can I ask you something?
Yeah.
How late are you here tonight?
Hmm. One more hour.
If I were going to see you again
I'd probably be more subtle.
Would you like to go for coffee, or something?
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm... not available.
There is a boyfriend.
Uh, well...
You don't know?
I don't know.
But thank you.
Pressure's steady.
Excuse me.
Can I have a little room, please?
I have to see the field.
And I have to work.
Careful. Mommy's watching.
Releasing the splenophrenic vessels.
Let's pack it in with lap pads.
Small vascular clamp.
Mobilizing the spleen.
Bowl, please.
Let's isolate
the hilar vessels. We'll ligate.
Did you touch the circulating nurse?
For God's sake.
Of course not.
It looked close.
Carmen, get out.
What?
I've had it
with your intrusive pettiness.
I'm doing my job.
No, you are driving us all crazy.
Now leave the O.R.
I can't do that.
Well, then
we'll call security to assist you. Shirley?
Are you serious?
I've never been more serious.
Catfight pending.
Dr. Corday. What?
They want to see you in Romano's office.
I'm operating.
He said to have you scrub out
and to escort you or I'm fired.
I'll take that spleen.
Don't follow me.
Isn't Surgery supposed to take your messages?
Let me guess, Roger or Jackie?
One of each.
Sounds like they're feuding.
Let 'em.
SARAH: I don't think I can.
ABBY: Just temporarily.
Is he okay?
Yeah, he should be sore for a week or so
but everything went well.
And he'll work like normal?
Should be just what you ordered.
Uh, Sarah didn't really have an issue with the circumcision.
I was trying to let him down gently.
Let him down?
I didn't want to hurt him.
You need to go upstairs and tell him the truth.
Huh-uh, three weeks.
No, now.
I backed over this guy's cat one time
and I stayed two more weeks.
This has got to be worth at least three.
Do whatever you want.
I'm so bad at relationships.
I can never just say
what I feel.
I know what you mean.
You do know I was in the O.R...
ROMANO: Sit down, Elizabeth.
No, thank you.
This is Edwin Bane, Cook County Health Department.
Dr. Corday.
It couldn't wait?
Dr. Bane is an investigator.
So, it's an investigation now?
Unfortunate record you've accrued lately, Dr. Corday.
Yes.
We're a little baffled by it.
As am I.
Did something turn up in my cultures?
No.
Does Carmen have a problem with my technique?
We're looking at other theories.
Other theories?
Has to be more than a statistical anomaly.
What do you think is happening?
Well, if I knew that, I'd have fixed it by now.
And there's nothing you want to tell us?
Uh... what are you insinuating?
The next step is a criminal inquiry.
I beg your pardon?
All four of these patients were elderly
in marginal health.
Yes.
All die of post-op sepsis under your care.
And on at least one occasion the family asked you
to euthanize, correct?
No. No.
Adrienne Tanzi?
Uh... t-there was discussion about the quality of life.
Um, I'm sorry, am I being accused of something here?
Doctor, you wouldn't be the first angel of mercy
to help end patients' suffering.
All right, hold on, Doctor.
I thought you were fact-finding.
I am.
So, if there's something you want to tell us
you should tell us now.
Like what?
That I'm going around with a syringe full of bacteria
infecting these people on purpose?
All right, that's it.
Let's adjourn.
The Chicago police will be contacting you.
You might want to think about hiring counsel.
( door closes )
Is that your dog?
Yeah, Speedy.
He's lost.
Somebody order crayons?
Ooh, thanks.
You're welcome.
Did you finish your shift?
I'm waiting for Luka.
Is it always like this?
Pretty much, yeah.
I really admire what you do.
Oh, you get used to it.
No, I meant you.
I always wanted to be a nurse.
Really?
At the hospital where my mother died
the nurses treated me like I was their daughter.
They gave me ice cream, and dolls to play with.
They were like angels.
KOVAC: Nicole, have you seen my patient?
Which one?
Wes, the one you met.
Uh, I talked to him maybe an hour ago.
Well, he's gone.
You finished stitching his hand, right?
Yeah, but the social worker has to see him.
Maybe he didn't want to get that tube removed.
I didn't tell him I wanted to do that.
Oh.
Did you?
No, I didn't say anything.
Abby, if you see Adele, could you tell her
that my patient eloped?
Sure.
Don't worry
he'll be okay.
He's on the street with a serious coagulopathy
drug habit, no money...
Well, if he left home, and...
What?
And stayed away this long
maybe he doesn't want to be found.
( music blaring and baby crying )
Rachel?
Damn it!
Rachel!
It's okay, honey.
Come on. Oh!
It's okay. It's okay.
I know.
Oh, it's all right, darling.
RACHEL: He's really cute
but don't you think he should cut off his hair?
Rachel, turn off the music and get off the phone!
Two seconds.
Hang up!
I got to go.
My dad's wife is freaking.
What's wrong?
You're supposed to be baby-sitting.
I am.
Ella was screaming.
Oh, sorry. Did you feed her?
I wasn't supposed to feed her until she woke up.
Well, she's up now, isn't she?
You want me to feed her now?
Yes, I want you to feed her now.
Listen, I want you to be responsible.
I want you to think about something other than yourself.
I said I was sorry.
I didn't hear her crying.
No, because you didn't care to listen.
You were playing that crap
and talking about rubbish to your friend.
If you're so worried about Ella
then why don't you just stay home with her?
I made the mistake of thinking
that you were reliable enough to do it.
Well, then, forget it.
I'm calling Lynn back.
Hey, no, you don't.
Elizabeth! Warm up that milk.
No. Now.
She's your kid.
You're living in my house.
Doesn't mean you can
tell me what to do.
Oh, yes, I bloody well can.
You know what?
You need to chill out.
This is my house.
You can't talk to me that way.
Boy, my dad sure can pick them.
Rachel, you do not want to battle with me.
You'll lose, I guarantee it.
( crying )
Your shift's over, isn't it?
Yeah.
What are you, a med student again?
I sent him home.
I loved being this age.
Having a crush on a guy, finally meeting him at a party.
She probably went home all excited
wondering what would happen next.
She has a chance.
Yeah, I just want to be here, whichever way.
Don't stay all night, okay?
Dr. Lewis, there's a woman on line two calling from Omaha.
Thanks.
Good night.
Good night.
You make me drive all the way over here?
What is your problem?
You'd know if you'd take my calls.
Look, I have 100 things to do during the day.
And that's more important than your son?
It's more important than refereeing you and Jackie.
I was 20 minutes late and she uses that
to keep me from seeing him?
We need to rethink this visitation thing.
It's getting complicated.
It's Jackie who's messing things up.
Jackie is his aunt.
And I'm his father.
You're his what?
I'm one of his fathers.
Look, Roger, I, uh...
I appreciate you caring for Reese
and I thought this time was important to make a transition.
A transition?
But right now, you know what?
You need to let go.
Peter, look, I'm willing to work out
a schedule, or something.
No. Reese has one father, and that's me.
We both know that's not true, don't we?
Carla told me
you're not his real father anymore than I am.
You want to back up with that.
So don't think you can just dump me
like you're more important to him.
I am more important to him.
All right, listen.
You don't call me anymore, you don't come to the house
you stay away from Jackie
and you stay the hell away from my son.
Are you going to do it again?
Seriously, I think it worked.
It feels much better.
Needles in your back?
Yeah, it was a bonus.
I didn't realize you were a masochist.
Whatever works.
I should run home and get my whip.
Yeah, you do that.
You almost off?
Uh, yeah, 15 minutes ago.
What are you still hanging around for?
And miss this late-night stroll?
It's starting to get a little chilly out here.
I got asked out by a fireman tonight.
Really?
Mm-hmm.
The ankle guy?
Yeah. Hard to believe?
No.
He was good-looking.
Big?
Yeah... funny.
Invite me to the nuptials.
All right, you got to help me out.
I don't know what to do.
Rub your back?
I'm just not
exactly sure what I'm supposed to do here.
I'm not exactly sure
how I'm supposed to comment on your love life.
I said no because I was waiting for something to happen...
with us.
You've been waiting?
You weren't doing much to move it forward.
No, you gave me an ultimatum.
You stood right there and gave me an ultimatum
and I did what you asked, and you've done nothing.
What did I ask you to do?
I broke up with Luka.
First of all, you didn't break up with Luka for me.
I didn't? No.
Second of all, you didn't break up with Luka.
( chuckling ): Really?
I'm pretty sure I did.
Then why do you care so much
about what he does or what he thinks or who he helps
or what he thinks about you, or...
I dated the guy for a year.
There's going to be some history.
Maybe too much history.
Well, yeah, I had a life before John Carter.
( mirthless laugh )
If you want someone with no history
you're going to have to...
find yourself a virgin.
No, I'll settle for someone
who isn't hung up on somebody else.
You don't have to settle for anything, Carter.
( door opening )
I talked to her.
She's at Andrew's.
And?
He said he'd have her back by 10:00.
End of a great day.
That investigator was totally out of line.
He all but accused me of homicide.
It's crazy.
What if people believe him?
They won't.
You know what's really crazy?
I feel guilty.
Elizabeth...
I do.
Four people are dead, I was their doctor
and I can't explain what happened.
Well, the answer certainly isn't
that you were euthanizing people.
Then I come back home
and I take it out on a 14-year-old.
That's a fair fight?
She didn't do what she said she was going to do.
That's worth a conversation.
I'm going to have that with her.
I don't think I can handle this, Mark.
I was barely handling working and looking after the baby.
You can.
I can't.
Oh, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
( sobbing softly ) Hey.
We'll work this out.
( crying softly )
We'll lay down the rules for Rachel.
We'll get you a lawyer if we have to.
Oh, God.
We got fights ahead of us, we know that.
But we're together.
And we got children.
We're happy.
That's a lot.
That's a lot.
Hey.
I called your mom.
She's flying in.
You had us a little worried.
