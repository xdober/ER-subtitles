Previously on E.R.: The tumor has invaded
the eloquent areas of the brain.
How soon can you operate?
I can't.
He won't send Rachel away.
It's like he has to prove he loves her.
Don't waste your time with somebody you don't have any chemistry with.
Was it there for you?
I did you a huge favor!
You just don't know it yet.
How's Elizabeth taking it?
I haven't told her yet.
So, you're going to keep this a secret?
Act like nothing's wrong until you pass out
in public?
Staying in a hotel isn't going to solve anything.
Mark, I'm not trying to punish you.
I'm just trying to do what's best for Ella.
So, when are you coming home?
I don't know.
( phone rings )
HOTEL OPERATOR: 6:30 wake-up call.
Thank you.
( sighs softly )
Oh.
Ah, sh...
( moaning softly )
See, the sun goes... here.
The star goes...
Where does the star go?
Here. The star goes there.
That's right.
And where does the moon go?
Hmm? Where does the moon go?
( knocking )
Oh. Yeah. Moon.
That's it.
Moon.
Can you say "Mama"?
Hmm? Can you say "Mama"?
Ma-ma.
Oh, hi.
You're early.
I figured you could use a break.
Oh, well, that's right.
( chuckles )
( whispering ): Hi.
Oh...
Okay, I've just fed her.
Um, I've put extra diapers
in the diaper bag... Mm-hmm.
...uh, her hat and coat are on the nightstand
and, uh, I wrote you a check.
Oh, Dr. Greene already paid me for the month.
Oh, okay.
Um, you didn't happen to grab the mail, did you?
Well...
Oh, fabulous.
Say "bye-bye."
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye, my love. ( kissing sound )
Bye-bye.
Bye.
What are you doing?
Finishing my homework.
You ready in 20 minutes?
Sure.
You okay, Dad?
Fine.
But I'm supposed to do a hernia
and a pancreatic pseudocyst today
and I don't see them anywhere.
Things change, Lizzie.
Robert, have you tampered with my schedule?
Uh-huh. Trauma call all week.
Any particular reason?
Yes, because you haven't covered the E.R. in almost a month.
I had to go down to that cesspool myself twice yesterday.
I'm catching up on elective surgeries.
I'll start back next week.
You'll back today.
With any luck, you won't be called down.
Right. That happens.
Did you pass out?
No, but we were tracking a black-crowned heron
and I suddenly felt light-headed and tingly.
She had some stomach problems last night.
That was just his cooking.
50 of Benadryl, C.B.C. chem panel
dip a urine.
Have you noticed any changes
in your eyes, Joanne?
No. Why?
Your sclera's a little yellow.
Any recent illnesses?
No. I do yoga and spin every day.
I'm in great health.
She's, uh, prone to panic attacks.
Paul, I am not.
Deep breaths.
We bird-watch to reduce stress.
I did not have a panic attack.
( gasping ): The eggs!
Oh, uh, we found a wood duck's nest in the park.
A raccoon was about to eat these for breakfast.
Can you put them some place warm?
We think they're about to hatch.
Sure.
Add an A.S.T., A.L.T., bilirubin
and a lipase for Joanne.
Okay.
Vegan brownie?
My sister's starting her own pastry business.
I'll pass, thanks.
Man in uniform. Nice!
Ah, they trot us out
for these recruitment breakfasts.
I was in Dearborn at 6:00 a.m.
Yeah? Sign anyone up?
Not for service, but a co-ed gave me her phone number.
Ah, you go, private.
Uh, that's lieutenant.
Lieutenant, could you do something with these?
What are they? Eggs.
What do you want me to do with them?
Don't break them. They're supposed to hatch.
Into what? Who knows?
Gallant, posterior splint, Exam Four.
A kid in Curtain Two needs his ear wax cleaned out.
I'm here to serve.
Dr. Weaver, stabbing victim rolling up.
Prep Trauma One.
Jerry, call the labs.
I need my chemistries for Exam One.
Mark, Susan, divvy up Kovac's pass-ons.
Morning to you, too, Kerry.
Somebody sign for this package.
Yo, Gallant?
I've got the eggs.
Have you tried one of these?
Uh, I'll just lose it later.
Yeah, good point.
I don't know, Jerry
there's something to be said for animal fat.
My sister's hard core-- nothing with a face.
Someone called for a consult?
Ah, Dr. Corday. Welcome back.
I've only been a few floors away.
Uh, head trauma is threatening to go AMA.
I'll get this package to Dr. Kovac.
Don't worry.
He's not here.
He'll get it tomorrow.
I'll find him.
Hmm.
You waiting for something else?
Can you... talk?
Martin, huh?
You need a doctor?
You need help? MAN: Hey, Doc?
This lady's got smoke inhalation.
Some minor burns.
All right, Malik, can you get him to Curtain One?
Fire at Martin Luther King Elementary.
She stayed inside, getting her students out.
I had the space heater on.
It fell on a little girl's sweater.
All right, no swelling in the nares.
Put her on a monitor, and get a carboxyhemoglobin.
Stupid heating's been out since January.
This the stabbing?
Smoke inhalation.
Some minor burns coming in behind us. Plan on more.
A second building went up as we were leaving.
We got all engines in the area responding. We got to get back.
Diana Hayes, 19 years old.
Multiple stab wounds-- right neck and chest.
The guy that got bit by the German shepherd
finally calmed down.
How much Ativan?
Six.
He's relaxed
and he's all yours.
I'm out of here.
You still keeping vampire hours?
Mm-hmm. Not that I can sleep much during the day.
Luka doesn't have any curtains?
Not in the living room.
You know, we got a lot of spare bedrooms.
What happened? You lose some of the kitchen staff?
I'm saying a girl needs her beauty sleep, that's all.
Thanks.
Lipstick Mary's looking for you.
She wants you to tell her shadow
to lay off.
It's not like it listens to me.
Making any headway?
With what?
Stop it.
I'll be at the 7:00 yoga
if you want to avoid me.
Oh, sorry.
No, it's quite all right.
That's a lot of glass you've got there, Nelson.
How'd it happen?
Candle.
Was it in a glass holder? Yeah.
Was it flying through the air at the time?
Dr. Corday? Yeah?
Dr. Weaver needs a surgeon in One.
I'll be right there.
Don't move, Nelson.
Haleh, where are the baby warmers?
Lost, stolen-- who knows?
What do we have?
Multiple stab wounds, right neck and chest.
Tension pneumo.
Pulse is thready at 110, B.P.'s 80 palp.
How old is she?
GREENE: 19 years old.
Student at Hamden College.
Attacked in her bed.
Curved Kelly, 32 French.
How many wounds?
At least ten.
There was blood all over the sheets.
We know about a weapon?
WOMAN: Nothing we saw.
Thoraseal's ready.
Needle driver.
I thought Edson was on call.
You'll have to settle for me.
Neck veins are up.
Trachea midline.
HALEH: Defensive wounds on both arms.
What time did you find her?
At 9:00. I always pick her up for Poly Sci. Uh-huh
and was she able to speak at all?
No. I thought she was dead.
Muffled heart sounds. Prep for a thoracotomy.
There's more like 15 wounds here.
Do we know who did this to her?
I don't know. Everybody likes her.
Lost the pulse.
Ten blade.
Okay, rib spreader.
Get ready for suction.
There's a defect in the left ventricle.
Get a finger on that. Mark?
Starting internal compressions.
I have a few minutes.
Do you want me to make a call?
2.0 silk on an atraumatic needle.
See if they can change the time.
Yeah, yeah, sure.
JARVIK: It's better if you wait outside.
I'm okay. GREENE: Prep internal paddles.
We're losing this one, too.
Grab a set of vitals.
Get another gurney.
She may have hit her head.
You did a nice job on your neck.
Shaving. I was in a rush.
Your mom called.
Oh.
At 4:00 a.m.
She still hasn't figured out
the time difference.
I'm so sorry.
Anyway...
Two more sutures, and we'll defibrillate.
Call the O.R.
Have them standing by.
CARTER: Decisions, huh?
At the end of the day
I think the Cheetos are just as good as Doritos.
Just going to get a soda.
Ah, Martin.
You were supposed to stay over there.
Is this your guy?
Oh, sort of.
What's the deal?
He can't speak.
Is that an emergency?
Well, there's something not quite right about him.
Hey, I'm Dr. Carter, Martin.
How you doing?
What, is he deaf, too?
Martin?
Can you turn around?
Are you hurt?
Are you in pain?
Mm-hmm. Well, I don't think he likes you much.
( pops soda can )
Do you think you could write down
what's wrong?
Is it your head, chest, stomach...?
Oh. Told you.
He's probably just hungry.
Well, when was the last time you ate?
Two days? Huh!
Two days.
Yeah, I got that. Thanks.
15 knife wounds.
She must have really pissed someone off.
It's horrible.
Bovie, pickups.
Let me get something straight.
Someone chops this girl up like a glove of garlic
and you take your sweet time in the E.R.
placing three horizontal mattresses in the ventricle?
It was a large defect.
Uh-huh. A Foley balloon would have taken care of it
in two seconds.
You still would have had to repair
the myocardium up here.
Exactly. While you were having your little sewing bee
I could have been repairing the pulmonary artery.
I didn't appreciate that wound.
Satinsky and more prolene.
So what's your excuse?
You lose a fortune in the stock market?
Nope.
Cat run away?
How many units in?
Just the six O-neg.
You and the hubby still fighting?
Aha!
So, the rumor mill is still churning out winners.
I'm glad the gossip's so amusing.
Army-Navy.
So, is this split temporary or the real thing?
I don't know.
You want my advice?
No. Another clip.
Stay away from love.
It does things to the brain.
( alarm beeping )
PVCs.
Oh, damn it.
A hundred of lidocaine.
Come on, Diana.
So, it's her nerves, right?
Nothing a Xanax won't cure?
Actually, your transaminases are very high.
What's that mean?
You have pretty extensive
liver damage.
I don't drink at all.
Drugs?
No.
Have you had anything
out of the ordinary to eat
the last few days?
We had seared Ahi last night.
A pear salad.
Chanterelles.
You ate our mushrooms?
I threw some in my omelet yesterday.
You weren't up yet.
Where did you get them from?
We picked them in Marin a few months ago.
I froze them.
Oh. If they were bad mushrooms
you could have amanita poisoning.
And that causes liver damage?
Extreme cases can result in full liver failure.
What do you do for that?
We don't want to get ahead of ourselves
but worst case scenario, you'd need a transplant.
But I don't even feel that sick.
It may not come to that.
Do you have any relatives
we can test to see if they're a match?
Do we know her name?
Cops are working on it.
Why didn't they tube her?
Big anterior hematoma
at the base of the neck--
didn't want to take the chance.
Female in her 20s found stabbed at Hamden College.
That's the second one today.
Found a knife at the scene.
B.P. 110/70.
Stab wounds to the neck
and two deep ones by the sternum.
Was she in the dorm, too?
Science building.
Police are searching the university.
Great. Killing spree on campus.
Remind me not to hang out there.
Open a crike tray.
We might need to cut through this hematoma.
Draw up 20 of etomidate and 120 of sux
and I need a 7.5 tube.
Dr. Weaver, a wall collapsed at the school fire.
What can we take?
Three criticals, four minors.
Okay, call Respiratory and E.N.T.
Hang on, she's trying to say something.
Honey, can you tell us your name?
Okay, suction ready.
Hold cricoid while we bag.
Pulse ox is coming up, 96%.
Probable mediastinal injury.
We'll have to triple scope her.
Oh, great.
Friend of yours?
Could someone take him to Curtain One?
600 of Clinda, 200 of gentamicin.
Meds are in.
We should tube her, Kerry.
Wait... what is it?
( whispering ): I loved her.
( woman choking )
Hey, where's my doctor?
Oh, I don't know.
Well, can you tell her that I'm flying again?
LEWIS: This beats the patch
any day.
I thought women liked pirates.
Yeah. 400 years ago maybe.
( clears throat )
I was paged about a possible liver transplant.
Oh, right.
Um, the sister's here.
I thought both of us could talk to her.
Thanks, Susan.
Yeah.
What's in New York?
What?
They were charges on our Visa bill from New York.
Terry Welsh? Do you know where she is?
Uh, yeah. Right down there by Curtain Three.
$52 from Saks.
Uh, yeah, that's mine. It was a phone order.
Something you couldn't find in Chicago?
Terry?
Yeah. Hi, sorry.
I just got out of practice.
That's okay. I'm Dr. Greene.
This is Dr. Corday.
Thanks for coming in.
Um, Paul said it was serious.
Yeah, serious enough that we should line up a donor.
Donor?
Hi, Ter.
Joanne.
Your sister's doing okay now
but we'd like to take the first step
and get blood drawn
and have you sign the consent form.
Uh, consent for what?
You didn't fill her in?
I thought Joanne should.
I might need a new liver.
What?!
JOANNE: And my best shot for a match is
someone in the family.
CORDAY: She's stage three right now
which means she's still
well enough to accept a living donor transplant.
Uh, wait a second.
We'd like to test you to see
if you're a match.
I have the Sweet 16 this weekend.
What?
We beat Indiana on Thursday.
The game you obviously didn't watch.
You play in a lot of games.
These are the play-offs, Joanne.
There's not a lot of time.
Right?
Sooner is definitely better.
It's just part of your liver.
It grows back.
You donate the right lobe, about 60%.
Wait.
Stop.
Let me think.
What's to think about?
No. You're right.
Uh, we don't even know if she's a match yet.
Shelley.
You should be lying down.
What's Renee doing here?
You know this girl?
Renee Carlson.
She's Diana's roommate.
Uh, she was badly injured.
Was she stabbed like Diana?
Are Renee and Diana close?
No.
She's quiet.
Kind of weird.
Diana's moving out
in a few weeks to come live with us.
Where is Diana?
Is she okay?
Oh, my God.
She's not dead?
I'm sorry.
I called your house today, Martin.
I know you can speak
because I heard your voice on the answering machine.
Why aren't you talking to me?
What?
I don't know what you're trying to tell me.
Why don't you just say it?
Martin.
Okay, stop playing games.
Tell me what's wrong.
CORDAY: Look, we'll try
supportive therapy, but with fulminant liver failure
there are no guarantees
and she has already started bleeding in her stomach.
I'm a match, aren't I?
Or you wouldn't be out here explaining this if I weren't.
A transplant would be totally curative for her.
But there'd still be a risk for me, right?
It would be minimal, and someone as young and healthy
as you should recover completely.
In three days?
More like six weeks.
I'm a senior.
This is my first and last time in the play-offs.
Can't she wait a month?
She's already having complications.
Pretend she didn't have a sister.
What would you do?
Well, we'd be forced
to put her on a waiting list for a cadaveric donor.
So there are other ways she could get a liver.
Terry, this is her best chance.
And obviously, it's your choice, but, uh
I'm sure she'd do the same thing for you.
No.
She wouldn't.
( tires screeching )
Oh, my God.
Run inside. Tell them we need a collar and backboard now.
I got hot water all over me.
Charlie, does your neck hurt? Everything hurts.
I need help here.
Somebody, please!
You need help driving!
What happened? Mark, the boy.
Okay, Charlie
stay still like a statue.
We're going to move you.
Hey, give me that one.
Go get another backboard for Charlie.
He's not breathing.
Lie him down here.
He's been unconscious about 20 minutes.
And why is he wet?
He was taking a bath. We stepped away for a minute.
He was under water.
For how long?
Two minutes at the most.
He needs a pulse ox.
How old is he?
He's eight.
His name's Viktor.
He's not moving much air.
How could we let this happen?
He'll be okay, Linda.
Who's Mom?
I am. I'm his doctor.
They called you first?
MARQUEZ: Pulse ox 85
on 15 liters.
Did you try to resuscitate him on the way over?
No.
Take vitals?
We thought it best to just come over.
First day labs
EKG, and a portable chest.
Follow the light, Charlie.
We need to see your pupils.
My pupils aren't my problem.
Titrate ten of morphine.
Get him feeling better.
Now you're talking.
Circumferential burns to both hands
just to the elbows.
Trying to clear the neck.
Trauma panel, dip a urine.
Get the sonosite.
Dr. Corday?
Yup.
Go ahead.
Let's get a full scan
just to be safe.
Head, c-spine. abdomen.
Bag him.
Draw up atropine, etomidate and sux.
Linda, Kyle, I'm going to recommend you step outside.
Orange zone on the Broselow.
We want to stay with him.
Not now.
I'm not leaving my son.
He's not getting enough air.
Six-oh cuffed E.T. tube.
He's going to be okay, right?
Are you a medical doctor?
Socialization therapist.
Satting at 91.
Try a nasal trumpet.
( phone rings )
Felicia Kind.
Number three straight blade.
Okay, sit down.
Deep breath.
You need to take that outside.
I should have called first.
Oh, no, no. I'm glad you came over.
We were on our way home
from baby gym class, and she just... said it.
Who's that? Who's that?
That's Dada.
Dada.
That's right.
Dada. That's Dada.
Why were three adults giving an eight-year-old a bath?
It was a bonding game.
Recreating the womb.
I'm in.
It was only for short periods.
Apparently, not short enough.
Mark, you should get out there.
Is something wrong?
Uh, no. Ella has something to tell you.
Okay, tidal volume 300, AC 14 on 100%.
Get a blood gas in 20 minutes.
I'll be right outside.
Hey, you deserted me.
I did nothing of the sort, Charlie.
You're in perfectly good hands.
She never buys from me.
Yeah, you're overpriced.
Dr. Weaver, Renee Carlson's mom is here.
Is there anything on the firefighters?
Not that I know.
Let's repeat the hematocrit
in one hour, and send the O-neg back to the blood bank.
Mrs. Carlson?
I'm Dr. Weaver.
I'm treating Renee.
Hi.
They called me at work.
They told me she got hurt at school.
I thought she twisted an ankle or something.
Your daughter has multiple knife wounds
including a deep cut across her throat.
You saved her?
We were able to repair the wounds
and she's stable
but we had to put a tube down her throat
to help her breathe.
When will she wake up?
It's hard to say.
We'll just have to wait.
She hasn't been in the hospital since she was born.
We'll need to get her up to the Intensive Care Unit.
The police said her friend Diana was attacked, too?
Yes.
Is she okay?
Diana's injuries were much more extensive.
We were unable to save her.
( groans )
Has Renee been having any problems at school?
No.
Ha-Has she been depressed or-or showing any signs of...?
No. Why are you asking this?
We're just trying to understand what happened.
Someone attacked my daughter, and her friend.
That's what happened.
Why is everyone asking
all these questions?
Renee didn't.
So, what?
My daughter didn't hurt her friend...
and she certainly did not do this...
to herself.
There must be a maniac
out there.
I'm sure Renee will tell us what happened
as soon as she wakes up.
( sniffling )
( whispering ): That's right.
She'll tell you.
She and Diana were best friends.
Viktor's stable.
He's breathing with the help of a machine.
Will he wake up?
We hope we see some progress in the next 24 hours.
Social worker's on her way down to talk to you.
Why do we need a social worker?
Wait, Doc.
Let me explain.
I got the gist of it.
We-We adopted Viktor in Prague last year.
We were thrilled, but he hasn't connected with us.
Well, love and time-- that usually does the trick.
Well, it was putting a strain on our marriage.
That's why Felicia's helping us.
You put your son in a lot of danger.
If he needs counseling
or you do, go to a real doctor.
Her success rate is 85%.
Excuse me.
What, no geese?
I swear a flock of ducks just walked down the hall.
He's seeing birds.
Please, Stan.
You told me you saw 50 butterflies earlier.
Pink elephants?
They weren't pink.
They were psychedelic
and pretty as Natalie Wood.
Jerry, have you seen Dr. Greene?
Yeah. He checked out for an hour.
Where to?
Don't know, but Dr. Lewis is covering for him.
STAN: * I feel pretty, oh so pretty *
Oh, where are you going with that?
I have a five-day-old with Listeria.
Where are the eggs?
What eggs? Susan.
I need a favor.
Uh, yeah, sure.
Can you take this to Exam Four?
Uh, this is a bit awkward, but, um
I need to know where my husband is.
I don't know.
You're covering his patients.
Well, yeah, but... Please tell me.
Uh, I'm sorry.
Look, I know there's something going on.
I know he's told you.
I don't think I deserve to be in the dark.
He is my husband. You need to talk to him.
Susan...
Uh...
Elizabeth, think about it.
What would be going on that he wouldn't want to tell you?
That he'd try to protect you from?
Um, excuse me.
I'm looking for my husband.
Mark Greene.
He just started his treatment.
Can you take me to him, please?
Sure.
I just pre-medicated with the anti-emetic--
ondansetron.
The decadron runs in over 15 minutes
as an IV piggy-back.
Once that's in, I'll be back to inject the vincristine.
He's also getting procarbazine and CCNU.
Right through there.
Were you knocked out?
No, but I was pinned pretty good.
All right, full trauma panel.
C-spine, chest and pelvis.
The school fire?
It's a bad one.
Contusions and abrasions to mid-thigh.
Can you wiggle your toes for me?
Good breath sounds.
Follow my finger.
Did you get everyone out?
One kid unaccounted for.
( grunting ): We were looking for him
when the floor above us collapsed.
Who's we? About six of us.
Pedal pulses, two plus, bilaterally.
They vented the roof
and half the main wall fell in.
You get all your guys out safe?
Still looking for three when I left.
Hanson, Jeffries and Lopez.
Sandy Lopez?
She was the first one in.
CORDAY: What about gamma radiation?
Didn't work.
The tumor's still growing.
Well, should we call Dr. Burke?
Maybe he... I saw him.
In New York.
How much time?
If this works...
ten months.
Why didn't you tell me?
I don't know. Uh...
I guess it was bad timing.
I could have helped.
How?
Look, you shouldn't be alone right now.
This doesn't change anything.
Yes, it does. It changes everything.
I don't expect you to come back and be my wife
just because this happened.
Let me know if Perotti goes to the O.R.
I'm pretty sure it's an appy.
What, you're going back to work?
I-I don't know what else to do.
I've debrided the forearms.
She going to need some Thermazene and some burn-net
and I promised her three stickers.
Mermaids or horses?
CHEN: Three liters of Ringer's so far
and 20 of Morphine. You got it.
He's going to the burn unit?
Yeah, third one today.
He's getting the last bed.
Urine output was 250cc's in the last hour.
There's your new boyfriend.
What? Oh, poor guy.
He's a little on the simple side.
You think?
Martin, did you talk to the lady from Psych?
Oh, that doesn't mean anything to me.
Okay, a scarf doesn't mean much either.
I don't get it, okay?
Um...
Did someone knit you the set?
Something happened to that person?
Oh, um...
Two days ago.
When you stopped talking.
Danny Barnett.
He was found on the scene at the fire.
No obvious burns or injuries.
People were very worried about you, Danny.
Where were you?
Cafeteria.
How are his sats?
99 on room air. Okay.
Did you breath in any smoke, Danny?
No. I told the fire lady I'm not hurt.
She still made me come.
Is-Is fire lady here with you now?
She rode in the ambulance with me.
Maybe they took her home.
And was she hurt?
Don't think so.
She was telling me jokes.
Okay. I'll be right back, Danny, okay?
Jerry, call the 38.
Verify that all their firefighters
are accounted for.
They're probably still busy with the fire.
Just do it.
You need to start wearing shoes, okay, Gilmir?
Where's Dr. Greene?
He'll be back in a bit.
You know where he went?
What do you need?
I've got a complex laceration
through the helix of the ear.
He was going to walk me through it.
I'll do it. Where's the patient?
Yeah? Suture Room.
What's that?
It's a lighter.
Scoped it out of some kid's belly.
What are you going to do with it?
Keep it.
Why?
Behold, Dr. Carter's box of wonders.
You've scoped all that stuff out of patients?
I like to think of it
as gastrointestinal bric-a-brac.
Hey, is that my good pen?
It still works. I can't believe
you pulled this out of someone's stomach.
Other end. Keep it.
Here.
You didn't sign it.
I know.
Terry, where are you going?
Back to practice.
What about Joanne?
Joanne's never had time for anyone but Joanne.
Look, even if that's true, that's still no reason not to help her.
We're not close.
She's still your sister.
I know I should be a bigger person
but I've trained for this my whole life
and I'm not willing to sacrifice that.
If that makes me a selfish, terrible person, I'm sorry.
Maybe I'll help Joanne afterwards, but not right now.
( crying )
( crying continues )
Ah, hiding out, are you?
Do me a favor, just go down there
when those idiots page you.
They're like crazed cyborgs paging every five minutes
until they somehow manage to find your fearless leader
and suck us all into their universe.
( sniffling )
Oh-oh, what happened?
Prince Harry in rehab again?
( laughing shakily )
Mark's tumor's back.
Has it invaded Broca's?
It's encroaching the motor cortex.
I'm sorry.
It was always a possibility.
He's known about it for weeks.
He just didn't tell me.
Well...
( sighs )
...maybe he was protecting you.
( sniffling )
There's so much we haven't worked out.
Oh, I...
I don't think I can go through this again.
I'm sick and tired of being the strong one.
You know, we... we've broken up.
We've grown apart.
He doesn't even expect me to be there, anyway.
I mean, what am I supposed to do?
Am I supposed to just go back home to watch him die?
Yes.
Well, I don't think I can.
Is he your husband?
Yes.
Do you love him?
Yes.
NEUMAN: The police found his mom on the bathroom floor.
They think it was a heart attack.
Does he live with her?
Yeah. I think it's a conversion disorder
brought on by the psychological stress of finding her dead.
Well, does he have any other family?
Yeah, there's a sister coming in from Louisville
and Psych said they'd hold him until then.
Well, I'm going to go visit him.
Okay.
Uh, Viktor Evans' parents?
Trauma One.
How much
do you charge for therapy?
Uh, went a little too far this time.
Too far?
You deprived that boy's brain of oxygen.
He'll pull through.
How would you know?
I have a feeling.
A feeling?
If you call yourself a doctor
you should be able to back it up.
Before I started working with Viktor
he could barely crack a smile
let alone acknowledge his adoptive parents.
Now, he's calling them "mommy" and "daddy."
HALEH: Dr. Greene
he's having purposeful movements.
Don't worry, honey, mommy's here.
Is he okay?
Viktor, can you hear me?
Try and grab my fingers.
Good grip strength bilaterally.
Looks like we're in the clear.
Check the weaning parameters.
Viktor, you have
a tube in your throat, so you can't talk.
Welcome back, champ.
GREENE: We'll take it out as soon as we can.
Look.
This may have been a breakthrough day.
MOTHER: You think?
KIND: Absolutely.
He's engaging with you.
You're kidding, right?
We have other methods we can try.
Not if you intend on keeping Viktor.
What you did today was abusive, not loving.
KIND: Radical problems require radical therapies.
NEUMAN: Why don't you tell that to Child Protective Services?
They'll be making a home visit.
HALEH: You okay Dr. Greene?
Uh... I-I got to go.
( Stan humming "I Feel Pretty" )
CARTER: What's Stan still doing here?
WEAVER: I told him he could sleep it off here
if he sang quietly.
At least it's not Oklahoma tonight.
Thank God for small favors.
And he's off the birds.
Can you call for Stewart's pelvic CT results?
Check a second troponin on Lang.
Oh, wait.
Mark, you haven't written up your H and Ps.
I'll do that on next shift.
Yeah, well, this shift isn't over.
I just had my first round of chemotherapy, Kerry.
I feel like hell.
I'm going to go home early, okay?
Hey.
What's the expression-- "couch tomato"?
Potato.
And I'm at the table.
I should buy a new comforter.
Don't do it on my account.
A girl named Michele called for you.
Oh, I forgot.
You're taking her to the Ice Capades?
What's wrong with that?
( chuckles ): Nothing.
I tried to explain to her that I was
just your roommate.
I'm not sure if I like her, anyway.
Is this the last one?
No, there's a couple more in there.
Any luck?
Um... yes, here's one.
Two bedroom, one bath, hardwood floors
breakfast nook.
Sounds big.
Has a doorman.
Safe.
And a lake view.
Ooh, how much?
Well, this one's only twice what I can afford.
I'm going to jump in the shower.
Yeah, you don't want to keep Tai and Randy waiting.
( laughs mockingly )
( chuckles )
This latte blows.
Weaver said that Charlie won't be
on his feet again till next week.
Well, then I'm in trouble
because this cafeteria stuff is criminal.
I heard about Mark Greene.
Tough to keep a secret around here.
You did.
So that night, you were, uh...
( sighs )
What can I say?
I'm passionate.
You spent the night together and I thought...
You have a very active imagination.
If you only knew.
You are not flirting with me.
No way.
Never make that mistake again.
Back in uniform.
Isn't your head cold?
Ah, nah, I've got thick hair.
What are you hiding?
Nothing.
What are you hiding?
What have you got there, Gallant?
What have you got in there?
Hey, come on, Gallant.
Oh, look at that.
Oh.
Can I hold one?
Sure.
Oh, they're so cute.
Oh.
Oh.
Sorry.
Hey.
Out barhopping?
I was just...
Lost?
Looking for you.
And you only found my car.
It was great what you did
for that kid today.
Part of the job, you know.
The good part, when the fire doesn't get you.
Do you want to... do you want to talk about it?
No, I'm back at 7:00.
Hey, you know what...
you, uh, no...
you can't drive.
Kerry, come on.
You were missing
and I was worried.
I'm touched.
You were right.
You did do me a favor.
Come to think of it, it was a pretty cool save.
Fire went to three alarms.
I couldn't see my hand in front of my...
Hi.
Hi.
Where's your dad?
Upstairs.
He didn't feel well.
Would you like to take Ella?
Hey.
There's Rach.
Hi.
Thank you.
He's sick again, isn't he?
( Greene retching and coughing )
( retching and coughing continuing )
How long have you been like this?
( sighs )
Forever.
Don't they say if it makes you sick
it's working?
It's cold comfort
when you're lying on the bathroom floor.
You want some Compazine?
I took some an hour ago.
Here.
Let me put this on your forehead.
( shudders )
You know, I tried for weeks
to get her to say "mama" and "moon."
They always say "dada" first.
That's just because it's easy to say.
Maybe she likes me.
She's a good judge of character.
( coughs )
Here.
I'm going to go out and get some Zofran.
No, no, no, no, no, stay, stay.
It'll pass.
( coughing )
