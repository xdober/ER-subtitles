Previously on E.R.:
It's impossible for that woman
to be my mother.
This information is there, I can get it.
You're not going to quit, are you?
You're fired.
Have you talked to Weaver about an attending position?
If she wanted me, she would have asked me about it.
I never got a chance to thank you
but I got my
chief resident confirmation.
I won't let you down. I'm sure you won't.
Don't talk to me about Luka.
I don't want to wish bad things for you
and I don't want to sit on the sidelines
waiting for you two to break up.
MAN: Hey!
Hey!
Roger.
You stay away from my wife.
140 patients, 27 admissions.
It has to be a shift record.
I got a record for you.
There's a guy in Exam Four
that swallowed 50 hot dogs in 19 minutes.
Shift record, as in, shift over.
Who has Pelar now?
Which one's that?
Kidney stone camped out in Seven
since this morning.
FRANK: Carter. I admitted him to Urology.
I just need a diet order.
Two gram sodium.
Thank you.
MAN: No, this is my personal property.
Two gram sodium in Seven.
I'm out of here.
No, wait. I need help with a foley.
It's my personal property.
What room? Right here.
No. What's the problem.
He's drunk, combative
and he won't give up his beer.
Give me... Is it open?
Oh, Abby, I need help.
I need to pee.
Sorry, I just punched out.
That's going to cost you.
Where's Mark?
What do you want to do, take it home?
Mark Greene, your Attending. I think he quit.
MAN: I need to pee.
Give me the beer.
No, no, no beer.
Kerry, have you seen Mark?
Oh, good, Elizabeth
I need you to see a post-op seroma.
Could you let me put my baby down first?
Where's Mark? Try Curtain Three.
TAKATA: No urine in the last hour.
Yeah, bolus another liter of Ringer's.
Call for a renal code.
Dr. Weaver? Yup.
X-ray's behind and my wrist fracture wants to leave.
Jing-Mei, you're Chief Resident.
Don't check with me on every patient.
You have to learn to keep things flowing, okay?
Well, we don't have time
for the ones we can move quickly.
Turf and admit, treat and street.
Mark?
GREENE: Bag him, prep the neck. One percent with epi.
What do you think you're doing?
Sorry, we got jammed.
You told me to meet you in the parking lot.
A drunk boating accident.
Busted his face.
We need to crike him.
This is exactly why we need a weekend nanny.
Weekday nanny is bad enough.
It doesn't make us bad parents, Mark.
Just want to raise our children. Then you need
to be home when you say you're going to be.
I'm an hour late for my shift.
Sats are down to 84.
Introducer needle.
Five more minutes.
Finish the procedure, give it to a resident
and meet me upstairs.
You're in trouble, Doc.
LOCKHART: You're being stubborn.
I'm not being stubborn.
You have six weeks to go on your residency
you don't have a job anywhere else
you know she's looking for another Attending
and you're still not talking to her.
She should ask me. You're being stubborn.
I don't think I'm being... MARQUEZ: Abby!
Hey, can you try for a line
on Barney before you go?
He's back with cellulitis.
I'm off.
Connie said you found a vein last time.
Yeah, I know, but I'm off.
He's asking for you.
I'm off, I'm off.
I'm gone, I'm out of here.
Some place important to be?
Yeah, home. I have to be back here at 7:00.
Have a good night.
See you tomorrow.
Hey!
Talk to Weaver.
How did it sting you in there?
( unintelligible ): It flew in my Coke.
What?
A bee flew in his Coke.
Dr. Weaver, I'd like to ask you a question.
Airway's clear. No wheezing.
50 of Benadryl PO.
Better get that new attending in here, huh?
Uh, yeah.
Hey, Haleh, I need a visual acuity
on the foreign body in Eight.
66In a minute.
Are you actively recruiting? What?
I mean, is it word of mouth?
Are you head hunting?
I'm running a classified in the Annals.
Huh.
Unresponsive initially.
Woke up with an amp of D50.
What's the half life of Glyburide?
Ten hours. Overdose?
60 milligrams. Admit him.
The hypoglycemia lasts for over a day.
Because I was thinking about applying.
For Attending?
It is my next step.
Oh, yeah, right, of course.
You don't sound very enthusiastic.
No, it's just we were hoping for someone
at least five years post residency.
But yeah, certainly.
Apply.
Right.
In case you can't find anybody better.
JING-MEI: John!
John, can you clear toe lac in Curtain Two?
I'm off.
He's been waiting five hours.
I can't get to it. We need the bed.
I'm meeting my parents for dinner.
You can dispo him in 15 minutes.
I have done my share of dispos today.
For me?
Sorry. Give it to Malucci.
Malucci is not here for another hour.
Cleo is stuck with pulmonary edema.
I'm baby-sitting four I.C.U. players.
We're down two nurses
and the rack is overflowing.
Please?
If you could just take one easy patient.
That's all I'm asking.
All right.
One patient.
Thank you.
Wait. What room?
We were unloading the volcano.
I dropped the base on my foot
between the lift and the platform.
Volcano? Yeah, the show ends
with this big volcano explosion with all this real
live lava and steam and crap.
Not real lava.
No, but it's real-looking lava, though. Yeah.
Um, this is more than just a cut.
No kidding. Damn thing almost sliced my toe off.
Yeah, it was just hanging there
like a big noodle or something.
I'll have to do a digital block.
Have to wait for X-ray.
Have to sew a two-layer repair.
You signed up for it.
It's going to take more than an hour.
Well, hurry up.
Maybe we can catch the end of the show.
The guys are opening up for Metallica.
What guys?
We're roadies for Touching Wood.
All right! What's the song?
BOTH: "Rapture Bitch."
I like that song.
It's not their only song.
It's not even their best song.
I'm going to numb the two nerves
in your toe and wash this out.
Then we'll take you for an X-ray.
Do you want to wait outside?
No, I'm cool.
( thudding )
( laughs )
That happens.
Check his vitals.
Run a liter of saline if he's postural.
Carter, he's not breathing.
What?!
The surgery caused the infection?
It may have contributed, yes.
But because of his compromised state
he wasn't able to fight off the infection
even with the appropriate antibiotics.
I told him not to drink so much.
If you'd like to go in and see him
I'll be in there in a minute.
Yes, please.
Jacy, Jacy, could you take her?
Oh, of course.
This way.
( baby crying )
Sorry. He started seizing.
We had to give him Dilantin and get him to C3.
We're not doing this anymore.
What?
No more weekend shifts
that are even remotely close to one another.
We just got jammed.
Four hours should have been enough.
Mark, I am not explaining to a woman why her son died
while my baby is screaming in her face.
Okay. I'm not.
I said, okay.
She missed her nap.
Just get her home.
Give her four more ounces and put her down.
Is the milk defrosted?
Yes.
But you will have to take another out for tonight.
Okay. I got it, I got it, I got it.
( baby crying )
Is that our homeless guy?
CORDAY: Post-op bacteremia.
He died of sepsis.
He has a mother?
Apparently, we all have a mother.
Hi, yi, hi.
Yes, yes.
She's a little cranky.
That's all right.
It'll be all right.
Give me some cricoid pressure.
Sats are down to 90.
All right, I'm in. Bag him.
What did you take?
I didn't take anything.
The paramedics gave it to me.
What did he take, drugs?
Alcohol?
Uh, I don't know.
Some beers, some pot, some Georgia Homeboy.
Is that liquid G.?
Yeah.
Call for a vent
BAL and a tox screen.
Cleo, I need you to take this guy.
Respiratory arrest from a GHB overdose.
I can't.
I'm off duty.
I have the stampede.
What stampede?
Guitar player collapsed at a rock concert.
The crowd just mobbed the stage.
Where?
At the United Center.
No way.
Metallica or us?
WEAVER: Any head injury?
ZADRO: He just slumped to the floor.
The crowd went nuts. History of seizures?
Girlfriend might know. She rode in with him.
Okay, ask her.
Dr. Weaver, do you have
an intubation from the concert?
Apneic on scene.
Pupils are equal and reactive.
Carter tubed his friend. He thinks
they mixed the alcohol with GHB.
BP is 122/78.
FRANK: Dr. Weaver
three crush injures rolling in.
Okay, I'll be right there.
Blood gas, BAL
and tox screen, and have Carter
follow their labs together.
Oh, and there's a guy at the desk
in a ponytail says he knows you.
Take a name. Make him wait.
PICKMAN: BP 100/60 pulse, 110.
Complains of abdominal pains, but no LOC.
multiple contusions to the trunk and extremities.
Is his family coming in with him?
No, he's by himself, but it was crazy.
All sorts of people were separated.
Who would bring a seven-year-old to a heavy metal concert?
One, two, three.
All right, portable C-spine
chest and pelvis.
Trauma panel.
Dip a urine. CLEO: What's his name?
Kevin. Kevin, I'm Dr. Finch.
Do you know your home phone number?
I can't breathe.
We'll help you.
They were pushing me.
BENTON: Good breath sounds.
I know, but you're safe now.
Epigastric tenderness. No rebound.
No guarding. Sinus tach at 112.
Is there a Dr. Benton in here?
Yeah, that's me.
A unit called in from Saint Rafe's.
An E.R. doc thinks he's got your kid over there.
What?
Uh, deaf, three or four.
Reese Benton written inside his jacket.
Yes, is he okay? It sounds like it
but they're looking for a parent.
Where's Carla? Who's Carla?
His mother.
I don't know, I was here.
Dispatch asked me to see
if I could find you.
Lily, get another surgeon. Peter, go.
What sort of look are you going for here?
Hey.
Bought a TV?
Yup.
Anything else?
A Sony Play Station.
I was thinking more along the lines of furniture.
You know, a table, chairs, a bed.
I got an aquarium.
Yes, I see.
Couldn't get a bigger one, huh?
The next size up was pretty expensive.
Um...
I-I thought we were going to go out to eat.
I'm still hungry.
Do you want to play?
I don't think so.
We can hunt zombies together.
Couldn't we just reason with them?
I think I'm just going to go home.
No, no, no, stay, stay.
No, no, no.
The zombies and the pizza isn't really mixing.
You're right.
Let's go.
I only agreed to suture a toe lac
and now I've got three patients.
Well, those two are basically the same guy.
Just order the same stuff. Get Chen.
She has a bad head trauma.
I don't care. Get her.
I'm handing this off.
You know that guy might be famous one day.
You can say you helped save his life.
We're in the emergency department.
Ask for Dr. Finch.
It's extension 7614.
I'm trying to be gentle.
That hurts.
What happened to Peter?
Personal emergency.
This is Kevin.
Crushed against the stage at a Metallica concert.
Hello, Kevin.
Aren't you a little young for Metallica?
They didn't start yet.
It was the warm-up group.
We're trying to track down his parents.
Got the answering machine.
Any evidence of bleeding?
No. Liver and spleen are intact, but there's moderate
epigastric tenderness.
Could be an abdominal wall injury
small bowel perf, maybe a bruised pancreas.
Want to get a CT? And serial exams.
We'll see if anything
declares itself.
GIRL: Kevin? Oh, my God.
Kevin, I'm so sorry.
You let go of my hand.
I tried to hold on. I'm sorry.
Is he okay?
Who are you?
Marla. I'm his baby-sitter.
His parents let you take their son to rock concerts?
My boyfriend came over
with tickets. We were going to leave early.
He was going to be in bed by 11:00.
Do you have a cell phone number for them?
Yeah. Did you call it?
I wanted to find Kevin first.
You found him.
Draw up etomidate, sux and grab surgery.
Is that our last crush victim?
I don't know. I just got here, chief.
Multiple rib fractures.
He needs two chest tubes.
Try Curtain Three.
Get out of those gym clothes.
Chief, I just got here.
Come to work dressed properly.
Dr. Weaver?
Yosh, give me a hundred of Mannitol
in Exam Four right away.
Do you have a minute? No.
I figure you're probably not thrilled to see me.
I screwed up last night.
You know what? Whatever it is
I'm not interested in a private investigator.
Hey, Frank, still waiting on that head CT.
Just went down.
How long? Who knows?
Well, get radiology on the phone.
I found her.
There's a new database service
available for adopted children
looking for their birth parents.
I ran a couple of old clients through
and you hit.
I double checked this time.
It's your mother.
Anyway, if you're interested, it's $400.
My new cell is on there.
Hi, Doc.
Hey, still here?
He never leaves.
You do?
Only because you take so long to move.
You know them?
We met at lunch.
Is the smoke going to bother you?
No, I'm fine.
Hi, Luka.
Hey.
Delirium Tremens, right? Yeah.
Abby?
Diet Coke and a couple of menus, please?
We stop serving at 10:00.
It's like 10:02.
I'm sorry.
I'm starving.
Do you have any appetizers or anything?
He might not have thrown out the soup.
What is it?
Like a potato cream.
Sure, that's fine.
All right.
Thanks.
You're welcome.
Anyone here you don't know?
You want me to put him on line for a unit bed?
No, he'll be extubated by the time that he gets one.
( knock at door )
Who is that? His girlfriend, I think.
GIRL: All right, I'm going to find out
what's going on, everything's cool. Yeah, okay.
Look, he'll be okay, right? Can you just tell them
John's running a little bit late? Relax, be mellow.
They should go ahead, start without me.
I'll meet them for dessert.
He's all good, okay? Thanks, 'bye.
Tell her he's all good. He's all good.
I saw him stop breathing.
Yeah, we're helping him breathe now.
Well, you don't just stop breathing.
It's probably a mixed overdose of alcohol and GHB.
He should wake up on his own in a couple of hours.
Are those bloodstains?
No. Are you okay?
Yeah, my asthma just gets worse when I get stressed out.
They look like bloodstains. I need that back.
I'll give it back to you. Take a seat.
Give me a good, deep breath through your mouth.
If those are bloodstains...
They're not bloodstains.
There's a body up there.
Can you be quiet?
( hyperventilating )
Do you have a history of heart murmur?
No, just asthma.
You on something?
Just a little acid.
I'm not talking to you.
No, I don't do drugs. Not anymore.
Any fever, chills?
Is something wrong?
Hey, don't touch that.
Haleh, find an open room.
Have somebody work her up for endocarditis.
Someone? As in you?
Excuse me, I'm Dr. Peter Benton.
My son is here. He's a patient.
The cops just brought me here.
No, three waiting for med surg. What's the name?
Reese Benton. He's four years old, he's deaf.
Right, have a seat, please.
Okay, yeah, I'm holding here, yeah.
What's the name?
Reese, what happened?
Were you in a car?
Did you hurt your head?
( whispers ): Let's see, let me see.
Can I help you?
Yeah, I'm his father. Did he lose consciousness?
You have to keep that covered. Was he in his car seat?
You have to talk to the doctor. Where's his mother?
I'll get the doctor.
I know you're busy. Tell me where she is.
Dr. Benton? Julia Scoft.
So, the police found you?
Yeah.
One of the nurses thought that there was
a Benton at County with a deaf son.
Um, what happened?
A single MVA.
Where's Carla?
Can he understand me?
Was Carla or Roger driving?
Your wife swerved to avoid hitting... She's not my wife.
Oh, she isn't?
No, no, no, we have shared custody.
Well, does she have a husband or a close relative?
Why, what's her status?
I really need to speak to a relative.
How many people died here today?
I don't know.
You're afraid to tell me.
( chuckling ): I honestly don't know.
This place is full of dead people.
Been to the dentist recently, had any teeth pulled?
No, why?
Any infections?
My piercing's been bothering me.
Oh, it's so dope.
Your piercing? Where is that?
Show him.
No.
Melody. Harmony.
Harmony, I think that you might have bacteria
in your bloodstream that's infecting your heart.
It's important that we locate the source
so we can treat it.
( sighs )
Oh. Did you do that yourself?
( sighs )
No, my friend, Fiona.
How long has it been like that?
Three months.
She said it would take time for the swelling to go down.
Definitely infected
and I'm going to have to drain it.
No. Don't drain her.
Don't let them drain you, Harmony.
Dianna, you're peaking. No!
Dianna!
Dianna!
Dianna!
Oh.
Dianna, are you okay?
( groans )
I'll make a new chart.
So, what made you become a nurse?
I can't remember.
Ever seen anything like this?
How long has it been like that?
Two, three years.
You should really get that looked at.
So, look!
Uh, by a doctor.
You should ask Luka, he's good with pus.
Cigarette?
No.
Thanks.
You're sure?
Yeah, I'm trying to quit.
You want to meet for breakfast tomorrow?
We could do it early.
Hey, guys, what about my toe? I was first.
All right, well, next time
you're back in town then.
I'm sorry, Dad.
I'm sorry too, Dad. I'm so sorry.
How long do you have to fix it before it falls off?
Hey, Dave, I need you.
Suture that guy's toe, he's already blocked.
I can't help you, Carter.
I've got a chest pain rolling up.
Where the hell is Chen?
Somebody go get me Chen.
Are you talking to me?
Yes, actually, can you go find her for me, please?
Dr. Carter, Pelar's finally going up.
Who?
The kidney stone, to Urology.
Good for Urology.
Well, Abby says she gave him GENT, but it wasn't charted.
So, should I give him a dose?
Not if she gave him one.
Then what do I do?
Call her.
And if she's not at home?
Call her cell.
You have the number?
You know what?
I need to yell at her anyway.
Hello?
Having fun?
Carter?
Are you out having a good time?
No, not exactly.
What are you doing?
I am setting a wrist on an LSDiva.
You're working?
Someone talked me into coming back
into the E.R. and begging Weaver
and I got sucked back into the E.R. vortex.
I didn't tell you to talk to her tonight.
Huh, did you give GENT to the kidney stone in four?
No.
Malik said you did.
No, that was the gall bladder guy.
I thought you had an early shift tomorrow.
I do. Luka dragged me to this bar.
So much for quitting.
Oh, hey.
What?
Who's that?
It's Carter.
Is that Luka?
Can you hang on a second?
What?
The cigarettes...
I'm going to Doc Magoo's for a minute.
Page me if you need me. Things aren't dying down.
I've got five patients. I'm not even on.
Okay, then sign out and go home.
I got to go.
No need to hang up for me.
It was about a patient. Are you ready to go?
If you want.
Yeah, Luka, I want.
Fine.
What, now you're mad?
Finish your cigarette. I'll pay the bill.
( train bell clanging )
Excuse me.
I'm looking for Carla McGrath.
Thanks.
Roger.
I'm sorry, man.
Is that her?
Yeah.
Do I go in or what?
The doctor will be right back.
What's he going to tell me?
You should just wait.
Peter, come on.
What's he going to tell me?
She came in without a blood pressure.
They worked on her for over an hour
but she had massive internal bleeding.
It was too severe to repair.
Was she awake?
No, she was... there was
a faint pulse in the field
but, uh, she was pretty much gone on impact.
We were supposed to go to Wisconsin this weekend
but I had to work last minute.
Are you sure Reese is okay?
Yeah, yeah, he cut his head, but...
Mr. McGrath? Yeah.
Dr. Scoft. I was the treating physician.
I'm here if you have any questions.
Well, can I see her?
Of course.
I'll be out here if you need me.
We had to trim a little hair.
The doctor will be with you shortly.
Mom?
Reese...
Mom?
Mommy went away.
She's gone.
Mommy was hurt
very badly.
Mom.
I can't.
She was...
Ma.
She was bleeding. The doctor...
Mommy went bye-bye.
Mom.
She went to be with God.
( moans )
I can't.
She's sleeping.
She's sleeping forever.
Mom.
I can't.
She won't wake up.
Look, no...
Sometimes people can't wake up.
Mom.
Reese, Reese.
Mommy died.
Mommy's dead.
( moans )
No response to Narcan. BP's 108/76, pulse 110.
Kind of young for chest pain, huh?
He complained about it all day.
Thought it was the meatball sandwich he had for lunch.
On my count, one, two, three.
Any history of early heart disease in your family?
Our grandmother had diabetes.
CBC, chem panel
12 lead, and a portable chest.
What's his name? Paul.
Paul, can you hear me? Pulse ox
to 98.
All right, well, no evidence of trauma.
He just collapsed, huh?
Yeah, he's been pushing himself pretty hard.
His first solo show opens Monday
I haven't seen him sleep the whole week.
Does your brother do drugs?
No, I don't think so.
Are you sure?
This is the first time
I've seen him
since he moved to Chicago.
Let's get a tox screen.
Here's your EKG.
I mean, I don't think he would.
He's an artist
but that doesn't mean...
ST elevations off the charts.
He's having a major MI.
What? Heart attack.
He's 27. It happens with stimulants--
cocaine can constrict the arteries.
Oh, god. 40 of tenecteplase, got to bust the clot.
I need an attendant or chief resident to order thrombolytics.
Come on, time is heart muscle, let's go.
I'll pull it, but you need to run this by Chen or Weaver.
Well, get one of them!
Shooting.
Pressure's dropping to 70/30.
Pulse is 130.
Bolus 500 of saline. Halstead clamp.
Heard you had bleeders popping up like prairie dogs in here.
Pediatric pancreatic transection.
Splenic vessels won't separate.
How old? Seven.
You're not taking the spleen?
Not if I don't have to. 4-0 vicryl.
How much blood loss?
Over a liter.
Dr. Corday? What?
Back in at 140.
Oh, must have torn the splenic vein--
Side biting clamp.
Dr. Corday.
What?
You're leaking.
Damn.
Is that breast milk?
I should have pumped.
Is it sterile?
No, you're contaminated. Scrub out, Elizabeth.
Fresh gown, fresh gloves.
It'll just leak again-- go pump.
Hang another unit of packed cells.
Now!
Okay!
CARTER: What the hell
does the guy want, a suite at the Ritz?
MARQUEZ: I don't know, his manager freaked out
when I said we had to move him.
Excuse me.
I thought this guy wasn't even famous yet.
It's not about fame, jerk-off.
Hey, Jim, can we clear this whole area here?
Hey, so, what should we do?
Find an open telemetry bed.
You gave the last one to his friend.
All right, any open exam room.
Okay.
Fascist. Geek. Goof.
What?
Okay, where were we?
Dude, does it always take this long to fix a toe?
When your buddies come in OD'd, yeah.
Hey, that's not my fault.
Are you saying it's mine?
I'm just saying
you guys need more doctors or something.
Dr. Carter, this is Vincent Newberry's mom.
Who?
The OD you sent to telemetry.
You don't remember his name?
I see a lot of patients.
He almost died. And I saved him.
What's my name?! Do you even know my name?!
Hi, Mrs. Newberry. I'm...
What kind of doctor are you?!
Why don't we take a little step over here?
I'm still here!
I'm Dr. Carter, I treated your son.
I heard he stopped breathing.
down his throat
and a machine's been breathing for him
for the past few hours.
Is he in a coma?
Not exactly, no. He should wake up soon.
It's that "Liquid-G" junk
isn't it?
Along with alcohol, yes.
I told him to stay away from that stuff.
It can be dangerous.
Where is he?
Your-your nose.
What?
Your nose is bleeding.
Oh, damn, not again.
Take a seat right here.
Give it a good pinch.
You know, every time I-I get worried
it gushes like a fountain.
GLENN: Shouldn't I be there, I mean, if he's having a heart attack?
JARVIK: You have to give the doctor room to work.
Nitro's going at ten mikes.
Titrate to a systolic of 100.
Do you need help, Dave?
A 27-year-old with acute MI, I'm thinking cocaine.
We're ready to push TNK.
Ah-- hold on, did you get a tox screen?
I sent one, but he's killing off myocardial cells
while we wait.
Any recent surgery?
No.
Bleeding disorder?
Clotting well at the blood draw sites, x-rays clear.
Dr. Chen? Huh?
pCO 2 on your subdural's up to 30.
Oh, okay, uh...
Increase the AC to 16 and drop him to 80%.
So, what about the cath lab?
It's the middle of the night--
takes them two hours to get in.
Uh... where's Weaver?
I can't find her.
Did you page her?
Yeah.
You want to wait for him to arrest?
Okay, do it.
How about Reopro?
Only if cardiology takes him for stenting.
He won't need it if we lyse the thrombus.
JARVIK: Got the tox screen.
Ah.
Cocaine, right?
Negative for cocaine
negative for amphetamine.
Or, he could have just taken them
and haven't had time to show up in his urine.
Did you do a lipid panel?
No, but we could add it on.
( alarms beeping )
We've got V-tach.
Charge the paddles!
Damn it, no pulse. Starting compressions.
Charge to 200, push an amp of epi.
It's too early for reperfusion arrythmia.
Get ready to intubate. Clear.
Still V-tach.
Charge to 300. Page Weaver again.
Clear.
I'm taking a cab.
Where did you go?
I was waiting for you outside.
Well, I-I thought you were coming back in, I...
( both chuckling )
Bye-bye.
Sorry, that guy's father
got diagnosed with prostate cancer last month.
He was asking about treatment options.
You can go in and talk to him, I'm fine.
It's okay, he's calling tomorrow.
Okay, I'm fine.
Luka, you forgot your credit card. Oh... thanks.
The last two were on the house.
Oh, no, how much?
Our treat.
We want to make sure you're going to come back.
Then, here. For you.
Thank you. Good night.
Night.
Nice meeting you.
Yeah.
Could you be a little bit more rude?
Could you be a little bit more friendly?
I'm glad one of us is.
Go back inside, cure cancer for the UN.
Where are you going?
I'm taking the El.
Still V-fib.
A hundred of Lidocaine, charge again to 360.
Good breath sounds. There you are.
Clear!
I am not staying, I'm going to pack this woman's nose
and then you are going to take the rest of these misfits.
You sure there wasn't GI bleeding?
Stool was quiet, negative, no contraindications.
Clear.
What happened?
Fatal MI
probably drug related. You sure?
He looks Marfanoid.
What? Clear!
Marfan Syndrome-- tall stature, pectus excavatum, loose joints.
I thought you got a history.
Yeah, I did-- the brother didn't say anything.
He might not know.
They have weak connective tissue
in the aorta. You better keep going.
He's dissecting.
Find the aorta, you might get a rhythm.
We gave tenecteplase.
What?
He had ST elevation.
You gave thrombolytics to an aortic dissection?!
We didn't know it was a dissection!
You flooded his aorta, he's bleeding into his chest.
Thoracotomy tray. No, he'll bleed out
all over the floor.
CARTER: Uh, O-neg, cryo and FFP.
We can do a chest tube to confirm the humor thorax
and start a central line.
Okay, let's go, prep the chest!
LUKA: I was trying to have fun.
Is that a crime?
LOCKHART: No, go have fun.
I can be left waiting in the street by myself--
I can certainly walk home by myself.
Why do you have to make
such a big problem out of everything
like you have an insect in your anus?
Okay, it's "Bug up my ass," Luka, bug... up my ass.
If you're going to insult me
you could at least get the words right.
Fine, how's this? Stop being such a bitch.
Okay, fine. As soon as you grow up.
Right, you're so mature.
Abby, you don't even know what you want.
Yes, I do. I want to go home.
You play games like a school girl who can have any boy
and treats them all like crap.
Luka, why don't you just call me a whore
and get it over with?
I'm tired of it.
You're not that pretty, you're not that special.
I'm pretty enough in the dark, though
aren't I?
You're never happy, I don't think
you're capable of being happy... "Happy"? Happy?
Six months ago you didn't care whether I was happy.
If you're not depressed or ashamed, you're just angry.
And you're married to a ghost.
At least I treat you with respect.
Oh, I know; you're a saint, Luka.
All right, hook up the thoraseal.
I can't thread the guide wire.
Just rotate the bevel 90 degrees.
Damn it.
Uh! No good.
Looks like his entire blood volume.
How much O-neg do we have?
Third and fourth unit are up.
Get another four, we need that FFP.
Where the hell is Weaver?!
We've been paging her for 15 minutes.
Doc Magoo's. What?
She said something about going to Doc Magoo's.
ABBY: Right, I know.
You're always so good, and I'm so bad...
I'm sick of being patient.
I'm such a mess and you're so understanding...
I put up with a lot, Abby.
Oh, and I'm a burden.
Carter, your mother, your moods.
Why don't you just break up with me?
I think you want me to!
If I'm such a horrible person
how could you possibly want to be with me?
I don't know how to be with you.
I don't know how to help you, I...
I don't want help.
I don't want help.
I don't want to be pitied, I don't want to be saved.
Okay, okay.
Okay.
I give up. Okay.
What does that mean?
What does that mean, what does that mean?
Why don't you just... I'm done!
I'm done, okay?! Carter can have you!
Okay.
Okay, the catheter is passing.
Any pulse with compressions?
A weak one.
Got the plasma.
Yes, run it in here.
Are we cracking him or not?
He can't clot, he'll exsanguinate.
He already has.
Could you please get Weaver, John?
Haleh, could you page her again?
If we're going to try this, we got to do it now.
I am not opening his chest without Weaver.
Could you get her? Now?
Okay, go ahead, prep. 4-0 silk.
We can't wait.
Wait.
Slow down, Doogie! He's got a tube in his throat!
MARQUEZ: You were going to draw a blood gas.
Wait another hour.
Hey! Hey, we need a private room!
( groaning )
( sighing )
Dr. Weaver?
Wait, where are you?
Chest tube output is four liters.
Ruptured aortic dissection.
We gave 40 of tenecteplase.
Put the scalpel down.
He's had cryoprecipitate and four units of FFP.
No. He might clot.
He'll keep lysing the thrombin.
Got to open the chest, fix the defect.
It's a proximal lesion, can't cross-clamp it.
Can we try anything else?
Stop compressions.
You killed him.
Almost done, okay?
One more.
Yeah. One more.
Hey, you okay, Reese?
The doctor...
will make it better, right?
Right.
I know... Mom's gone.
Finished. I'll have the nurse dress it
and then you're free to go.
BENTON: All right, thanks.
I can remove the suture, right?
In seven days.
Listen, they're transferring her to the morgue till morning.
I've got to find a funeral home.
Did you call her parents?
Yeah, they're on their way.
Listen, uh, Roger, tell them that, um...
It's cool, it's cool.
Can you, uh, can you take him tonight?
I'm going to have to stay.
Yeah, I was going to anyway.
Right, right. Thanks.
Reese, you have to go with your father tonight.
Okay?
But I'll see you tomorrow
or the next day, okay?
I love you, too.
You don't know what Marfan's looks like?
He's an artist.
His brother said he was up all week.
I was thinking cocaine.
Did you check the blood pressures in both arms?
I-I don't think...
Did you or didn't you?
No.
You didn't recognize the widened meidastinum?
Uh, not until after he arrested.
Apical capping, tracheal shift to the right--
it's classic for a dissection.
I was told that it was clear.
I meant no hemothorax.
Wait, wait a minute.
You didn't look at the X-ray
before you signed off on thrombolytics?
Jing-Mei.
( sighs )
Jing-Mei?
Uh...
No, I should have.
Yeah, you should have.
You didn't answer your page.
We had to make a quick decision.
You know what? That's your job!
You make quick decisions
based on the information available.
You had the right information; you didn't bother to look at it.
And you've never made a bad call?
Not as stupid and lethal
as this one.
Then show up and make it yourself.
We paged you three times.
In a perfect world, Dr. Malucci
I wouldn't subject any patients to your care.
If you knew your ass from your elbow
or even gave a damn.... I do give a damn.
I do give a damn.
...this man might still be alive!
Look, he dissected into his coronaries.
He'd probably never even survive surgery anyway.
Well, we'll never know that, will we?
The rest of the family should be screened.
I'm going to go talk to the brother.
Wait, Dave
I'll do it.
WEAVER: No, I will.
No one talks to anyone about this case.
Is that clear?
Is that clear?
Yes.
Ice that back, Carter.
( baby crying )
Get up and help me.
Mark!
What?
Get up and help me!
There's poop all over the bassinet;
it's running down her legs.
What?
You didn't tighten the bloody diaper!
God, what time is it?
Now!
Okay, okay, okay.
You know, I heard her crying from downstairs.
Oh, sorry.
I told you to double up.
I thought I did.
Look at this!
Calm down, it's not fatal.
Yeah, okay.
You take her; I'll run her bath.
You know what?
Why don't you just go back to bed
and I'll take care of her.
No. No, you don't make me the bitch
just because you can't follow simple instructions.
I was just offering to take care of it.
Yeah, a splendid job you've done so far.
Fine. You take care of it.
I've got a shift in three hours.
Oh, and what do you think I'll be doing in three hours?
I'm the feeding trough, remember?
Elizabeth, if I could breast-feed, I would.
Oh, great, great.
You take it.
Take it all.
The sore nipples, the rashes, the hemorrhoids
the leaking in your trauma gown
the public humiliation, the sleep deprivation
the incontinence, for goodness sake--
you take it, it's all yours!
( crying continuing )
( snoring )
There you go.
Watch out for that volcano next time.
Hey, Malik, can you dress that toe
and fit him for a cast shoe?
Sorry, I'm off.
Can I help you?
Uh, did anyone turn in a pager?
No, I don't think so.
Carter, I saw your lady with the nosebleed.
Scheduling her for a septoplasty next week.
She had a defect?
Yeah, that you could drive a truck through.
I guess two grams of coke a day will do that.
Nap note?
Yeah, I was supposed to be off last night.
Well, you're not in surgery.
Don't punish yourself. Go home.
No, I'm on at noon.
I'm just going to go pass out.
Bad idea.
You know what they say:
The longer you stay, the longer you stay.
Hey, Connie, I need you to dress a toe for me
in Curtain Two.
After my break.
Yeah, whenever.
Hey... Reese, what's wrong?
Bad dreams?
You want to sleep here?
Come on.
Okay, it's okay.
