ANNOUNCER: Previously on E.R.
She's pregnant. Who?
Nicole.
Oh, yeah, yeah, my stuff just leapt into her bag.
Nicole?
You know, I used to have a crush on you.
I had a crush on you, too.
I'm glad you came back.
Me, too.
( crying )
Get in!
No, I'm good!
No, you're not!
Go on, get out of here.
Come on.
What was that about?
I'm being subpoenaed.
For what case?
Reese-- Roger's suing for custody.
JACKIE: He drew this?
Yesterday afternoon.
He's got talent, don't you think?
Hey, Jackie.
Hey.
Thanks for dropping him off.
No problem.
Hey.
I missed you last night.
Me, too.
I know
I had to work late.
No, no, no, I can't play.
I'm going to come back and put you to sleep.
Yeah.
Yeah?
Dr. Benton, Romano wants you to assist
on a post-op colectomy.
I'm off at 8:00.
It's 7:55.
Call Edson.
Oh, damn it.
JACKIE: What is it?
( sighs ): It's the E.R.
I thought of something.
Remember how Carla wanted Reese
to be with you on Father's Day?
It says a lot. The judge should know.
That's good, yeah.
We'll be okay, right?
Yeah, it's his first day.
Maybe I should be there to help.
Jackie, you are helping.
GREENE: Rachel Greene--
I need a copy of her attendance records.
You could have told me.
I didn't know.
Okay, I'll hold. Who's allergic to lilies?
She may not have appreciated the symbolism.
Symbolism?
Lilies are for funerals.
Oh, God, I'm sorry.
I just wanted to send her some flowers.
You got his grandmother flowers?
I can't seem to get in her good graces.
How's her leg, anyway?
I think she's still more concerned
with the girl she hit.
I already met with the Vice Principal.
I thought that girl was better.
Yeah, she's on her upswing.
About to have a much bigger bank account.
She settled?
Very good offer.
Good, so you can fax it to me?
Who's paging me?
They need you in Room Two.
Where's Corday? Upstairs.
Isn't she on for trauma?
We just got here.
I thought she was out on leave.
She's been cleared to operate.
What about all the dead geezers?
You know, there's no evidence of any wrongdoing.
Good news.
( under breath ): When the paramedics roll me in, I'll take Romano.
Entrance left temple, no exit.
What type of gun?
Cops said a .32 at close range.
Pupils are five millimeters and fixed.
Who shot her?
Does it matter?
Got caught in a gas station holdup.
Absent blink reflex.
Probable brain stem damage.
All right, did we push mannitol?
Peter, I'm still assessing her.
What the hell are you waiting for?
We're checking for signs... Let's push the mannitol
load Dilantin and hyperventilate.
I was taking Gallant through the neuro exam...
Why don't you treat the patient first?
ABG, gram of Ancef and a head CT.
What's the GCS? Elizabeth
it's 8:20.
Sorry, I had to change.
Let's call Neurosurg if there's something fixable on CT.
What's the rush? I have to be somewhere.
MARQEZ: Heart rate's dropped to 50.
Push an amp of atropine.
Is there a problem, Peter?
Yeah, you're late
and I have to get the hell out of here.
What's the Caloric reflex? Slow deviation to the stimulus.
And then?
Uh...
Saccadic return to the midline.
Date of birth, 9/12/73.
Dr. Benton ever in a good mood?
He has his moments.
Go ahead.
No response.
Looks like she's a donor.
( sighs ): I'll be right back.
KOVAC: Is there
any other family we can call for you?
( choked up ): Her parents live in Minnesota.
We were going to drive there today.
This is Dr. Corday.
I'm so sorry, Mr. Pruitt.
Are you going to operate?
The bullet passed through the brain stem.
I'm afraid no surgery
can repair that.
Well...
Is there any chance that she'll s-survive?
She's no longer breathing on her own.
We have to wait and see
if she regains consciousness.
But it's highly
unlikely.
The medical exam is consistent with brain death.
I was still asleep when she left.
I know this is a difficult time, but we found a donor card.
A what?
Your wife wanted to be an organ donor.
Oh, yeah, I-I guess that's what she wanted to...
Can I go see her?
Yeah, sure.
Elizabeth, we need you in here.
ZADRO: Started an 18 gage
in the left AC.
Rudy Escalona, 15 years old, LOC.
from blunt head trauma-- one, two, three.
ZADRO: Boxing league.
He took a lot of punches during practice.
Any medical problems, Rudy?
Huh?
No-- my son's in good shape.
Do you know where you are?
I hit him, man.
I hit him good.
Pulse ox is 98 on two liters.
Pupils equal and reactive.
Do you know what year it is?
Nobody thought I could do it...
Answer the doctor.
...but I did it.
Squeeze my hand, Rudy.
Haleh?
He's not responding.
We need to get some information from you, sir.
Airway's okay. Still has gag.
No, I'll stay.
Uh, after
the X-rays, you can come back.
Abdomen soft, no guarding or rebounds.
How late are you on?
Peter should be back by 6:00.
I'm on till 10:00. Can you check Rachel's homework?
Sure... lateral C-spine and a head CT.
She needs help with her trinomials.
Normal Babinski.
I believe I failed Algebra.
It's either that or the Revolutionary War.
I'll stick with math.
Why can't you talk to Human Resources?
It won't change the outcome.
Nicole's had a tough time.
She deserves a second chance.
Is that your objective opinion?
Okay, she made a mistake
but I know it won't happen again.
Look, Luka, the hospital has a zero-tolerance policy
against stealing.
But, if you explain the circumstances
they might reconsider...
There is nothing to explain.
Kerry, just do it as favor to me.
I'm sorry, I can't.
Or you won't? Please, I got her the job.
You should have screened her first.
Carter, what is this abscess still doing in Exam Four?
It's peri-rectal.
Yeah, it definitely needs surgery.
So, you're on this too, Susan?
Carter wanted a second opinion.
No. Call surgery, we're busy.
One doctor per patient.
Have fun suturing.
Have fun with your rectum.
When was your last tetanus shot?
Uh, you better ask my Dad. I...
Jorge, this is Dr. Lewis.
Hi. How's his exam?
Uh, two centimeter lac on the labial mucosa
I'd suggest an interrupted four-oh vicryl.
How'd you get hurt?
Ow.
He was boxing.
And the other guy?
You tell me.
The patient in Trauma One?
Jorge's little brother, Rudy.
Yeah, he got in a good one.
I kind of lost it
but I didn't mean to hurt him-- not bad.
There you are.
How's Rudy?
They say he's going to wake up.
He's going to be all right. You okay?
He needs a couple of stitches.
Does it hurt?
No.
This is one tough kid.
Be careful of your reaction to the testimony.
No sighing, no faces.
What if I need to ask you a question?
Write it down, I'll answer.
Schedule change, they switched judges on us.
Who did we draft? Alter.
Is that good or bad?
Well, he always favors the mother.
It's not a problem in this case.
It wouldn't hurt to show your maternal side.
Right.
Is that the tie you're wearing?
Mm, what's wrong with it?
Well, it's a little showy, don't you think?
And when it comes your turn
don't get too emotional.
You don't want to come across
as cold or unfeeling, either.
You make it sound like it's some kind of performance.
Well, it is.
That is the whitest tie I've ever seen.
It's blue.
She's breaking out in hives, like an allergic reaction.
To what? I don't know.
Nobody's figured it out.
We've been to three ERs this week.
50 of Benadryl in the field.
Push 125 of Solumedrol...
We've found guided imagery helps.
Close your eyes, honey.
Who's your doctor?
Oh, he's in Syracuse.
We're on our honeymoon.
Oh, better hide the good silver.
What's she doing here?
Meeting with personnel.
I heard she's getting fired.
Let our souls intermingle...
Uh, any new soaps or pesticides?
Everything's the same.
What do you mean? What about latex?
Yeah, some people
are allergic to rubber gloves
tennis shoes, condoms...
Condoms? We stopped using them.
CARTER: When? A couple weeks ago.
We're trying to get pregnant.
Everything's all right.
Feel the warmth of the sun. Just embrace the joy...
Rudy's vital signs and oxygen level are good.
Is he awake now?
Not quite yet, but he might be able to hear you.
Go ahead.
Thanks.
Even before I married Carla, we discussed it.
I knew it would be a challenge
but we agreed that our first priority
would always be Reese.
You took a variety of steps
to be a good parent to him, didn't you?
I learned to sign, I...
I've always been in contact with his teachers.
I've been volunteering at his school ever since he started.
And you're self-employed?
I run a Web site company out of my home office.
What kind of hours
do you have?
Completely flexible. I make my own work schedule.
Have you ever needed to hire a baby-sitter for Reese?
No.
Ever needed to have someone else
pick him up from school? No.
So you've never passed
Reese's care-giving on to anyone else?
Never wanted to.
But Dr. Benton often requires help, doesn't he?
Objection. Outside his scope.
Mr. McGrath has direct knowledge.
He can testify to what he's observed.
Overruled.
Peter has a long list of people who pick Reese up from school.
His girlfriend, his sister
his niece-- they're all involved
in looking after him.
And even Dr. Benton himself has asked you
to help him out, hasn't he?
Yeah.
He asked me to get Reese.
But I don't mind.
I want to be with him.
Did Reese
ever mention to you
where he prefers to sleep?
Your house or Dr. Benton's?
He likes my place.
Why is that?
He says it's his home.
CORDAY: Once the procurement teams
arrive, we'll move her to the O.R.
And she'll be on a ventilator?
Yes.
So her heart will keep beating.
So she'll be alive when you remove her organs.
Mr. Pruitt, your wife's brain is not functioning
at its most basic level.
There is no medical distinction
between brain death and cardiac death.
You said that the machines
are keeping her alive.
Not exactly.
They're merely keeping her organs viable.
Can't you just let her die naturally?
To get healthy organs
we procure while the heart's still beating
and there's oxygen in the bloodstream.
I don't know. I don't know.
We never talked about this.
Look, I know she filled out the card and everything, but...
I understand.
I'm not so sure that I can do this.
Why don't you take some time with her?
I'll come back and we'll talk some more.
Dr. Corday, pre-op's ready.
We're going to wait a bit.
Abby, I need morphine now for a perilunate dislocation.
How much?
Uh, get 20 just to be safe.
What's the patient's name?
Bovard.
I saw Nicole. They let her go?
I'm sure she'll find another job.
It's not important.
She might want to take it easy now
with the baby coming.
She's keeping it?
You thought she wouldn't?
Uh, I don't know, it's-it's tough being a single mother.
Maybe she won't be.
Um, I'll need some Versed, too.
You can't be serious.
She's a good person.
You met her, like, five minutes ago.
It's the right thing to do.
Did she ever take a pregnancy test?
Of course.
Did you see it?
I mean, in front of you?
I trust her. And what, exactly, has she done
to deserve that?
How can you be so... Even if it
is yours, there's other ways to help.
How much Versed?
I'll do it. No, I'll do it...
I said I'll do it.
There was some bleeding deep inside Rudy's brain.
How bad is it?
The problem's usually a weak arterial wall.
If we can prevent any further hemorrhage
he should be okay.
He's always begging
to get in the ring with his brother.
I shouldn't have let him do it.
This isn't from boxing.
It's a pre-existing condition.
What do you have to do?
The neural radiologist can use a catheter
to mend the artery from within.
And then he'll be okay?
He should be.
Look, you didn't cause this, okay?
It could have happened at any time.
It happened when I hit him.
Susan, you have Curtain Two-- a woman with hives.
No, I've got the thyrotoxicosis.
That's mine.
Is she ready for dispo?
No, I'm still working her up.
Have either one of you guys
ever heard of an allergy to semen?
Maybe an aversion, but not an allergy.
There's hundreds of proteins that are potential antigens.
Is that your best diagnosis?
It's a possibility.
You must be desperate.
This is Sean Gatley.
My foot's stuck.
You doing okay, buddy?
Dad wouldn't let us break the thing.
The toilet?
It's a personal hygiene system.
Oh, you're out of your mind.
Hey, Dr. Weaver, right?
Sandy Lopez.
Right.
Good job last week.
I hear the lady and the baby are doing okay.
Yeah. Hey, Abby, I got this.
Okay.
Do you need something?
I was looking for Luka.
He's with a patient.
Oh.
Do you want a cup of coffee?
So, based on your extensive observation
of Dr. Benton and Reese
how would you summarize their relationship?
Peter's completely devoted to Reese.
He's always focused on what's best for him.
I can't imagine anyone being a better father.
Thank you.
Are you and Dr. Benton married?
No.
Living together?
We've discussed it.
How long have you been a couple?
Almost three years.
So, you didn't break up in June?
It wasn't exactly a break-up...
And get back together two weeks ago?
Are you tracking my love life?
Objection. Argumentative.
Sustained.
Let me ask
do you consider yourself a stable factor in Reese's life?
I do.
How can we be sure you won't break up again
next week, or next month, or next year?
Objection. Calls for prophecy.
Goes to the stability of the home.
Point taken, but you can answer.
It's my intention to be around Peter and Reese for a long time.
You occasionally baby-sit for Reese, don't you?
Quite often.
We get along well.
There was an incident with a piano.
Could you explain?
Reese hurt himself.
Under your care.
It wasn't my...
So, that's the supervision
Dr. Benton entrusts
his son to. Objection.
I looked away for two seconds.
When he's the one who should have
been looking after him.
Are you going to ask a question?
Counselors, let's all breathe.
15 minute recess.
Is that decaf?
No.
Oh. I shouldn't have caffeine.
Oh, right, I forgot.
Luka told you?
Have you had a pre-natal exam yet?
Not yet.
I used to work in O.B.
I could do an ultrasound.
That's nice of you, but I'll take care of it.
How do you know you're pregnant?
Thanks for the coffee.
This is not the way to get Luka.
What are you talking about?
The truth.
What happened to your father?
I told you-- he killed himself when I was little.
And then miraculously came back to life again
so he could kick you out when you were 16?
Is this funny to you?
No. I'm just trying to figure it out.
You haven't told anyone the same story twice.
My mother remarried
and my stepfather didn't want me around.
Okay, I guess you have an answer for everything.
I guess everything's your business.
I just don't want to see him hurt.
Maybe you don't want to see him happy.
I know what won't make him happy.
A made-up life.
I, you know, if, if this
if this is all for real, that's great-- go for it.
But if it's not
he's going to figure it out.
He's not stupid.
You know, I never got a chance to thank you for the...
Saving your life?
( chuckling ): Uh, yeah, that.
Listen, no sweat.
It was a crazy night.
That's a pretty crazy job.
I haven't met too many female firefighters.
The only one in Company B.
Must be pretty challenging.
No, not really.
I'm just one of the guys.
Anyway, I'll see you around.
Did you get a wound check?
Hmm?
Your hand.
Oh. Uh... I don't like doctors.
You should let me take a look at it
before you go.
Maybe some other time.
What happened?
Rudy dropped his sats.
B.P.'s 230/120.
Pulse ox 78 on 15 liters.
He stopped breathing.
One of pavulon, 100 of sux.
What's going on?
Let's check the fundi.
There's increased pressure in your son's brain.
What are you going to do?
Well, we're going to help him breathe first.
Multifocal PVCs.
Dr. Greene?
Push another 100 of lidocaine.
Heart rate 58.
It's Rachel.
I can't talk right now.
Start nipride at 70 mikes.
You told her to check in.
Elizabeth will be home at 6:00.
I'm in.
Lily, another 60 of nimodipine.
I'll get it.
Looks like V Tach.
Oh, God.
No pulse.
Charge to 200, and start compressions. Go.
Have you ever tried a non-heartbeating protocol?
I observed one at Case Western.
They take the patient to the O.R.
turn off the vent
and wait for the heart to stop beating.
Meanwhile, lack of oxygen can ruin the organs.
You remove them after only two minutes of cardiac arrest.
They should still be viable
and she'll get a natural death.
She's dead either way.
This approach only compromises the success of the transplant.
It's the only approach the husband will consent to.
You know that for a fact?
You presented this to Mr. Pruitt?
NICOLE: Luka?
I suggested it as an option.
Without consulting me.
She's my patient, too.
You're not the one who needs approval
for an unconventional procedure
nor are you the one
going to have to do it.
Can you take a break?
Yeah.
Dr. Weaver, is there anyone in Exam Four?
The middle bed in there is free.
Uh, I don't want to tie up a monitor.
Hey, do I have to keep this in my arm?
Yeah. If I'm right, you might even need emergency meds.
What if someone comes in?
These doors lock from the inside.
Oh, my God.
Is that what I think it is?
Ah. Just give me one second.
Malik.
I thought this guy was going to the morgue.
I was just about to.
( no audio )
HALEH: We need epi in here.
MALIK: How many amps?
As much as you can carry.
Maybe this isn't such a good idea.
No, it'll be fine.
JARVIK: Charged to 360.
Clear.
GALLANT: Asystole.
How long has he been down?
45 minutes.
Resume compressions.
How much epi?
Push another four milligrams.
HALEH: How much longer are we going?
I'm going to bring him in.
You're calling it?
Not yet.
Rudy hasn't had a heartbeat in almost an hour.
How could this happen?
He had a massive hemorrhage.
No.
It damaged the part of his brain
that controls his heart and his breathing.
You said they could fix it.
There wasn't enough time.
Keep trying, please.
We've shocked him repeatedly.
We've used every drug.
Nothing is working.
Do you want to say good-bye before we stop?
You fought hard, Rudy.
You never gave up.
I'm proud of you.
We'll never forget you.
Shut up.
We love you, mijo.
( sobbing ): You'll always be in our hearts.
Shut up! Shut up!
Can you hear me?!
Shut, shut up!
( sobbing )
Shut up!
( frustrated yell )
( crying )
Just let us know when you want us to stop.
( crying continues )
I hope it snows.
I'd like to see the city covered in white.
Yeah, it's pretty.
Till your car won't start.
Maybe I can get a job shoveling sidewalks.
Might be good if you don't work for a while.
Take care of yourself.
The baby.
I need to work.
You don't need to worry about the rent.
I talked to my friend.
I think I found a job.
Wow, that was quick.
He's opening a cafe in Montreal.
He wants me to help run it.
I can't move to Montreal.
You've been very generous.
I'm thankful for everything.
So...
What are you saying? That's it?
You could leave like that?
Listen, my shift's over at 7:00.
Let's talk about this tonight.
I'll call you in a few days.
Are you angry with me?
No, of course not.
Do you think I'm angry with you?
I hope not.
Then why?
I-I thought we both felt the same.
You're a good person
but you talked yourself into loving me.
This isn't real.
I'll leave the key inside.
I made an OB appointment for Friday.
It's not necessary.
It is.
No, it's not.
I'm not pregnant.
I felt safe for the first time in a long time.
I didn't want to lose you
so I made it up, Luka.
I'm sorry.
I made it all up.
( rhythmic squeaking ) I think we need two layers.
You know how to bury the knot?
Take your first bite in the center deep...
and then come up sub-Q. ( pounding )
You hear something?
You're nuts.
I hear banging.
What's that noise?
Oh, I think they were working on the pipes or...
( moaning )
Oh, that don't sound like pipes.
You got this?
Yeah, yeah, I think so.
Who is in there?
My allergy patient.
The lady with hives?
And her husband.
Don't tell me you are tying up
a room so they can have sex.
I'm... conducting a clinical trial.
Send them to an allergist.
No, that'll take weeks.
They're young. They're aroused.
They want their answer now.
Does Weaver know you're running a brothel?
It's not a brothel if they're married.
Dr. Lewis, lab's back on Escalona.
I didn't order any labs.
Rudy? Kid who arrested.
Oh, I had the brother.
That's mine.
It wasn't your fault.
Sometimes things happen you can't explain.
Rudy's labs came back.
Did he ever take any stimulants?
I'd never let him do that.
There was ephedra in his bloodstream.
Ephedra?
It's a natural supplement.
It's in power formulas.
He drinks Beta-Morph sometimes.
From where? From the store.
He wanted to drink a six-pack before we sparred.
He said he wanted to dust me for once.
The ephedra probably raised
his blood pressure, causing one of the vessels
in his brain to rupture.
Why would he do it?
To enhance his performance.
He wanted to make you proud, Dad.
You knew about this?
He was never tough enough for you.
Why didn't you stop him?
You kept pushing him
and you never let up.
Calm down, guys. No, he was just a kid.
No, he wanted to be a champ.
Look, that's what you wanted.
It's over.
I'm through.
This is not the way to honor your brother.
It's my choice. It's not your choice.
You were born with a gift.
Look, come on, Jor-- No, here's your gift.
Here's your gift.
( sighs ): Man...
He's spinning everything his way.
We'll get it all back on your testimony.
Hey.
Hey, everything all right?
Yeah, I just couldn't sit at home
not knowing what was going on.
We're just getting started.
You testify yet?
No, Roger went first.
What'd he say?
That I was the world's greatest father.
Peter...
I asked him to help out with Reese a couple of times.
He made it seem like it happens all the time.
( sighs )
He lied.
It's his version of the truth.
Isn't that perjury?
Isn't there something you can do?
Jackie! Wait a minute.
Why were you lying? Jackie?
Leave us alone.
BENTON: Jackie, don't. Get away from me.
Wait a minute, stop it, and tell the truth.
Ma'am, step away.
BENTON: Jackie, this isn't helping, all right?
Get your own family.
He got us here. His choice.
Reese is our boy. Jackie...
He's our boy! Jackie...
( rhythmic squeaking and pounding )
( sighs and moans )
What are you doing?
Getting caught up on my charts.
You were listening. No.
You were, you were listening to them have sex.
I am not.
You usually chart at Admit or in the lounge.
I can chart wherever I want, and I don't need
to listen to your porno patients for kicks.
( squeaking and pounding stops )
They stopped.
See? You were listening.
She okay? Do you think we should check?
What's going on in there?
Ask Carter.
You broke your fifth metacarpal.
Damn.
Hey, that's what they call a boxer's fracture.
You're going to be in a cast
for about six weeks.
Good.
Dr. Greene? Teenager with
a ten-foot fall coming in.
Get Carter. Clear Trauma One.
Hey, you want me on that?
Numb him up first. Hematoma block.
Does my dad know?
Uh, not yet.
Can you tell him?
It would be better coming from you.
Listen, Jorge, uh...
everybody has a hard time talking to their father.
Yeah, well, it's different with him.
I mean, he's old school.
He grew up in Cuba.
When did he come over?
Before I was born.
( clears throat )
He was a great fighter.
When he tried to leave, they broke his hands.
Well, that's why he pushes you so hard.
Yeah.
I guess he just wants us to have what they took away from him.
You ever talk to him about this?
Well, maybe you should.
I'm sorry, honey.
Maybe you just need a little break.
Carter...
Well, you never used to have
a problem finishing.
That dead guy freaked me.
Well, you need to use condoms
until you can try again under medical supervision.
I never used to be allergic to sperm.
It's the semen, actually.
Oh, what would cause that?
Sometimes multiple sex partners...
Have you had more than ten?
Ten?
Let's go, honey.
I thought it was just me and Kenny Markowitz.
What else haven't you told me?
That's a very good job there. It's very diplomatic.
It was your diagnosis.
No, I bring people together, Susan.
Oh, yes, you and Cupid.
16-year-old male fell from a lamppost.
Carter. Uh-huh.
Good vitals. No LOC.
Obvious ankle fracture.
No meds, no allergies.
Okay, everybody, grab hold and on my count.
One, two and three.
Pulse ox 99 on two liters.
Got any pain here? No, I'm fine.
Turn your head towards me.
GREENE: You need help?
Yeah, could you Doppler the foot?
You got it.
Okay if I cuff him, Doc?
Yeah, do it on the right side.
Turn away from me. MARQUEZ: BP's 124 over 78.
Does it hurt? No.
Neck's clear. Let's get him off the board.
Bounding dorsalis pedis.
Go. What's he in custody for?
Kids were stealing street signs.
Anybody else hurt? No, girl's fine.
She's in the car with my partner.
Okay, we're going to sit you up now.
What's your name?
Andrew.
Don't I know you?
That your daughter?
She's not under arrest?
No, situations like this, we just like
to scare them a little bit.
Take them down to the station, call their parents.
They release her to me? I'll call the Sergeant.
Shouldn't be a problem. I'd appreciate that.
Got a phone I can use? Yeah.
WEAVER: I adjusted her meds.
Have the nurse call if she has any questions.
Hey. Lopez.
Still got time for a wound check?
Uh, I thought you had to leave AMA.
Oh, it wasn't bothering me
until I jammed it rolling some hose.
Still bleeding? I don't think so.
Come on, let's take a look.
Okay.
WHARTON: What happens when you're on call?
We work 12-hour shifts.
7:00 AM to 7:00 PM?
Half the time.
And the other half, you work overnight?
There's always a surgeon in-house.
So, you cover weekends, too?
Sometimes. Looking at your schedule
it appears that over half your shifts
are weekends or overnights.
Well, I'd have to check. Take me through
what happens when a gunshot victim enters the ER.
Well, I evaluate the patient
and I take them to the O.R., if necessary.
Gunshot to the chest.
How long of an operation is that?
Well, that depends.
On what?
The path of the bullet, extent of vascular damage
if bypass is necessary for cardiac repair.
So, it could take over an hour?
I'd say three hours was a reasonable estimate.
Sometimes longer? Five hours?
Sometimes.
So, if a patient comes in at 6:30 PM
who takes over for you at 7:00, when you go home to Reese?
Well, I try to get someone to cover for me.
And if you can't?
Then I stay with the patient.
If an operation takes five hours
you'll be there till midnight?
That's a rare situation.
But it happens?
It's possible.
So, when you're tied up in surgery all night
who's looking after Reese?
Well, I have the support of family and friends.
Like Dr. Finch, for example?
Yes.
Cleo is very good with Reese.
Yes, we've already covered that.
Who else helps you out?
My sister, Jackie, picks him up from school, if I have to work.
And makes him dinner? Sometimes.
And puts him to bed while you're working the night shift?
That's right.
Is she always available?
Jackie's become like a mother
to Reese these last few months.
But initially, after Carla died
Jackie wasn't so receptive to the idea
of caring for Reese, was she?
It was a tough time.
She has her own children, doesn't she?
Joanie, her daughter.
Wasn't there a boy?
Yeah, uh, Jesse, my nephew.
He died last year.
The death was gang-related, right?
Objection.
He can answer the question.
Yes.
How is your sister handling that loss?
You know, I'm sorry. I don't, uh...
I don't see how this pertains
to my fitness as a father.
PRAGER: Your Honor, this is
far afield. Goes to the stability
of the person he's identified
as primary caregiver.
I'll give some latitude.
Is Jackie under the care
of a psychiatrist...
I don't know. ...for situational depression
and pathologic grieving?
She lost her son. Is she currently being
managed by medication...
This has nothing to do with Reese
or my ability to care for him.
...whose side effects include
insomnia, sedation
and anxiety?
Gentlemen?
Why don't you ask me what kind of father I am?
Why don't you ask me about how I was there when he was born
prematurely, how I stayed in the hospital in the NICU
watching over him, making tough decisions
and praying over him day and night?
Why don't you ask me that?
Your Honor, a moment with my client.
Dr. Benton... Your Honor, there's
no question before the court.
No, why don't you ask me about Reese
so I can tell you that there's nothing more important
to me in this world than my son?
Why don't you ask me that?
You can't let that happen again.
They were provoking him.
You better get used to it, Peter.
I said what I had to say.
Well, I hope you feel better, 'cause it sure didn't help.
What did the judge say in chambers?
That he was impressed with Roger's availability.
Availability? I'm available to Reese.
We're going to have to make a better showing.
All right. I'll do better tomorrow.
That's not going to do it.
Your hours are hurting us.
He's a surgeon.
It goes with the job.
Do you want to keep your son?
What do you think?
That you need to start setting priorities
and making some hard choices.
That's what I think.
How well do you know Andrew?
What's that supposed to mean?
Does he do drugs?
I don't think so.
Are you sure?
What's this?
Results of his tox screen.
He tested positive for marijuana.
Aren't you supposed to keep that confidential?
Were you smoking with him?
No.
Have you ever smoked with him?
I wouldn't do that.
Good.
Then you'll test negative.
Are you serious?
You don't trust me?
I trusted you to go home after school.
Dad, he was going to drop me off
but then he wanted to stop.
We agreed no rides.
I missed the bus.
You should have called me.
I didn't want to bother you.
Sure didn't work out that way.
You want me to pee in a cup?
Yep.
Yes, a gram of Ceftazidime.
Michael, did the family choose a mortuary yet?
What? Rudy Escalona.
We need to get him to the morgue.
No. Not the ICU, the ER.
Thanks.
Oh, you need me to do something?
Ask Frank for the decedent packet.
Luka?
Hmm?
You weren't here
so I gave Collins the Gent first.
Thanks.
Um... I had to go out.
Everything okay?
She's leaving town.
Why?
I don't know.
Dr. Kovac, Exam Four's vomiting blood.
What about the baby?
There is no baby.
I started another line on Zahler.
Did you have a written order?
It was right up there.
Why was Abby about to discharge my bowel obstruction?
I have no idea.
Because you can't write between the lines.
Oh, sorry.
BENTON: Carter, is this one yours?
Oh.
Mrs. Urman?
Gave her 50 of benadryl.
What happened?
I guess you were right.
We followed our bliss.
Where?
To our pickup truck.
I figured we'd be safe
right by the hospital, so, uh...
I'll get her started.
300 of cimetidine.
I will be right there.
Ooh, that's a very nice suit.
Thanks. I was in court all day.
A patient?
No. Something wrong?
No. Everything's cool.
Dr. Benton, they need you in the O.R.
Mr. Escalona.
Uh, if you'd like, the nurse said
that we can make arrangements for the funeral home.
We used Rose Hills when his mother died.
But I-I never thought that...
He was a good kid.
He made everybody smile.
Jorge--
he was the serious one.
I didn't mean to lose my temper.
It's been a hard day, you know?
He doesn't want to see me.
He doesn't understand.
You, uh, should give him a shot.
He might surprise you.
( sighs )
( both crying )
Sorry to be brief
but my nanny gets off in six minutes.
Diane Pruitt-- GSW to the head.
Transplant teams are flying in
from Indiana and Michigan.
The gas station robbery.
Yes. Romano has agreed
to a non-heart beating protocol.
When did we start doing that?
Today, apparently.
That's the husband over there.
If you could review the procedure with him once more?
He's already consented, right?
Yeah, of course.
What is there to talk about?
The man needs some reassurance.
Elizabeth, you had him for 12 hours.
You deal with him.
He wants to talk to the operating surgeon.
( sighs )
Peter, what's the matter?
Nothing. Go home.
Mr. Pruitt?
Hi.
I'm Dr. Benton. I'll be coordinating the procedure.
As soon as the out-of-state team gets here
we'll take her to the O.R.
Okay.
I, uh... I tried to explain it
to her, but, uh, she's too young.
I don't know how I'm going to do this by myself.
Well, you're going to do the best you can.
You're supposed to be on light duty.
I was moving some gear.
No, you went on a run.
( chuckling )
I get a little stir crazy.
Okay.
Looks pretty good, no sign of infection.
That's it?
No. You need a new bandage.
So, is, uh... Captain Devlin
still at the seven-five?
I know the name.
Those guys used to hang out
at a place called the... "Moose and Squirrel."
( laughs )
Yeah. Every Friday night.
That was a fun place.
Uh, you should have someone remove the stitches
in four days.
I know where to find you.
Listen, Sandy...
Oh, gosh, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. Oh, I bunched it up.
That's all right. What were you saying?
Do you want to do something?
Excuse me?
Uh, sometime?
You know, something.
Something?
Uh, I don't know.
Lunch or a movie or... ice fishing.
( laughs )
Like, go out?
Yeah.
I mean, unless I'm totally off base here.
No.
No, you're on base.
How's it going?
Fine.
Your drug screen came back.
Everything was negative.
Don't look so disappointed.
I know you're upset.
But I had to do this
because I want you to be safe.
I care more about that
than about your being angry with me.
I want to be able to trust you.
It's something we both have to work at.
Can I go now?
Is the recipient ready?
Yeah. All I need is a liver.
All right. The heart team gets first crack.
But tell them to make it snappy.
Sternal saw's up.
Open the oh dexon, atraumatic needle.
( saw whirring )
All set?
Good to go.
After two minutes of cardiac arrest
I'll call it, and then we'll begin procurement.
How's her oxygenation?
Fine. Satting at 100%.
BENTON: Good. Turn it off.
( vent goes silent )
Respiratory support discontinued at 20:37.
( EKG monitor beeping )
Oh, they're sweet.
I hope they get pregnant.
Shouldn't be a problem.
The endocrinologist can wash the sperm
and then it's safe to artificially inseminate.
Hmm.
That's a new one.
Just goes to teach you never to doubt my diagnoses.
Yeah, no matter how loony they are.
I can't believe they did it
in the back of a pickup truck.
They had a camper shell.
How do you know?
I saw it. You did?
Yes. In the front of the hospital.
It's their honeymoon suite.
Very weird.
Not so weird.
Ferris wheel-- that's weird.
Really?
I-I was young.
It was my first real boyfriend.
Where else?
Your turn.
Camping. Where else?
In a tent?
That's the best you can do?
Uh...
( snaps fingers )
On a train to Seattle.
Really?
Mm-hmm.
With who?
I was by myself... but it was memorable.
( laughs )
Mm. It's cold.
Yeah. We should probably go in.
Yeah.
Carter...
You don't have any allergies I should know about, do you?
Oops.
( laughter )
Where were we?
( monitor beeping )
How long has it been?
49 minutes.
Tissues could be getting ischemic.
All right. Send an ABG, lytes and a lactate.
Who's in charge here?
I ordered liver an hour ago
and I haven't seen my waitress since.
The patient's breathing on her own.
Ugh. How inconsiderate.
Well, this could take hours.
Page me when she goes.
What do you want to do, Dr. Benton?
Let's just wait.
