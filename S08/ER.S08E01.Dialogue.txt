Previously on E.R.:
You're Chief of Emergency Medicine
not the county's lesbian advocate.
That's where you're wrong, Robert, because I am both.
I am the Chief of Emergency Medicine, and I am a lesbian.
Jesse? Come on, man.
HALEH: It's his nephew.
( screaming ): No!
Some guy opened fired in a foster care facility.
GREENE: Derrick Fossen.
WEAVER: 14 shots, six deaths.
HALEH: Adele Newman. That maniac shot at her house.
You took his kid away from him, right?
There were police in the house. The front door's been kicked in.
WOMAN: Psych?
My daughter doesn't need a psychiatrist.
The doctors want to make sure.
I just need to talk to her.
That's all.
CARTER: No, can you get him on the phone now?
When did he die? It's Dr. Carter in the ER.
WOMAN: How long does a CAT scan take?
ABBY: ...or if you want to get coffee or something...?
I really need to talk to my daughter.
There's coffee there, isn't there?
I wouldn't ask you to subject yourself to that.
Dr. Wiseman? This is Dr. Carter.
You have a patient down here, Holly Evans
who was supposed to be admitted last night.
CORDAY: Delaying surgery could kill him.
Say he doesn't die on the table or in post-op.
You ship him back to his convenience store alley
but this time, instead of getting beaten up
he gets eaten by dogs because he's too weak to move.
Eaten by dogs? It happens.
In Chicago? A lot. A cop told me.
Dr. Greene, Dr. Romano needs
to speak to you in his office immediately.
Did he say why?
Something about the Fossen case. He says it's important.
Something wrong?
I don't know.
BENTON: Hey, Mark?
Yeah?
You got a second? No.
What? She said she was nauseated.
...'cause she's alone and afraid
and has now been waiting for almost 20 hours.
Well, put your thumb out, get down here, and admit your patient.
Give her another gram of cefoxitin and order a clear liquid diet.
"Pull your thumb out"...?
And call me in a half an hour
if someone from pedes doesn't get here, okay?
No, I won't bother... No, no, no. Call me.
Exactly what don't you want me to subject myself to?
Oh.
Dr. Weaver.
Abby, John.
Things are a little tense.
I can imagine.
So, I'll see you later.
Queen Elizabeth wants me to meet her boy.
Abby, you got room for a Haldol deficiency?
Park her over there.
Because we are compatible.
Who? You and Prince Charles?
He likes coffee, and so do I.
I could be princess.
He is mine, honey.
Abby, MVA with PSI rolling up.
Coming.
Now you stay away from him.
I promise.
There's an apartment listed in that building.
What building?
The one you like on Clarke.
Two bedrooms, big closets, wood floors.
You went there?
Yeah, I called the manager.
She already had two people interested.
Are you seriously considering it?
I thought you liked that area.
Oh, I can't afford that kind of rent.
Don't worry about it.
And I'm pretty happy where I am.
Oh, I...
You know, it's...
( crashing )
( rhythmic drumming )
How much is this?
For you? $20.
Is it real?
Of course.
No, I mean authentic.
Direct from Kenya, pretty lady.
Imported with my own two hands.
All right. I'll take it.
( sighs )
Don't bother. It's not a gift.
MAN ( over radio ): Come on. At some point, we have to have standards.
WOMAN: Who gets to decide? You?
They did, when they chose to participate
in that kind of behavior.
So you judge character based on what one does in one's bedroom?
I have no problem with alternative lifestyles
or whatever you call it
but you're talking about role models here.
Then you would oppose gay teachers, for example?
I oppose any homosexual in a job where they...
( turns radio off )
Okay.
What don't you want me to subject myself to?
Oh, no, it...
Dr. Weaver.
Abby, John.
Hey, Chief. Back in the saddle so soon?
Yeah, we weren't expecting you...
Queen Elizabeth wants me to meet her boy.
It's been three weeks.
Already? Man, time really flies when...
Because we are compatible.
Who? You and Prince Charles?
Malik, you got that X-ray going?
What X-ray?
With the kid.
Yeah.
He is mine.
Abby, MVA with PSI rolling up.
I love your hair color. It's perfect on you.
Oh, thank you.
It's strong. It's very...
What building? The one you like on Clarke.
That bracelet's awesome. Where'd you get it?
A place in Nairobi.
Was it totally amazing?
What?
Africa.
It was exactly as I remembered it.
( crashing )
ABBY: Bradying down to 50.
P.E.A., starting compressions.
Two of O neg on the infuser. Get some saline.
How did she get upstairs?
She's an ER patient?
Came in with a facial fracture
abdominal pain and a broken wrist.
She was waiting for a psych consult
pregnant with her brother's baby.
Why wasn't anyone monitoring her?
They're shorthanded with Legaspi gone.
Another two cc's in the cuff.
Give me a vascular clamp.
They haven't replaced Legaspi?
Someone said she got a job in California.
We should be so lucky.
Is that true?
Dr. Weaver, have you heard from Dr. Legaspi?
Oh!
Probably a tension pneumo.
What happened?
KOVAC: Four-story fall. GCS of three, now in PEA.
How did she fall?
ABBY: She jumped.
HALEH: Pulse ox 74 on 100%.
Did she ever have a pulse?
No.
Try for a central line.
No, open up another tray.
We got this, Kerry. Go get cleaned up.
Prep for a subclavian.
I want a second chest tube first.
Ten blade. Let's move.
Really, Kerry.
We've got it.
Set up a thoraseal.
KOVAC: Holding compressions.
ABBY: Looks pretty agonal. You want atropine?
Yeah, push a milligram.
All right, let's set up for a pericardiocentesis.
What did you say to her? I didn't say anything.
KOVAC: How long are we going?
Dr. Weaver? How was your trip?
Hot. It was hot.
Hey, I never got a chance to thank you.
For what?
I got my Chief Resident confirmation.
I won't let you down. I'm sure you won't.
WOMAN ( screaming ): No!
No!
No! No! No!
We should sue that Scottish bastard.
What?
Sleazebag host will say anything
to get you on his show.
Mr. Peterson started a brawl at a talk show taping.
Somebody smacked me with a microphone. I killed her...
Carl...?
Stay the hell away from me, you queer.
( woman sobbing )
I don't dig penises, okay?
I have only one more operation...
Touch me, I swear.
Hey, you need to calm down.
Calm down?
This thing makes me look like
some twisted fairy!
You knew. Part of you knew.
You see this, huh?
Man? Woman. That's what I know.
That's normal.
It's still love, Carl. Love is love.
It's perverted, you faggot.
It's sick. You disgust me.
Calm down, sir.
You're a freak.
Sir, please, calm down.
Damn homo.
You all right?
The M & M's started.
You going to the M & M?
What?
On Fossen. The M & M's started.
Luka, has there been any talk about me?
Kerry, people always talk about their bosses.
No, I-I mean personally.
Personally?
Well, Dr. Weaver.
I thought maybe you fell under the spell
of some Masai warrior and were never coming back.
Coming in?
ZOGOIBY: Why wasn't lidocaine given for a stable V tach?
I didn't have the ACLS drug box with me.
When transferring a critical patient?
The trauma nurse ran out to get it
but then the doors closed unexpectedly.
Leaving you alone with the patient? Right.
ZOGOIBY: You cardioverted the patient without sedation?
ROMANO: Dr. Legaspi's a lesbian, am I right?
Isn't that a little barbaric?
GREENE: Under the circumstances...
LEGASPI: I've never hidden that fact from...
Was there any delay in OR accepting...?
Don't worry, Kerry. Your secret's safe with me.
WEAVER: That's not what I meant.
...any delay in admitting him to the OR?
...compromised at all?
GREENE: Compromised? No.
LEGASPI: ...then deal with the stigma of being gay.
Do you care to comment on that?
Dr. Weaver?
In your opinion, was the patient's care
at all compromised?
Compromised?
Did the ER accept too many trauma patients that day?
Uh, I don't believe so.
We were busy, but we handled it.
Watch your back.
Kerry, you under the weather?
Excuse me?
You're a little slow on the uptake.
Jet lag.
Oh, oh, yes.
Your trip to, uh, Africa, was it?
Spontaneous decision doesn't seem like you.
Half of my accrued personal days were about to expire.
Well, it still doesn't justify you going MIA
for three weeks with no real warning.
You know what? I took a vacation.
I may take another. I still have 19 days banked.
Aha. I see. You might want to try Papua New Guinea
for your next big adventure.
I hear they put gourds on their penises.
Give us some notice next time.
Wait! Robert?
Careful, Kerry, you okay?
Yeah. Hold on.
You know, you can just call my office.
You don't have to go beating up the elevator.
You, uh, who have you told?
Told who what?
About what we discussed before I left.
Oh, ah, yes, Legaspi. As ordered, I backed off.
But she was determined to leave, decided she didn't like us anymore
and was going to move and work
in San Francisco, I understand.
Go figure.
Have you told anyone about me?
I don't know what you're talking about.
I think you do.
Have you told anyone that I'm a lesbian?
Oh, uh, no.
Kerry, I-I assumed that that was confidential.
Was I wrong to assume that? I mean, if you want
to tell everyone, that's your business.
But I don't see how a person's sexual affairs
are appropriate subject matter
for a workplace conversation, do you, Kerry?
No.
Then we're on the same page.
Joanie, we got aluminum rotors in stock?
I doubt it. You want me to order some?
If it's not too much trouble.
Pads, too?
I'm sure your father
will give me a deal.
If I ever need an operation
Peter, you better not charge me.
Just for parts. Uh-huh.
Oh, what's this? Summer session?
Chem II.
Look, if you can pay him, you should pay him.
Mom got fired.
What happened?
You can only take a leave of absence for just so long.
Hey, you know what? You should bring Cleo over.
We haven't seen you guys in a while.
We're taking a little break right now.
What did you do?
Nothing. She's going through
some rough stuff right now.
She needed a little room. I'm respecting that.
HOLLY: Did you reach him?
No, not yet, but I'm going to try him again
in a few minutes.
He said he'd come by to check on me...
I know.
Nine years I've been hosting a talk show
I've never gotten bit.
I thought those fights were all staged.
Not exactly.
Zofran... People usually don't get hurt...
My liver enzymes were up...
We use lightweight furniture in case.
We'll know in one more week.
When their lover tells them
he used to be a man...
Can you catch AIDS from a she-male biting you?
What? One of the transsexuals bit me.
Uh, excuse me.
She broke the skin.
Claire?
Hey... you all right? Yeah.
I heard you got sick.
A little nauseous.
Trouble with your meds?
I'm fine.
You're still taking them, though, right?
Do you want to help out?
Sure.
A 20-year-old girl fell down
and broke her left wrist.
That doesn't sound surgical.
Then smacked repeatedly with a folding chair
to the face and abdomen.
Talk show brawl, huh?
She's a little worked up.
Just found out her boyfriend is also her half-brother.
Right, up...
down.
Okay.
You might have a facial fracture.
I need to see some X-rays.
Is this tender?
How about here?
I need to use an ultrasound machine
on your belly
to rule out any internal bleeding, okay?
Alice?
Get out!
Now... Get out!
Just let me explain to you.
You tell me on TV. You keep this from me.
You let me date him!
And y-you knew we were having sex
and you tell me on TV!
The producers begged me... Mrs. Jenkins.
Get out!
I can explain... Mrs. Jenkins, sit.
Let us monitor you
I need to talk to Alice!
Get away from me!
Listen, I can explain this.
Get out!
I can explain this... Get... out!
Get out!
Can you tell if I'm pregnant with that?
Do you think you are?
I might be.
Looks like about ten weeks.
I was going to keep it.
This can't be happening.
This can't be true. I love him so much.
( sobbing ): It's so unfair.
There's no intra-abdominal bleeding
but I'm going to get a CT scan of your face, okay?
Would you close the curtain?
Sure.
Dr. Benton, can I discharge Molton?
As soon as he's done with his IV.
Also this girl needs a facial CT and a psych consult.
Last night... Weaver's here! Weaver's here.
Why didn't someone say she was working today?
She's on the schedule.
I know I know you from somewhere.
I wouldn't forget that smile.
Put Neosporin on the wound three times a day.
Keep your head dry. Don't wash your hair
for two days.
No way. I'm a bridesmaid on Saturday.
I have to wash my hair.
I want to look good. Dr. Greene?
Dr. Romano needs you in his office immediately.
Did he say why?
Something about the Fossen case.
Sounded important.
Something wrong? I don't know.
Hey, Mark? Yeah?
You got a minute? No.
Listen, is Cleo having trouble with the triple cocktail?
MAN: She's alone and afraid
and has now been waiting for almost 20 hours.
...should ask her yourself.
I just want to make sure
they're following her LFTs.
Peter, you should talk to her.
JOANIE: Uncle Peter?
Joanie? KIT: There he is.
What's wrong? Can I talk to you?
Your parathyroidectomy is ready to go in three.
All right, put his film on a view box
I'll be right back.
What's up?
I think they're going to break up.
Who? My mom and my dad.
I didn't notice it
until I came home for the summer
but it's really bad, Uncle Peter.
I mean, one minute Mom seems okay
the next she's crying
and locks herself in the bedroom
and Dad won't even say anything.
He just gets all quiet and stares into space.
Look, they lost their son. It's normal.
No, it is not normal.
They fight all the time about her job
about Jesse's room.
Dad washed a shirt that had his scent on it
and Mom went nuts.
And then Dad stayed out all night...
I don't know. It's messed up.
Somebody's got to talk to her.
There's nothing I can say
that'll make your mom feel better.
There's nothing you can do but give it time.
It's almost been a year, Uncle Peter.
Joanie, I know, but it...
( beeping )
Trauma one?
Yeah, it's your patient. My patient?
The girl from the talk show waiting for psych.
What?
WEAVER: Whoa.
Probably a tension pneumo.
What happened?
Four-story fall
GSC of three, now in PEA.
How did she fall?
She jumped.
Pulse ox 74 on 100%.
Did she ever have a pulse? No.
Try for a central line.
No, let's open up another tray first.
We've got this, Kerry. Go get cleaned up.
Prep for a subclavian.
I want a second chest tube first.
Ten blade. Let's move.
Really, Kerry, we've got it.
Set up a thoraseal. Holding compressions.
Pretty agonal. You want atropine?
Yeah, push a milligram.
All right, let's set up a pericardiocentesis.
What did you say to her?
I didn't say anything to her.
KOVAC: How long are we going?
I'm in.
Check for tamponade.
Give her eight units, packed cells.
KOVAC: Can't feel a pulse.
Injury current on the monitor.
Ah... blood in the pericardium.
120cc's out.
Rate is 29.
Still no pulse.
All right, resuming compressions.
Another amp of epi!
Mother's outside.
Keep her out!
I'll tell her.
I'm not ready to call it yet.
You will be.
Let it circulate.
Mix up isoprel!
ABBY: Didn't she tear off her aorta?
Dr. Benton?
HALEH: Asystole.
MRS. JENKINS: No! No!
No! No, no!
No, no!
( sobbing ): No!
Time of death: 12:17.
Peter?
Hey.
Hi.
What, are you spring-cleaning?
Getting rid of some crap.
It's not too dark out here for that?
I wanted to finish. Salvation Army comes tomorrow.
Let me give you a hand.
I'm almost done.
Want a hamster cage? No?
You okay?
What'd you need, Peter?
I... what?
I just came by for a, uh... a snow shovel.
All right, I came to check on you.
I heard you lost your job.
We'll just have to wait to expand that porch.
What's wrong with the porch?
I don't know.
I thought it was time for a change.
Walt took some pictures of the backyard
that we could Xerox and draw on, make plans.
When I went to pick up the prints...
( voice breaking ): I found three pictures of Jesse left on the roll.
( sighs )
I fell apart right in the store.
I realized... that's it.
There'll never be any more pictures of him.
15 years old...
and he's never going to change.
( sighs )
You think every day you're getting a little better
getting through it
and then you're right back to the day it happened.
He's still my baby, Peter.
I'm supposed to take care of him.
I feel like...
somewhere, sometime...
He's going to be sad or cold or scared.
Who's taking care of him?
Who's being his mother?
MINISTER: I am the resurrection and the life
saith the Lord.
He that believeth in me
though he were dead, yet shall he live
and whosoever liveth and believeth in me
shall never die.
We brought nothing into this world
and it is certain
we carry nothing out.
Wherefore my heart is glad and my spirit rejoiceth
( cell phone ringing ) my flesh also shall rest in hope.
The Lord gave and the Lord hath taken away.
Blessed be the name of the Lord.
In sure and certain hope
of the resurrection to eternal life
through our Lord, Jesus Christ
we commend to Almighty God, our brother, John
and we commit his body to the ground
earth to earth
ashes to ashes, dust to dust.
Dad did a nice job with the eulogy.
He worked on it for a while.
Grandpa would have liked it.
Yes.
Gamma seems to be holding up.
I expect she would.
( cell phone vibrates )
Is it for your convenience or someone else's?
Hello?
Yeah, kind of busy. Why?
Wait, wait, she's not on the ward?
No, Wiseman was supposed to admit her last night.
What's her hemoglobin?
Okay, yeah, no.
I'll be right there.
Fifteen minutes.
We need to make a stop at County General Hospital.
Just get off on Division.
This, uh, shouldn't take long.
Do you mind?
Pow!
Could someone please shut him up?
Why don't you both shut up?
I've got a right to be here, same as you.
Pow, pow, pow.
You left without saying good-bye.
You were asleep.
For about ten minutes.
I'm sorry.
I had someplace to be.
I don't like it here.
I know, but we're going to make sure
that you get your own bed and your own room upstairs.
You said that last night.
Well, they're still working on it
but I'm going to go hurry them up, okay?
Okay.
Any more pain in your stomach? A little.
I'll take care of that.
And Abby here's going
to hang out with you
until they bring you up.
Tell her to call me again
if you want to talk to me.
Thanks for coming back.
You're welcome.
What was her last crit?
Thirty-six
after two doses of solumedrol.
Give her four more MS, then Q2 PRN.
When are her parents getting here?
Around 3:00. They missed their connecting flight.
Dr. Wiseman, please.
That's a nice suit. Who died?
My grandfather.
I'm sorry. I didn't know.
Ah, no, no. Can you get him on the phone now?
When did he die?
It's Dr. Carter in the ER.
Monday.
Wow. You okay?
I'm off at 4:00 if you want to go get a coffee or something.
I got 200 people back at the house.
There's coffee there, isn't there?
I wouldn't ask you to subject yourself to that.
Dr. Wiseman?
This is Dr. Carter. You have a patient down here, Holly Evans
who was supposed to have been admitted last night.
Wait.
Thank you.
Did the driver get lost?
John had something more pressing.
It was trouble with a patient.
Decent turnout.
Well, it'll do.
Where's Gamma?
Lying down; said she was tired.
Where are you staying?
The Drake.
The Ritz-Carlton was booked.
Did you think about staying here?
Oh, there's Peter Harkins.
I should say hello.
Who's Peter Harkins?
Uh, he's handling the probate.
I think I'm going to check on Gamma.
I did. She's fine. Yeah, still...
John, do you want to help your grandmother?
Be a good host. Introduce yourself
to Senator Herrero's daughter.
Arthur?
ARTHUR: Jack, I'm so sorry.
Thank you.
Dr. Carter?
Your friend is here.
Holly got her bed.
Yeah? Did Wiseman come down?
Yeah, a few minutes after you called.
It's amazing what a little "pull your thumb out" will do.
Did you eat something?
No. I couldn't decide
between the smoked tongue pate and the whitefish mousse.
We must have run out of the pigs in a blanket.
Well, somebody should really talk to your caterer.
You're going to have some dirty birds.
Grandpa liked to drive the power lawnmower around.
Did he drive it into the birdbath?
Not on purpose.
He was having a fatal MI at the time.
( stifled laughter )
Oh, God.
I'm-I'm sorry.
Got to die somehow.
Mm-hmm.
It's not a bad way to go.
Sunny day...
get on the mower...
Don't... don't... don't laugh.
I'm sorry.
Don't laugh.
Well, stop it.
Oh, God.
I hope it's all right that I came here.
I'm not usually a funeral crasher.
Figured this would be a good one?
And I felt bad...
that something like your grandfather dying
could have happened
and you didn't even talk about it.
ELEANOR: John, have you seen Millicent?
No.
Mom, this is my friend, Abby.
Abby, this is my mother, Eleanor.
Hello.
Hi.
Things are winding down.
She really needs to make an appearance.
I will go and look for her in a minute.
Please do.
Sorry.
It's okay.
No, it's my parents.
They don't... they don't handle loss well.
Who does?
It's been a while
since we've had to deal with this sort of thing.
Since your brother died?
Mm-hmm.
You better go.
TV reporter: ...64. That was back in July.
It's been a rather quick fall Oh, come on.
from grace for the NASDAQ.
John?
Dad, is everything okay?
Yeah, I just took a hit on Parning.
Biotech's in the basement again.
You want a drink?
No, thank you. Have you seen Gamma?
Haven't given up that quest, huh?
Oh, Mom thinks she might be hiding out.
I don't blame her.
That room can get insufferable.
Dad, I really think that you should stay here tonight.
Don't worry. We have a driver.
No, I meant for Gamma.
You know how your mother feels about it.
Well, then, stand up to her this time.
Thanks for the counsel.
I'll take it under advisement.
She buried her husband today.
Yes, I know. My father.
Then don't run away again.
Drop it, John.
Leave it alone.
I've left it... alone.
Bobby's not coming back.
If Mom wants to walk around in a bubble
for the rest of her life, then fine
but don't... don't let her keep holding you inside of it.
TV reporter: ...is buying Union Carbide for $11.6 billion
and word of the deal sent Union Carbide shares...
You might want to try the garage.
( engine revving, then dies )
MILLICENT: Damn it to hell.
Gamma?
I can't get this stupid thing started.
( engine revving, then dies )
Well, it sounds like it's flooded.
You need to let it sit.
Your mother sent you?
Yeah.
People want to pay their respects.
Well, they can wait.
I'm the widow.
I hope you weren't thinking about drinking and driving.
We were saving that bottle for our 60th anniversary.
Missed it by a year.
Open it.
Nah, you can still wait.
Let's drink to your grandfather.
It's a very nice vintage.
You sure you wouldn't rather share this with...?
Oh!
( both laughing )
We don't have any glasses.
You can drink from the bottle.
To John Truman Carter:
entrepreneur...
philanthropist...
family man.
And friend.
We going to take this old girl out for a spin or what?
Damn right.
Okay, that's it.
How did it look?
We have to wait for the radiologist to read it.
You saw it.
I'm just a tech.
Do you see anything bad?
KOVAC: You want to take on Fossen?
What? The shooter.
He coded in the elevator.
I thought maybe you should present him at M & M.
Yeah, sure, whatever.
Did you give nitro?
Two sprays, no relief.
Can you see if they brought my daughter here?
I think she broke her arm.
Is this from the talk show?
HALEH: How did you guess?
They're stacked up in the waiting room.
How did it start?
How do any of them start?
I heard somebody bit the host this time.
So I only present the cab driver, that's it, yeah?
Luka, relax, okay?
Just stick to the facts.
You'll be fine.
Cleo, check a 12 lead and a...
The meds.
Third time today.
You tried compazine?
Yeah. We can get you some Zofran.
I can live with the nausea.
My liver enzymes were up last week.
Meds might be giving you hepatitis.
Only one more week.
Three out of four might be enough.
Maybe.
You don't want to hurt your liver.
I want to be safe.
Malucci, need something to do?
Uh, no, I'm swamped, actually.
Want my opinion?
I guess so.
Reduce your dose and monitor your LFTs.
Talk show?
No, Casey Square.
Bunch of teenagers beat him up for his coin cup.
Okay, Trauma Two.
Multiple contusions to the face
chest, abdomen, arms, legs, everything.
Didn't anybody see this happening?
The whole plaza saw it happen.
All right, uh, get surgical consult and X-ray.
I'll be right there.
LOCKHART: Nobody did anything?
Hi, Adele.
Hi.
How's physical therapy?
It's hard.
I hear you got up on crutches?
Yeah, with leg braces, yeah.
That's a good sign.
Well, I'm trying.
But I'm also realistic.
Romano wanted me to go to the Morbidity and Mortality
as a show-and-tell.
Are you presenting Fossen?
Yeah.
Well, have fun.
CORDAY: I need an ultrasound.
LOCKHART: Coming.
MARQUEZ: C-spine's ready.
Did you get his pressure up?
90/60 after a liter.
What's his crit?
Hi, it's Abby calling
about your colitis patient, Holly.
32. Tender in both quadrants.
She keeps asking for you.
Does your neck hurt, Mr. Skapinski?
Could you call me? Thanks.
Everything hurts.
( coughing )
Okay, we can take the collar off now.
How did it go?
What?
Oh, right, uh, good, yeah.
I still have a brain.
Mark.
Everything's normal.
I still can't believe
people would just stand there
and watch someone get beaten like this.
How are you holding up?
Six weeks of maternity leave-- not enough.
We have fluid in Morrison's pouch.
Call the OR.
GREENE: Where?
There. Sir, it appears
you're bleeding internally, and we...
Hold on. It could be ascites from cirrhosis.
I can't assume that.
What's his blood alcohol?
315.
When was your last drink
Mr. Skapinski?
They took my last drink.
He's hypotensive with a low crit.
Could be septic from pneumonia.
High risk for surgery.
Even riskier if he bleeds out.
Let's take a deep breath
and do a peritoneal lavage.
CORDAY: He's a surgical candidate.
He's a homeless alcoholic with pneumonia.
And therefore not worth saving?
He's about as healthy as he's going to get right now.
I'm trying to keep him that way.
Surgery could kill him.
Delaying surgery could kill him.
Say he doesn't die on the table or in post-Op.
You ship him back to his convenience store alley
but this time, instead of getting beaten up
he gets eaten by dogs because he's too weak to move.
Eaten by dogs?
It happens.
In Chicago?
A lot. A cop told me.
Dr. Greene, Dr. Romano needs to speak to you
in his office immediately.
Did he say why?
Something about the Fossen case.
Says it's important.
Something wrong?
I don't know.
M & M's.
They serve their purpose
in the practice of medicine, I guess
but they can be a real pain in the ass.
You needed something, Robert?
I hear you're presenting this serial killer.
Mass murderer?
Right, right, this Fossen guy.
You don't want me to?
No, it's just that legal flagged something
that might be asked
and I wanted you to be prepared for the question.
Sure, go ahead.
It's no big deal.
It's their job to be anal.
Yeah, what is it?
Well, uh, the nurses' notes show
that you left the trauma room at 16:25.
And the code blue notes from pre-op begin at 16:42.
Why did it take you 17 minutes
to transfer a patient up four floors?
Well, I, uh...
Dr. Romano?
There's an incident in Ambulance Bay.
I'm in a meeting, Brenda.
An ER patient jumped out a fourth floor window.
That's great news, Brenda.
Thank you.
Are they dead?
I don't know.
They're working on her.
ROMANO: Keep the press away.
No statements from anyone to anyone
and get risk management down there.
Why I wanted this job, I will never know.
All right, Greene, let's go.
As you can see, I've got bigger fish to fry.
Doors open on the surgical floor.
I was alone doing chest compressions.
Ran down the defib battery.
It took time to get help.
Transfer the patient to pre-op.
Okeydokey. Brenda
get PR on the line.
Is that it?
Yeah.
I don't think anyone's going
to be crying over this guy, do you?
GREENE: Autopsy also revealed
injuries to the spleen and superior mesenteric artery.
Cause of death: sanguination from multiple vascular injuries.
Why wasn't lidocaine given for stable V-tach?
I didn't have the ACLS drug box with me.
When transferring a critical patient?
The trauma nurse ran out to get it
but then the doors closed unexpectedly.
Leaving you alone with the patient?
Yes.
I don't know
if it would have changed the outcome.
I'm sorry, did you say
the original dysrhythmia was stable V-tach?
Yes.
He had a pulse?
That's correct.
So the patient was conscious?
Yes.
I didn't realize that.
ANSPAUGH: Were you involved with this case, Dr. Corday?
No, no.
ZOGOIBY: Wait a minute.
You cardioverted a patient without sedation?
Yes.
Isn't that a little barbaric?
Under the circumstances, it's what I felt I needed to do.
ROMANO: Was there any delay in the OR
accepting the patient?
ROMANO: Dr. Greene?
No.
Did you know him?
Who?
His grandfather?
Yeah, I met him at that charity event.
Charity event?
Abby, where's my patient?
Dr. Corday took him up to surgery.
I thought you okayed it.
Yeah.
KOVAC: So you're going?
LOCKHART: Uh, yeah.
Mrs. Jenkins?
Could you take this tube out?
They wouldn't take this tube out.
This is a coroner's case.
I'm sorry we have to wait.
They flew us to Chicago and put us up in the Hilton.
Gave me money to go shopping with.
They even took me to a dentist.
The producers said not to tell her
until after the taping.
Then it would be more real
if she didn't know what I was going to say.
It was a lie.
It was all a lie.
All that stuff about them having the same daddies--
I just-just said that to get them on the show.
I used to say
"Alice, you must always tell the truth"
and she'd go, "Well, why, Mommy?"
And I'd say
"Because when you don't, God gets very angry."
( keys jangling )
How is she?
Catherine said she slept for three hours this afternoon.
Has she fed?
Just now.
How's our patient?
Extubated in recovery when I left.
I repaired a little omental oozing
but it might have stopped on its own.
It's hard to say.
Judgment call.
You do what you think is right, Mark.
Elizabeth, in the elevator, with Fossen...
I think we've talked enough about Fossen today, don't you?
I'm going to bed.
Are you coming?
I'll just wait a few minutes, make sure she's down.
Okay.
Good night.
Good night.
Night-night, sweetheart.
( baby cooing )
Mark?
I'll get up with her.
Okay.
