Previously on E.R.:
Stop compressions.
You killed him.
If I'm such a horrible person
how could you possibly want to be with me?
I'm done, okay?
Carter can have you.
She came in without a blood pressure.
She had massive internal bleeding.
It's too severe to repair.
I found three pictures of Jesse left on the roll.
I fell apart right in the store.
You look lovely.
Thank you.
Promise me you won't grow up too fast, okay?
Okay.
BENTON: We were running late, so I just threw a bunch of stuff in here.
I got some snacks and a movie for later.
I'll pick him up around 8:00, okay?
Jackie?
I'll pick him up around 8:00.
Yeah, sure.
Listen, I, uh, really appreciate this.
I've got a nanny agency
setting up some interviews for next week.
Don't worry about it, Peter.
All right.
*
MILLICENT: John?
John?!
Are you all right?
Yeah.
I brought you some aspirin.
I just need to stretch it out.
What you need is to see my orthopedist.
I'm making you an appointment today.
I'm covering half a shift today.
Then tomorrow.
I don't need to see your doctor.
Your back is nothing to trifle with.
You don't want to end up with a hunch like Uncle Everett.
This isn't orthopedic, Gamma.
I was stabbed.
I know that, John.
All the more reason to take care of yourself.
Oh, uh, sorry.
It's okay, Gamma, I'll get it.
No, don't move. You have no shoes on.
All part of my ninja training.
Your what?
( music playing )
( loud crack )
Oh, no.
Sh...
Maybe we should go back to taking shifts.
Are you going to make it?
I thought this walk was supposed to wake me up.
I offered to get you some coffee.
I don't need coffee. I need more than two hours sleep at night.
I think Rachel was seven before she slept through the night.
Oh, God, bite your tongue.
LOCKHART: How big is
a 100-gallon tank in feet? Like two by four? Three by five?
Weaver's on the warpath. Run for your lives. Save yourselves.
I'm going upstairs.
Chicken.
Well, how much is a 300-gallon tank?
Without fish?
Give me something.
I don't know if it's saltwater.
I didn't taste it.
Chuny, this guy checked in at 10:00 last night.
Don't look at me. Weaver's taking her own histories
on every patient and ordering every test in the book.
I don't know, you know-- like, fish.
Like, if there's a red one and a yellow one...
Unnecessary tests?
HALEH: You better do something before somebody
shoots her. I have to call you back.
All right, let's treat and street some of these people.
Any candidates for early parole?
Take your pick. Who's on first?
Jenny.
Possible bladder infection.
Dip's positive for leukocytes, icon's negative.
Okay, Jenny, are you allergic to any medications?
No.
All right, I'm going to give you Bactrim--
one every 12 hours for three days
and come back if you're not doing any better.
Weaver's got this one waiting on an ankle X ray.
I think it's broken.
Did you fall off your horse?
Yes. Really?
Yeah, it was for the jousting demonstration
at the Renaissance Fair.
Cool. Any pain here? No.
How about here? No, not too bad.
Okay, I need you to walk for me.
It hurts.
Yeah, it you can walk on it, it's just a sprain.
Ice it, wrap it and give him some ibuprofen.
That's it?
Well, normally, I'd do some blood-letting
but we're low on leeches.
Don't forget about me, Dr. Greene.
Hi, Candy.
Human bite to the buttocks.
Again?
Some boys can't get enough Candy.
Uh-huh. 500 of Augmentin and prep her for suturing.
Who's sick, you or the pig?
It's not funny. My hand really hurts.
Ah, think how the pig feels.
Hey, Mark, what are you doing?
Trying to treat some of these patients
before they eat each other.
He's already discharged two.
Oh, thank you, Haleh.
I think I need Surgilube.
No kidding. You didn't even take enough time
to do a proper exam on that girl.
I mean, you could've missed pyelo, PID.
She was afebrile; garden-variety UTI.
Make your hand this shape.
Okay, I want all patients to be examined thoroughly.
The moment we become complacent, we make mistakes.
Speak for yourself.
Haley, put Jenny in a gown; set her up for a pelvic.
Dr. Weaver? I'm listening.
22-year-old woman with chest pain reproduced by palpation.
Pulse ox is 97; EKG looks normal.
Okay, send her out.
Well, I'm only asking because she's taking birth control pills
putting her at risk for a PE.
So I was wondering if we should send off a D-dimer...
I got it.
What?
Yeah, you can look at last month's QI data.
No, no, I just need to know if we should order a VQ...
I'll take it.
Okay.
Dr. Chen, I've got an abandoned newborn female
maybe two hours old.
Okay, how's her color?
Some peripheral cyanosis.
They dumped her at St. Anthony's.
She's cold to the touch.
Airway's okay, but a weak cry.
Uh-huh, Trauma One.
Have you tried letting him fall asleep with you
then moving him to his own bed?
It doesn't matter. He still wakes up crying.
I ask him if he's having a nightmare and he says yeah
but then he can't tell me what they're about.
About Carla?
Yeah. I found him wandering around the apartment
with his little flashlight looking for her.
Poor guy, he's confused.
Yeah.
It has to get better eventually.
I don't know.
We were making breakfast this morning
and it dawned on me--
my son's going to grow up without a mother, you know?
Something so basic, such a big part of who he'll be
and there's nothing I can do about it.
Hey, Cleo, I reduced your prolapsed rectum.
What?
Yeah, I used the old sugar trick.
You treated my patient?
Yeah, she was in a lot of pain.
With sugar?
Yeah, yeah.
You sprinkle a little on
the water escapes from the mucosa
the edema subsides and you pop that puppy back in.
You should have let me take a look first.
It could've been a prolapsed hemorrhoid.
Trust me... that was no hemorrhoid.
No, wait, who asked you to see her?
Hey, Dave?
What?
Don't treat my patients unless I ask you to.
Why? I rectified the situation.
No, anyone could've shoved it back in.
Rectified... You get it? That was funny.
I was waiting for a surgical consult.
Oh, come on, you were in there gabbing with your boyfriend.
Is there a problem, Dr. Malucci?
Uh, yes, actually, I never knew anyone
so possessive over somebody else's butthole.
Just stay away from my patients.
It's that Freudian thing, isn't it?
Who keeps stealing my ultrasound?
We need it for that kid in Curtain Three.
CARTER: Who you hiding from?
You giving yourself a pedicure?
I think I stepped on a piece of glass.
Let me see.
Ow!
Yeah, you got something in there.
Want me to try to take it out?
Yeah, please.
Luka and I broke up
a few days ago.
Uh, why?
I think both of us realized
the relationship wasn't working a long time ago.
Neither one of us wanted to be the one to call it.
So it was amicable.
No, I wouldn't say that.
I'm sorry.
Is that why you're avoiding him?
Partly.
I had to go over to his place this morning because I...
HALEH: Carter...
Chen needs you in Trauma One.
What about your foot?
It's all right.
You're going to have to find another excuse to hide out in here.
Malik, have you seen Mr. Fell's digoxin level?
Ask Abby. She was working him up.
Carter, have you see Abby?
Try the lounge.
CHEN: Set up heated, humidified O2 for blow by.
What's this?
Abandoned newborn; needs warm IV fluids, but I can't get a line.
Can you try a intraosseous?
Mm-hmm. Where'd they leave her?
A church. They didn't even bother to dry her off.
MARQUEZ: Temp was 91.2.
Boy, she hardly even reacts when you stick her.
Ah, damn it. What's the matter?
I went through the bone.
I need some gauze. Chuny, any luck?
I can't find the scalp vein.
Carter?
Mm-hmm, I'm in.
Let's push 60cc's of saline.
How's the accu-check? 82.
We need a cath urine for culture.
Carter? It's infiltrating.
Damn it.
HALEH: Heart rate's 180.
Okay, this kid needs fluids right now.
Let's call pedes surgery to do a cutdown.
What about an umbilical line? I can't.
I did one during my internship.
We won't get it if she's more than a few hours old.
It's worth a try.
Come on, fewer complications than a cutdown.
We just need two minutes.
Go get an umbilical line kit.
No. Chuny, page pedes surgery.
Just go get the kit, Deb.
( sighs )
What's wrong with kids these days?
They used to think it was cool to see me walking on stilts.
Maybe they're more sophisticated than we were.
You mean more vicious.
They knocked him over.
On purpose.
Little buggers were actually cheering when I went down.
I made an appointment for him to see ortho in two days.
Good. Until then, keep your wrist elevated and iced.
Can I get a note for work?
No problem.
Hey, boss, can I ask you something?
Sure.
MALUCCI: Hey.
Hey, hey. Dave, what's your question?
Nothing. Hold the elevator
hold the elevator.
MAN: We're full.
This is a medical emergency.
Are you a doctor?
Yeah. I'm Dr. Dave.
So I've been warned.
( alarm sounds )
I told you we were full.
Open your eyes, sir. I think he got caught
in one of his own booby-traps. Traps?
Jungle Bob lives in the park.
Some of these homeless guys can be very territorial.
Hey, Malik, I need a lateral C-spine, chest and pelvis.
Abby's covering trauma.
I got this. Go.
My friend Marty's a mime. He carries a gun.
I hope you're kidding.
Hell, no. Some punks love to hear the mimes scream.
Dr. Greene, Weaver wants a wound culture on your butt bite.
CANDY: I've been on my own since I was ten.
Rachel?
Hi, Daddy.
What are you doing here?
I came to see you.
How did you get here?
She took the train.
From St. Louis? By yourself?
Mom kicked me out.
My mom kicked me out, too.
Best thing ever happened to me.
CARTER: Need a drape?
CHEN: Somebody tied off
the umbilical cord with a shoelace.
Ten blade and umbilical tape.
Where the hell's pedes?
Now flush the catheter.
They should be here by now.
Come on, Deb, stay with me.
( alarm beeping ) Can't get a BP.
Okay, turn off the alarm.
Somebody get Weaver.
And you hold on. I'm cutting the cord.
What if we can't pass the catheter?
It's okay. The umbilical vein looks good.
Prep and drape the ankle just in case.
What do you think she weighs?
About three kilos?
Hmm... maybe a little more.
Let's get ready with 20 per kilo.
Okay, in at five centimeters.
Okay, try a drawback.
2cc return.
Got a good vein. Yeah.
All right, let's push a 60cc bolus.
That's nice work, Deb.
Thanks. 3-0 silk on a needle driver.
Uh, yeah, okay.
Well, make it quick.
How much longer?
They're working on it.
I don't know if I can wait any longer.
It's so hot in here.
Everybody just relax.
This happens all the time.
They think I have an ulcer.
Yeah.
Uh, if you get scared, I'll-I'll hold you.
Scared of what?
Plummeting to our deaths.
What?!
He's just kidding, ma'am.
Look, maybe it would be best if you just stopped talking.
I think I'm going to be sick.
No. No. No one's going to be sick
no one's going to faint
and we're all just going to relax...
Oh, God!
God...
( loud rock music plays )
Good song.
What?
I love this song.
Do you listen to Abandoned Pools?
I do now, along with everybody else
within a six-block radius.
It wasn't that loud.
Don't come crying to me
when you need a hearing aid.
Oh, yeah, and what about those old Led Zeppelin records
you're always playing?
Okay, they're albums; not records
and they're vintage; not old.
Whatever. You still play them way louder than this.
Chicken or beef?
Dad, I'm a vegetarian.
I knew that.
Mom thinks it's just a phase.
Like, hello-- it's called a healthy lifestyle.
Maybe you should try it.
Exactly what happened between the two of you?
I told you. She kicked me out.
( pops lid )
She did!
I came home from my friend Stacy's
and she had thrown all my clothes out on the lawn
so I left.
And why'd she throw your clothes out?
She's crazy.
Seriously. I think she needs therapy.
She grounded me last week for being home a half hour late.
I mean, come on, Dad.
A half hour. It's summer vacation.
( pops lid )
I'll call her.
Don't bother. She's beyond reason.
Does she know you're here?
Rachel, you got to let her know you're here.
Why?
W-Why? Because she'll be worried to death.
So what?
CORDAY: Hello.
Rachel.
She dropped in for a visit.
Well, that's a nice surprise.
How long are you in town for?
You here for the consult?
Yeah. Rule-out appy.
That's mine-- end-stage dementia.
Mm-hm.
Okay, I'll be right back.
Call your mother.
Bye.
Mark, you didn't tell me she was in town.
I didn't know. She ran away.
Why? To join the circus? I don't know.
She and Jen are having mother-daughter issues.
I'm sure you know what that's like.
I didn't run away from home.
No, of course not 'cause your mother
would have set the hounds out on you.
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
This guy's definitely not breathing.
He needs an airway.
Hand me this when I say "tube."
Okay?
There's no air in here.
I can't see squat. All right.
You, push on his neck.
What?
Give me your hand.
Like this.
There you go.
Okay.
Forget it. I'm never going to see the cords. Oh!
Oh, God!
Oh...!
MALUCCI: Roll him. Oh, my God!
Damn it. Blew the line.
Bag him.
I don't know how to...
Just squeeze the bag
every three seconds.
One, two, three...
squeeze, all right?
One, two... hey, hey, hey!
Help her, help her. Hey! Hey!
I said no fainting, no fainting, okay?
KOVAC: Run the fluids in over two hours
and give him 50 of Librium for the shakes.
Abby?
What?
Did you hear me?
Yeah.
You want a blood alcohol level?
Um, just a liver panel.
Did you find your sweater?
Yeah.
Good. I thought you maybe
had some trouble.
Why would you think that?
I haven't seen you all morning.
Yeah. Well, we've been busy.
Abby, I'm sorry if I hurt you.
I didn't want to hurt you.
You didn't hurt me.
I just want you to be happy, Abby.
You never seemed to be happy with me.
That's all I want to say.
Well, you said it.
Yeah.
So, what now?
You tell me.
Should I send a protime?
Yeah.
What's your biggest angiocath? 14 gauge.
Give it to me.
What are you going to do?
Retrograde intubation.
Hold that.
Wire...
...should come out the mouth.
Okay, hold onto that, Sparky.
I got the line.
Squeeze in a liter.
Hold onto that.
Don't stick anyone.
And... tube.
I said tube!
WEAVER: Doctors are human.
We make mistakes.
Speak for yourself.
If this guy had been properly diagnosed
and sent straight to the O.R. without T.N.K.
he'd still be flipping burgers at McDonald's.
Marfan's is difficult to detect.
The residents had never heard of it.
Which is why we have attendings.
I can't be everywhere at every moment.
Wrong answer.
As we speak
the Trib is writing a feature story
on this screw-up
and the rise in preventable deaths.
So you either come up with a better excuse
than "doctors are human"
or find yourself a good old-fashioned scapegoat.
MALUCCI: Good breath sounds.
Very cool.
Who's the man?
She's pinking up.
She's breathing quietly without retractions.
Heart rate is normal at 140.
Temperature's up to 97.
All right, somebody's got to call
Social Services and D.C.F.S.
This little girl's going to need
foster placement eventually.
WOMAN: Dr. Carter?
This is Mirissa.
She's the woman
who found the baby at the church.
Oh. She wanted to know how she's doing.
She's doing very well
but it's a good thing you found her when you did.
Would you like to see her?
Hi. This is my sister, Carmine.
Doctor, can you show my sister
the mark on her chest?
The birthmark?
Oh, yeah.
There you go.
Ya vez?
Te lo dije!
Es una senal de la virgen.
CARMINE: Es un milagro.
Se me desaparecio mi artritis.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Okay, did I just miss something?
( chuckles )
She thinks the birthmark is the sign of the Virgin Mary.
CHEN: Oh. Oh, it does look like
a bleeding heart.
( laughs )
Hey, John...
thanks for the help.
Anytime.
No, no, really.
Really.
Anytime.
Hey.
Can I get you a cane?
I've heard that women find helplessness charming.
In puppies, maybe.
You still evading Luka?
No. Well, yeah, sort of.
It's complicated.
Most breakups are.
Here, sit down.
Well, not that way.
This morning I had to go over to his place
to get one of my sweaters...
and I smashed his fish tank.
Why?
It was an accident.
Oh.
Did you replace it?
No, not yet.
I haven't even told him.
Is it too broken to fix?
Well, it was more like a crack.
Ow!
Want some lidocaine?
No. Just do it.
That's one big piece of glass.
You really should replace it.
Otherwise, he's going to think
you're a little... vindictive.
It wasn't like that.
Oh, I know.
I'm getting him another one.
I think that's a great idea.
I just need some help
getting it into his apartment.
Don't even...
Come on.
I can't lift it up by myself. We could get there.
We could replace it before he gets home.
You can tell Luka what happened
and the two of you can fix it together without me.
May I remind you I just removed a thorn from your paw?
John, did you discharge Ravitz?
Who? Please?
All right, I'll think about it.
I owe you one.
22-year-old woman with chest pain.
She was taking birth control pills.
Yeah. Yeah, why?
Well, Weaver took her from me.
Oh.
She gave her to you?
Maybe she thought you were swamped.
Yeah, more like incompetent.
She made you Chief Resident, you know.
You're the chosen one.
Yeah, by default.
We met when we were kids.
Her family had the cottage next to ours.
We used to go waterskiing together.
But now she can't feed or dress herself
and she doesn't even recognize me.
What will happen if we don't operate?
Her appendix will burst
and she'll develop a life-threatening infection.
Is that a painful way to die?
She doesn't have to die, Mr. Tanzi.
It's a fixable condition.
I'm not so sure she wants to be fixed.
It's a simple surgery, Mr. Tanzi.
Look, I don't want her to suffer, but...
I want to let her go.
Can you do that?
Sure, we can.
Give her five milligrams of morphine.
Keep her hydrated.
Excuse me.
Mark, are you not at least going to try and convince him?
He has durable power of attorney.
It's his decision. Dad?
Yes, I know, but...
Dad?
Rachel, what's wrong?
I called her. Yeah?
She started freaking out. I told you.
All she ever cares about is her stupid job, and...
Call if you need me, okay?
...she said she's going to send me to summer school
and I swear I'm adopted!
Rachel, what did she say?
She hates me. She's such a bitch.
Now, Rachel... She is! You don't know what she's like.
You don't live with her.
Well, I did.
You couldn't stand it, either.
Hey, Mark, we got a G.S.W. coming in.
Okay, I'll be right there.
Haleh, prep the trauma room. Where's Malucci?
Said he was going to Radiology.
What are they waiting for?
104's bringing them.
( laughter )
Chief!
You're fired.
I'm on my break.
I'm between calls.
Go home, Malucci
and get this rig out of here.
What? Two days? You want to suspend me for a week?
You no longer work here, Dr. Malucci.
What do you want, like a formal apology or something?
I want you to empty out your locker.
What? Dr. Chen, you need to check the baby.
GREENE: Jen, Jen, calm down.
She's right here. Do you want to talk to her?
No. Fine, when do you get in?
I don't want her to come.
She's calling from the plane.
I'm not going home with her.
Whoa, don't yell at me.
I didn't tell her to come here.
Okay, okay, yeah. I got to run.
Uh-huh, we'll figure this out when you get here.
Bye. She was freaking out, wasn't she?
She was worried.
Mr. O'Groat, Mr. O'Groat, where are you going?
Back to the game.
No, I still need to check your X-ray.
No, I'm good to go.
No, I think you may have separated your shoulder.
It's okay. I saw the baby.
Cheers. What baby?
Are you taking her side? What?
Hey, boss, can you talk to Weaver?
She thinks she fired me.
What'd you do now? Nothing.
I don't even want to see her.
Why are you still here, Malucci?
See? Kerry, what's going on?
He's out of here.
MR. TANZI: Dr. Greene? Just a second.
Are you going to talk to her?
Dr. Greene, my wife's gone.
What? I went to call our son.
When I got back, she was gone.
Well, maybe the nurses took her to the bathroom.
But her walker's gone, too.
Well, she couldn't have gone far.
Well, the last time she wandered off like this
she nearly got hit by a car.
Randi, can you call security and let them know
that Mr. Tanzi's wife might be missing?
We'll find her. Dad, I really want to stay here with you.
Rachel, not now.
Okay, so, you'll talk to her then, right?
You talk to her. She didn't fire me.
You ready?
One more patient.
Okay, I'll be in the car.
I don't want Luka to see us.
Aren't we going to be wearing ski masks?
FINCH: Thank you for calling me.
Ooh, yes.
You win the lottery?
Better.
My labs came back. My HIV test is nonreactive.
Hey, congratulations, that's great.
I have to take it again in three months, but...
Yeah, but if you haven't converted by now
chances are, you probably won't.
God, I feel like I just got my life back.
I don't think this is working.
Give it time, Yolanda.
What's this?
Oh, she just had an allergic reaction.
She probably would breathe a little easier
if you'd take the corset off of her.
Be my guest.
No, thank you.
Slow, deep breaths, Yolanda.
You got this?
Yeah, sure.
What happened? She dropped her sats?
Sinus tach. Heart rate's 180.
Is she dehydrated?
Uh, definitely not dry. She's making good urine.
She spike a fever?
Repeat temp is 98.4.
Chuny, I need that hemoglobin.
It's coming.
Well, last one was 12.2.
She's not anemic.
You're not anemic, are you?
Did you check a tox screen?
Mm-hmm, negative.
Hmm, maybe she's just worn out
from performing all those miracles.
Second hemocue's 8.2.
Aha.
I knew she was looking pale.
Well, that's too low to be dilutional.
Maybe hemolysis.
Or GI blood loss.
I'll check a stool guaiac.
What are you doing out of bed, dear?
The baby was crying.
Well, let's get you back to your room, all right?
CHEN: Send off a retic count
haptoglobin, Coombs, direct and indirect bilirubin.
I want to transfuse 2cc per kilo per hour
over the next five hours.
Good pick-up, Deb.
I would never have thought to repeat the blood count so soon.
Tachycardia will resolve with transfusion.
Yeah, baby's anemic, you give blood.
Not exactly one for the journals.
What?
Thanks, Carter. That was great.
Where was she?
Wandering the halls, apparently.
I was detained by Malucci
who seems to think he's out of a job?
He is.
The baby was crying.
What happened? Why is she so much better?
Uh, her appendix probably burst.
Once the pressure's relieved, the pain
temporarily goes away.
For how long?
Within 24 hours, peritonitis will take over.
Causes high fevers and severe abdominal pain.
Thank you for taking care of me, Lawrence.
Malucci is not the first doctor to get caught performing
an unauthorized physical in the hospital.
She knows I've been taking care of her.
Excuse me?
It's been two years since she said my name.
Is it too late to perform the surgery?
She's perforated. We'd have to do
an open procedure, which will take much longer to heal.
I want you to operate.
Mr. Tanzi, your wife's moment
of lucidity was probably a fluke.
The surgeon says it's a simple operation.
Mr. Tanzi, why don't you stay down here with your wife
and we'll have the surgeon come down
and speak with you, all right?
She deserves to have everything done for her.
She will.
What are you doing?
His wife's end-stage dementia.
I'm trying to help both of them.
Well, apparently, you're not.
Oh, you want this one, too? She's yours.
In fact, why don't you take all the patients
seeing that you're firing all the doctors.
Hey, he had it coming.
For what?
Unacceptable behavior. Insubordination.
I mean, he has no respect for anything.
So what? Reprimand him.
I am tired of his attitude.
You can't get rid of him
just 'cause the two of you don't get along.
Hell, if that were the case, you'd have to fire all of us.
You know what? I'm not going to justify my point of view to you.
Where is she?
Good to see you, too, Jen.
Don't break it.
You owe me so big for this.
Oh, my God!
What's wrong?
I left the keys in the apartment.
That's it. Mission aborted.
Wait, hold it, wait.
He sleeps with the window open.
Wouldn't it make more sense just to leave this out front?
What? So someone can steal it?
Who steals a fish tank?
Come to think of it, who breaks a fish tank?
I told you, it was an accident.
That's good.
Okay, that's Luka's.
Can you give me a boost up there?
No.
Just bend over.
You could at least buy me dinner first.
I got a bad back, you know.
What are you implying?
I'm saying, if, what if somebody sees us?
All right, just relax, Opie.
Are you ready?
Yep.
Okay.
( groans )
God.
Wait.
Okay.
It's stuck.
Darn it, it's stuck.
Whoa.
Carter!
She doesn't listen to a thing I say.
She ignores her curfew.
She doesn't do a damn thing around the house.
How would you know? You're never home.
I just made partner. Excuse me for working
so hard so I can put a roof over your head.
You made partner?
Yeah.
Congratulations.
Thanks.
Dad?
Rachel, sit down.
Obviously, there's a lack of communication here.
And it sounds like, to me, Rachel
you could be a little more responsible.
And Jen, maybe you could spend some more time...
I am responsible. She's unreasonable.
I've given her 14 years. I am tired of being her maid.
Tired of being a mother is more like it.
Can you blame me? Time out.
We'll finish this at home.
We're getting on a plane at 5:30.
Maybe I'm not going back.
Rachel, I had to cancel my whole day to be here
and now, I'll be up all night doing a brief.
Well, I'm sorry I'm such a pain in the ass.
Dr. Greene, we need you.
Remember when she used to flush crayons down the toilet?
Seriously, Mark, you've got to help me here.
Now, Doctor.
Okay, I'll be right back.
Auto versus pedestrian at moderate velocity.
Altered with GCS of 2-4-4.
BP is 80 palp.
Full trauma panel, type and cross for four.
Any sign of head trauma? Nothing I appreciated.
Witnesses say she was already lying
in the crosswalk when she got hit.
She may have been struck more than once.
Set me up with a central line.
HALEH: Pulse ox 98 on two liters.
Contusion, left upper quadrant.
Pupils four millimeters and reactive.
Dr. Benton?
Whoa, we got a severed umbilical cord.
Where's the baby?
She's got a retained placenta.
Okay, I'll try to extract. Call OB.
She's missing a shoelace.
Think we can resuscitate him? I think he's been down too long.
Think we should flush him? Think Luka will miss him?
Maybe he'll think one of the other fish ate him.
They're not piranha. Oh, fine.
I was never any good with pets.
I used to like those little turtles
you could get at the Woolworth's.
Don't they carry salmonella?
I don't know.
They didn't live long, especially
if you paint them with nail polish.
Can we get out of here now?
Yeah, I just have to wipe the place down for prints.
( knocking at door )
( whispers ): Should I get it?
No.
No pneumothorax.
Are you ready with the ultrasound?
All set.
Systolic's up to 100. She's coming around.
I'm Dr. Greene. What's your name?
Anna. What happened?
You were hit by a car.
My stomach hurts.
Where's your baby?
I don't have a baby.
HALEH: Crit's only 28 after two units.
BENTON: Hang another two.
She needs a splenectomy. What?
You need an operation. Why?
You have internal bleeding from the accident
and you haven't delivered your placenta yet.
No, I'm not pregnant.
You were.
Did you leave your baby at the church?
I don't have a baby.
All right, I'm taking her off. Hold on.
( baby cries )
Shh, it's okay.
How's she doing?
Oh, her crit's up, but she needs
another four per kilo.
Okay, I need to take her for a second.
What? Take her where? Just next door.
Dr. Greene, she needs more packed cells.
BENTON: Send off another CBC from pre-op
and I want plasma in the OR.
Peter, wait.
What? Her pressure's borderline.
I got to take her up.
Dr. Greene, I need to put her back on the monitors.
Anna, this is your baby.
I don't have any children.
You tied off her umbilical cord with your own shoelace.
No.
We need to finish the transfusion.
You left her at the church
'cause you wanted her to be safe.
I can't have a baby.
GREENE: But you did.
Is she okay?
She's very sick
but we're helping her now.
I never meant to hurt her.
I thought God would protect her.
CHEN: He did.
Some people think she's a miracle.
What?
They feel better when they're near her.
Can I touch her?
Yeah, go ahead.
What are you doing, ordering pizza?
I'm calling my lawyer.
They haven't charged us with anything.
We are sitting in the back of a police car.
What are they going to arrest us for--
aquatic mischief?
I hope you're this funny in handcuffs.
I am.
Oh, here we go.
Oh, he looks pissed.
Do you think he's going to press charges?
I don't know.
We did kill his fish.
We?
Oh, he's really pissed.
I'm making my phone call now.
All right, Bonnie and Clyde.
Your friend cut you loose.
Stay out of trouble.
Do you think we should say something to him?
I think you should say something to him.
Maybe tomorrow.
Rachel, your mom's waiting out front for a taxi.
Thanks.
I know growing up can be tough...
but you can call me anytime.
Yeah, until Mom takes away my phone privileges again.
It'll be okay.
No, it won't.
Rachel, what do you want me to do?
Well, you can let me stay here.
Ah... you can't.
Why not?
Your mom would miss you.
Right.
You'd miss your friends.
They're only a phone call away.
I'll make new ones.
What about school?
They have schools in Chicago.
I just want to spend more time with you and Ella.
I've got a baby sister who doesn't even know me.
And Elizabeth is totally smart and cool.
She's a great role model.
Are you serious about this?
Yes.
It's a big move.
I miss you, Dad.
I'll talk to your mother.
Straight clamp, then 2-0 Vicryl.
Any chance we could speed this up?
I got tickets to the Cubs game.
If you're asking me to compromise this woman's surgery
in order for you to attend a sporting event
the answer is no.
BABCOCK: I did a pre-op assessment
on this woman.
I've had more intelligent conversations
with my neighbor's cat.
I need to irrigate with two liters.
I've only got 500cc's on the field.
Then get us some more.
Coming right up.
Maybe this is God's way of saying her meter's... out.
If I ever get to this point
I sure as hell don't want a trip to the O.R.
I'll keep that in mind, Dr. Babcock.
What happened
to dignity in death?
Elizabeth?
( loudly ): Dr. Corday?
Where's my saline, Shirley?
Ready to go.
Right, then.
Did you just fall asleep?
No.
You did.
You fell asleep.
I was resting my eyes.
Peter, you missed a good one.
Seven gunshots, it was like a scavenger hunt.
What've you got?
A 20-year-old with a fractured spleen
and retained placenta.
Did you call Coburn?
Yeah, she's on her way down.
She's going to try manual extraction
under general anesthesia.
Well, hopefully it's not accretia.
Dr. Benton.
There's a young man out here looking for you.
Jackie?
I'm sorry, Peter.
What's wrong?
I can't do this... not right now.
Jackie, I'm getting ready to go into surgery... I tried.
I really did.
Okay, okay, listen, why don't we just
talk about this when I get home, okay?
Reese is the sweetest little boy I know.
I love him like he was mine
but he's not mine, and every time I see him...
It's just not fair.
Peter...
Jackie... Jackie.
Is he scrubbing in with you, Peter?
BENTON: I just need to find somebody to
keep an eye on him.
Uh, don't look at me.
I'm going to day care, I'll be back in two minutes.
Oh, no, no, I don't think so.
Go home, get your personal life sorted out.
But I'm getting ready to perform a splenectomy.
Not anymore-- she stands a better chance of surviving
if I do it.
Spend some quality time with your son
at Chuck E. Cheese or something.
( sighs )
Hey.
Weaver change her mind?
No, not yet.
She will. She's just mad at you.
She's always mad at me.
This is different.
Well, maybe it'll blow over.
I don't know, I...
I should have seen it.
I didn't focus on the mediastinum.
I didn't even look at the X ray, Dave.
Because I told you it was clear.
I thought I was doing the right thing.
I just wanted to save the guy, I...
You know
they say you're not a real doctor
until you've killed a few patients.
What are you going to do?
This is the only thing that I've ever been any good at.
I'm going to be a doctor.
You were never arrested or brought home by the police
or anything when you were a kid?
No, you?
No, not for anything serious.
What, no counterfeiting, no grand theft auto?
Actually, I got in trouble once
for taking this guy's car.
You stole a car?
Barely. It was a Gremlin
and I was only borrowing it anyway.
No high-speed chases involved?
It was a short one.
But it was an emergency.
We had to get Wham! tickets.
Now, that's a crime.
Do you want to come in for a coffee or something?
No, I got to get up early.
Okay, well...
Thanks for helping me.
You can find yourself another wheelman next time.
That's too bad
'cause I had my eye on this liquor store on the corner.
You heard the cop, you stay out of trouble.
( bumping door )
I'm sorry I almost got you arrested.
WOMAN: What's your problem?!
MAN: What's your problem?
My upstairs neighbors.
They sound like nice people.
They're at it again.
Somebody should go up there.
I'm sure they'll settle down in a minute
Mrs. Gottschuck.
Why don't you go back to bed?
( both chuckling )
I'll see you tomorrow.
All right, good night.
You'll tell Luka this was all your idea?
Yes.
Don't worry, I won't drop a dime on you, Carter.
You look beat.
I am.
How was Mrs. Tanzi's appendectomy?
Uneventful.
Hey, Rachel's still here.
Yeah.
I thought Jen was coming to get her.
Things didn't go quite as planned.
How's that?
As in, how do you feel about
Rachel staying with us for awhile?
Like the rest of the summer?
Maybe, maybe longer?
It could be handy having a live-in baby-sitter
and I'm sure she'll help around the house.
She's your daughter, Mark.
Of course she's welcome to live with us.
The fact that she's still here suggests
you've already told her she could.
You were in surgery.
So... do you guys have a satellite dish?
No.
No singed nasal hairs.
If you lean back far enough
the flame burns away from your face.
That's the key to fire-eating.
Yeah, so what happened today?
Usually I smear my 'stache with Vaseline
but today I forgot, so I used hair gel instead.
I, um, guess it was flammable.
Yeah, guess so.
Let's shave off the rest of the mustache and debride the skin.
You can't shave my mustache.
It's my trademark. Dude, it's half gone.
I'll get an extension or something.
I'll give you some Neosporin.
Give this to Dr. Carter.
Hey! He left.
So give it to someone else.
Look, Chief, I know you're pissed
but let's be real about this.
If you really wanted to axe me
you'd have to go through the residency review committee
and the disciplinary committee
and then they'd want to counsel me.
The best you'll get is a suspension.
You have five letters in your file
for unprofessional behavior...
Me and every other doctor here...
You have been counseled each time.
You have failed two rotations.
Yes, there will be a meeting of the residency review committee
and yes, they'll once again offer you counseling
but I'm telling you right now
you will never work in this E.R. again.
What the hell's your problem?
You, Malucci, you're my problem.
Why, because I don't kiss your ass?
I like to have fun sometimes but I'm a damn good doctor.
I had a half a dozen great saves today.
Being a good doctor is more than just great saves.
Oh, really, what?
I need to adopt your cheery attitude
and sparkling bedside manner?
This isn't about my performance, is it;
or my rotations?
You just don't like me.
You're right, I don't like you.
You have no respect for me, your coworkers
this hospital, anything-- you like to think
you have this whole "cowboy" approach to medicine.
But the truth is
you don't have the goods to back it up
so you make mistakes--
mistakes that kill people.
I need this job, you can't fire me.
I have a kid to support.
Since when?
You never said anything about being a father.
Did you ever ask?
You don't know a damn thing about me.
Well, I know you're fired.
You're a sad, cold-hearted bitch.
You know that? Call Security.
You don't like me, but nobody likes you. Get out.
You know why this stupid E.R.
is so damn important to you, lady?
Do you know why?
'Cause it's the only thing that you've got in your life.
Nazi dyke.
