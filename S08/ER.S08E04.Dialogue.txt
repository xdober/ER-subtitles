Previously on ER:
Marfan's is difficult to detect.
The residents have never heard of it...
Which is why we have attendings.
You had the right information.
You didn't bother to look at it.
We paged you three times.
You can't get rid of him
just 'cause the two of you don't get along.
They say you're not a real doctor
until you've killed
a few patients.
You don't know a damn thing about me.
I know you're fired.
You're a sad, cold-hearted bitch.
Luka and I broke up a few days ago.
Abby, I'm sorry if I hurt you. You didn't hurt me.
It's going to be a pain to lose Susan Lewis.
Big mistake.
Phoenix.
Bye!
Oh... sorry.
Oh!
Sorry.
MAN: His buddies said he just passed out.
FINCH: Passed out? There's rigor mortis
and lividity.
We had a bit of a crowded scene.
It was easier just to grab him.
Well, it's going to be harder to dump him.
Come on, Doc.
No. look, I'm not tying up a room
with a dead body.
Take him to the morgue.
You've got a morgue.
No, come on, let's go-- load him up.
We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone.
This is a county hospital.
Let me know when you start
paying taxes and wearing clothes.
This should be enough Elemite
and make sure all your bedding gets washed in hot water.
And the dog, too?
Sure, why not?
And make a follow-up appointment
with your regular health care provider.
This is our regular health care provider.
Right.
Hi, I'm looking for Mark Greene.
Talk to the clerk.
Dude, it only takes, like, two minutes
to freeze a wart off.
Actually less, but you still
have to wait like everybody else.
Hi, I'm looking for Dr. Greene.
Fill this out, take a seat over there.
No, I'm not a patient.
We're having lunch.
Chairs are thataway.
Okay, but you'll tell him I'm here?
I'll tell him.
You might want to know my name.
County General. Oh.
Excuse me.
Pardon. My fault.
Maybe you can help me.
I'm looking for Mark Greene.
Yosh? Labs back on gall bladder
in Exam One? Check with the computer.
He's a friend of mine.
Hold on.
Have you still not forgiven me?
My angelfish died.
I'll buy you another one.
There were two of them.
I'll buy you three.
Maybe you can help me.
I'm looking for Dr. Greene.
Check with the clerk.
Go ahead and call the mayor!
Shut us down for all I care!
Dr. Lewis!
Dr. Lewis.
Yes. Hi.
Ralph.
Ralph.
Ralph Binks.
Six years ago I was tapping
the electrical main downstairs.
Took 20 amps in the ass.
You treated me, said I was going to be just fine.
Right, right.
Well, I wasn't.
My life has been
a living hell of static cling since then.
So thanks, Doc.
Thanks for nothing.
MAN: Bet I know what you
came here for!
Is that it?
So she just got on a plane?
Sent for the twins the next day.
Haven't seen her since.
Dr. Kovac don't know what happened.
Dr. Kovac?
Tall, hunky guy, dark hair.
You can't miss him.
Can someone move Mr. Schnack
before we have to hold the wake ourselves?
Ah... She's still here?
Worse. She's in charge.
Excuse me, ladies, we have patients
breaking the eight-hour mark.
Don't be a stranger.
I won't.
Susan?
Hey, Kerry.
What a surprise.
Are-are you here for the ACEP Assembly?
No, I'm here on some interviews.
In Chicago?
I'm meeting Mark for lunch.
He's in with a bad GSW.
Yeah, I finally got someone to talk to me.
Who have you gone to?
What? Hospitals.
Oh. Rush, Northwestern, a couple of privates.
Looking for a staff position?
Mm-hmm.
Well, good luck with that.
Thank you.
Nice to see you again.
You, too.
Welcome back.
Sort of.
Do you mind?
I work here.
Chest cavity's filled with clot.
Sats are down to 60.
Lap pad.
Who's that?
Susan Lewis.
Your friend from Scottsdale?
Phoenix.
Says Scottsdale on the phone bill.
Metzenbaum scissors.
She looks great, doesn't she?
Pericardium's tense with blood.
What's she doing here?
We're supposed to have lunch.
There's a big bleeder underneath.
You didn't say anything about having a lunch.
I didn't?
No.
Can you feel the defect?
I just can't put my finger on it.
Something must have
It's "Miss."
Miss McDuffy.
Well, to start with: I'm tired
I'm depressed, I can't concentrate
I've got headaches-- oh, and hives--
and I'm bloated and constipated
and it hurts here, too.
Any chest pain?
Oh, that's the worst of all.
I see. Well, that just about covers everything.
Abby. Yeah.
Can we get a CBC, Chem 20, TSH, Free T4
troponin, CK with MB, lipase, EKG, chest X ray
urine and a culture?
That it?
I've got a yeast infection, too.
Wonderful.
Want to see it?
Maybe later.
Come on, be a sport-- do the pelvic.
I think that might just put me over the edge.
Into what? Celibacy?
Into taking it. You're not taking it.
I think I'm taking it.
You like it here too much.
Abby, I don't have a job here.
Weaver offered you shifts.
I can do shift work anywhere.
Northwestern.
It's tenure track clinical faculty position.
You want to be a professor now?
It's better job security.
Like you're in it for the money?
And my money says they have
yeast infections at Northwestern, too.
Well, I'll let you know.
If you really wanted it
you would have taken it by now.
I'm going to have to let them know.
They've clocked it. Clocked what?
I have to let them know by Friday.
Tomorrow's Friday.
I know.
John, can you take the hypochondriac
with the spider bite in Curtain Two?
You asking me or telling me?
Whatever gets you to do it.
I told the creep all we had
was travelers checks.
Wouldn't do him any good.
Pretty brazen for a mugger
to hit you in broad daylight.
Oh, he didn't hit us.
Stan tripped over a curb trying to get away.
Um, Dr. Weaver?
Yeah, I'll have the nurse
set you up with an ice pack.
He doesn't need an MRI?
Not this time.
Yesterday's positive list.
Make sure Frank routes them correctly this time.
Mm-hmm. Sure.
Last week the cafeteria ended up
with our UTI sensitivities.
Anything I should know about this meeting?
What meeting?
With Romano. Risk Management called me
so I'm assuming it's about the Marfan's death.
Oh.
Has there been a wrongful death suit filed?
In-house review is standard procedure
in this kind of circumstance.
It's not an M&M. These are lawyers, right?
Their job is to protect you and the hospital.
And assess exposure.
It's normal.
Dave was fired.
I just thought maybe...
Dr. Malucci's termination isn't reflective of anything.
There were other concerns
other issues involved.
Am I in trouble, here, Kerry?
I found it in my slipper.
I figure you need to milk it for anti-venom.
Actually, Chicago doesn't have any dangerous spiders.
It doesn't?
Mm-mm. Not native anyway.
So this one hopped on a bus across the border.
All I know is that little bastard took
a chunk of out my foot.
That looks like a flea bite.
Flea bite? I can feel the toxin
making its way to my heart.
One percent Hydrocortisone cream and Benadryl for the itching
and get yourself a flea bomb.
That's it?
That's it.
See, look, you've got this down.
Why would you want to leave it? Hmm.
WOMAN: Pardon, Miss?
What's your name again?
Abby.
I'm Nicole.
We met at the bar with Luka.
I was your waitress.
Right. Yeah.
What happened to your hand?
I cut myself.
Not bad, but I think it needs to be, uh...
How do you say?
Sutured.
Yeah, sutured.
That man-- he won't tell Luka I'm here.
He's so rude.
Hmm. Do you want me to take a look at it?
I was hoping Luka could look.
Well, Dr. Carter is very good at suturing.
Luka's not working today?
No, I think that he is.
Isn't he, Abby?
Yeah.
Sure. Come on, I'll get you a room.
Thank you.
Hey, don't hurt him.
What are you doing?
I'm letting him go. Why?
You said he was innocent.
Oh.
Frank, I think I need housekeeping in here.
Funny, that's not how I remember you.
Ow!
Son of a bitch!
That is.
Dr. Lewis!
What are you doing here?
Susan, Carter.
Right. Susan, hey.
Hi.
( laughing )
Oh. Well, would you believe I'm looking for work?
In Chicago?
Yeah. Never say never.
Oh, that's great.
Wow! You look...
different.
Yeah? You look, uh...
the same.
Are you, uh... interviewing?
Yeah. I have a meeting at Northwestern today.
Northwestern? Yeah.
A clinical faculty position?
Yeah. Why?
I was just offered that job.
Oh, no. It's in the ER.
No. I switched back to emergency medicine.
Oh. When?
Uh, forever ago.
So you must be Chief Resident.
Uh, no.
That would be Dr. Chen.
Deb Chen?
It's Jing-Me, now. Jing-Mei now.
Jing... what... Frank, what is it?
I don't know what she calls herself.
Yeah, so...
Hey.
( laughs )
( sighs )
Robert.
Hey, Kerry, what, are you lurking
around the men's room now?
You changing teams again?
You're scheduling meetings with my residents
without consulting me?
I'm sorry. Did you not get the memo?
What memo?
The one that says I run the place.
Yeah, Dr. Chen is my responsibility.
I expect to be notified
if she's to be questioned by Risk Management.
Fair enough. Consider yourself notified.
Good, I want to be there.
No, you don't. I don't even want to be there.
As Chief of the department
I try not to interfere
with Risk Management investigations.
So now it's an investigation?
Information gathering
whatever you want to call it.
They have a few questions.
Dr. Chen approached me.
She was scared.
She wants me to come with her.
She's a big girl.
She talked about lawyers.
Do you want it to escalate to that
or do you want me to come?
Does she have something to hide?
No, the truth is bad enough.
I think we should be trying to protect her.
You sure you don't have a little thing for her?
Oh, Robert.
Okay, fine.
3:00. Seventh floor conference room.
Good femoral with compressions.
Stop CPR.
( knocking )
No pulse, no pressure.
CORDAY: Your friend's back.
What do you feel?
Probable entry wound
in the left ventricle.
It feels ragged through the mitral valve.
How big? Too big.
Nothing's organized on the monitor.
He's gone. You want to call it?
Let's see if we can piece anything together.
Okay. I'll be right back.
O silk on a needle driver.
Hey, can you give me ten minutes?
Oh, yeah
if there's still an express to Oak Park.
Yeah. You look great. You look great, too.
HALEH: Dr. Greene.
Got a six-year-old boy
with vomiting and severe dehydration.
Get Cleo. He's got a genetic disorder.
Tachy at 120, B.P.'s 90/60.
You know what?
I don't want to be late.
I'll just come back after my interview.
Okay. That's great.
Elizabeth, how are you doing?
Forget it. Go.
Good to see things never change.
Knock 'em dead.
You, too.
How long has he been vomiting?
Three days straight.
He's dry as a bone.
And you waited 'till now to bring him in?
He has a geneticist at Mercy, but our insurance got messed up
and they weren't able to see us.
Is he Down's?
MOTHER: No. Trisomy 18.
I thought they didn't survive past age one?
They don't. He's special.
Yeah, uh...
Belly's hard as a rock.
Elizabeth, you better get in here.
Let's do a rectal temp.
I can do that if you want.
No, no. We'll let the nurse do it.
She only means she does it for him all the time.
What is it?
Possible bowel obstruction.
Six-year-old boy with Edward's Syndrome.
Six? I thought that was impossible?
Well, apparently not.
No luck with the IV.
Prep for a subclavian.
It feels like a loop of bowel.
I'll try to reduce.
Okay.
Um, it's probably perfed.
I'm surprised he doesn't have a fever.
He will. There's probably dead bowel
in addition to the obstruction.
Let's take him to the OR.
He's vomiting. Let's roll him.
MOTHER: Please, this has to stop.
Once we get the line in, we'll
give him some Compazine. HALEH: I'm in.
That's not what she's asking.
She wants you to give him something for the pain.
Titrate six of morphine. No, to end it.
What?
Please, just end it for him.
Haleh, I need to go upstairs.
Have each resident pick up at least two of the fast tracks
as soon as their sicker patients are tucked in.
They don't listen to me.
Oh, and make sure
Mrs. Hertel gets her gentamycin.
Two per kilo? Yeah.
You ready? What?
I'm going with you.
Why? What's wrong?
Nothing.
Dr. Romano assures me it's routine.
Then why are you going?
To represent the department, apparently.
Haleh.
Oh, God.
Jing-Mei, no one is out to get anyone.
You do this job long enough
you'll make a serious mistake.
That's true for everyone.
That's encouraging.
Mr. and Mrs. Schudy?
Has he stopped vomiting?
Yes.
We've given him morphine for the pain
and antibiotics and fluids.
You must think we're awful people.
No.
No, I think that, uh
when a child is this ill, emotions can escalate
and I don't think you really want
what you asked for.
No. No, of course we don't.
I don't know, maybe we're both just too tired.
Kenny needs round-the-clock care.
I imagine he would.
Just tell us what you need to do.
Well, your son has an incarcerated inguinal hernia
which we can repair-- it's a simple procedure--
but we will have to evaluate his internal organs.
If he's been obstructed for a while
he may need a colostomy.
How many has he had so far?
MR. SCHUDY: Four.
Three laparotomies and a VSD repair.
He's had more surgeries than birthdays.
I was opening for lunch.
The back gate gets stuck sometimes.
It doesn't look deep enough to suture.
Let's irrigate and give her some Keflex.
My boss wanted me to finish my shift.
He's such a...
What do they say here?
A capitalist?
What did he want me to do?
Bleed on everybody's food?
KOVAC: Good thing he let you off.
You don't want it to get infected.
NICOLE: He didn't let me. He fired me--
after a year of working there seven nights a week.
Abby, where's that irrigation kit?
( coyly ): It's coming, Dr. Kovac.
What?
I'll be right there.
There may be a little scarring.
Will you be able to find another job?
I don't know.
He kept saying he'd make problems with my visa.
I think he can, too.
Is everything okay back there?
Yeah. Yeah.
MAN: Had you looked at the X ray
do you feel that you would have recognized
the widened mediastinum?
CHEN: Yes, I think so.
Well, how confident of that are you?
I don't know. Confident.
Standard of care is to take a chest X ray to rule out
aortic dissection before ordering thrombolytics
correct?
That's right.
So why take one if you're not going to look at it?
Dr. Chen has already admitted to a critical error.
No need to belabor the point.
We're just trying to understand what happened.
The treating resident told me the X ray was clear.
He thought I meant hemothorax.
I thought he meant signs of dissection.
Dr. Malucci.
He's been terminated
since the incident.
That helps, I suppose.
In essence, the mistake was the result
of a miscommunication during a time-sensitive critical care situation.
Except for the chain of command issue.
What issue?
How did you get involved in this case?
Chief Residents or Attending are called on to sign off
on any use of thrombolytics.
Chief Residents who are Attending.
I am an Attending.
You are now
but at the time, you were five days
from officially completing your residency.
My appointment started July 1.
I was making up days from my maternity leave.
WEAVER: Dr. Chen was given the authority
of an Attending while a Chief Resident.
Prematurely.
If she wasn't Board eligible
she wasn't authorized to make this decision.
I thought I was.
Who was your Attending?
What?
Who was your Attending?
Dr. Weaver.
We're talking five days.
And where was Dr. Weaver?
Excuse me. I'm sitting right here.
You can ask me.
You're here as a representative of the department.
I'm interviewing Dr. Chen.
She was out of the hospital.
I was right across the street.
I was getting a meal with the understanding
that Dr. Chen would page me for critical cases.
And did you page her?
Yes.
Before or after you authorized
the use of thrombolytics?
Before and after.
I never received a page.
Three times total.
You could have come to get me.
I didn't know where you were. Carter knew.
He found me in time to stop you from cracking his chest.
LAWYER: Dr. Romano, this is precisely why I like to interview
participants separately.
WEAVER: The fact is
this is a systems error.
The cafeteria isn't open at 2:00 in the morning
so you need to leave the building to get a meal.
Hmm. You might consider brown-bagging it next time.
I'm done.
All right, well, this has been very enlightening.
Thank you, Dr. Chen.
I'm sorry?
You're excused.
Kerry, you stay.
That's got to be a record.
35 minutes for a finger cut.
Do you need something?
Nine-year-old scalp lac.
He's a handful.
They didn't pull you out of court, did they?
Good.
I thought you were going to take a stool sample.
I will, Miss McDuffy
but you have to go back and lie down.
Because I have to go.
I have a friend who's having
some trouble with her visa.
I thought you could help her out.
Do you know anything?
What?
About my condition.
Not until your labs come back.
Work visa... French.
Does the fact that I have bad B.O. mean anything?
That is entirely possible.
Great. I'll send her over.
You have to lie down.
Nicole.
Thanks, I owe you.
What?
Nothing.
I thought she was going to protect me.
She was going to protect herself.
What did you expect?
I don't know.
It just never occurred to me
that she had to protect her own ass.
Well, maybe your asses aren't mutually exclusive.
Yeah, well, that's why she's still up there and I'm down here.
Look, Weaver's political, that's true
but she's smart enough to protect her own.
I don't see it again.
What does it look like?
What? The spider.
Nat, it's a big insect-- big, hairy.
Right.
I mean, you're a reflection on her.
You were her choice for Chief Resident.
She'll defend you, if only to defend herself.
How's your back? Hurts like hell.
35-year-old male impaled himself
after a slip and fall off a roof.
How much blood loss at the scene?
Whoa. Not a lot. We packed around the wound
and stabilized it.
No KO. B.P. 100/70.
Don't touch me!
What was he doing on the roof?
Wife said he was trying to get free cable.
Where's my wife?
Bye, baby.
I can't believe we have to cut him open again.
Would you like me to go over the procedure with you?
No, we know it by heart.
Right, then I'll just need you
to sign the consent then.
It shouldn't take more than a couple of hours.
There's a waiting area just down the hall.
Do you have a cafeteria?
Uh, yeah, third floor.
It's the only time my husband and I
get to share a meal together--
when Kenny's in the hospital.
I understand.
Thank you.
BENTON: Any messages?
Elsa Alacaron called; said she doesn't want the job.
Did she say why?
No.
No new nanny yet?
No. Not one that signs.
Oh, yeah, right.
That must be hard to find.
You look tired.
So do you.
Parenting will do that to you.
Hi, this is Peter Benton.
I got your message.
I was... I was hoping you would reconsider.
If you could at least call me back
I would really appreciate it, okay?
Thank you very much.
( screaming )
What do we got?
Fragments into the peritoneum.
Ooh, that's a hell of a fragment.
B.P.'s down to 70.
Bolus two liters wide open.
Central line kit.
Can't you take that out? It's killing him.
We have to do it in the O.R. If we do it here
he could bleed uncontrollably.
Hemacue is ten.
You should take her outside.
Two units O-neg standing by.
( screaming )
Can't you give him something?
We did.
Melanie!
Possible diaphragmatic rupture.
Okay, let's red line him.
Melanie!
What?
I love you.
No, no. Shut up.
You're not saying that.
I do.
Stop it. You'll be okay.
Where's the O-neg? Waiting on Dr. Chen.
BENTON: Let's move.
Need some help?
No, I've almost got it.
Didn't she leave a guide wire in some poor schlub's chest?
That was over six years ago.
She was a medical student.
But now there's a pattern
and if we don't show that we took corrective measures
we could have real exposure
if she kills anyone else.
That's a little dramatic, don't you think?
The guy's dead. You can't get more dramatic.
There's no reason to think
that she's going to kill anyone else.
Can you guarantee that?
Oh, come on.
What happens the next time
you take a 20-minute break
off-campus, Kerry?
How much does the technicality in her status
really factor in?
You mean, can you end the blood trail with Chen?
I want to know what kind of support to expect.
For you or the department?
For me.
Well, I won't tell you what to do.
It's your ER, but I expect the family's going to want
accountability beyond Dr. Malucci.
B.P. 's stable at 110/60.
Mr. Warshaw? I'm Dr. Benton.
We're going to put you to sleep and make any repairs, okay?
No, don't.
Don't what?
Save me.
Mr. Warshaw, I know the medication
has you feeling a little strange, but don't worry.
You're going to be okay.
Just let me die.
Was this a suicide attempt?
Not that I know of.
Dr. Benton, your niece called.
Her car broke down. She can't pick up your son.
( stammering ): It-it has to be
an accident.
Mr. Warshaw, your family needs you
so just hang in there, okay?
They need the money more!
( yelling ) Oh, my God!
Grab his hands, grab his hands, grab them!
What the hell?
No pulse.
All right, starting compressions.
What happened?
Don't just stand there, bag him.
You want to tube him instead?
Still no pulse.
I need to clamp the aorta.
Here?
The O.R. is 20 feet away.
He'll never make it. Ten blade!
B.P.'s 40 and dropping.
Whoa, watch your step.
Ten blade.
I need scissors and a rib spreader, let's move!
I got to go to the O.R. and get a tray.
Forget it!
Help me pull this apart.
What? Just do it!
Here we go.
Oh, God... ( ribs cracking )
Got it! All right, let's get him in the O.R., move!
( classical music playing )
Mozart?
Yes.
I don't have time to listen to music anymore
except at work.
Up on the bovie.
Kids will do that to you.
God, have you ever seen this many adhesions?
Is it part of the disease?
That and heart defects, mental retardation
multiple gut problems.
Move to the right, Lizzie. What?
Your hands-- they're blocking his shot.
Make sure you get the cecum.
Robert, I'm in the middle of surgery.
No, you're in the middle of an historic case.
A six-year-old trisomy 18 has to be some kind of record.
Hey, I said stop it.
Don't forget, we need close-ups of the palmar creases
and rocker-bottom feet.
I hope you have permission to do this.
This is a teaching hospital, Lizzie.
It's in the interest
of science.
Oh, for God's sake.
Shirley, suction.
How these parents can keep this kid alive
in good conscience is beyond me.
Oh, get a shot of that.
Fistula end looks nice and pink.
Let's tack it down.
Okay, now, over here
this one's for the coffee table.
Smile, Lizzie.
Perfed the cecum up through the omentum
and the superior mesenteric vein.
I've got the cross-matched.
There's no answer at the garage. What?
Your brother-in-law isn't there.
Try my sister. What's her number?
555-0146.
The portal vein seems intact.
Oh, one, what?
Four, six.
What time is it?
Almost 4:00.
Sixth unit is up.
He's exsanguinating.
JACKIE ( on machine ): We're not home to take your call.
Leave a message and we'll get back to you.
Jackie, it's Peter.
Are you there?
I need you to pick up Reese.
No way I'm going to make it in time.
I'm stuck in surgery.
Jackie, if you're there, pick up.
Jackie.
Check the ostomy output Q six hours
and change the dressing.
How'd it go?
As well as it could, I suppose.
Where are they?
Who?
His parents.
I don't know.
I don't think they've been back
since you went in.
Are you sure?
They never checked in with me.
Well, they can't still be eating.
GREENE: So you're not going to take it?
Mark, he asked me out.
Consider it a bonus.
In the middle of the meeting.
Was he good-looking?
He spits when he talks.
So you're going to let a little saliva hold you back?
No big deal.
I have three more interviews set up.
Well, you could stop and come back here.
Yeah, right.
We're looking for an attending.
No, you're not.
Seriously.
You saw what it was like down there this morning.
Weaver didn't mention anything.
Ah, does that surprise you?
I thought it was cooler than a tattoo.
You could have at least called me, you know.
And say what?
"Hey, how's it going?
By the way, I have a brain tumor."
Or written a letter.
Oh, like the one you wrote me
telling me that you were engaged?
It wasn't an engagement, and it's over.
Is that why you're moving back
or did you collapse from heat exhaustion?
Well, after Chloe moved
there wasn't much reason to stay.
I can't follow my sister's family around forever
and I'm not exactly desert girl.
I just missed it here, you know?
The city, the weather...
you.
Hey, Mark.
Have you seen the Schudys in here?
Who?
The parents of the Trisomy boy.
Did he make it through surgery?
Yes, his eleventh.
Susan, this is Elizabeth, my wife.
Elizabeth, Susan.
Nice to meet you.
You, too.
Susan's moving back to Chicago.
Would you like some coffee?
I don't drink coffee.
I'm breast-feeding.
Excuse me.
She seems nice.
BENTON: Grade four liver lac.
Pressure's 60/nothing.
All right. Hang more blood.
Suction.
( suctioning )
What'd they say?
Hold on. They're deaf.
It has to go through the text translator.
Ask them if they can keep him there until 6:30.
Combination stellate lac
with elements of crush injury.
I'd start pressors if there was something left to press.
They can't. You have to make other arrangements.
Tell them it's an emergency!
And your son's getting upset. He's crying.
Hang up.
What?
Just hang up.
Tachy at 120.
555-0177. Put it on speaker.
Who's that? Just call it.
Suction. Get more lap pads.
Let's pack this thing off.
Change it.
Another clip.
ROGER: Hello?
Hey, Roger, it's Peter.
I wouldn't normally ask you, but I've got an emergency.
I need you to pick up Reese from school.
Everything all right?
Yeah, I'm in surgery.
Right now?
Yeah, Jackie's not around
and Joanie got stuck.
Uh, no problem, I'll take care of it.
All right, I'll pick him up after work.
Fine, don't worry.
I'm on my way.
Where the hell is vascular?
Dr. Mitchell will be here in ten minutes.
Ah, damn it!
Defib. He's ischemic.
More blood. Hold on.
More blood!
Can't go any faster.
Internal paddles, come on.
Won't work.
Charge to 15.
Clear.
Nothing.
Charge to 30.
Clear.
Let go of me!
Sit still, John Thomas.
Let the doctors look at your head.
It hurts!
I know. We're going to make it feel better.
No! John, we're going to give you a shot
so your head will stop hurting.
My name's John Thomas, and I don't want a shot!
This is why Daddy told you not to climb on his boat.
I wasn't climbing!
It's just going to be a small pinch.
I-I don't a small pinch!
If you stop crying
I'll take you to McDonald's.
I want to go to Toys R Us! McDonald's.
Toys R Us!
Ow! Ow!
Hold still.
I'm almost finished.
Stop it, John Thomas, or I'm going
to tell Daddy you were climbing on his boat.
I'll tell Grandma you were playing with Daddy's penis!
Ow! Ow! Ow!
( screaming )
I think he's going to Toys R Us.
Oh, yeah.
What?
I haven't seen you smile for a while.
Forgot how pretty you were.
Thank you.
I guess.
Oh! Can I help you?
Yeah. Find the big, hairy spider on the loose.
What?
Cleo, have you seen Kenny Schudy's parents?
Not since you sent him up to O.R.
I can't find them.
Did you try the chapel?
Yes, and the bathroom, and the snack areas.
Maybe they went home.
I don't know where home is.
LEWIS: You can't be serious.
Be like you never left.
Elizabeth, tell Susan what a great place this is to work.
Haven't the time.
Either she doesn't like me, or she's mad at you.
No, she's just focused.
Right.
Have you eaten yet?
No.
Let me buy you lunch.
I'm not hungry.
( sighs )
I want you to know I went on record against this
but the administration...
Am I being fired, Kerry?
No. No, no, of course not.
You're on a year's probation
and subject to a month's suspension without pay.
I argued your case to the best of my ability
but Risk Management feels that given your history
they needed to take corrective measures
to mitigate any further incidents.
My history?
The guide wire.
Oh, God, you're going to use that?
You'll also have to resign your Chief Residency.
What?!
I understand
how upsetting this must...
What about you?
Are you going to resign anything?
My involvement or lack thereof is not at issue.
Yeah, yeah, you made sure of that.
Look, this is only a temporary setback
after which you'll be back on track.
Were you even wearing your pager that night?
This isn't about me.
Someone obviously misdialed.
Yeah, just blame everyone but yourself, Kerry.
Look, I'm sorry that this had to happen...
You are not sorry... just relieved.
Jing-Mei, I...
Go to hell, Kerry.
I quit.
WEAVER: No, she wasn't terminated. She resigned.
You needed to demote her?
Risk Management seemed to think there might be
some liability issues involved.
Oh, right. I bet.
What do you mean?
This is a teaching hospital.
Exactly, and she was the one who was supposed
to be doing the teaching.
Jesus, Kerry, who you cutting loose next?
Look, I'm going to miss her, too.
This saddens me, too.
It's easy for you to be upset and angry
about it when you don't have to manage the situation
but guess what, I'm angry and upset, okay?
I mean, I think it sucks
only I don't have anyone to complain to.
You're asking me to feel sorry for you now?
No.
I just wanted you to know what was going on.
Hopefully, this will be the last person
I'll change for a while.
I want to hire Susan.
Lewis?
Yeah. If you have a problem with that
bring it up at the next staff meeting.
We need doctors, Kerry.
Mom and Dad stayed just long enough
to give consent, huh?
Doesn't mean anything.
The entire document is a lie.
Fake phone numbers, phony addresses.
I'm not even sure his real name is Kenny.
God knows he can't tell us.
20,000 bucks later
and only his parents have any quality of life.
Probably in the Bahamas by now.
He requires an enormous amount of care.
Obviously, it became more than they could handle
after six years.
Yeah. Boo-hoo.
Robert, it had to be extremely draining on them
physically, emotionally.
You want to be a parent?
Shut up and do your job.
Nice workout, Peter.
Flogging a dead guy for an hour.
Probably burned a thousand calories.
( TV playing )
Mrs. Warshaw?
He lost his job six months ago.
Said it was the worst thing that could happen to us.
He lied.
Your husband came in with severe injuries.
We tried everything we could to save him, but...
he died.
I am sorry.
He never told me why he wanted cable so bad.
We don't need cable.
Is there a way to stop it from happening again?
Get her to stop picking her nose.
Honey...
Did you order a beta on Karen McDuffy?
The hairy woman? Yeah.
No, it's about the only thing I didn't order.
You should have. She's pregnant.
Huh! What?
Yep. I guess there really is
someone for everyone.
Um, no. I think he went home.
Oh.
Oh, that smells good.
What is that?
Chocolate chip cookies with a little oatmeal.
I made them to thank him.
He got his immigration lawyer to help me.
That Luka. What a great guy.
Do you want one?
Oh, no. They're Luka's.
I would never touch Luka's cookies.
No, please, have one.
Are you sure?
Yeah, I've made plenty.
Is he working tomorrow?
I don't know. Is Luka working tomorrow?
I don't know, I don't know.
Can you make sure he gets them?
Sure.
Mmm! You better put these in your locker.
These are good.
Really?
Yeah. Maybe the best
I've ever tasted.
Thank you.
No, thank you.
All right. I appreciate it, Abby.
Any time.
Carter, I need to speak with you.
What is it?
Privately.
Is something wrong?
Uh, there's not enough time for our nomination process
and practically speaking
it'd be better to have someone
who's familiar with both staff and procedure.
You lost me.
If you want the Chief Residency, it's yours.
Dr. Chen resigned.
Are you sure? I just talked to her.
20 minutes ago.
Is she serious?
I don't assume it's something she'd do lightly.
She resigned the Chief Residency
or she resigned altogether?
Altogether.
What happened?
It's unfortunate. I can't talk to you about it.
But it has to do with the Marfan's Syndrome death?
I can't talk about it.
But I want you to know that your circumstance aside
I should have chosen you for the Chief Resident
in the first place.
And the truth is you've handled yourself and your recovery
with grace and confidence
and I appreciate your professionalism.
Thank you.
So I assume it's a yes?
Um, can I have some time to think about it?
Well, sure. Find me in the morning.
Get housekeeping to clean that up.
You call me back for something important
but you have no idea where it is?
I know exactly where it is.
It's just not there right now.
This is crazy.
Voila.
How come I have a feeling
this could have waited till I finished unpacking?
It's all about momentum.
Open it up.
Oh, my God.
You saved this.
Yeah, well, someone found it
a couple years ago when they moved the laundry.
I was going to send it to you.
Peeling paint, frequent fliers, the lousy pay
you know you want it.
This is very sweet
but you're not winning me over.
I already told Kerry that it was a done deal
so if you pull out now
it would make me look really stupid.
You serious?
Signed you up for Tuesday.
It's mildewy.
I'll dry-clean it.
Hey. Hey.
How's he doing?
Good, good.
We, uh, we played, had some spaghetti.
He conked out about half an hour ago.
Listen, Roger, I really appreciate this man, thanks.
No problem.
It was nice. I miss it.
Yeah. So, how you doing, man?
( sighs ): You know.
I miss Carla, too.
Yeah.
Want me to get him?
No, no, no, no. I got it. I got it.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey, Reese.
It's time to go on home.
Come on, come on, it's late.
No, we can't. We must go home.
Reese, come on.
He's half asleep, Peter.
Maybe you should let him stay the night.
I don't want to bother you.
No, it's no bother.
( sighs )
All right.
I can drop him off in the morning.
No, no, I'll come by.
About what time?
9:00?
Sure.
LEWIS: It's true.
GREENE: No, it isn't.
( laughing ): It is.
You're right
CHEN: I always knew she was capable
of stuff like this.
I guess I fooled myself into thinking
that she wouldn't do it to me.
She offered you the job yet?
I'm not sure that I want it.
Yes, you do. You've always wanted it.
I'll pass, if it means you'll stay.
You should take it.
I don't want to be here anymore.
Really.
If it's not you, it'll be somebody else
and I'd rather it be you.
Are you going to try and stay in Chicago?
I don't know.
I think there's still a spot open at Northwestern.
Promise me, John, that whatever
sacrifice you make for this place
you just make sure it's worth it.
( crying )
( dance music plays )
( background conversation )
How's it going?
Fine.
Uh, vodka, please.
On the rocks?
Neat.
Here you go.
Thanks.
Another round?
Yeah, four, thanks.
