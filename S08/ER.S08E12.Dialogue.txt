Previously on ER...
And I'm not leaving this house.
And I don't care if I'm uninvited.
I'm not going to let your father break up this family.
You said you were picking up. Who's lying now?
You're right. The truth is
I was searching your room because I don't know
if I can trust you.
You came on to me.
You are not out.
( quietly ): I am not out at work.
I don't got time for this.
No, I got stabbed!
Where the hell were you?
Are you going to blame me for taking drugs?
I am blaming you for not being my mother!
MAN: Who? Who was it?
Who the hell were you talking to?
WOMAN: The shopping network, I swear.
At 3:00 in the morning?
I couldn't sleep.
I just wanted some earrings.
Don't lie to me!
No, stop it, Brian!
Who were you talking to?!
Nobody!
Who?!
Nobody, I swear. Brian, please!
Call the police!
Shut up!
Please, call the police!
Shut the hell up!
Stop it, Brian, stop it!
Shut your lying...
( loud thud )
...filthy mouth! ( woman screaming )
( woman screaming )
Rachel?
Can't sleep?
I was hungry.
What are you eating?
PB and chips.
It's good.
Pass some over.
Did I miss the part
where the giant tomato's chasing Mason Dixon down the sidewalk?
You know this movie?
It's a classic.
I don't really get it.
What's to get?
The tomatoes are killers.
Yeah, I figured that part out.
This is good.
Told you.
This reminds me of when I used to get up at 5:30
in the morning to watch the Smurfs with you.
You liked Smurfs?
No, you liked the Smurfs.
I liked the news.
So we did what I wanted to do.
It's hard to argue with a two-year-old.
( both chuckle )
Seems like last week.
We need some milk.
Watch this.
What?
Watch.
( Rachel laughing )
Ooh, it's gross!
This is so stupid.
( still laughing )
You weren't out, were you?
Nah, I went for a walk.
Where?
Nowhere.
At 3:00 in the morning?
It's the only time I can.
Except you can't.
I'm under house arrest now?
Not yet, but you're making me think about it.
You talk to my teachers
screen my calls, search my room, which even...
Rachel... my guidance counselor
considers totally uncool.
Okay, that's enough.
I have to report to the hospital
after school. It's like living in a prison.
Go to bed.
CORDAY: Mark?
Here comes the warden.
Hey! Why won't you just
for once treat me like a thinking person?
What's going on? When you start showing
a little better judgment, maybe I will.
Yeah, I should've when I decided to come live with you.
I said turn it off!
I want to watch the movie!
Well, that's too bad.
I'm calling Mom. I'm moving back to St. Louis.
It's not that easy.
Why? You don't want me here anyway.
Hey, quiet, both of you.
You're going to wake the...
( loud slam )
( baby crying )
...baby.
All set, ma'am.
Your complaint will be kept on record.
My complaint?
What about hers?
She says it was just an argument.
Well, yeah, it was an argument--
he was beating the crap out of her.
OFFICER: She says he wasn't.
She was screaming
for help.
Not anymore.
LOCKHART: Is that it?
Not much else we can do.
But we appreciate the call.
BRIAN: Hey, let's get some sleep, honey.
You must be a real light sleeper.
( kettle whistling )
Oh. Did I wake you?
Late shift.
I'm sorry.
No, I had to get up in two hours anyway.
You don't drink coffee.
Actually, I do.
I distinctly recall you hating coffee.
Yeah, when I was 15.
Oh, it wasn't that long ago.
What would you like for breakfast?
( chuckling )
You're offering to cook?
Momentary weakness, take advantage.
All right, eggs.
Have you, um...
spoken to your father recently?
Uh, yeah. He called a couple days ago.
Where's he staying?
He, uh, rented a place on Michigan.
Scrambled?
Whatever.
Do you have his number?
Yeah.
Why?
He didn't give it to me.
Well, I'm sure that he intends to.
Did he say something?
Maybe you should just let it sit for a little while.
( cracks egg loudly )
Actually, I was hoping that you would call him for me.
Sure.
Or better yet
the three of us could dip ourselves in a vat of acid.
We made mistakes, John.
I made mistakes, I know.
But I don't believe that it's too late to fix it.
Sorry.
I know we argue a lot.
We didn't mean to bother you.
You were screaming for help.
I know.
I called help.
Brian and I have been together since high school.
And there's a lot of history and a lot of passion...
Passion?
Anyway... I'm sorry to bother you.
Is it your ankle?
I'm okay.
Let me take a look at it.
I don't need any help, really.
Joyce.
I'm sorry. I'm late for work.
LEWIS: It's got to be hard for her.
Well, she should deal with it herself.
Maybe she doesn't know how.
My mother's not the retiring sort.
She's tougher than he is.
Well, nobody's tough
when their life's falling apart.
( sighing )
You haven't met her yet. Oh.
They're out of vanilla.
Thanks. Jennifer Lampkin.
Yeah, her ex-husband.
WEAVER: Where are we on Mrs. McCabe's gall bladder?
I convinced Surgery to take her.
How'd you manage that?
I explained that she had been to the ER over ten times.
That pain meds and a clinic appointment were
no longer appropriate.
And they accepted that?
Even got her paperwork started for Medicaid.
That's excellent. I have attendings
that can't turf a stable patient to Surgery.
Have her call me at the hospital.
It's about Rachel. Thanks.
What?
Someone's a teacher's pet.
Rumor is he's about to be promoted
to hall monitor.
No. CARTER: What's all this?
Weaver's got a crush.
Oh, yeah. I thought I noticed
a little something there.
Mm-hmm. Or I'm doing well on my rotation.
Whatever it takes.
WEAVER: Michael, have you ever seen the erythema multiformae?
Just in the books.
Come here. Now's your chance.
Oh, so it's Michael now, is it?
( laughter ) OLBES: Anybody home?
MARQUEZ: Dr. Greene, 42-year-old prisoner
with stab wounds to the face and abdomen.
Good vitals. ETA ten.
Uh-huh, give it to Susan.
She's great with inmates.
Thank you.
OLBES: David Zachery, beat up in a brawl
in an after-hours hip-hop club. No LOC.
You having any trouble breathing, David?
Ain't my name. He goes by Dimon Z.
You have any chest pain?
BP 120/70, pulse 90.
No, my back, and the twins is moping, man.
What?
I got some serious jug damage.
What does he mean?
My boys hurt.
Ah. Did you get kicked?
Not there.
Okay, can you wiggle your toes?
Oh, damn, that kills!
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What happened to your lip?
Some bitch with a ring.
What started all this?
Bunch of thugs looking to crank a name.
Oh, yeah? Dimon's famous?
A major label signed him just a month ago.
Hey, Chuni, can you give...
Aisha.
...a room? Sure. Come on.
You take care of my man, all right?
WEAVER: What's a common
etiology other than drug reaction?
Viral infection.
Any one in particular?
FRANK: Dr. Weaver, Sandy Lopez called you back.
Herpes? What?
Herpes Simplex Infections. That girl fire fighter.
Right. Sandy Lopez from the 38?
That hot one?
The gay one.
Get out of here.
My cousin Rico used to have a huge crush
on her in high school.
She wouldn't even give him the time of day.
Yeah, well, I've seen your cousin Rico.
I don't blame her.
Abby, 50 of Benadryl in Exam One
and cover the lesions with one percent hydrocortisone.
I just got here.
Clock in and get busy.
She said she'd stop by
before her shift to see you.
What? Lopez.
Are you guys friends?
I treated a man in her unit last night.
15-foot fall, femur fracture, blunt head trauma.
Gallant, let's get a good neuro exam on Mrs. Barisch.
Abby, are you okay?
What?
You look a little... tired.
Thank you, Frank.
LEWIS: Abby, grab a gram of Cefotetan.
BP stable, pulse 100, protecting his airway.
That your prisoner?
Yeah, what happened?
He must have been jumped in County holding.
He's testifying against a lifer.
I didn't snitch.
I was subpoenaed.
No blood in the nares.
Foreface stable, neck non-tender.
You're beautiful.
Thank you.
Four, maybe five superficial cuts
no deeper than the sub-cue.
Draw up 40 cc's of lidocaine.
No rebound or guarding.
Push a hundred mikes of fentanyl.
No. No drugs.
You're in pain.
It reminds me I'm still alive.
Push the meds.
They must be next door.
You got the narc keys, Yosh?
CARTER: No scrubs?
I didn't have time to change.
Where's the foley?
Belly's benign, nontender.
Dimon, we're going to have
to put a tube in your penis, okay?
( groaning ): You are so wrong.
It might be uncomfortable.
For you, 'cause I ain't doing it.
We have to check your urine for blood.
I'll pee in the cup, dog.
Keep that tube away from me.
Carter, your dad's on line two.
Can you take a message for me?
DTR's are two plus and equal
toes down going bilaterally.
Where's the fentanyl?
All we have is morphine.
They haven't restocked. Try the lock-up.
Hemacue is 14, urine dip's positive for heme
and leukocyte esterase.
Gross blood?
No, but it's cloudy.
Okay, send a UA.
Over 50 red cells and we'll image the kidneys.
Where did Abby go?
I need another 20 of lido with epi.
MARQUEZ: I'll get it.
Hey, he says he'll call you
when he gets to New Orleans.
What? Your dad.
He's flying to New Orleans at 3:00.
What?
How about a head CT?
It's not necessary.
Well, she's never had headaches before.
What if it's a subarachnoid bleed?
That presents as sudden onset of severe pain.
She's got a mild chronic headache.
Well, she could have hydrocephalus.
I think a CT is a good idea.
An outpatient work-up should be fine.
Okay.
Hi, it's Kerry.
I heard you were going to come by
before your shift, but...
I'm a little backed up here, so let me call you later.
Thanks, bye.
Where's Aisha at?
DIMON: Getting her lip sewed up.
Marcus Welby, I'm going to live?
No internal injuries.
I was worried they put a cap in you, man.
When I go, brah, I'm taking the world with me.
Can I talk to you for a sec?
This is my boy, CC.
Hey. I want to go over your lab results.
It's cool. He can stay.
I got to stay in bed for a week
and be waited on hand and foot?
The l-s-spine series looks good.
( softer ): But your urine was cloudy.
That why it burns when I whiz?
Yeah, you've got chlamydia.
Chlamydia?
Good news is, it's very treatable.
You get that from nasty booty, right?
It's sexually transmitted, yeah.
No, Aisha's clean.
You got any other partners?
No, man, I love my girl.
Are you two practicing safe sex?
Ain't hurt nobody yet.
That would be a "no."
Are you saying Aisha's stepping out?
Well, let's run some more labs.
We'll see where we are.
I'm going to need to get
your consent for the HIV test.
No, man, she's true.
No, no, it's standard for any patient with an STD.
He needs one of those?
Mm-hmm. I'll have a nurse come back, draw some blood.
Whatever, man.
Hey, can I get some more pudding?
I will see what I can do.
Abby, when you get a chance, can I get a red top in Two?
Yeah.
You okay? You look a little...
Don't say it. ...tired.
That seems to be the general consensus.
Too much clubbing?
Well, I was up most of the night.
Really?
Not for fun.
Well, I don't know, but I saw Frank
a little drag-ass this morning, too.
You caught me. I was up all night
slapping Frank's ass raw.
Raw?
You haven't seen him sit down today, have you?
Come to think of it...
Hey, Frank, have you sat down today?
What? Nothing.
You a little sore today?
No, why?
Uh, your split lip vagalled when she saw the lidocaine needle.
Aisha?
Mm-hmm, the rapper's girlfriend.
Better add on a DNA probe. He's got chlamydia.
Dad, hey, I got your message.
No, I was wondering if you wanted to squeeze in lunch.
Dr. Weaver, Romano called again.
What did you tell him?
Told him you were tied up. Good.
He said to leave your personal life at home
and get to his office pronto.
Well, no, if you're already at Midway
I'll just come meet you there.
Yeah.
Okay, see you there, bye.
Hey, John, do you know why Dr. Chen is here?
Deb's here?
Did she say anything to you?
No, actually, you know I haven't really talked
to her lately.
Doctor, listen...
I wanted to ask you.
Can I get me one of them tests?
What test?
Chlamydia.
You know, that's only
contagious through sexual contact.
Right.
Right.
Okay, right.
Uh, Abby, can you start a new chart here?
Sure.
You can never trust these ETAs.
You know I'm still waiting on that hypotensive TC?
Got diverted to Mercy.
Oh, great.
I'm waiting for a chest pain.
Hey, did you reach her?
Who?
Jen.
Hmm.
What did she say?
She wants to think about it.
Think about it? She's her mother.
Well, we can't let Rachel make these decisions, you know.
Act up, get angry at one
and then punish us by moving back to the other.
You know, Mark, you might consider boarding school.
She could use some structure.
Yeah, I could sell her off to pirates.
You develop a sense of self-worth
community, responsibility.
It worked well for me.
Yeah, but...
But what?
You're British.
Mark, she's out of control.
Thank you, Elizabeth, I'm aware of that.
Yes, and she's disrupting our entire life.
I am working on it.
Are you? Or are you just waiting for it to blow over?
Julio Echeverria, passed out in a cab line
at the Bismark Hotel.
GCS 14, complaining of shortness of breath and chest pain.
Mr. Echeverria, any heart problems?
I don't think so.
How many am I getting?
Maybe three more.
( groaning )
You got lucky. These cuts aren't deep.
Whoever did this didn't want to kill you.
I'm well liked.
Or you did it yourself.
Misplace that "Get out
of Jail Free" card?
Yeah, something like that.
You're the first woman I've talked to in 14 months.
Yeah, I get that a lot.
In high school I was voted most likely to marry a convict.
You know, you don't have to do that.
It could get infected.
Yeah, I wouldn't want to die
before they get a chance to kill me.
You're on death row?
Cell number FD414.
Scheduled June 6, 02.
The almanac says it's going to rain.
Who believes the weatherman?
Yeah.
Well, at least I know how and when and where.
Not like all these poor saps you see every day
who go to work in the morning
after fighting with their wives
and never get the chance to say...
I'm sorry
or...
good-bye.
Uh...
I'm out of gauze.
Could you, would you, uh...
would you keep me here a while?
Just so...
I don't have to be there...
a little bit longer?
Uh...
you might need to be observed for a couple hours.
Thank you.
Kinney, let her go.
I'll straighten him out.
Uh, that's all right.
Don't lose my tie. It's a rental.
We'll put everything into a bag.
Where were you going?
Our Lady of Grace.
Pulse is 90, sats is 95%.
Bilateral crackles to about
two-thirds of the way up.
EKG.
Rather harsh pansystolic murmur.
You have cardiac damage.
Maybe a heart attack that started last night.
I have to go. It's my daughter's wedding.
I'm afraid you're going to miss it.
( gagging )
Emesis basin!
( retching, splattering )
An aspirin and five of Metoprolol.
Probably mitral valve regurgitation.
We'll need to do an echo.
Mr. Echeverria, you're too sick to go anywhere.
We're going to have to put you on a monitor.
Would you like us to call your daughter?
( coughing )
No, don't ruin it.
She'll wonder where you are
when there's no one there to give her away.
She won't.
That was fast.
Nucleic acid amplification test.
Pretty new.
What'd it say?
Positive for chlamydia.
But we can clear that up
with a single dose of Azithromycin.
Is that okay with protease inhibitors?
You're HIV positive?
For a year now.
I do the clinics.
Does Aisha know this?
Aisha?
No.
Zachery.
Thanks. Uh, are you on the triple cocktail?
My CD4's pretty good
but I'm just hoping they'll develop
a once-a-day before too long.
Wait here.
* I hung with this girl, her name was Lydia *
* She was so freak, she gave me chlamydia. *
That ain't even funny.
( both chuckling )
Aisha, can you give us a minute?
Get me a soda, boo.
Root beer?
You know it.
Whassup?
Your rapid HIV test came back.
Yeah?
Aw...
No way.
I come here with a bum back, and you're telling me--
I'm sorry.
I don't do needles, and I ain't no faggot.
Well, you're positive.
How?
I don't know.
But Aisha should be tested, too.
I told you, she's clean.
She needs to be tested anyway.
I got confidentiality, right?
Mm-hmm.
You can tell her yourself.
What if I don't want to?
She's at risk. You need to tell her.
The high five is heavy.
I ain't letting that word spread.
Dimon, it is really important that we find out
how you contracted the virus.
No root beer, D. Grape?
Let's jet.
You need to sit back in the chair.
This is messed up. We're out of here.
No, Aisha, I need to take another look at your lip.
There's a chance we might need to run some more tests.
She's fine. You could be at risk for a range of STDs.
At risk? What's going down?
Don't get into it now. You got it, didn't you?
Back off, bro. You got to come clean, man.
What are you talking about?
Shut it! We're past the fronting here, dawg.
You a punk, dawg. D.! Are you tripping?
Shut up. What is wrong?
We're ghost. Hey, Malik?
What are you doing?
ROMANO: Enter.
Ah, Kerry.
Your response time is impressive, as always.
I didn't know that we had a meeting.
You remember Dr. Chen.
I'm on shift, Robert.
Dr. Chen would like to be reinstated.
We're fully staffed at the moment
but if something opens up, I'll keep you in mind.
I'm not asking you to consider it.
It was your choice to step down.
I've changed my mind, then.
Oh, I'm sorry that only with hindsight
you've decided...
I didn't decide anything.
You decided I was expendable.
I'm not the doctor that blew out that man's aorta.
No, you're the doctor who wasn't there.
You were reprimanded for making
a mistake, but rather than accept it... The only mistake I made
was allowing you to sacrifice me... You ran away in anger
rather than accept any responsibility. ...like you did Malucci
to save your own ass!
Easy, ladies! If I want to see a good cat fight
I'd watch The View. Let's try to keep this civil.
I respect your abilities as a doctor
but the position's already been filled.
We're prepared to file suit unless that
and two other conditions are met.
Dr. Chen's record needs to be expunged
and an official statement of correction
attached to her file.
We're trying not to tarnish any more reputations here.
I don't respond well to threats.
Dr. Weaver... No, you know what?
You can't screw up and then whine about being mistreated.
Jing-Mei, you need to grow up.
I don't think it's broken
but I want to get an X-ray just to be on the safe side.
He's got it, doesn't he?
What do you mean?
Dimon. He's got the high five.
What?
HIV.
You know we can't discuss
Dimon's medical status with anybody but him.
I feel you.
But I see he's tripping 'cause he...
he never hit me before.
Does he know that you're HIV positive?
My viral load's been zero and he only gives.
I told him wear a rubber anyway.
He said what for?
Wasn't sex to him.
He's on the DL.
Uh, the DL?
Down low.
See, he ain't gay.
He can't be a faggot and be legit.
He only does guys 'cause women get so stressful.
Uh, does Aisha know about this?
I was just keeping it going...
waiting for the day
he'd come around and get real.
I didn't even think about her.
CC, it is really important that we find her.
She has a pager, but I don't know the digits.
You think you can get it?
I can try.
Thank you.
Let's order a water's view to rule out an inferior orbital rim fracture.
I got a lunch. Just page me if he gets that number.
So "down low" is bisexual?
No, on the side, in secret.
In the closet.
No, to be in the closet you have to be gay.
He is gay.
CC's gay, Dimon's on the down low.
Well, if he's having anal sex with his friend, he's gay.
Not to him. He's got a girlfriend.
He just sort of gets down with his buddy for release.
Uh-huh, so down low means "in denial"?
Yeah, basically.
Have you injured it before?
Not that I remember.
You feel a pop or a snap?
Uh, I'm not sure...
Over the bone or to the side? Both.
Okay, there? Yeah!
Oh...
All right, that's a pretty good sprain.
How'd you do that?
Oh, my husband bought me those roller shoes for Christmas.
I was practicing.
Turns out I was a little worse than I thought.
Has the swelling increased?
You triage her?
No, we're neighbors.
I saw her this morning.
Oh, could be an avulsion off the lateral malleolus.
Get an ankle series.
Is it broken?
I don't see a fracture
but Dr. Weaver's going to have to check it out.
Am I going to have to get crutches?
Maybe until you can bear weight.
You're definitely going to need some help
getting around for a few days.
How are you getting home?
I'll call Brian.
It's not all him, you know.
I give as good as I get.
Well, I don't see him sitting in an ER
needing X-rays.
Well, that's not the way it seems.
Our walls are pretty thin, Joyce.
He's the only guy I've ever loved.
Will you talk to a social worker?
Someone with experience who could maybe help you
lay out some ways you might want to deal with this?
Joyce...
I think you came here for a reason.
I can help you.
Yeah, I came here
'cause I didn't want to answer a bunch of questions.
WEAVER: And if a patient with the same history
and exam presents again tomorrow
I expect you to order the work-up I requested today.
Do you understand? Yes ma'am.
Dr. Weaver, glad I caught you.
You can go away now.
I was going to have you paged
but I couldn't be sure you'd be wearing your pager.
Robert, you're not going to be intimidated by these baseless accusations?
Oh, they have someone on record, Kerry.
About what?
Some waitress at that dump across the street said
that you were in there looking for your pager
the night Chen and Malucci killed that guy.
It's an important detail, don't you think?
Robert... I don't need to hear it, Kerry.
No explanation, no spin.
Just fix it.
Fix what?
All she wants is an attending position
with standard pay scale
and a personal apology from you.
No, I-I can't do that.
Well, there's a first time for everything.
I wouldn't have any kind of authority over her.
We've settled with this dead kid's family.
I am not going to open it back up again
because you have a management problem
created by your own negligence and deceit.
She's not interested in taking down you or the hospital.
All she wants is her job back.
Give it to her today.
And super-glue that pager to your forehead if you have to.
Excuse me.
I'm looking for Julio Echeverria.
He had a heart attack.
Check in at the desk down the hall.
Dr. Weaver, I need help in Trauma Two.
That's Dr. Lewis.
Sats are dropping.
What's wrong with him?
I don't know.
15 liters by mask.
( labored breathing )
Sir, I need you to take a deep breath.
Did you get a 12 lead?
No ischemic changes.
What happened?
Hyper-resonant with decreased breath sounds on the right.
Lung exam was normal 15 minutes ago.
Is this new?
Yeah, they had to straighten me out.
Prep for a chest tube. I need lidocaine.
What are you doing?
A broken rib collapsed your lung.
We need to put a tube in your chest
to help you get more oxygen.
No. We have to.
I don't want it.
You'll die if we don't reinflate your lung.
I don't care, I'm ready.
Ten blade.
Hold on, Kerry.
We need consent.
I'm dead anyway.
Please... Kerry.
( patient gasping )
Curved Kelly.
Susan, I need the Kelly now.
Please... they'll keep beating on me...
Susan, open up some Vaseline gauze.
( louder gasping )
Susan, now.
Sorry, I was looking for a parking place.
Oh, you want a drink? I'm boarding.
I should be boarding now.
Oh, no, thanks.
So what's so urgent?
Nothing, really.
I was just checking in.
So how's the new place?
Sparsely furnished, but there's something to be said for that.
For sparseness?
Clarity, although if I knew your mother
was moving into the house
I would've taken some of the New York furniture.
Yeah, she mentioned to me
that she doesn't have your new number.
Hmm.
You should give her a call, check in.
Why?
You were married to her.
She wants to negotiate.
I don't know when she started looking at life
the way other people read the stock reports, but, uh, it's over.
I don't think she shares that assessment.
You're her ambassador now?
No.
No, I'm just suggesting...
you take time to make sure this is what you want.
I do, thanks to you.
Me?
Mmm, I was part of this lie
this illusion we were living in order to hold it together.
It took losing Dad and thinking about what you said
to make me see that, uh...
I was lost.
I can't find my way back with her.
I don't know.
I've never ever seen her reach out like this before.
That's my flight.
Careful, John...
she's an emotional vampire.
Is he dying?
He's had a pretty big heart attack.
He may need surgery to replace a valve.
Why didn't you tell me you were coming?
I was scared you wouldn't want me there.
After all this time, you show up now?
I've got 200 people waiting.
Please, go, go...
and be happy.
Six years... and nothing?
Why, papi?
I should've let you come back home.
It was a mistake.
Why now?
My little girl's getting married.
MARIA: It's supposed to be the best day of my life.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to ruin it.
And you're not going to.
I'm happy now.
Rene is a wonderful man...
and I don't need you anymore.
Maria...
Miss Echeverria...
I've got the best caterer in all Chicago
setting up for me at the Hilton.
Let me talk to you for a minute.
Nothing's refundable.
Your father is very sick.
I don't care.
You don't want to leave it like this.
Just like he didn't care when I called him from Wichita
begging him to let me come back home.
He wanted to see you get married.
Look, he abandoned me, okay? Turned his back.
Nobody does that.
Only a stubborn, cold, heartless man!
He's trying to reconnect.
You're not going to make me cry.
This makeup took three hours.
He was fine when I left him.
I didn't touch him.
He has broken ribs and a collapsed lung.
He was flailing against the side rails.
We had to restrain him.
With your night stick?
Why do you care? He's a murderer.
He killed two teenage kids on their way to a movie.
( crashing )
Oh, my God! Get it off of him!
What happened? I don't know.
I was looking at the X-ray and he just flipped the gurney.
Mr. Kinney, are you all right? Help us!
Wait, chest tube's out of the thoraseal.
Asystole! No, no, no, no. He pulled his leads off.
One, two three.
Mr. Kinney?
Pulse ox is dropping to 85.
Mr. Kinney, open your eyes.
Blood from the ear canal.
Mr. Kinney?
Left pupil is nine millimeters and sluggish.
GCS is 1-2-1.
Probably an epidural bleed.
20 of etomidate, 100 of sux. 8-0 ET tube.
Bag him, Susan.
Kerry.
Get a head CT and call neurosurgery.
Kerry, the guy's going to die
in a couple months by lethal injection.
Bag him now.
He asked for no heroic measures.
He's a death row inmate attempting suicide.
He can't ask for a DNR.
Tube him-- now.
Whatever you say, Kerry.
Hey.
I got your message.
Yeah, we've been backed up all day.
You told me to come by.
Actually, I left another message on your machine
that I would get back to you later.
Well, I'm here, okay?
I came to see Marty from the 38.
So what did you want to say?
Dr. Weaver, Dr. Chen's looking for you.
Yeah, tell her to wait.
I just wanted to make sure that you were all right.
I heard it was a pretty big fire.
I'm fine.
Good, good.
Dr. Weaver, can you sign an order
for a Social Services consult?
They won't come down here without a signature.
Not now.
Well, it's Joyce Westlake, the ankle.
There is domestic violence involved, so I...
Yeah, I'll come down and talk to her.
So that's it?
What?
You're going to keep playing this game.
I'm not playing any games.
So what, you just want to check on me?
( softly ): Is that all right?
Could you just write the order and I'll take care of it?
( voice breaking ): No. Abby, I'm the treating physician, okay?
( sniffling )
I'm sorry...
It's all right.
Why are you avoiding?
I'm-I'm not.
Look, hey, can you tell I'm just a little swamped?
Kerry, excuse me.
You want to talk to me, talk to me, okay?
I'm not going to be hanging around for your convenience.
You know, forget it.
Come on... Forget it.
Please, wait. No, good-bye.
Let me just, let me just check--
You know...
Good-bye, Dr. Weaver.
You packed me a lunch?
We call this an escape kit.
Money, medication, phone numbers--
anything you might need is in here.
For what?
In case one night, you decide
you don't feel safe at home
and you have to get out of the house in a hurry.
He's my husband.
I don't need that to feel safe.
Okay, um... But it can't hurt having it around, right?
So I'll just put it with the rest of your stuff.
Hi. Hi.
Joyce, this is Adele.
She's a social worker here at the hospital.
I told you I don't need a social worker.
Well, in situations like this it's hospital policy
for me to interview the patient.
Situations like what?
Abby, I need you. Brian's going to be here any minute
and if he finds her in here, he's going to get upset.
Okay, I'll be back.
Well, has that happened before? Abby...
When a kid named Ricky gets on the phone
transfer him to Trauma One.
Who? A choir boy.
He's going to hold up the phone from the church vestibule.
Did you see it?
What?
Me either.
But I heard it was steamy.
Your rehiring will necessitate the scaling back
of the hours of others
so don't be surprised if your return is not met
with open arms.
Oh, I'm sure they'll look to you for any scheduling complaints.
You start tomorrow at 7:00.
A.M.? P.M.
Hmm, you're putting me on overnights?
Under the circumstances, I don't think
you're in any position to complain about your schedule.
You know that's not true, Kerry.
So let's stop lying, okay?
I'm getting my job back
with the following conditions...
I didn't agree to any conditions.
I'm returning as an attending.
I expect shift equity and equal pay.
I'll report to more experienced faculty, but not to you.
We both know what you did here.
Yes.
And we know what you did, too.
So while we're being truthful
let me just say
I'm not the one with blood on my hands.
If you were a more thorough doctor
you wouldn't have needed me there in the first place.
A kiss could mean anything.
Not that kind of kiss.
Guess Kinney's going to get executed after all.
Oh? The inmate.
He's in a post-op coma
not even triggering the vent.
Yeah, we did what we had to do.
$4,000 a day to keep this guy alive
so they can kill him in five months.
Hardly seems like the best use of our resources.
You know what, just save the patients, Susan.
I'll worry about our resource management.
Is Dr. Carter here?
Carter!
Hey, Aisha.
See you tomorrow. See you tomorrow, okay?
I got the page.
Dimon's always had an act
but I thought he was real with me.
No, I'm just glad you came back.
What do you need, Malik?
Nothing.
Yeah, well, then why don't you find something to do?
GREENE: Warm for January.
Maybe we'll luck out and have a mild winter.
Why are we going this way?
I thought it would be nice to walk by the river.
I have a lot of homework.
I called your mom today.
And did you tell her I'm going back?
We talked about it.
And I decided that it wasn't good for us.
You and me or you and Mom?
You and me.
I don't have a say?
Maybe in a few years, but, no, not yet.
Rachel, I want you to stay here.
I missed too many things in your life
to let you leave angry with me.
I'm your father.
I'm not going to pass you off when things get rough.
And what makes you think things'll get better?
We both try harder.
Neither one of us is very good at listening.
I just don't want to be treated like a kid.
Good.
I don't want to be treated like an old man.
Brian... Brian!
Hi, what happened?
Hi. Uh, everything's okay.
Joyce's ankle was bothering her.
She sprained it pretty badly.
Aw, geez. I told her those things
don't have any ankle support.
She's not a great skater as it is.
They can be dangerous.
Listen, I'm sorry you got pulled
into this little domestic drama.
I think you got the wrong idea.
Evidently I did.
We both have tempers
and once in a while things get out of hand.
This is really none of my business.
Well, if it infringes on your life it is.
Our neighbor in San Francisco thought there was an earthquake
ran out into the street in his underwear.
It was just Joyce smashing all my softball trophies
because, well, I went to a playoff game
instead of going out with her folks when they were in town.
Right.
Anyway, they told me Room Three, it's over here.
Yeah, it is, uh...
but, you know, Joyce is almost finished
so if you like, you could pull your car around
and I could wheel her out and we can meet you.
I can get her.
Yes, but it's a long walk to the parking lot
and she's really supposed to stay off the ankle for a day or two so...
Well, is there a problem?
Abby, I'll, uh, talk to you later.
LOCKHART: Thank you.
Hey, baby, how's it going?
Better, the throbbing stopped.
They give you lots of drugs?
A few.
Well, there's an upside.
You hungry?
A little, yeah.
Why don't we go over to Angelino's
and get some pasta
and get a bottle of Merlot, what do you say?
Mmm, I feel more like a cheeseburger.
All right, it's your call.
Thanks, Abby.
Uh, is this yours, Joyce?
No, I have what I came with.
Bye.
Who are you?
We got a call, Kerry.
No, I mean, who the hell are you?
I live my life without apology.
Yeah, that's right, your life.
You make choices for your life
you don't make choices for mine.
I didn't choose to be lied to or have my time wasted.
I never misrepresented myself.
No, you just pretend to be something you're not.
Lopez, let's go.
You know what, that's my employees
my colleagues, my workplace.
I choose to keep my private life to myself.
You can't separate who you are
from what you do.
That is not your decision to make!
I stand up and face it every day.
You want the life without the hardship.
You don't get one without the other!
Not with me, anyway.
So you did this out of spite
to teach me some kind of lesson?
I did you a huge favor.
You just don't know it yet.
( sirens blaring )
What are you doing?
The light went out.
Why didn't you tell Henry?
I'm not incompetent.
I'm capable of changing a lightbulb.
( gasps ) ( bulb clatters )
Here, come down from there.
I'll get it.
Oh, screw it. I'll get it later.
Whoa!
Have you been drinking?
Uh, Norman Tucker sent Millicent a bottle
of 40-year-old Bordeaux as a get-well gift.
And you what, helped her open it?
I spent the entire afternoon
at that children's cancer center for Millicent.
There was this, uh, one boy...
I came home and I made the mistake
of getting in the middle of an argument
between Millicent and her physical therapist.
Yeah, Gamma's having a little trouble
losing her independence.
Hey, hey, hey...
Sit down.
She told me that my presence was
in fact hindering her recovery;
that if she needed a caregiver
I would be the last person she'd call.
It's a defense mechanism.
What are you doing?
I'm checking your pulse.
Did you speak to your father?
60 and weak.
Are you taking something?
Xanax.
He's giving up on me.
When did you start taking Xanax?
I have a prescription.
And you took it with alcohol?
( violent wretching )
How many pills did you take, Mom?
I'm so sorry...
I'm sorry, you shouldn't have to go through this.
How many?
Two.
I just took two.
She asked me to leave.
( sniffling )
Do you want me to leave, John?
( sighs )
No.
You're right.
I failed you.
I failed your brother...
and then I failed you.
Mom...
He was tired
before we even left for France.
That was 20 years ago.
Millicent insisted
he just needed some fresh air.
He'd been inside all winter.
It delayed the diagnosis by less than a month.
It... wouldn't have changed anything.
I was his mother...
I just stood by... while it was eating him alive...
( sobbing ): I just stood by.
