Previously on E.R.
Mark's gone.
That means you've been here longer than any other doctor.
People will look to you to step in
and fill the void.
Are you guys insane?
I need to cross-clamp the aorta
with that big-ass clamp.
If you don't know what it's called
you sure as hell shouldn't be using it.
You want to stay here
you do what I tell you, when I tell you.
It's that simple.
This meeting starts at 1:00.
Oh, that's great. Go on ahead.
When's the last time that you went?
What do you think?
Well, then what's it going to hurt?
Well, it'll kill my buzz for starters.
One step at a time.
You went for you?
You promised me you would.
I went for you.
How come the dog bite's still here?
I don't know. Waiting on his I.V. Unasyn.
Any particular reason?
Nurses aren't back from ACLS class yet.
The sooner he gets his meds, the sooner he gets discharged.
Yeah, well, I've done my share of I.V.s
at the V.A.
There's no "I" in team, Pratt.
People really say crap like that around here?
No, but they should.
What happened to her?
Chipped her tooth in Barbados.
Told her to stop opening beer bottles with her teeth.
So, Pratt, you want to check orthostatics
in Exam Three?
Why are you asking him?
I don't know.
He's got a cute ass?
We're down three nurses.
Yeah, we can help.
The point is, why should we?
Let's all pitch in, shall we?
Pratt, why don't you check vitals
Gallant, why don't you start I.V.s
and I'll discharge Martinez here.
All this because a nurse tells us to.
No, because Abby is
the Obi-Wan Kenobi of nurses.
So, what's that make you? Yoda?
Learn from her you will.
WOMAN: Might have to separate these two.
Partial thickness burns on the soles of the feet
from hot coals.
Firewalkers?
Lawyers. Attorneys.
Why walk on hot coals?
It was a bonding exercise.
We're partners at the same firm.
Stupid idea. If I could walk, I'd kick your ass!
It would have worked
if she hadn't pushed me.
My feet were burning, you idiot!
Somebody smell smoke?
Yeah, kind of.
Of course you do. We were char-broiled.
No, it's coming from your cuff.
Oh, my God! Whoa!
I'm on fire! I'm burning! Don't panic!
Oh, my God!
Don't panic! Don't...! I'm burning!
( man grunting )
( gasping rapidly )
( coughs )
Oops.
This is not a hotel, Stan.
But I got the chills so bad, my teeth are rattling.
I can't get no rest behind a Dumpster.
Okay, I have the flu
and you don't see me in bed.
Might like to.
What about that hippo oath you guys took?
Do some good, be nice...
Yep. Ask Dr. Pratt.
He's handling you today.
Is this 'cause I'm new?
No. Because you're annoying.
Sure could do with a rub down, my brother.
Who wants the first tetanus shot?
Me, so I can get away from this moron.
You know you both have to come back
for a wound check tomorrow.
I'd rather have my feet amputated.
You don't have to do it together.
What about showers?
You don't have to do that together, either.
That's fine. Just, uh, pat the burns.
Dry with a clean towel.
Dirty water running down to the foot increases
the chance of infection.
Okay. How about the bathtub?
How about just keeping them dry?
How about y'all kiss and make up?
Multiple MVA, two minutes out.
Marge Satterfield, restrained driver of a gambler's special.
50 years old, altered at the scene.
How's her airway?
Wide open. Pulse ox 98, B.P. 110/80.
You were in an accident, ma'am.
We're going to try and help you.
Let's take her to Trauma One.
How many do we have? I'm not sure.
Then where are you going?
I'm going to work up this blunt head injury.
I'll take her. The first one out triages.
She could have a subdural hematoma.
The next one might be worse.
Colin Prentice, 21-year-old driver
high velocity head-on collision with a bus.
Was he restrained?
Not very well-- two-inch scalp lac
and he broke the steering wheel with his chest.
This guy driving a matchbox?
Worse. A Gremlin.
We intubated for a G.C.S. 2-2-3.
B.P. is 120/70, pulse 96.
All right, Trauma Two, let's go.
Not by yourself though. Get Dr. Lewis to help you.
Hey, Doctor, Doctor, how's Marge doing? Our driver.
We don't know, Mr....?
Ralph Meyers, 73, obvious forearm fracture with deformity.
You having any chest or belly paint?
No, but how the hell am I supposed to play the slots now?
Just use the other arm.
Hey, got another one for you, Doc.
Facial lac?
From broken glass. Name's Lenore Fong.
Neuro's grossly intact.
How old is she?
You got me. Doesn't speak English.
( speaking in Mandarin )
What'd she say?
Uh, it's rude to ask a woman's age.
Take her to Curtain Two.
Get it out of her, Deb.
Good. That might be it.
( siren wails )
Or not.
Did you call back the nurses from the ACLS class?
I would if I could, but they're all on a break.
Well, then, get some clerks or something.
We're dying down here.
Could we have our aftercare instructions, for God's sake?
I'll be right with you.
Miss, my colostomy bag is leaking.
All right, just a minute, okay?
Uh, my family has been here
for a long time.
I'm sorry, we just got hit
with a really big accident.
Yeah, both of my kids are sick.
And someone will see them as soon as we can.
Okay, we were here first.
Are my passengers okay?
They're all so old.
No hemotympanum, toes downgoing.
She need the O.R.?
Nothing surgical so far.
Marge, any pain here?
Good breath sounds bilaterally.
No tracheal shift.
Look, I got to go.
Not until you get a vent.
Call for a c-spine, chest and pelvis.
Nurses usually call.
I don't know the numbers.
Systolic's down to 80.
Run a two liters wide open.
This really isn't my job.
It is today.
Feels like a pelvic fracture.
Hello, this is Dr. Pratt at the E.R. I need...
Draw blood for a C.B.C. and chem panel.
I'm on hold.
Type and cross for four, and find some O-neg.
Found the sonosite.
Oh, good. I need to rule out an intrabdominal bleed.
Chem panel goes in red top or green top?
Abby, help.
Excuse me?
Go see if Kovac needs you.
Dopamine? What?
I need to start a dopamine drip.
Top right drawer.
How's it going up there?
Oh, we might get some more criticals.
Everybody's got multiple medical problems.
Is this 400 in 250?
That's the premix.
Hey, where's the head?
It's not in here.
Then where?
No fluid in Morrison's pouch.
Carter, take him out with you.
Yeah, sir, you can't be in here.
But I got to take a whiz.
Yeah, come with me. Hang a left.
Can you call my daughter?
Okay, I need everybody to move to the Admit Area
so I can assess all of your injuries.
You want to see my bruises?
Not right now.
It hurts when I walk.
She's expecting to hear from me.
Hey, Gallante, deal with this.
Listen, everybody, proceed to the north
and we'll get you all taken care of.
Where the hell is north?
All right, got the pressors.
Oh.
I thought you said she was hypotensive.
Sorry. She probably just vagalled with the blood draw.
You know, you could check him for compartment syndrome.
( speaking Mandarin ) Why not?
Can you wiggle your fingers for me. Mr. Meyers?
Damn foreigners ought to just get their own bus.
( shouting in Mandarin )
What'd she say?
That I had a fever
and then something about his mother.
Probably what set the driver off
all that gibberish.
Marge was twitching, she was so mad.
Twitching?
Like a holy roller.
Excuse me.
She might have had a seizure.
Before or after the accident?
Before.
She have a medical alert bracelet?
Check her wallet.
Mental status is consistent
with a postictal state.
GALLANTE: Dr. Carter, I've got a couple of really sick kids.
I'm a little busy right now.
Let's do a half load of phenytoin
and send off levels.
Listen, they were seen here a week ago with fever
then developed a rash.
No myoclonus.
It's pretty bad. I think you need to see them.
Go, Carter. We got this.
Okay, let's take a look.
We thought it was chickenpox
but I've never seen it as bad as this.
Can you lift up her shirt?
It's not on her chest or her stomach.
Adam doesn't have it as bad.
When did the rash start?
Three days ago.
How long have you been waiting?
Too long.
I tried to tell that nurse, but she said
it was busy.
Could it be an allergic reaction?
No.
Would you, uh, excuse me?
Get-Get masks on them.
Hey, what's up?
Where are the, uh, tubes?
What?
You know those tubes with the posters in them?
Oh, those public health things?
Yeah, they send them every month.
Yeah, they should be over there, man.
( clattering )
Oh, man.
Oh, man...
What?
What's going on?
Michael?
Yeah?
Go get Dr. Lewis. Now!
I'm going to move you to a private room.
Can you take Adam and follow me quickly?
What is it?
It's just a precaution.
Excuse me. Coming through here.
Can you move out of the way?
Why are we running?
Just stay with me.
Right up here.
( kicks door )
All right, stay here.
I'll be right back.
What is going on?
Where is she?
Getting a central line kit.
Susan, just come with me.
I think I got two cases of smallpox.
Oh, my God.
Firm, deep-seated pustules
all in the same stage of development.
No, it's probably just a bad case of the chickenpox.
No, centrifugal distribution, sparing the trunk.
It's all the major criteria.
We haven't had a case here since the '40s.
It's airborne.
We need to lock this place down.
Okay. Elevator lobby, north stairwell
and south corridor are all secure.
Security's trying to lock the ambulance bay doors.
Isn't that a fire safety violation?
Okay, we're close to trauma.
Is Public Health on the way?
Do I call the city, the county
or the state department?
Check the emergency response plan.
This is the emergency response plan.
I don't know; call all three.
Hey, hold on.
You think maybe you're jumping to conclusions?
You ever seen smallpox before?
No, but that's my point.
It could be anything--
scabies, pityriasis, chicken pox...
This is not chicken pox.
...herpes, impetigo...
Are you 100% certain?
You want to risk exposure to the city?
Whoa, how bad is it?
It killed half of Europe.
Yeah, but they have a vaccine for it now.
The C.D.C. should have a stockpile of it.
In Chicago? Atlanta.
Oh, great.
No, Luka's right.
Smallpox has been eradicated.
I heard the Russians had some on ice.
If a terrorist group got hold of it...
Shut up, Jerry.
Damn, I should have called in sick today.
What did they say?
Lock it down.
They're on their way.
The entire hospital?
The E.R.
So, what do we do about the critical patients?
You're asking me?
The infected kids--
they're brother and sister.
Five and ten? Yeah, why?
I think I treated them last Tuesday.
They presented with the flu.
I have a fever.
Well, you need to be quarantined.
Oh, God.
Hey, come on, slow down, guys.
No, no, no, Susan
you got to come up with a plan, like, now.
Okay, okay; Deb, Carter's right.
You're quarantined to Exam Four.
Jerry, pull the staff schedule
and the patient log from last Tuesday.
Luka, reassess all the patients, group the criticals.
I'll take care of Public Health.
What about the kids?
Nobody panics, nobody starts any rumors.
This is just routine.
Okay, then you'd better tell them why the doors are locked.
LOCKHART: Carter, wait.
Did you know that family sat in chairs for 45 minutes?
They should have been isolated right away.
Yeah, and they would have been had I seen them.
Pretty hard to miss.
We had a huge trauma
and we're down three nurses.
I told you that.
What are you doing?
Well, if you're right about smallpox
they could get septic.
Well, let's hope I'm not right.
You're going to need some help.
You don't have to come in here
if you're worried about exposure.
I've already been exposed.
MAN: Who's in charge here?!
I got some rent-a-cop telling me I can't go.
Why are you detaining us?
I'm about to explain.
Look, honey, if I don't get a cigarette...
Ma'am, please.
Jerry, Jerry, does this thing still work?
( clamoring )
It did in '95.
What the hell is going on, huh?!
Does this place even have a license?
Uh, sorry.
I'm Dr. Lewis.
Uh, as you may have noticed
there are guards posted at all the exits.
This is because we have
a potential public health concern.
I would like to emphasize the word "potential"
because at present, we don't have any conclusive evidence.
The city authorities are on their way to assist.
However, until we have more information
we ask that no one enter
or leave the department.
( angry clamoring )
This is purely a precaution.
Why?! What's happening?!
When I know more, you'll know more.
( angry shouting )
Thanks for your patience.
You can't force me to stay!
I want out of here!
I'm getting out; now, move!
Let me go!
LOCKHART: Is that helping?
ADAM: Do I look like her?
Not as bad.
Was anybody sick around you?
I don't think so.
We were at the embassies, hotels.
We stood out.
Where?
Central Africa.
Craig works for the State Department.
When did you get back?
Two weeks ago.
Okay. Okay, we need to keep you both in isolation.
Why?
'Cause you could be incubating the virus.
You probably both are.
You said ten to 14 days.
We need to know every place that you've been
everyone that you've come into contact with
since your kids developed a fever.
The kids were in school.
They could get sicker than this?
We need to get skin biopsies and smears
send them to the C.D.C.
biocontainment lab.
They could die?
We're just doing this to be careful.
Nothing's been confirmed.
Dr. Carter.
Is she tachycardic?
Uh, no, but you're freaking them out.
( whispering ): Slow down.
Are you okay?
Yeah. Biggest public health emergency
of the century, and I'm stuck here.
Stuck? This is the damn Ritz, if you ask me.
Sorry, you got a roommate.
Oh, come on.
Were you really here last Tuesday, Stan?
Yeah, sure I was.
You know, they say this could be very serious.
I've had gastritis, hepatitis, and pancreatitis.
A little pox is not going to bother me.
( clears throat )
You got a temperature, too?
Ah, probably just the flu.
* Everybody's got the fever It's not smallpox.
* This is something we all know... *
It's not smallpox. It can't be.
* Fever wasn't just a new thing * Got to be a mistake.
* Fever started long ago
* You give me fever
* When you kiss me
* Fever when you hold me tight... *
County.
Hey, how in the hell long is it going to be?
Sir, I really don't know.
Well, are you going to pay me
for the hours I miss at work?!
Gallant, how are the seniors?
Mostly sprains and contusions.
Ah, thank God for small favors.
What about Public Health?
En route, but Chicago P.D. is here.
Gee, I feel safe now.
Where do you think you're going?
She needs a head C.T.N., and she's not infectious.
Does she have a blown pupil?
No. Then she can wait.
She's an older trauma patient.
Ma'am, do you know where you are?
Looks like a hospital-- a crappy one.
I'd say she's pretty lucid.
MAN: Dr. Lewis.
David Torres, Department of Public Health.
We can take over now.
The crisis, or the patient care?
This is for contact tracing
and this is for you. Okay.
The C.D.C. will be flying in from Atlanta.
In the meantime, we're going to need this area for our staff.
Kill the A.C.
It's 80 degrees outside.
Welcome to the hot zone.
May I see the infected kids, please?
No, the infection's in the bloodstream
which makes the lungs leak fluid.
But she's been responding to oxygen.
God, we never should have been there in the first place.
Look, you could have stayed home.
Yeah, right, and your children don't see you for a year.
100/60, pulse 98.
If there had been an outbreak, we would have heard.
Craig, we were targets.
Some maniac is using this as a weapon.
There are a lot of unknowns...
Dad, there's something wrong with Bree.
Pulse ox is down to 83 on 15 liters.
What does that mean?
That means that she's not getting enough oxygen.
Come with me, Adam; you're fine.
I just want a little room to work on your sister.
Etomidate, atropine, and sux.
What is that?!
It's medication to help sedate her.
We may need to put a tube down her throat to help her breathe.
Abby, wait!
We don't want to infect Pratt's patient.
We need a pediatric intubation tray.
All right, I'll go, I'll go around.
Keep her on a 100% nonrebreather.
We're going to need another room.
And a decontamination area.
You got to clear out.
Sats are down.
He could have a pulmonary contusion.
What's his pO2?
I can't get an A.B.G. down to the lab.
Nah, it's just a mucus plug.
He just needs suction.
Then a vent, a neurosurg consult
maybe even a burrhole.
I got an airborne deadly virus in there.
What are you doing?
I'm moving him.
He could crash in the hallway.
Or smallpox could get him.
A little girl needs an airway.
I need this room. Why don't you calm down?
We don't even know if it's smallpox yet.
Bag him; let's go.
Need to get by.
I'm sorry, you can't.
Yeah, it's all right; I work here.
The ER's been locked down.
- You need to move back, please. - For what reason?
We're just trying to secure the building.
I'm the Chief of Emergency Medicine.
If there's a situation, I need to get in there.
I said step back.
Dr. Weaver. What's going on?
We had class on the second floor.
They wouldn't let us back down.
Yeah, hi, it's Kerry Weaver. Get Dr. Romano.
Don't... no, don't you dare put me on hold.
Heard the cops say it was something contagious.
Like what, the plague?
Excuse me, are you in charge?
No, find him.
They brought my fiancee here
and I can't get in.
They're not letting anyone in, honey.
Yes, it's an emergency.
I was following him in the car
and he got into a bad accident.
Marta Guzman, 18, G.S.W. to the right chest.
Last B.P. 80 palp...
They shut down the E.R.
Nobody radioed us; I got a G.S.W. here.
I need to get inside.
My fiancee may be dying. You cannot go inside.
Can you take her to Mercy?
Not with her pressure dropping.
No breath sounds on the right.
You need to let us in.
Not this entrance, not this floor.
This woman is bleeding into her chest.
How long do you think we'll be stuck in here?
I don't know.
Maybe a day or two.
Might have to spend the night together.
You afraid?
What, of catching smallpox or waking up next to you?
Okay, looking good.
No retractions.
He likes having his own room.
You like having a little sister?
I'll bet you two never fight, do you?
( chuckling )
Ah, I didn't think so.
The alarm's going off!
Sinus brady at 45.
Push point four of atropine.
Sometimes kids drop their heart rate
when the oxygen gets low.
I thought you fixed that.
I lost the pulse.
V-fib; starting compressions.
Go get Lewis.
Oh, God!
Hey, Pratt, Pratt, come in here!
CARTER: Hurry up!
WOMAN: Help her, please!
Do you want me to start bagging?
Uh, no; charge paddles to 50.
What's up?
Vascular clamp.
"O" silk is ready.
My children, they need me.
Yes, they do, Marta, so hold on.
All right, tube's in.
Needle driver.
My kids...
Somebody say Thoraseal?
Ah, right here!
Be careful-- you break it, you buy it.
How about some Vaseline gauze?
How about a two-ton safe?
Robert, I need to get this girl in surgery.
Tell me something I don't know.
Security's holding the freight elevator.
I'll meet you there.
500cc's out so far.
Pressure's up to 100.
Doctor, why has the Public Health Department
closed the E.R.?
I have no idea.
Elastoplast now.
Is there a communicable disease in the E.R.?
There usually is.
Pressure bags on both liters.
Are you in touch with anyone inside?
WEAVER: Yes, I am.
Who the hell is that?
The Chief of Emergency Medicine.
We don't know that anyone is infected with anything.
What kind of disease
can close down a hospital?
Don't say it, Kerry.
Could it be Ebola virus, anthrax?
I told you I don't know.
Set the chest tube on water seal.
Are you aware that the Smallpox Response Team...?
( pandemonium )
MAN: We're sitting ducks.
CARTER: Clear.
Still fib.
Five minutes since the last epi.
Another point two.
Why isn't it working?
Charge it to 80.
And clear.
No change.
Let's try procainamide.
You want to give that to kids?
200 at, uh, 20 per minute.
I think she's lighter than that.
Do you know what you're doing?
LOCKHART: We're following the protocols.
Charging to 90. Clear!
Call someone; get someone!
I want somebody with more experience!
PRATT: There isn't anyone.
Well, call them now!
What he means is nobody's seen this disease
for 50 years. Clear.
Why aren't you telling us anything?!
We don't even know if it's smallpox.
Well, give us masks!
You don't need masks.
You've already been exposed.
WOMAN: To what?!
We don't know, but we can help.
Yeah, by letting us go!
( angry shouting )
No, we can't do that.
We won't do that.
We need time...
Listen! The exits are surrounded
by the Chicago Police Department.
If you leave, you will be arrested.
MAN: Arrested?
We've been prisoners already for...
Dr. Lewis, you better come check on Carter.
Will you please return to your seats?
I have to go home. I don't want my baby getting sick.
I'm sorry. Please! Please!
CARTER: Clear. LOCKHART: Fine v-fib.
Looks like a heart attack.
Could be a loose wire.
It's not the leads. Charging again to 100.
If something's loose
then maybe it's not shocking her right.
Everything is working fine. Clear.
Asystole.
Damn it!
She could be hypovolemic.
Check for a pulse with compressions.
If you can't feel a pulse
she needs a fluid bolus.
That's not the problem.
Well, maybe it will help!
Good pulse with C.P.R.
She doesn't need fluids.
How long has it been?
40 minutes.
How about high-dose epi?
We've done everything.
PRATT: Could be worth a shot.
I said no; that was it.
WOMAN: What are you doing?!
You have to keep going!
He had an idea!
You have to keep going!
( crying hysterically ): Oh, God!
Tell the C.D.C. we have our first casualty.
What are you doing?
I thought I was helping.
Well, you're not.
When I call a code, that's it.
No discussion.
You overlooked high-dose epi.
Especially when the mother of the little girl
is sitting there right in the room.
And it was worth a shot.
Well, you're wrong.
Well, now we'll never know.
Do you ever listen?
I mean, do you ever listen?
Do you?
High-dose epi does not result
in the return of spontaneous circulation
or an increased survival.
And if you read the literature, you would know this.
Or you could teach me.
You know, I don't have time, Pratt
to stop and explain things to you.
So I'm supposed to read your mind?
No, your job is to shut up and follow my lead.
Then lead! LOCKHART: Excuse me.
The Health Department wants us to double-shroud her.
I'll take care of it.
No, you're not going back in there.
Look, the mother still has questions.
I'll take care of it.
She trusts me.
I said no.
Ooh, you feel hot.
What?
Abby, can you take his temperature?
PRATT: It's 100 degrees in here.
Yeah. You feel hotter than that to me.
I feel fine.
You have a fever.
101.4.
You always have to be right.
And you have to be quarantined.
And you say you've been here for five hours.
Six. That is outrageous.
I'll be with you in just a moment.
Hey, where are you going with these?
They said we can't blow the germs around.
LEWIS: Forget smallpox.
We'll have 100 starvation deaths if we don't get food down here.
You've got 20 minutes, and then I'm ordering out pizza.
Hey, what's the name of that public health guy?
David Torres. And your first name?
TV REPORTER: ...what can you tell us about the situation?
Why? Class action lawsuit.
This is false imprisonment
with intentional infliction of emotional distress.
The Public Health Department has the authority.
MAN ( on TV ): History has shown that...
Malik, who is that? What?
That voice.
...isolation of those with the disease
and vaccination of contacts
Jerry?
can avert a widespread epidemic.
We refer to this strategy
as "surveillance and containment."
Now, uh, I want to assure the public
that there is no need for panic
and that only those in close contact
with the infected individuals...
Jerry! ...need the vaccine.
What? I was...
REPORTER: We're having technical difficulties...
...just calling my mom.
I-I love you, too, Mom.
We'll come back to Mr. Markovic just as...
Brian Meadows is now at the scene
talking with two nurses who are unable to report
for duty because...
What, do you have to cover her face?
Yes, I'm sorry.
Um... do you want to take a minute?
Yeah.
Don't.
( crying )
Mr. Turner?
My wife didn't want to come.
We don't know how the kids got sick.
No.
It's my fault.
Punch biopsy is next.
Private jet will take the samples
to Atlanta for an E.M. and P.C.R.
How's your breathing?
Dad?
Yeah.
Was she scared?
What?
Bree... when it happened.
( shallow breathing )
She was asleep.
Am I next?
No.
You... promise?
I promise.
( labored breathing )
( groans )
I have been ringing for ten minutes!
Hell, I had to ring for an hour.
Oh.
What do you need?
You have to use the bathroom?
Yes, not that it's any of your business.
How bad is it?
( groaning )
Really, really bad.
Come on, what are you doing?
What's the point?
If they bring me an N-95 mask and a cover gown
I can at least use the ladies room.
Don't hold your breath.
It's not my breath I'm worried about holding.
Hey, you want... you want to use mine?
( groans )
( chuckles )
Her Dilantin level was eight?
Yeah. Lab even rechecked it.
MAN: It's a water fountain, not a bird bath!
Yeah, come on.
Doctor, I can't take my Naprosyn on an empty stomach.
We may have some crackers. Forget your pills.
We got terrorists trying to kill us.
Crackers? You got crackers?
Eight-er from Decatur! Yes!
( laughter )
Oh, man.
You'll have to play somewhere else.
I need to talk to Marge.
But she's our lady luck.
It's important.
Party pooper.
What's up, Doc?
Oh, I bet you hear that all the time.
How did you get a commercial driver's license?
You have epilepsy, Marge.
Just an occasional tic.
I haven't had a seizure in years.
Where do you get your Dilantin?
Mexico?
The Internet?
You're not going to rat me out
to the insurance company, are you?
You had a seizure while you were driving.
You could have killed everyone on that bus.
You said they were okay.
Come here.
That's the guy you hit.
Does he look okay?
What's wrong with him?
Luka!
I'll be back.
Pressure's down to 60.
Where is he bleeding?
Probably the pelvic fracture.
I should re-scan the belly.
Looks like the I.V.'s infiltrated.
Yeah, throw in a central line.
Just be ready to transfuse two units.
Yeah, if we could get to the blood bank.
I hear you have crackers.
I haven't seen any.
What, are people lying to me? Excuse me.
I will kick someone's ass
if I don't get something to eat!
Don't come in here.
Etomidate's on board.
Sixty of sux.
Okay, you're going to go to sleep now, Adam.
Not like with Bree.
Just for a little while.
Your mom and dad will be right here.
Adam...? LOCKHART: He's out.
I need some cricoid pressure and some suction.
Oh, God.
His upper airway is just covered in lesions.
Do you see the cords?
No. I'm never going to able to pass that tube.
Bag him. Oh, no...
You have to crike him.
I can't crike him.
I've seen you.
If I cut through the pox
it'll seed his lungs and make him worse.
( sighs )
No free fluid. It's a pelvic hematoma.
Systolic's only 50.
I get a flash, but I can't thread.
His veins are collapsed.
I'm going to go get a cut-down tray.
Lost the carotid.
Start compressions.
Carter's patient's in trouble.
So is ours.
He needs a surgical airway.
This guy's bleeding out.
Well, what should I tell him?
To do the best he can, okay?
We need to open the lower neck to avoid the lesions.
A surgeon will come down and do a formal tracheostomy.
And then he'll be better?
Definitely.
Luka's patient's in arrest.
Get Romano.
I don't think they're letting in...
Just get him!
How are things in the leper colony?
You're on with Romano.
One of the kids needs a trake.
I'd like to bring him upstairs.
Forget it. You'll infect the entire hospital.
Why don't you come down yourself?
That's easier said than done.
Look, I need some help.
Well, I'll see what I can work out
but under the circumstances, you may be on your own.
Just get your ass down here.
Sats are dropping.
All right, prep the neck.
You sure? Yeah, I'm sure.
You said a surgeon has to do this.
Yeah, I started out in surgery.
What's that mean?
It means Dr. Carter can do this.
Give me a ten blade.
JERRY: Form a single file line.
( all talking at once )
I'm not thirsty, I'm hungry.
Damn it, people, we are not animals!
And we are not children, either.
What about food?
JERRY: Dr. Lewis! Not now, Jerry.
Hey, it stinks in here, okay?
Can we open a window?
No!
Bitch!
They didn't bring any diet soda.
I only drink diet.
You know what?
We're doing the best we can.
A little sugar is not going to kill you.
His thyroid isthmus is huge-- suction.
Come on-- suction! I'm trying.
Oh, God, there's so much blood. Oh!
All right, hemostat.
Bradying down.
I can't even see the tracheal rings.
Give me another kelly.
Give me four-by-fours, and keep suctioning.
Okay... all right, Mr. Turner
I'm going to need you to squeeze this bag.
No, no. Yes, just put your hand here.
Keep the mask secured over his face
and squeeze every three seconds.
One, two, three, bag.
One, two, three, bag.
He's dropping his pressure.
Do we spike another liter?
No. I want you to keep this field clean
so I can see what I'm doing.
Give me some four-by-fours.
They're not answering the phone anymore.
Things are little hectic.
Is he still okay?
As soon as I get in, I'll check on him.
It's Dr. Lutz!
Dr. Lutz, over here!
LUTZ: No statements at this time. No comments.
I have no statements at this time.
...if this is terrorist-related?
No comment.
Kerry Weaver.
I chair the hospital's Bioterrorism Committee
and in addition to being chief of the E.R.
Why aren't you inside?
I wasn't here when it started.
Well, at least you weren't exposed.
Yeah, I would like to be able to assist.
We can only bring in necessary personnel at this point.
This is my E.R.
Not anymore.
Sorry, Doctor.
Tracheal hook.
Okay, retract cephalad.
Short run of v-tach.
You want lidocaine?
No, he needs oxygen. 11 blade?
I got it, I got it. Bag faster.
All right, number four shiley.
Pressure's 70.
Sats are down to 81.
Damn it...
What?
It won't go.
How about heliox?
I can't pass the tube.
Help him, please! Help him...
I just have to switch the tank.
Yeah, okay, do it, do it, do it.
I'll try a cruciate incision.
You know what? Pull off my mask!
What?
Pull off my goggles, my mask.
I can't see, I can't breathe.
Carter... Do it. I don't care.
All right, all right.
Come on.
Multifocal P.V.C.s.
Come on, Adam.
( Robin crying )
Lost the pulse.
Starting C.P.R.
CRAIG: Oh, please.
Please...
There, there... there, there, there.
I think I got it.
Heart rate's up to 40.
Sats are coming up.
Strong carotid.
Is he okay?
Yeah. Yeah.
CRAIG: Thank you.
( relieved sigh )
ANNOUNCER: The last naturally acquired case
of smallpox occurred in Somalia...
Oh, God. That's horrible.
It's a pox, I know it.
It's a cold sore
and I don't want to think about how you got it.
( man yelling )
What are you doing?
That is completely illegal.
Necessitas non habet legem.
"Necessity has no laws."
Hey... hey, hey, hey, get your hands off...!
( Chen moans )
Now you are just peeing in there, right?
CHEN: Oh, shut up.
I'm getting thirsty.
Water's the best I can do for you, bro.
Does this help?
No.
Got a shy bladder, huh?
( Chen moans )
Thanks.
Why aren't you guys talking?
Not exactly like we have a lot in common.
Stan.
Yeah.
You feel like singing?
I'm not in the mood.
( moans )
( clears throat )
* Row, row, row your boat... *
* Row, row, row your boat... *
* Merrily, merrily...
* Row, row, row your boat... *
* Merrily, merrily, merrily
* Life is but a dream
* Merrily, merrily, merrily, life is but a dream. *
( groans )
CARTER: His oxygen level's up to 95.
ROBIN: So he's better?
For now.
The lesions are on the inside, too.
There's still the risk of organ failure.
But you can prevent that?
We'll have to watch him very closely.
How are you holding up?
Oh, I don't know.
How about your husband?
You'd have to ask him.
( sighs )
The good news is it's not the hemorrhagic form
which is 98% fatal.
Well, that's a relief.
Do you think it would have made a difference?
What?
If I'd gotten to them sooner.
Probably not.
Abby, Dr. Lewis needs you.
Really nice save, Carter.
You know what she wants?
Something about setting up the vaccine clinic.
What does that have to do with me?
I guess you're doing it.
CHEN: We need Ativan!
15 liters. O2 by mask.
He needs a line.
( pants )
He needs a drink.
He's having an alcohol withdrawal seizure.
Like I said, he needs a drink.
Okay, I'm in.
Dr. Chen, four of Ativan.
Throw it.
CHEN: Get sux and etomidate.
Benzo's on board.
I'm going to bag him.
Pulse is weakened and thready.
Oh! He's cyanotic.
Stan, damn it! You're not dying in here!
You hear me!
Stan!
Guess he heard you.
Sats are up.
He's going to need some Librium.
Not for hours.
( gasping ): That was exhausting.
Oh, yeah.
( Chen groans )
( groans )
NARRATOR: Prick the skin 15 times as shown here.
This should be done rapidly, in a perpendicular fashion
within in a five-millimeter diameter area...
Do you have enough room in here?
Yeah, I think if we clear this bed out, we'll be fine.
MAN: We took a vote!
LEWIS: Excuse me?
They told us if we get the shot, we won't get sick. We're ready.
Yeah, unfortunately, that's not my call.
Fine. Right here. Let's go.
We haven't started yet. You'll all get the vaccine.
When?
After we get confirmation.
We're hot as hell, we're starving to death
and you haven't done a damn thing!
We are running the tests right now.
Let us leave, and call us when you know something.
Sir, move back and give us some room.
Listen, jagoff, you move back!
( shouting angrily )
Okay, wait.
I know you're frustrated. I know you're upset.
Forget it. I'm not waiting anymore.
There is a reason we have to do things this way.
Stop stalling! Hey, you had your chance.
Forget the tests!
All right, please, just relax. Okay?
It's going to be all right. Just relax.
Please.
We can use this!
Let's go!
Come on!
They can't stop us!
Move! Move! Move!
( yelling ): Come on!
Slow down, guys. Slow down...
Hey, slow down! Slow...
( grunting )
Come on!
( grunting )
Ready, one, two, three!
( men yelling )
Guys, guys. You don't want to...
MEN: One, two, three!
( grunting )
Keep pulling.
Stop it! One, two, three!
Come on, just stop it!
( grunting )
Stop it!
Carter!
What is going on out there?
I don't know.
MEN: One, two, three!
( grunting )
( gurney crashing into door )
Where's Abby?
( chuckling ): I don't know.
Why aren't we doing anything to stop this?
I tried.
( grunting )
Something bad's happened.
No one's answering? My phone's dead.
OFFICER: Let's go-- across the street.
What happened?
Expanding the perimeter. Why?
Nothing's changed. Just a little precaution.
Look, I need to speak to your supervisor.
Doctor, if I were you, I would go home
and be glad I didn't come to work today.
( grunting )
( feedback whining )
Uh... ( gasping )
this morning, a little five-year-old girl came in here
with a rash that looked like smallpox.
She died quickly.
Her older brother is still critical.
We don't know what it is
and we don't know how they got it.
But it's here, and it needs to be contained.
This is not about denying your civil rights.
This is about protecting you.
If we let you go, you could carry the disease home
to your own families.
So, please, stay here, help us...
and we'll all get through this.
Uh-huh.
Yeah, okay, good.
Let's talk in two hours.
What?
Electron microscopy shows a brick-shaped virus.
An orthopox?
Right. So it is smallpox.
Not necessarily. They're still running the P.C.R.
How much longer?
Make yourselves comfortable.
Hey, look at the bright side: only two critical patients
and we're closed to paramedics.
So, what now?
Well, we can watch ourselves on TV.
REPORTER: So far, the only suspected cases of smallpox
are at County General in Chicago.
50 cc's of urine output in the last hour.
Well, I guess that's something.
Yeah, at least his kidneys are working.
I cannot wait to get out of here.
I'm going to take, like, a two-hour shower.
Yeah. I'm going to sleep for 24 hours.
( sighs )
How is he?
He's stable.
We know it's some form of orthopox
so we need to limit contact.
Haven't we been doing that?
You've been doing a great job handling this situation
and the department would like to thank you.
You're welcome.
Unfortunately, I'm afraid the two of you
are going to have to remain
in this quarantine area.
Why? We're not infectious.
It's just a precaution.
For what? Why don't you just follow protocol and gives us a vaccine?
We will, as soon as we get final confirmation
on exactly what we're dealing with here.
It's smallpox.
Nobody in the U.S. has seen this since 1949.
And due to the unknown origin of this outbreak
we're being extra cautious.
It won't be much longer. Thanks, guys.
Aw, man...
How much does this suck?
"The department would like to thank you
but we can't bring you a fan."
Is it me? It's like a sauna in here.
I'm... soaked.
Do you have a fever? No!
Well, just... sit down.
I'm fine.
Sit down.
Take your temperature.
I'm not infectious.
Just stick the thermometer in your ear.
Today started out like a normal day, huh?
See? 99-- I told you.
Okay.
You're still hot.
( inhaling )
Is that better?
Mm-hmm.
Worst of this is over, right?
Tell me we're going to be okay.
We're going to be okay.
We're going to be okay.
