Previously on E.R.:
Did you sleep well?
Yes, it was great.
I'm afraid it's definitely tumor regrowth.
How much time?
If this works...
ten months.
I'm going to go out and get some Zofran.
No, no, no, no, no, stay, stay.
It'll pass.
( coughing )
( slapping pavement )
Problem with the office supplies?
I just pronounced Bertha.
Blue Bertha?
I admitted her ten times for C.O.P.D.
in the last six months.
She must've liked you a lot if she kept coming back.
Every time she swore to me she'd quit smoking.
Every time.
Behind the crack, no rim.
As soon as she was discharged, though, boy
back to two packs a day.
I even saw her light up under the arch once.
Intubated her three times this year.
High-dose steroids, home nebulizer
dragging her O2 tank
around with her.
That's an "H" for you.
I mean, what's the point if you're not going
to take a little responsibility for your health?
I call this the spirit-killer.
Is it supposed to rain again?
That's an "O" for you.
I think it's going to rain again.
We offer them a service.
Whether they take our advice or not is up to them.
She'd still be alive if she listened to our advice.
As hard as it was to deal with Blue Bertha
it's still harder to be Blue Bertha.
Not anymore.
MAN: Dr. Carter.
There's a rig rolling in with an MVA
and I got a researcher at the Art Institute
LOC at work.
It's Greg Pratt? Yes.
Mark Greene. How you doing?
What did he do to deserve us?
He just finished nine months at the V.A.
Ouch. Three months of internship?
Yes. I'll be a resident in July.
Here?
Only if the match screws me.
Nice. No, but I'm ready to jump in.
Pretty much seen it all, one way or another.
Is that right? Mm-hmm.
You want us to grab that?
No, no, no.
You've got your museum lady.
You know what?
I'll help you with that crossover later.
I think I got it.
Uh-uh. You're palming it.
The idiot chucked the ball right at my head.
There's a little blood.
You probably have a tiny perforation.
He popped my eardrum?
We see it all the time.
Give you some drops to help it heal.
Come clops?
Some drops.
Corticosporin suspension.
Okay.
Oh, thanks.
So, what should you be?
What?
Frank's career aptitude quiz.
Oh, he hasn't cornered me yet.
What is this?
It's green tea with echinacea.
Good for the immune system.
I think I'll stick to the normal sludge.
Well, you're going to have to get that yourself.
Would you rather pose nude
or be bit by a ferret?
Uh, ferret.
How's he doing?
Uh, somewhere between "rock star" and "lion tamer."
Did you cheat?
Just a hint of Mick Jagger.
And a whole lot of Siegfried and Roy?
I have a patient.
Nursing orders, I.V.s, medications go on that rack
and if you get both clerk and nursing orders...
Start with the clerk rack.
Frank.
Pratt.
You got a first name?
Well, at the V.A., they called me "Doctor."
Well, here, we'll call you "Junior."
Luka, can you take the chest pain in Three
and the kid with the UTI?
I already have three criticals.
I'll take it.
Oh, no, that's okay.
Carter, uh, grab my rule-out appy
and the hunt for the lost condom.
Sounds like fun.
Abby, uh, your landlord called.
KOVAC: My landlord?
This the respiratory distress? Your name Abbey?
Norma Cruz, 46 years old, choking episode.
Severe multiple sclerosis.
Abby.
Carter.
I'm good.
Is this her baseline?
Not sure. Son should be here soon.
He was coming in his car.
All the base station calls
come in over the M.I.C.N.
Okay.
Don't touch it, Junior.
Don't call me that.
In case my point was missed
it wouldn't hurt us
to lighten Dr. Greene's load.
Right. Yeah, sure.
Why? What's the problem?
Uh, nothing.
LOCKHART: Can't get a line in.
Chem panel, UA, and a Foley.
Is she moving air?
Sounds like rhonchi at the bases.
This is Jeffrey, Mrs. Cruz's son.
Hi. I'm Dr. Greene.
Is your mother normally this sick?
They said she'd be dead a month ago.
KOVAC: He filled me in on his mother's history.
I can take this.
Is it my birthday or something?
Then it's okay
for me to treat my own patient?
Sorry.
Did your mother throw up?
No, she shouldn't.
We never feed her by mouth.
Might be obstructed.
Does she have a Do Not Resuscitate Order?
Her veins are shot. I'm never going to get a good line.
Jeffrey, your mother probably has an aspiration pneumonia.
We can have a surgeon look at her, but she'll need a special I.V. line
to give her antibiotics.
I need to wait for Linda. Who's Linda?
She's my sister. She's a lawyer.
She drew up the papers.
Pressure's dropping. 80 systolic.
I don't think we have time.
Do you want us
to administer drugs to push up her blood pressure?
I can't. I-I need to wait.
You got to tell me.
Central line kit now.
PRATT: Willa Goldman
Egyptologist from the Art Institute.
Syncopal episode at work.
She have any medical conditions that you know about?
The curse of the mummy.
( groans slightly ) The what?
I found her passed out
on the floor of Nefertiti's tomb.
Carter? That guy in Curtain One's hurting.
Can I give him something?
I'll take it.
Okay. Do a quick exam, and then call URO.
You got it.
It's a penile fracture.
Penile fracture?
Mm-hmm. Up to 100 of fentanyl.
One, right?
Yeah. It's over there.
I'm all over it.
So, no history of these episodes?
Carter, he's going in the wrong room.
He'll figure it out.
Let me take a look.
You want to unbuckle your belt and pull your pants down
please?
( shouting ): My pants? What?
It's okay. I'm a doctor.
I'm still waiting for some drops.
That's not going to do it.
The pants, please.
Are you sure this is necessary?
Hmm.
Could you lean back a little bit?
Oh! Easy there.
Were you having vigorous sex?
What?
No. I was hit in the head.
Most sprains happen along the shaft
but yours seems to be pretty minor.
Nothing personal.
Dude, I have an earache.
( sighs )
JEFFREY: Well, then come down here then.
Fine.
Don't worry.
It's not always as simple as it seems
on the other end of the phone.
No. She's right.
Mom told us she wanted to die
at home in her own bed.
I should never have called the ambulance.
I should have just let it happen.
It's okay if you don't want to let her go.
But that'll never stop.
I'll always want more.
Dr. Greene, her Sats are down to 86.
WEAVER: Decreased on the right.
Portable chest, page RT.
Did surgery see her?
Dr. Corday said she'd reevaluate in four hours
depending on the DNR status.
Pressure is down to 70 systolic.
What's happening?
She re-aspirated or collapsed a lung.
I thought you said she was okay now.
( coughing )
Jeffrey, your mother's not going to be able
to breathe much longer on her own.
Do you want us to help her?
Linda said not to do anything.
Well, she's not here right now.
You have to tell us.
( coughing )
Save her.
You sure?
Just do it. Do everything.
Okay, rapid induction.
Seven point five ET tube and a three mac.
500 of Levo, 600 of Clinda.
Drugs are on board.
Bag her.
Sats are down to 80, Mark.
Let's go, let's go.
Give me the tube.
LOCKHART: My fault. Sorry.
WEAVER: Abby, I need
a stress dose of 125
of Solu-Medrol.
Here.
I'll do it.
All right, give me a straight blade.
Okay, get steroids.
FRANK: Sensor, intuitor, judger.
LEWIS: I never thought of myself as judger.
Yeah, right.
What?
Check judger, Frank.
Hey, mind your own business. This is my career.
Won't work if you're not honest.
Oh, who's judging now?
I've earned it.
Hey, Mark.
Hey.
FRANK: Dr. Greene, your ex called.
She'll meet you at 1:00.
I thought she said noon.
She's running an hour late.
What did Weaver get?
She ain't playing.
Give your best estimate.
Uh, sub-group P-three--
"Beauty pageant organizer
or warden at a women's prison."
Carter, where's your intern?
Either Radiology or the cafeteria.
Find him.
You all right?
Early onset arthritis.
Coffee?
Maybe you should ease up a little.
I'm fine, Kerry.
You do triage for a while if you want
or take a half-shift.
Working is good.
You need to make sure you're taking care of yourself.
There's no need to overextend.
We can handle the load.
I just want to keep doing what I've always done.
You couldn't hold that ET tube.
It's little spasms in my hand.
Is that from the vincristine?
A side effect of the treatment or a progression of the disease.
You pick the poison.
Still, I'd-I'd like you
to take over Pratt's orientation.
Whatever you want, Kerry.
It might be best if you left critical procedures
to the rest of us.
Are you pulling me out of the trauma room?
Anybody else, I'd send home.
I trust you
to recognize your own limitations.
I take pills for my blood pressure and my water.
PRATT: What do you mean?
Water in your legs or to make you urinate?
Hytrin. It helped me pee for a while
but it's worse now. Ow!
That's hurts? You bet.
Any way to put the med and back pain together?
Alpha one blocker.
And if you take too much?
Hypotension. Could make you dizzy, possibly fall.
Have you had any falls, Mr. Seidel?
Nope. Good question, though.
And who's your primary physician?
Allanson. Service said he went skiing.
I should come here.
Hypertensive at 140/90.
Pulse 96. Oral temp, 98.6.
I have had two Foleys since Christmas.
Has Dr. Allanson ever asked you to use a catheter at home?
No. Last time, I twisted his arm for a blood test
and I still haven't gotten the results.
What do you want to do, Dr. Pratt?
Full set of labs, urine, culture, accucheck
a post void residual and a rectal.
Are you sure?
My guy never does those.
MARQUEZ: Dr. Greene...
it's 1:00.
Add a PSA
I'll be back in half an hour.
Can I get you anything?
No, thanks.
Milk shake, huh?
Decided to let myself go.
I can't stay long.
I just wanted to stop by and say hi.
Did you see Rachel?
We had breakfast.
Her favorite.
Waffle House?
That'll score you some points.
Mm.
She couldn't stop crying, Mark.
It's a lot for a teenager to take in.
It's a lot for anyone.
It's really that bad?
Yeah.
But there are always breakthroughs, right?
I mean, look what happened last time.
I'm kind of beyond that.
Well, we agreed Rachel would be with me
for July and August
but if you want to change that...
No. That sounds like a good plan.
She could stay with you longer.
I mean, she's going to want to spend time with you.
As much time as possible.
Thanks.
I'm sorry, Mark.
I'm sorry we had such a rough go.
Maybe if I hadn't switched jobs or...
been more patient...
We made choices, Jen.
Both of us.
( sighs )
We weren't so bad together, were we?
I would... I wouldn't change a thing.
None of it.
Okay.
So, I-I got to get to Midway.
Wait. I updated my will last year, but...
Look at it out there.
It's going to take me hours.
I want to start a college fund.
Well, you'll drop Rachel off in St. Louis in July
and we can talk then.
I-I don't know if I'll be able to make that.
Yes, you will.
I want to set something aside for her wedding, too.
July, okay?
Let's not do this.
Not today.
I don't know if there will be another time.
She's my daughter.
I want to make sure that she's taken care of.
She will be.
Jen...
I'll see you in St. Louis.
Heads! Heads up!
Slow down.
Hey!
Enriquez, the new orderly.
He's going to kill someone.
Keeps the rooms clear.
So, what did he want?
Who?
Uh, your landlord.
Oh, yeah. Uh, Brian?
Um, he moved back to Idaho a few days ago
and he took all his stuff with him.
So, you have your place back?
He offered it to me, yeah.
Good, good.
I mean, all my stuff's there, so...
Yeah. It'll be nice to sleep in a bed again.
Yeah.
( both chuckle )
But, um... thanks for the hospitality.
Except, of course, for that Croatian
lamb gruel stuff.
It's not gruel. It's called jujenca juha.
It's a gastrointestinal adventure.
Take your time.
I mean, if you want to make sure that he is gone for good.
Yeah, I think I've mooched off you long enough.
Dr. Greene!
Okay, you need to sit still.
Mr. Ervin, how is the junk business?
I'm having some trouble with my feet.
But he refuses to take off his shoes.
I don't know her.
Dr. Chen. She's very capable.
She touched my cart.
Don't touch Al's cart.
I moved it two feet.
Okay, meet Dr. Pratt.
Hello. Hey.
What's the trouble?
The ghouls put spikes through my sneakers.
The ghouls?
The ones from the burned-out Jeep
or the ones that roam the rooftops?
There are new ghouls.
Everywhere.
PRATT: Uh...
Psych consult?
Screw you, Junior.
Take it easy, Al.
Take off your shoes, so we can look, okay?
Okay.
Let Dr. Chen help you.
I'll be back in a minute.
( Pratt chuckling )
It's not a good idea
to openly show disdain for our frequent fliers.
The guy's seeing ghouls.
What's wrong with suggesting a psych consult?
A little help?
All right, go back in there. Try it again.
Freddy Harrison, looks about 30.
He's 28.
No, I'll hang with you.
Grab his old chart and get a history.
Come on. Carter said I could get my hands dirty.
Go!
Go! Found down an alley
with agonal respiration and pinpoint pupils.
Were you shooting up?
We're in rehab. He's clean.
Hey, Dr. Greene, I'll get this.
I'm already on it. One, two, three.
Gave two of Narcan down the ET with no response.
Go get dry. I'll cover this.
Carter, you've officially
listened to Weaver, now, back off.
CBC chem panel tox screen, Foley
and a portable chest.
Hey, you're ruining his clothes. Stop.
We're trying to help him. Okay, step back.
You're in the way.
Whoa, Narcan is working.
You want some ativan? And some pavulon.
Check the ET tube. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Freddy!
( retching ) Oh, Freddy, Freddy. Lie back down.
Freddy, you're okay. I thought you was dead.
I want my wallet.
Freddy! Give me my wallet.
All right, we need to take care of you.
Don't touch me. I want my wallet.
Maybe it fell in the parking lot, Freddy.
Abby, call security. He wants his stuff.
You people, you're crooks. You know you are.
Freddy, Freddy...
Hey, Carter, I need your help. Hey!
You know you stole all his things. Freddy, come back.
You're bleeding.
You stole his pants!
( yells ):
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Oh, God!
Son of a bitch!
It was an accident.
It was an accident.
You okay?
My baby's coming out. Okay, just try
and breathe slowly. Don't push.
( screams ) Keep breathing, keep breathing.
Get the gurney.
CBC, chem-7. Get an ultrasound.
Looks like I missed the fun.
Chest is clear.
Did she break her water?
I don't know.
Set up the SonoSite.
Why is the floor wet?
Because this window leaks.
GREENE: Diffusely tender with guarding.
ABBY: Did they sedate that maniac?
Didn't have to.
Passed out and smashed his face.
Pressure's only 80.
Oh, man. Okay, uh, let's type and cross for four
and get some O-neg in here.
It hurts. It hurts!
How far along are you?
What?
When are you due?
I don't know.
( screams )
She's having contractions.
KOVAC: Okay, get a fetal monitor.
( panting )
How big?
Looks like about 28 weeks.
Okay. Terbutaline
point two five sub Q and mix the mag.
No evidence of previa. Call OB.
She may need a crash section if she's abrupting.
Pulse ox 85.
No, bag him.
Mid face fractures?
I can't see the cords.
You want to give this a shot?
Set up the fiber-optic scope
and prep the neck for a crike.
She's crowning.
What? It's coming now.
Don't push. Just breathe.
I can't.
I can't stop!
Don't push.
( groans )
Okay.
Bulb suction and clamp.
Call the NICU.
Oh!
Two point five ET tube.
And draw up point zero two...
Is that my baby? ...of epi.
Come on, breathe, little guy.
He's very sick.
I want to see my baby.
Bag him.
Pulse is 50, starting compressions.
My beautiful boy.
What's the Apgar?
LOCKHART: One for heart rate.
Zero for color, respirations and everything else.
Let me go see my baby!
Not right now.
Shane, what kind of drugs are you using?
I'm not.
If you want us to help your baby
you have to tell us if you're using heroin.
No, I don't do that anymore.
Cocaine? Crack?
No, nothing.
CARTER: Whoa! You okay?
Baby's pinking up. Heart rate's 120.
Start working on the umbilical line.
LOCKHART: You all right?
CARTER: No, too much blood. I can't get this.
He's Bradying down. All right, let's do the crike.
Amp of atropine. He needs a surgical airway
unless you want to give this one more shot.
Let me just take a quick look
and then you can cut.
I thought you were right-handed.
Yeah, I'm a switch hitter.
I need you to advance the tube when I say so.
Ready?
Here we go.
MARQUEZ: Run of five.
Hundred of lidocaine. Hundred of lidocaine.
Damn it.
Let's do the crike.
No, no, no, here we go.
There, there, go. Advance the tube, Carter.
Go, go, go, go, go.
Good breath sounds.
Sats are coming up.
That's nice. Lucky.
Very nice.
All right, let's get a post intubation film.
Head and facial CT to follow.
Five-minute Apgar is six.
Better.
Dr. Greene, mom's tox screen.
Shane, we're taking your baby out
to the intensive care unit.
I want to stay with him.
Go ahead. Take him up.
( sobbing ): No! You're stealing my baby.
Shane, let us take care of him.
You'll keep him. You won't bring him back.
I love him.
You almost killed him.
That's not what I wanted.
Your urine's positive for opiates.
You've been shooting up. You've never been to a doctor.
But I was going to.
After seven months?
Or are you too strung-out
to even know that you're pregnant?
Dr. Greene?
I... I've been stressed-out. Oh, well
that explains why you've been using cocaine, too.
And don't tell me that you haven't been drinking
'cause your blood alcohol level is 54.
I had a beer last night. You've been
lying to us from the moment that you got here.
I want to see my baby!
You want to see him?
There he is. Look, premature.
A third of the weight of what he should be.
If he's lucky enough not to have brain damage
from the coke, he's still going to suffer
from fetal alcohol syndrome...
No! ...growth retardation...
Please, stop it! ...developmental delays.
The next time you see him
he's not going to look any better, because he's
going to be suffering... Please!
...from the effects of heroin withdrawal. Stop it!
Congratulations. You're a mother.
Can you take the baby up?
Yeah.
You a basketball fan?
I saw you playing from my window.
Try to hit it the first time, Marni.
Doctors are the worst patients.
So I hear.
I took my grandson to see his first Bulls game last week.
They're not what they used to be.
He fell asleep at halftime.
But I think he enjoyed it.
That's okay.
Their guards fall asleep all the time.
We'll let that infuse.
20 minutes; I know.
( sighs )
It's the E.R. on line two.
Dr. Weaver?
Someone named Pratt.
Pratt, I'm with a patient right now.
I can't talk.
What?
I'll be right there.
Marni, could you send someone down
with the vincristine?
Dr. Greene... Marni.
We don't do house calls.
I am not going home.
Excuse me.
Excuse me. Thanks.
CARTER: Bevel up, angle at 45 degrees.
LOCKHART: Pressure's dropping 90/60.
ERVIN: Let me go.
What happened?
He barfed on Pratt's shoes and passed out.
Dr. Greene, where were you?
We didn't want to have to call you
but he wouldn't calm down.
Whoops.
Sorry.
Here you go.
Don't go too far.
Thanks.
What's that for?
Reduce my blood alcohol.
No luck with the I.V.
Right saphenous?
What?
It's the only one that's not sclerosed.
You want to get it, Carter?
No, Pratt's got it.
Accucheck's through the roof.
Do you take your insulin, Al?
There's so much to remember.
He's a diabetic?
It's news to me.
Line's in.
It shouldn't be news to you.
Did you get a good history?
I have a glorious history.
I told you to get his old chart.
So, what was that, like, a test?
Make sure he flushes all three lumens.
Don't give him an air embolus.
CBC, chem 21, and a urine.
Sats are 90, pulse is 110.
Dr. Greene?
Add a hemoglobin A-one-C, serum ketones
blood cultures, and a 12 lead.
Liter up, good 18 in the right foot.
Yeah, add 40 of "k" in the liter.
Intubation tray.
8-oh ET tube.
Why? What's that for?
Sats are dropping.
Come on, Al, breathe.
Carter, get ready to bag him.
Do the selleck.
The what?
GREENE: The selleck.
Give me your hand.
( gagging cough )
Okay. Okay.
When his blood sugar's over 700, sometimes he stops breathing.
Thanks for mentioning that.
GREENE: Give him ten of regular IV push.
Start him on eight units per hour.
Dr. Pratt.
Dr. Greene.
Oh...
Thanks.
You could have told me he was a diabetic.
I told you to work him up.
I was looking for chronic athlete's foot.
You missed the DKA
because you didn't follow my instructions.
It didn't seem necessary.
That assessment is up to me, okay?
You do the learning, I'll do the teaching.
Do I seem like a punk to you?
No.
Then how about you stop
trying to treat me like one?
I'm sure that you think that you're ready for anything.
Wait a minute.
Is this the one about the old guy and the young guy?
'Cause, see, I've heard it all before.
There's a door over there that goes outside.
If you don't like the way I'm doing this
keep walking.
CARTER: He's a good doctor.
He's a burnout if I ever saw one.
I learned a lot from him.
Yeah, well, if I had my call
I'd rather stick with you.
You don't.
You saw him in there.
I mean, I just can't figure out
what's going on with this guy.
A tumor.
What?
He has a brain tumor-- an inoperable GBM
that's recurred.
That's what's going on with him.
That's what the IV's for.
He's in his second cycle of chemo.
And he's still working?
Everything okay?
Yeah.
Yeah. Pratt was just saying
how much he's benefiting from Dr. Greene's experience.
He's a good teacher.
You know, you guys could start feeding me
some of this information a little bit earlier.
Labs back for Seidel.
Thanks.
PRATT: His PSA's higher than his Alk Phos.
GREENE: 600? Did you call his doctor?
Yup. I left three messages on his service
before I got the cell phone number.
Son of a bitch.
What, you think he knew?
He should have.
This guy shouldn't have to find out
from doctors he's never met in the ER.
Hey, listen, uh...
in med school, uh, I was a hot shot
and I forgot I'm not one here.
Well, not yet, at least.
Like I said, no rush.
Hi. Yeah, is your father there?
Uh, yeah, this is Dr. Greene from the County ER.
Listen, um, I didn't mean any disrespect earlier.
Someone told you I'm dying?
Yeah.
Hi. I-I understand you're on vacation.
Your patient's PSA set a record high.
Well, for starters
when was the last time you examined him?
Two years.
In fact, yes.
Metastatic prostate cancer.
Well, the huge irregular mass
on his enlarged prostate may have been one clue.
You want me to put him on the phone?
Better yet, why don't you put down your hot cocoa
and get your ass on a plane back to Chicago where...?
He hung up.
Very persuasive.
I try.
Should we tell him?
Uh, no. Let him sleep.
Call Urology for a bed.
JEFFREY: I panicked, okay?
You weren't here
and I didn't know what to do.
You knew this wasn't what she wanted.
GREENE: You extubating?
You should have never intubated her
in the first place.
What about the obstructions?
It's probably a mild ileus.
I don't care what it is.
I have durable power of attorney
and we want to take our mother home now.
Get that line out of her.
You might want to leave that in in case she needs fluid.
Don't you get it?
She wants to die.
You people can't accept that.
It's like a defeat to you.
Do you have the DNR?
Okay.
( stifled sob )
Pull it.
Just, uh, the bed right around the corner here.
All right.
What's this about?
I got called down from Oncology
so the nurse is here with my vincristine.
You sure you're feeling all right?
I wish people would stop asking me that.
Would you unplug her and let them go?
Yeah. Sure.
Dr. Greene, I want my cart.
What?
They threw my cart outside.
HOLLINGS: Ready?
Sure.
I want my cart!
I always have it with me!
It's okay, Al.
I'm right here.
Everything's going to be all right.
I almost had to call
an Oncology staff meeting.
They weren't crazy about my doing this down here.
Please! I want my cart!
Give me my cart!
( sobbing )
These new needle-less systems are a pain.
( sobbing ): Give me my cart!
( sobbing continues )
You know what?
I'm not doing this.
I can't come back.
You don't have to.
I'm done.
Please!
HOLLINGS: Dr. Greene.
I want my cart!
Al, let me help you find your cart.
Thank you. Thank you.
Aspergilloma--
it's what people used to superstitiously take
as the curse of the mummy.
I'll never hear the end of this at work.
How did I get it?
Well, you went to Egypt recently on an excavation, right?
Pulmonology will bronch her. Give her 200 of Itra...
...Itra conazole BID
will help with the oral steroids.
I work too much, and that's why
I'm sick.
You'll be okay soon.
You know that song
"Don't it always seem to go
that you don't know what you got till it's gone"?
Joni Mitchell.
The story of my life.
I hate that song.
CORDAY: Mark...
I spoke with Oncology.
I told them you'd be up soon for your injection.
You shouldn't have.
They're holding a room for you.
I'm finished. I've had enough.
Well, you go up now
and I'll drive you home.
Elizabeth...
Look, this isn't something you decide by yourself
on the spur of the moment.
This might be the last important decision
I get to make.
You haven't given it time to work, Mark. Please.
I dropped an ET tube today.
I couldn't wrap my thumb around it.
That doesn't mean the chemo's not working.
It's a game, Elizabeth.
I don't want to play.
Look, it's only the second cycle.
This treatment could prolong your life.
Maybe... for a couple of months.
( choked up ): Well, then, give yourself that time.
Give it to me and Ella.
Give it to Rachel.
Who knows what might happen?
We see patients here everyday
who were told that they should have been dead long ago.
I need to be realistic.
You mean give up.
No, it's not giving up.
It's making a choice.
I'd rather have two good months
than twice that, chained to meds and-and needles
and I.V. stands, stuck in a bed?
Sitting next to other clock-watchers
being prodded and small-talked to
by doctors and nurses...
All of them with that look in their eye--
like you're already gone.
I don't want to end it like that.
Look
we can... we can look into some-some new regimens.
We can... we can find some alternative therapies
that we haven't heard about.
Uh, Mr. Seidel is awake.
I'll be right there.
Please?
There's no alternative.
Just dying the way I've lived.
I'll see you at home.
I love you.
( inhaling deeply )
You ready?
I can do it.
It's not the easiest news to give someone.
I know the job.
Mr. Seidel?
My old lady's waiting with my daughter
at some burger joint, so can we get this over with?
Uh, your presentation is consistent
with metastatic cancer of the prostate.
Cancer?
Are you sure?
Maybe you got it wrong.
Allansan never said anything about cancer.
He may have overlooked it.
He always acted like I was a hypochondriac.
He should have caught it.
Maybe we should call your wife in here
before we start to explain everything.
Tell me-- is it bad?
Possibly, it could be.
What, do I need, uh, uh, chemotherapy, or an operation
or what?
I mean, it's not like I'm going to die, right?
I could die?
We need to admit you for tests.
The cancer appears to be very advanced.
You need to prepare yourself for the worst.
I know what a shock this is...
and what must be going through your mind right now.
You can't.
Yeah, I can.
I-I'll call his family.
( gasps )
( sighs )
Go in and sit with him.
What did you say to him?
It wasn't anything I learned
from being a doctor.
CHEN: No, no, no, no.
We need to keep that in, okay?
I want to go!
It's wet out there, it's raining.
It stopped.
I don't want to be here.
Me either.
When can you get him upstairs?
I'll call the telemetry unit.
Last serum ketones?
Still positive.
Urine? 200cc's in the last hour.
I'll take it out.
You know I know how.
Al? Al?
It's going to become harder for you
to be able to take care of yourself.
Do you have any family you can go to?
No. There's nobody.
Then let me admit you.
You know I don't like this place.
I don't belong here.
Whatever's going to happen
I want it to happen outside.
Please.
Okay.
It'll be over soon? Right?
Yeah, it will.
How much longer do I have to sit here?!
Mrs. Raskin, it's been a long time.
Well, the service isn't what it used to be.
What's the trouble?
I have this hangnail, and it is very painful.
I have a brain tumor, and it's inoperable.
What?
I win.
MAN: Over two hours.
Can somebody please see my daughter?
Nurse will be right with you.
I'm Dr. Greene.
Hi, Doctor.
No, it'll hurt, Daddy.
Oh, what'll hurt?
Katie's class mythology project.
Why they let kids play with wooden spears
I'll never know.
I like your outfit.
Can I put you up here?
There.
It hurts.
I know. I'll be gentle.
It's up, under the nail.
She won't even let me near it.
Can I look?
I don't want a shot.
No, no, no, no.
No shots, I promise.
Let's play a game.
Close your eyes, okay?
Okay.
What do you see?
The sky.
What's up there?
Orion's belt.
Orion's?
He couldn't
beat the scorpion, so he jumped into the sea.
Really?
Artemis put him in the sky
where the scorpion never gets him.
I didn't know that.
There.
That didn't hurt, did it?
Is it over?
It's all done.
Thank you, Katie.
What did I do?
You just became my very last patient.
Shift over?
Yeah.
Thank you.
Haleh, can you give that hangnail lady a cast shoe
sign her out, and tell her to never come back?
If you say so.
Dr. Green?
I set up Seidel for the biopsy
and his family's on the way in. Okay.
Hey, I just wanted to say
um, you know, I learned a lot today.
Good-- come back tomorrow.
How's Pratt doing?
Uh, a little eager, a little cocky.
( chuckles )
He should fit right in.
Think he'd want to take on some extra shifts?
Pretty safe bet.
What about you?
Me?
How many shifts should I put you down for next month?
Never let your work become your life, Kerry.
Live a little.
No rest for the weary, Carter.
I've been on since 4:00 a.m.
You leaving early?
Not early enough.
Fisher in the hall's an alcoholic.
Took a fall, knocked himself out.
Check the head CT and road test him
before you let him go.
Withdrawal?
Just your usual midweek party.
Chakarova has hives.
Got Prednisone, Benadryl... feeling better.
Watch her for half an hour, send her on her way.
Dispo's written.
Anybody actually sick?
Just the doctor.
Hey, did you see the guy in Three?
Pacio, 56 years old, chest pain
ruled out going to medicine.
Got aspirin, beta blockers
heparin, and an ace.
28 year old girl, LOC, fell through a plate glass window.
Okay, just keep pressure on that dressing.
Arterial bleeder in the left forearm
is the worst of it.
Good night, Dr. Greene.
Bye. B.P.'s 100/70.
Pulse 100.
So, EKG for Pacio?
Flipped T's in lateral leads
X Ray's clear.
Check his troponin, and repeat EKG in ten minutes.
Stopped raining.
Yeah.
Clear sky.
I'm out of here.
You on tomorrow?
Your ball needs air.
It's not my ball.
You set the tone, Carter.
What?
Work on your jump shot.
