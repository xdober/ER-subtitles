Previously on E.R.:
You cannot leave. Fainting can be a warning sign
for a heart attack, for a stroke.
I'll take my chances.
Luka got me a job. Oh, he did.
Is she, like, your girlfriend now?
I got her a job, that's all.
I don't know what I was thinking when I said I'd come back.
You weren't.
Reese has one father, and that's me.
We both know that's not true, don't we?
Four people are dead; I was their doctor
and I can't explain what happened.
Well, the answer certainly isn't
that you were euthanizing people.
Am I being accused of something here?
You wouldn't be the first angel of mercy
to help end patients' suffering.
( clears throat )
Sign in. Uh, actually...
Where the hell are our T-sheets?
Actually, I'm a new med student.
Congratulations.
You said that yesterday.
Check in with the docs.
Okay, thanks.
Uh, do you guys have a lost and found box?
Somebody stole it.
Excuse me, ma'am.
Are you Dr. Carter by any chance?
Lewis. I don't think he's in yet.
And I'm not old enough to be a ma'am.
Sorry about that.
I'm supposed to meet him here, around 8:00.
Hmm, you're a tad early.
Yeah, it's my first day.
I guess I was a little excited.
You'll get over it.
So, Mr. Hopper
what seems to be the problem?
I can't eat. I can't sleep.
I just don't feel like myself.
How long has this been going on?
A few weeks.
Any stress?
Family? Work?
All my problems started when I met this girl at an after-hours bar.
She bit me.
She bit you, where?
In the alley outside the club.
No, where on your body?
My neck.
I'm pretty sure she was a vampire.
That's a hickey.
Is that a zygoma fracture?
Maybe.
Are you Dr. Carter? Nope. Greene.
I'm Michael Gallant.
I'm supposed to be meeting Dr. Carter.
Yeah, well, you found the E.R.
That's half the battle...
You called for a surgical consult!
I changed my mind.
After I got down here.
He's got rectal pain. It's probably prostatitis.
And that's why I need to examine him.
If it is an appy, he's probably going to need surgery.
Somebody need a second opinion?
Nope. Yes.
He has a 22-year-old male with right-sided tenderness.
Who also says it burns when he pees.
What's his urine and white count?
Still waiting.
Usually you won't even come down till labs are back.
Fine, when it bursts, you can operate.
Dr. Carter? Kovac.
Elizabeth? Hold on, Elizabeth. What's going on?
Isn't it obvious?
No.
Kovac called for a surgical consult
then changes his mind the moment he sees it's me.
Yeah, well, that's a little egocentric, don't you think?
People are afraid to have me treat their patients.
You're being paranoid.
Am I?
Excuse me, excuse me.
Do you know where Dr. Carter is?
He should be here in a few minutes.
Hey, listen, I know you're really busy
but maybe if you tell me where he is
I can find him myself. I don't know. Sorry.
How come there aren't any donuts in the lounge?
No petty cash.
There was 50 bucks in there yesterday.
I need a psych consult.
My patient thinks he's a vampire.
Count Fred? Where is he?
Exam Two.
Is there a nurse in there with him?
No. Why?
He's a vampire.
What do you mean he's a vampire?
I mean, he drinks people's blood.
You're kidding, right?
That's nasty.
MILLICENT: I volunteered to drive
to the Royal Botanical Garden's fund-raiser.
ALGER: I'm sorry, but there's just not much I can do about it.
MILLICENT: You can stop lying to me.
Good morning. ALGER: Dr. Carter.
Did I miss something?
Yes, breakfast.
Your grandmother's upset
because the Jaguar's being serviced.
For a week.
What's wrong with it?
Yes, Alger, what's wrong with it?
They're waiting for a part.
What part?
The ignition coil.
Liar.
He's holding me hostage.
What's the matter with the town car?
I don't drive the town car.
Well, you shouldn't be driving anyway.
That's why we have Alger.
Having a driver was your grandfather's idea.
Now that he's gone
it seems an unnecessary expense.
He's just trying to look out for you, Gam.
I'm a big girl, John.
I don't need a chaperone.
Oh, John, are you still planning
to come with me to...
Gamma!
Gamma?
The nurses do most of the triaging, right?
That's right.
So maybe you could sneak me a couple of minor cases?
Uh, maybe you could sit down...
read your orientation kit
and wait for Dr. Carter.
What's going on, Malik?
I'm teaching Nicole to take a blood pressure.
Why?
Because it's part of her training.
What training?
I'm learning to be a nurse's aide.
Really? Abby!
No helmet. Alert at the scene. GCS 14.
Any blood loss or seizure?
No. Okay, let's get him in Trauma One.
Nicole, come on. Me?
Yeah, it will be good for you to watch.
DUMAR: He must've taken a header right off his skateboard.
Bad scalp lac and hematoma
right parietal-temporal.
Abby, show Nicole how to take a pulse ox.
Uh, put some gloves on.
Can I watch?
When will you sell tickets?
You a med student?
Michael Gallant. Dr. Finch.
Nice to meet you.
Road rash all the way down the chest.
Big abdominal bruise.
( groans ) B.P.'s 90/60, pulse, 115.
Full trauma panel, lateral C-spine, chest and pelvis.
Jeremy, do you remember what happened?
( groaning ) Right pupil is sluggish
and slightly larger than the left.
ABBY: 18-gauge in the right A.C.
KOVAC: What's his pulse ox?
I can't get it.
Abby.
Make sure the fingernail
has contact with that red light.
No CSF or blood from the ears.
100 of Fentanyl, and page Benton and Neurosurg.
Read the number over this monitor.
Decreased breath sounds on the right.
78!
What?
Pulse ox is 78 on 15 liters.
Okay, good job.
What do you think?
Hyper-resonant on the right, decreased breath sounds
low Sats, hypotension...
Tension pneumothorax, right?
Yeah.
I had a fainting spell, John.
It happens.
It shouldn't happen.
In my day, it was quite acceptable
for a lady to swoon.
Hey, Carter, there's a new med student looking for you.
I'm a little busy.
Oh, hello, Mrs. Carter.
Hi, Evan. I talked to your mother. Hello.
She's on her way.
She found your inhaler in the laundry.
Okay, Gam, could you sit up for me?
Put your legs over the end of the bed.
Yes, John.
You're not going to make me do push-ups, are...?
Gam? Gamma?
Gamma? Susan?
Gamma, can you hear me?
John?
Okay.
You're okay.
I need to, uh, step out for a minute.
I'll be right back.
Were you checking orthostatics?
Yeah.
Is she anemic?
I don't know.
I think I'm going to send her up for a tilt test.
She might be dehydrated. It's probably nothing.
Can I intubate?
Maybe next time.
All right, what am I looking at?
Teenage skateboarder.
Tension pneumo on the left with a head injury.
Needs a central line.
He's anterior.
I can see the cords, I'm in.
Bag him, Nicole.
Come on.
One, two, three, squeeze.
He do all of this on a skateboard?
Trying some crazy-ass stunt no doubt.
Good breath sounds. Probably has a depressed skull fracture.
That's what they used to call a ping-pong fracture, right?
Neurosurg is on the way.
Pressure's dropping.
Okay, he's bleeding somewhere.
How much out on the chest tube?
Less than a liter. First Hemacue is nine.
All right. Let's hang the O-neg.
We need to get him up to the O.R.
Has he had Dilantin yet?
Yeah, and 70 grams of mannitol.
What about his head?
Who the hell are you? Michael Gallant.
You're the trauma surgeon, right?
You a med student?
Yes, sir.
Listen, why don't you go and find something to do.
Let's, uh, get him ready to go. I'm in.
I'll think I'll learn more in here...
No, you'll learn a lot more if you keep your eyes open
and your mouth shut, all right?
I think he's got a point. What about his head?
It won't make a difference
if he bleeds out in his chest first.
Okay, people. Let's go.
You did good.
Really? I was so scared.
Yeah, you get used to it.
I don't know.
You saved his life.
Yeah, I hope so.
Me, too.
I better go back to work.
I'll see you later.
Okay.
What are you doing?
What?
"What?"
This morning she was learning how to take a B.P.
and now she's in a trauma?
Yes, she's learning.
To be an aide, not a nurse.
I know you don't like her...
That has nothing to do with this.
It is inappropriate for her to be in a trauma, and you know it.
I just asked you to help her.
That's not my job, Luka.
Do you even realize what I do in there?
You're not the only one
trying to save that kid's life.
I'm going to go ahead and scrub in.
I'll page Neurosurg again.
Dr. Benton?
Yeah.
Yeah, are you Peter Benton? Yeah.
Consider yourself served.
Have a nice day.
What was that about?
Peter?
I'm being subpoenaed.
For what case?
Reese. Roger's suing for custody.
So how extensive do you think his brain injury is?
Um, it's too early to tell.
How is he?
Skateboarder-- is he going to be okay?
Are you his father?
No, I'm David Hilliker. I called 911.
Did you see what happened?
Uh, screwing around in the mall with his buddies.
Looked like he hit his head.
Yeah, he wasn't wearing a helmet.
Of course not, that wouldn't be cool.
You don't need a helmet to drive a motorcycle in this state.
Why would you need one for a skateboard.
Oh, you got a little limp.
Oh, yeah, I twisted it chasing him
and his buddy out of the mall.
You should let us look at it.
Oh, ice pack and a couple of beers
I'll be fine.
Sit down.
We just need to change the dressing.
But, uh, Dr. Carter usually does that.
Yes, I'm aware of that
but Dr. Carter's not here right now.
We don't mind waiting.
I have no idea when he's going to be in.
I'm very patient.
Look, Sister...
Helen.
...the sooner you let me change the bandage...
I'm Monica.
...the sooner you guys can get out of here
the sooner you can get back to doing your stuff
and, quite frankly, I need the bed.
( clears throat )
Perhaps if you told Dr. Carter we were here.
Glad you're here. Your fans are getting restless.
What is it with you and nuns, Carter?
It's almost kinky.
Can you, uh, take care of them for me.
They're looking for you.
My grandmother had a, um...
She passed out this morning.
I'm having Cardiology work her up.
Is she okay?
I don't know.
Are you?
Me, I'm fine.
I just want to make sure she gets settled
before I clock in.
I'll take care of it.
Thank you.
Come on, ladies, Tequila Willy is still is in Exam One
he's covered in puke and assorted body fluids.
He's making this whole place reek.
This place always reeks.
Yeah, and it's Abby's turn.
Oh, come on.
I did him last time. You're up.
Fine. Nicole.
You need something?
Yeah, uh, grab some gloves.
I'm going to show you how to bathe a patient.
Oh.
Robert, Robert, I was scrubbing in
when I discovered Dale's doing my Whipple.
Yeah, he's an arrogant ass
but he's becoming a decent surgeon.
I thought I was back on service today.
No, not yet.
Why not?
I've complied with every insulting, demeaning request.
I've even volunteered for a damn lie detector test.
I know, but we have to wait for the CDC
to finish with their bug hunt.
The good news is
the criminal investigation is essentially over.
They couldn't find anything.
So what does that mean?
"We think you're killing your patients.
We just can't prove it"?
If it makes you feel any better
I don't think this has anything to do with you.
Then why am I not in surgery?
I'm sorry.
I know this is frustrating, Elizabeth
but what choice does either one of us have?
Take the opportunity to get caught up with your dictation.
Spend some time with your baby.
Enjoy the downtime.
What are you doing? Excuse me?
That's my patient.
I'm drawing some blood.
No, you were injecting something into her central line.
I couldn't get a draw, it was clogged.
What did you inject into my patient?
I didn't... Don't lie to me, I saw you.
Is there a problem here?
No, I... Yes. She was injecting my patient.
With urokinase-- to bust the clot in her line.
Let me see it.
( sighs )
Where's the vial?
Elizabeth.
Sorry.
Excuse me.
26 years with the Chicago P.D.
never fired my gun once.
That's good.
These are different times.
Try and stay off your ankle, and keep it elevated, huh?
Dr. Kovac, Jeremy's mother's here.
Okay.
I'll have, uh, one of the nurses
give you a lesson on using the crutches.
Mrs. Norris?
( sniffling )
Hi, I'm Dr. Kovac.
I was the first doctor to treat your son.
How is he?
He suffered a hemothorax.
That's when blood collects in the chest cavity
and collapses a lung.
But it's been repaired.
Can I see him?
He's been taken up to the O.R.
But he's going to be okay?
There was evidence of a head injury.
Is he in a coma?
I'm afraid we won't know till he's out of surgery
and the anesthesia wears off.
Hey, there's the idiot who was chasing him, right there.
A-Are you the boy's mother?
What did you do to my son?
N-Nothing, I-I'm sorry...
He threw his stick at him. What?
You should get back in bed, Mr. Hilliker.
No, he's the one who made Jeremy wipe out in the first place.
Your boy was riding in the mall.
I asked him to leave.
You knocked him off his skateboard.
I didn't!
You attacked my son? No!
Yes, you did.
Can you put him back in the suture room?
What did you do?!
Nothing. I was the one that called the ambulance!
Where's the suture room?
Last door on your right.
He hurt my son? I don't know, ma'am.
I saw him do it.
He's the reason Jeremy's here.
He should be arrested or something!
I just want to see Jeremy.
I just want to be with my son.
I'll get an update
and find out when you can go to see him, okay?
I think he's having a heart attack.
Good. He started hyperventilating
and complaining of chest pains.
What's going on, Mr. Hilliker?
I don't feel so good.
Your chest hurts?
Yeah, my head is spinning.
Okay, put him on oxygen
aspirin, and let's get an E.K.G.
I didn't mean to upset the mother.
I was just trying to offer my condolences.
Okay, just relax.
He rode by me, stole my hat.
He's tossing it back and forth
threatening to throw it in the fountain.
They were terrorizing the entire mall.
Did you throw your nightstick at him?
( coughing )
Okay, okay.
Just relax.
Dr. Zogoiby.
Dr. Corday.
I've been reviewing some charts
and I have a question about a patient you worked on with me.
Yes?
It was a few weeks ago, a Mrs. Taylor?
I'm having a little difficulty
reading your notes.
You put in a central line.
No, I was called away.
That was the day my son
fell off the monkey bars at school, remember?
The on-call anesthesiologist stepped in for me.
And who was that?
Babcock.
( whispering ) Babcock...
ROMANO: ...this wasn't a waste of time.
Think this kid will ever wake up?
I don't know.
You're scaring me, Peter.
You're not your usual jolly self today.
You haven't developed a drug addiction or a drinking problem
like the rest of your misfit buddies in the E.R.?
Nope.
Give it time.
Jeremy Norris' mother is in the waiting room.
Great.
Jacy, have you tracked down my sister yet?
I left another message.
All right, thanks.
You want me to talk to her?
No.
Good.
Mrs. Norris?
Hi, I'm Dr. Benton.
I'm one of the surgeons that was with Jeremy.
How is he?
Well, we tied off the bleeding vessels in the chest
but there's still some swelling in the brain.
He's with the neuro team now.
With an injury like this, it becomes a, uh...
a waiting game.
Waiting?
To see if he wakes up?
Waiting to see if he's a vegetable? What?
All of that.
They've got to be able to do something.
He's all I've got.
Yeah.
You ever gotten an erythropoietic porphyria?
No.
What about a prophyria cutanea tarda?
Nope.
What's the most unusual medical case you've ever seen?
I had a guy with a live bullfrog in his ass once.
You ever seen a patient scratch through the skin into the bone?
Are you serious?
We figure that he'll hit gray matter by spring.
Mr. Elden, could you show a young med student your itch?
Ooh.
Save me.
What?
I have a med student who is in need of a home.
Ah, no thanks
but he seems nice.
Oh, yeah, of course he does.
That's how they all start.
Until they grow up to become residents, like Carter.
I wish.
What?
"I wish"?
He turned into a good doctor.
Uh-huh.
He is.
You and Carter aren't, uh...?
Dr. Greene, can I ask you something?
I'm sorry, am I interrupting?
Not at all.
You don't mind me asking you all these questions, do you?
No, of course not.
This is a teaching hospital.
This is how you learn.
Bye.
Oh, hi. I was just talking about you.
How's your grandmother?
What is it?
Looks like Shy-Drager.
I'm sorry.
They've been having a lot of success with fludrocortisone
and desmopressin.
Yeah. How'd she take it?
I haven't told her yet.
Kayson's still up there running some tests
ruling out some other things.
Is there anything I can do?
I don't think so.
Let me know. I will.
Carter.
Dr. John Carter, this is your new med student, Michael...
Gallant.
Hi. I tell you what
why don't you go to the admit desk
get the orientation package.
When you're finished with it, just come find me.
I did that while I was waiting.
Um, tried to keep busy.
Yeah, I had a family emergency.
Nothing serious, I hope.
Want to talk about it?
Okay, um, well, I watched a trauma already
and helped Dr. Kovac with a possible M.I.
both of which were very interesting
but I was hoping that once you got here
I could start working up some of my own... cases...
He stepped into the men's room.
Oh.
His grandmother's sick.
Do you want to see if we can go find you
a case to work up?
Yeah.
Kit.
I want to apologize for my behavior earlier.
It was completely unprofessional.
I know it's not an excuse
but I have been under a lot of stress lately.
I understand.
That said, uh, I also have a couple of questions
about some recent cases.
Uh, do you remember Mr. Durning?
Diverticulitis?
No, he was an elderly gentleman.
Came in for a hemicolectomy for colon cancer.
With all the faded Navy tattoos?
Yes. Yes. Uh, you took out his central line
on October 16.
Yes. Well, no.
It came out on the 16th, but we didn't do it.
Babcock did.
Babcock?
Why Babcock?
I don't know, he just did.
Sometimes he likes to pull his own lines.
In fact, occasionally he insists on it.
So, Mrs. Reynolds
have long have you had the spots?
About a week.
I gave her some penicillin.
Oh, for what?
I got a cold-- cough, sore throat, headaches.
Mmm, yeah.
Antibiotics won't help.
I told you.
Where did you get the penicillin?
The medicine cabinet.
I had some left over from an ear infection.
Yeah, you should never share prescriptions.
And if you're given one, you should try to use all of it.
What do you think's wrong with her?
I believe she's experiencing
what we call hypersensitivity vasculitis.
It's from the antibiotics.
Thank you, Dr. Kevorkian.
Is it treatable?
Absolutely.
We'll get some medicine for you
and, uh, have you feeling as good as new.
You might want to get a C.B.C.
I beg your pardon?
On account of her history.
Could be indicative of undiagnosed thrombocytopenia--
you know, low platelets.
And you are...?
Grace. I'm a second-year med student.
Ask her if she has any unusual bleeding
when she brushes her teeth.
Are you a med student at this hospital?
No.
I'd appreciate it if you kept your comments to yourself.
Hello.
Is he your student?
Excuse me?
She's a second-year med student
who thinks that she can diagnose my patients.
He takes a lousy history.
I will bet your lunch money, she's got thrombocytopenia.
She's right.
Low platelets.
Needs additional labs, head C.T.
and admission.
I'll take care of it.
You're welcome.
So, do you do self-diagnosis, too?
As a matter of fact I do.
Um, I've let myself get a little run-down
and I can feel a flu coming on.
I can't afford to be sick right now
so I was hoping you could get me
a little Relenza or Tamiflu.
Yeah, I think we can manage that.
What school are you in?
I'm getting my law degree simultaneously.
Really?
Mm-hmm. My parents didn't want me to go to med school.
I know that feeling.
( breathes deeply )
Excuse me, uh, can you get a head C.T.
from Mrs. Reynolds in Curtain Two?
I-I'm not a nurse. I'm just training.
I-I'm sorry.
Ah, that's okay.
Sort of in training myself. Oh.
I'm a new med student, Michael.
Nice to meet you.
Nicole.
How are you doing?
Oh, okay.
Everybody helping you?
Yeah. Abby showed me how to bathe a homeless man.
It was a little...
Abby's pretty busy.
You should stick with Malik and Haleh. Oh.
Is this Mr. Hilliker's 12 lead?
Yeah.
Did he have an M.I.?
No. Probably just an anxiety attack.
You want to give him the good news?
Yeah, can I?
Yeah.
I've got a trauma coming in.
Uh, Nicole, we're going to need
some I.V. saline.
You're going to find it in the suture room. Okay.
It can get a little crazy here.
Yeah, I know. It's only my first day.
Are you liking it?
Ah, so far so good.
( choking )
Oh, my God.
Go-Go and get somebody!
Take a breath, Mr. Hilliker.
( gasps )
Somebody help me!
( gasping )
Somebody help me!
Okay, okay, hold on.
Okay, hang on.
Hang on.
( gasping for air )
Okay. Okay...
Hey, Gamma.
Sorry this is taking so long.
Did you get some lunch?
No, I didn't get anything, and that cardiologist
has never been back to see me.
Yeah, that's 'cause I asked to speak to you first.
Why?
I figured
it's the least I could do
since you've been stuck in here all day.
John, don't beat around the bush.
You have what's called Shy-Drager syndrome.
It's a progressive disease
that affects your blood pressure
and could put you at a greater risk for heart attack
or stroke.
Is it going to kill me?
Most people die within ten years.
Ten years?
I'm not even sure I want to be around ten more years.
Ten days-- now that might have put a kink in my plans.
Gamma...
Can I go home?
I think they're going to want you to stay overnight.
John, I want to go home.
( crying )
You on a break?
No.
Can I get you a coffee?
No, thanks.
Uh, do you want to talk?
Is he going to die?
The guy that hung himself? No.
Well, not today.
He's lucky you and that med student walked in.
( sighing )
You should try not to let it upset you too much.
Every once in a while, some freak comes in
tries to off himself in the hospital.
I wish they would just do it at home.
My father hung himself.
I was only eight.
He'd lost another job.
I found him in the kitchen.
I was too little to do anything.
Oh, God, I'm sorry.
It's okay.
Does Luka know this?
No, I never told him.
I never told anyone.
I don't think I can do this.
Well, it's not always this bad.
Look at me-- I'm crying like a baby.
We've all cried.
Sometimes it's the only thing you can do.
I went through my charts again
and I found another commonality
to every one of my post-op infection mortalities.
What am I looking for?
I highlighted his name.
Babcock?
Yeah, he was in every case.
I only missed it before
because he stepped in for Dr. Zogoiby--
whose handwriting is illegible.
Sounds like Dr. Babcock is going to have a date
with your friend from the Health Department.
Phone call, Dr. Greene.
Take a message.
He knew I was being investigated.
Why didn't he step forward and say something?
Maybe he didn't want to be probed
or forced to give stool samples.
Mark, I'm being serious.
Who knows what he's working with in his lab.
I'm sorry, Dr. Greene, that's Rachel's school.
They need for you to pick her up.
Is she all right?
She got suspended.
For what? I don't know.
I really don't think that's any of my business.
Suspended? It must be some kind of mistake.
Probably drug-related.
You'd better go. I'll deal with this.
How's he doing?
Well, pulse ox is 98 on 50%.
Good.
Mr. Hilliker, we had to put a tube down your throat
to help you breathe but I'm going to take it out now, okay?
I want you to take some deep breaths
and when I say blow, I want you to blow as hard as you can.
Ready?
Okay, blow.
( blowing )
( coughing )
( raspy ): I'm sorry.
Try not to speak, Mr. Hilliker.
Take some deep breaths.
( coughing )
Tell him.
Okay, Mr. Hilliker, just relax.
Just relax.
He doesn't want us to tell the police what happened.
He's still got a lot of buddies on the force.
I'm afraid we have to.
It's going to be okay, Mr. Hilliker.
It's going to be okay.
( soft raspy breathing )
His wife died last year.
What?
Breast cancer.
He was a respected and decorated police officer.
I mean, the only reason he took the job at the mall
was so that he could still be out there helping people.
Why are you telling me this?
I just thought you should know.
Keep an eye on his vitals
and uh, call for a psych consult.
100.8.
Feels like 108.
B.P. is 140/80 and your white count is 14,000.
You're a little anemic.
Hmm, 40% of menstruating women are anemic.
So my diagnosis is that you're a little run-down.
Maybe it's time to pick a career.
Medicine beats law any day.
My parents will only pay for med school
if I graduate from law school.
If your parents are both attorneys
how come you don't have any health insurance?
Let's just say
I have a sad and complicated relationship with them
that you couldn't begin to understand.
I might surprise you.
You need to start taking better care of yourself, Grace.
You need to make sure that you're eating right
and getting plenty of sleep, and laying off the caffeine.
I would if I could.
I haven't had eight hours' sleep in months.
Do you think you could get me some Halcion?
I don't think so.
Just one dose.
I mean, today is shot for me.
If I could just go home and crash.
Please?
I diagnosed your student's patient.
This is a one-time
special treatment, and only if you promise to do
the other things we talked about.
Cross my heart.
What are the EKG findings for hyperkalemia?
Peaked T-waves, prolonged PR and short QT intervals.
You're good. Mm-hmm.
Hey. Your day getting any better?
Not yet.
Did you talk to your grandmother?
Mm-hmm. How'd she take it?
Sounded like it didn't bother her. She went home.
You let her drive?
No, no. Her driver came and got her.
You have to notify the DMV.
I didn't tell her that yet. Dying's one thing.
Not being able to drive, that's a whole other story.
You have to mail in the notice, Carter.
Technically, I didn't see her as an ER patient. I just brought her in.
It's the law. I can't rat out my own grandmother.
Well, you want me to? She already doesn't like me.
Carter!
Your patient went down.
What happened?
LOCKHART: She must have vagalled.
All right, let's get the gurney.
Whoa.
All right, come on.
Robert, I need to talk to you.
Somebody took target practice on a school crossing guard.
I've got to plug her up before she bleeds to death.
It's rather important.
Well, then give me the Cliff Notes.
I'm listening.
Um, I'd prefer to have your full attention.
Suit yourself.
Are you joining us, Elizabeth?
No, I'm afraid not.
Uh, if you could have your assistant page me
when you're done. Please?
Hey.
Hmm.
Thanks for coming.
Want something to eat?
No, no. So, what'd he say?
Well, I talked to both Mitch and Sophie
my friend that works in the Family Courthouse.
And? They both said the worst thing
you can do is fight it.
But I can fight it if I want to, right?
Then it looks like you got something to hide.
Well, what if I'm just offended by the whole principle?
Peter, you go in, you get swabbed, they run the DNA
and you can prove once and for all that Reese is your son.
What if he's not, Jackie?
Is that really a possibility?
( door squeaking )
Ooh.
BABCOCK: What are you doing?
You're out of surgery?
Yeah, the uh, patient coded before we even got started.
What are you doing down here?
I wanted to ask you about a couple of cases.
Uh, you know, uh...
( pager beeps )
It doesn't matter anyway, it'll have to wait.
I've just been paged.
Elizabeth.
Aren't you forgetting something?
I believe those are mine.
Thank you.
I must be dehydrated.
I, um...
All I've had is coffee and a muffin since last night.
You want to tell us about the scars?
I used to be a cutter.
My parents fought a lot when I was a kid
and I was a geek in school.
I developed an eating disorder.
It was my way of dealing with the stress.
Did you ever see anybody about it?
The only people who really seemed to care
were the doctors and nurses.
Which is probably why I'm in med school.
And what about now? Are you still cutting?
No.
Show me your arm.
You don't believe me?
Grace, you have a fever, you have
a borderline white count...
maybe from an infection, maybe from using a dirty blade.
I told you I haven't eaten.
So the eating disorder continues?
No.
I've just been cramming.
Pull up your skirt.
Pardon me?
Let me see your thigh.
I don't think so.
You ass!
You're still cutting.
Hold on, Grace. I have a pathology final.
If you don't agree to speak to somebody
you'll force me to put you on a psych hold.
On what grounds?
Danger to self.
That's not true.
Grace, Grace, wait. Stop!
You're blowing this way out of proportion.
LEWIS: If you just see one of our
psychiatrists, we won't hold you.
Why are you doing this?
Because I know what it's like to need help when you least want it.
Please. Please, just leave me alone.
I can't.
What are you staring at?
You couldn't even diagnose thrombocytopenia.
Get five of droperidol.
No, no, no, no! Stop! I don't need that!
Okay, just get back in the bed, Grace.
Don't touch me! Don't touch me.
Please, please. Okay.
Just take it easy. It's okay.
Please, you'll ruin everything.
Please, you'll ruin everything.
No, please. Stop.
Don't, don't, don't.
Please.
God, you can't even give a half...
( crying )
I had to get another doctor to cover for me.
I'm sorry. Scissors, Rachel?
It's not like they said.
Did you threaten this girl?
It was Natalie Curtis, and I threatened
to cut off her dreadlocks, not stab her.
Why?
She's trying to steal Andrew away from me.
She keeps on sending him notes in class
and, you know, asking him over
to her house to study.
This is over a boy.
It's no big deal, Dad.
Then why aren't you in gym class right now?
Maybe because they stopped teaching "gym"
like, in the '70s.
Don't get smart with me, Rachel.
This is serious.
You've been suspended.
Next time, you will be expelled permanently.
There won't be a next time.
You're right, because now we have a new set of rules.
Like what?
Like, no more rides to school
unless it's with Elizabeth or me.
No more going out on weeknights
or weekends for that matter
for at least a month.
Why don't you just send me to a convent?
I would, but we need you
around the house to do all your chores.
I have chores now?
Yup. From now on
think of yourself as Cinderella
and I'm your evil stepmother.
I've already got one of those.
Keep it up, Rachel
you'll find yourself back in St. Louis.
Why are you doing this to me?
I don't know, Rachel.
Maybe because I love you.
Oh, really?
Yes, really.
Do you know how many messed-up teenagers
I see day in and day out?
Drug addicts, suicides
ten-year-old homeless girls who've been gang raped
'cause nobody gave a damn about them.
Well, I give a damn about you.
You may not like it now.
Hell, you may never like it
but this is how it's going to be.
Get in.
Need any help?
Hey.
Did you page me?
No, but I figured I might find you in here.
Hi, Reese.
How are you?
Good?
Did you talk to Jackie?
Yeah, she thinks I should take the test.
So what happens if you're not...
a genetic match?
Well, I guess that makes it easier
for Roger to fight me for custody.
Nothing's changed, Peter.
You're still his father.
So, what are you two doing for dinner?
Why don't you come to my place tonight?
I still have those fish sticks in the freezer Reese likes.
Hey, hey.
Take it easy.
Someone's getting a little frustrated.
He's tired. He wants to go home.
Daddy can't take you home.
I have to work.
What's he saying?
He wants his other daddy to come take him home.
CARTER: Gamma, because you cannot drive.
Because you could black out.
No, hey.
I-I'm sorry.
No, I'm not.
No, I am not.
She doesn't want to stop driving?
She just called me from the car.
She's been driving around for two hours
just to prove me wrong.
( chuckling )
It's not funny.
She could hurt herself or somebody else.
What are you going to do?
What am I going to do?
What am I going to do-- call the cops on my grandmother?
You already made me call the DMV.
Me? Don't make me the bad guy.
I should go home.
Wait for her.
I can wait with you.
Yeah?
I mean, yeah, if you want.
( knocking )
ROMANO: Enter!
Ah, I was just about to page you.
Have a seat.
So, Elizabeth, Dr. Babcock says
that you were trespassing in his office
and his research area.
Care to elaborate?
I wanted to talk to him.
You knew I was in surgery.
He's worked on every one of my cases
that died from a post-operative infection.
Is this true?
Yes, it's true
and I have evidence to prove it.
So what?
So, you have made it abundantly clear
on more than one occasion
that you are not opposed to euthanasia.
Can't imagine a humane doctor who is.
I have four bodies in the morgue.
That's not my fault.
You need to take responsibility
for your own gross misjudgment.
Time out!
This is a load of crap.
You allow her to operate
on these elderly lost souls who should never be
in surgery, and then when they die
which they inevitably
will, she comes crying to you
looking for someone to blame.
They didn't die from surgery.
They died from the same post-op infection.
The key word there being "post-op."
ROMANO: Okay.
If you hadn't operated on them, they'd be alive.
Okay! Enough. This whole thing has gotten out of hand.
The health department has yet to conclude its investigation
so until they do, neither one of you is in the OR.
Happy?
No. That's not a solution.
It works for me.
I'm not doing
another case with her.
No, you certainly aren't.
Get out, both of you.
You're giving me a headache. Go.
God is love.
LOCKHART: You can go home, Gallant.
Carter already signed out.
Oh, yeah, I know.
I think I'm going to stay and study.
Here?
Maybe I'll pick up some stuff by osmosis.
Well, you'll pick up something.
Hi.
Feeling better?
What do you want?
I heard you talking about your pathology exam
and I thought you might like to take a look at Robbins.
Thanks.
( sighs )
I'm sorry about some of the crap I said to you.
I think I was just a little stressed.
Yeah, I know what that's like.
So, you, uh... you obviously
know your vasculitities.
How are you with your, uh, glycogen storage diseases?
Not so good.
Yeah, me, neither.
Mr. Benton?
I'm Asha.
You're here for a DNA test?
Yeah.
Okay.
Don't worry, it's painless.
I'm just going to use this little swab
to wipe the inside of your cheek, okay?
Yeah.
Say, "ah."
Ah.
Oh.
Okay.
All done.
That wasn't
so bad, now was it?
I can't believe it.
I didn't believe it either.
Fentanyl.
If you're going to abuse drugs, abuse a good one.
Wow.
I've been clean and sober for over a year.
You got it out of your system.
Well, I wouldn't say that.
What?
Nothing.
Disappointed in me?
No, no.
I'm just...
You were stabbed.
Twice.
I don't recommended it.
( giggling )
Can I see your scar?
What?!
Show me your scar. No.
Why not? Why?
Don't be bashful.
No, get your own.
( laughing )
Why do I feel like a school kid sitting out here?
Must be the adolescent sexual tension.
Mm.
That's it.
You know I used to have a crush on you.
Used to?
It's all coming back to me.
( laughs )
I used to have a crush on you, too.
Liar.
I did.
You were cute.
Real cute, but...
But?
Well, you were a med student.
I was a resident.
Well, I'm a resident now.
Chief resident.
That's right.
I'm glad you came back.
Me, too.
Gamma's home.
