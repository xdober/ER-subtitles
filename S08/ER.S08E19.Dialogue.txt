Previously on ER...
I'm a drunk.
How long have you been sober?
Almost five years.
Brian! Brian!
( groans )
Is there somewhere you can stay tonight?
I'll figure something out.
So, you have your place back?
He offered it to me, yeah.
Greg Pratt? Yes.
Mark Green. How you doing?
Do I seem like a punk to you? No.
Then how about you stop treating me like one.
I know everybody thinks you've changed, Chloe
and I hope to God that you have
but, I mean, do you really think you can be a good mother
to this little girl?
I'll be right back.
Okay.
You like macaroni and cheese?
Who? Me? No.
That's all I've got.
What?
For dinner.
Too bad.
Oh, well, it's not so bad
if you kick in a few bucks for a nice bottle of wine.
I've got your meds, Mr. Walden.
Are you asking me out?
I'll pass.
Why?
I don't like macaroni and cheese.
Well, then you cook something.
I don't think so.
What? You can't cook?
I'm not making you dinner.
Wow. I just figured you'd want to eat first.
First?
You know, before things get hot and heavy.
( laughs )
Okay, sure.
Come on, you can't tell me
you wouldn't want to go home
have a nice hot shower, glass of wine
some great sex.
Did someone say sex?
Do you like macaroni and cheese, Pablo?
Oh, yeah, I love it.
You got yourself a date.
Yuck. I don't even know what half this stuff was.
( knocking on door )
Were you expecting someone?
No.
Hey. Come on in.
Hey, Carter.
Would you like some pizza?
I just came by to make sure you were settled.
I'm getting there.
Yeah, I can see that.
It's a little housewarming gift.
Welcome home.
Oh... you got to make it stop, man.
Hey, I can't help you
unless you settle down and tell me what's wrong.
Need a hand?
It's in my stomach.
Did you ingest something, sir?
No.
My brother...
Wait, wait...
your brother what?
Did he give you something?
No. He's inside me.
Want me to call for a psych consult?
Not yet. Are you taking any drugs?
He's trying to bite his way out.
I'm going to get some haldol.
I didn't ask for that.
Stop it.
And some soft restraints.
No. Look, I fly the plane.
You serve the coffee.
MAN: I think he's angry.
Oh, God.
Fine, he's all yours.
Pratt, did you do a repeat
EKG on Finestien?
No.
You need to do serial EKGs to rule out an MI.
His first EKG was normal.
He could have pseudonormalization of his T-waves.
I got to get him out before he kills me!
Calm down.
A little help!
Hey, Haleh, let's get hard restraints
haldol and psych consult.
Better get a wrist film too.
ROMANO: Did you know
that "lesbians are at a higher risk of breast
"cervical and ovarian cancers
"because they are less likely
to have children by age 30, if at all."
Is that so?
Yeah. "Lesbians are less likely to see healthcare
"because of the discomfort of coming out
to healthcare providers."
Why are you telling me this?
"Lesbians are also less likely
"to get routine gynecological services
which means later detection of these cancers."
Robert. Huh?
Do you have to keep saying that?
What? Lesbians?
I'm just reading what it says.
Don't.
I can't help it.
Kerry, I-- this gets me excited.
You want to know why?
Because this smells like money.
Your sisters are underserviced
and we can fix that.
Yeah, you're trying to exploit my lifestyle.
No, I'm not.
I am trying to accentuate the positive here.
You're Chief, you're gay, you're challenged... Ah, challenged.
You can be poster girl for County General's
new Center for Lesbian Excellence.
No.
You haven't even seen the proposal.
What proposal?
It's in the press packet.
Read it before the news conference.
You better be kidding.
This is going to be great!
What are you doing?
Damn toaster ate my Pop Tart.
Is that a switchblade?
I couldn't get my brass knuckles in the slot.
Whose stuff is this?
It's Pratt's.
I don't think Weaver's given him a locker yet.
I hope you unplugged that thing.
( toaster rattling )
Very funny.
LEWIS ( phone message ): Hi, it's me.
I'm out saving lives or shopping.
Leave a message. ( beep )
At least I'm honest.
Have you heard about a replacement for Dr. Green?
This is Frank from Castle Automotive.
Your car needs a new battery.
It's 180 bucks with labor. Get back to me.
$180. I barely make that resuscitating somebody.
Are you covering for...?
SUZY: Aunt Susan? It's Suzy.
Wait.
My mom's really sick.
We're in a hotel. I think she needs a doctor.
I can't wake her up. I got to go.
CHLOE ( on phone ): Hello...
Chloe?
We're not at home
but if you want to leave a message for Chloe or Joe
wait for the beep.
Chloe, hi, it's Susan. Are you there?
Chloe?
Are you there?
Your brother-in-law's a cop?
Yeah, in New Jersey
but I couldn't get a hold of him either.
His precinct said he took a few days off
but they don't know where to reach him.
Mmm. Do you have caller ID at home?
No.
Can't you just trace the call or something?
Yeah, I'll see what I can do.
Okay.
You okay?
I don't know what to do.
I'm sure it's nothing.
You know kids; active imaginations.
Dr. Lewis, Mrs. Reynolds
would like you to go over her husband's aftercare.
I did.
She has a few more questions.
It's a damn carbuncle.
I'll go talk to her.
No, Carter, you don't have to do that.
It's all right; I rock with carbuncles.
Thanks.
What room?
Exam four.
I'll be right there.
You got a minute?
Yep. What do you need?
I need to talk to you.
Go ahead.
About Abby.
What about her? What do you think?
She's drinking again, or didn't you notice?
WEAVER: Luka, seven-year-old witnessed 15-foot fall, headfirst.
He was climbing a tree on a class trip.
Page surgery.
Stabilize the neck.
Get Peds neurosurge down here.
JARVIK: Is that spinal fluid?
Looks like it. Prep 30 grams of mannitol.
Sats 93% on four liters.
Blood in the left canal.
Feels like a deformity at the angle of the mandible.
DTR's three plus.
We got this, Carter.
Pupils midrange
equal and reactive.
Probable basilar skull fracture.
6.5 ET and a two mac.
Premedicate with 40 of lido and 2.5 of pav.
So, how was it?
What?
Your date with Pablo.
Pretty interesting.
Did you know he used to be with a Mexican circus?
Oh, really?
Yeah. Guy's had a hard life, but intriguing.
He was even shot by border patrol once.
You really had dinner with Pablo?
Not at my place; at Doc Magoo's.
He was hungry and I just can't stand eating alone.
Where's Mrs. Pradeep?
I sent her home.
Excuse us.
I didn't sign off on her chart.
There was nothing wrong with that woman.
She just wanted a free meal.
Yeah, I sign off on every single patient you see.
I don't care if they stop in here
for directions to Wrigley Field.
Got it? I got it.
Let me know if you hear anything.
Thanks, Dix. Bye.
Anything?
WILSON: Dr. Lewis?
Yeah?
Phone company traced the call.
Came from a cellular phone
off a network in New York.
New York?
Yeah, it's on the upper west side of Manhattan
which is in the jurisdiction of the 55th precinct of the NYPD
and they're expecting your call.
Thank you.
Yeah.
( phone rings )
5-5 Precinct. May I help you?
Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Please hold.
Bosco, you're early.
They fumigating your apartment?
No. Some jerk from the second watch
has been working out in the weight room
without wiping down the benches.
What do I look like? The gym monitor?
Sir, you have to call parking enforcement.
We don't tow cars.
How hard is it to take a towel
and wipe the sweat off the bench?
5-5 Precinct. May I help you?
I put up a sign, he's still doing it.
Tell you what, I figure out who it is
I'm going to put his head in the squat rack.
Okay, ma'am, let me put you on with an officer.
Bosco, take a missing persons report.
I'm not on yet.
Well, your sweaty manhunt can wait.
Line two.
Be right with you, ma'am.
Officer Boscorelli, how can I help you?
Okay.
Okay, ma'am, calm down.
Ma'am, you got to calm down. Now, listen to me.
When was the last time you talked to your sister?
Abdomen's soft, no guarding.
Two by two abrasion of the left iliac crest.
Let's hold off for now.
Give neurosurge a chance to see him before we paralyze.
Heart rate down to 60.
Six centimeter scalp lac
with exposed gaylee-ah.
I need three-O chromic on a driver.
How's Mark?
He's good.
He's in Hawaii with Rachel.
He's showing her where he grew up.
Oh, that's nice.
I didn't know he grew up in Hawaii.
He grew up in a lot of different places.
He's fixed and dilated.
What? No.
Eight millimeters.
BP's up 160/100.
Cushing's response.
Let's page neurosurge.
There's no response to pain.
Swab.
There's a step off; pretty big skull fracture.
No corneal reflex.
I think he's herniated.
WEAVER: Let's tube him.
200 mikes of Fentanyl
50 of sux.
Won't the sux raise the ICP?
No. It's a myth.
Besides, I don't think it's going to matter.
I have to leave. I put in four calls
to find someone to cover for me.
Wait, slow down, Susan.
My sister and her daughter are missing
and the police aren't helping.
I have to go. I'm sorry.
Whoa, what's going on?
Oh, I'm trying to catch an 11:30 flight.
You're going to New York?
Yeah. I can't sit around here and wait.
What are you going to do?
I'm going to find them.
Jesus was a healer.
Who let Reverend Ed in?
You know the preacher?
He's a holy pain in the ass.
Get rid of him.
Me?
In about ten minutes
he's going to start trying to heal people.
It's bad for business.
REVEREND: You see, the road to recovery
begins when you open your heart to Jesus.
Excuse me, sir.
I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to leave.
Now you treat the body and I treat the soul.
Watch your back, darling.
Gallant! Go with God, my son.
Stanley Sherman, 32
security guard, GSW to the abdomen.
B.P. 140/80, pulse 100 with a liter in.
Pay attention.
Where's it hurt, Stanley?
Where do you think? Right here.
Eyes are open.
Is this the GSW?
Small caliber entry wound to the epigastric area
no LOC, good breath sounds both sides.
Haven't seen you around this morning.
It's been busy.
This is all yours, Pratt.
Okay, CBC, Lytes, BUN and creatine
glucose, accucheck and a hemacue times three.
Okay, a big stick. Say ow.
( yells ) Told you.
Lateral C-spine, AP chest and pelvis.
Bilateral TMs are clear. Head's atraumatic.
Can I do the airway?
No, he doesn't need an airway.
You can do the rectal.
The rectal.
Play nice, kids.
Don't make me stop this trauma.
It's a big gun show in Baltimore this weekend.
You interested?
Uh, no, thank you.
Oh, come on.
Come on, you can bring the kids.
Yeah, okay, let me call Fred
and tell him to pack a bag for the kids
so they can go to the gun show.
Hey, what's up, Lieu?
Your missing persons report from this morning.
Who?
The doctor with the missing sister.
I thought she was in Chicago.
She was. She flew here?
What are we talking about? You brought us in for this, Boss?
Somebody tell me what's going on.
Her sister and her sister's kid
go missing for what, an hour
so she's coming unglued.
Take her out and drive her around.
Oh, you got to be kidding me.
A doctor from Chicago...
That kind of trouble I don't need. Lieu.
Hey, Bosco, whatever you told her on the phone
she hopped on a plane.
Now she's your problem.
I didn't tell her anything.
Well, maybe that's why she got on the plane.
Wait, what's going on?
The sister's missing?
She probably took her to the zoo or something.
Uh, excuse me, excuse me.
Are you the officer I spoke with this morning?
Yeah, hi. Boscorelli. How you doing?
This is my partner, Officer Yokas. Hi.
Susan Lewis. Have you found them?
Uh... I made a few phone calls
but I'm afraid I don't have much.
I called my niece's school.
They said she hasn't showed up in days.
I'm going to get a cup of coffee.
You want some?
No, I'm fine.
You know, uh, Susan?
Yeah.
Like 90% of the time
these things work out to be just fine.
Well, I called their home, his work.
I can't get ahold of anybody.
Maybe the whole family took a trip to Disneyworld or...
I don't know, went fishing or something.
Where do they live?
South Orange.
South Orange?
That's New Jersey.
You know what we can do
we can call the PD over there
and we can have them send a patrol over
and, uh, you know, check it out.
Would you just listen to this?
SUZY ON TAPE: Aunt Susan?
Aunt Susan, it's Suzy.
My mom's really sick.
We're in a hotel.
I think she needs a doctor.
I can't wake her up.
( whispers ): I have to go.
Did you try the hospitals?
Isn't that your job?
Do you have pictures?
Yeah.
Well, what we can do is we can canvass
the hotels in our precinct and see if anybody's seen them.
Can I come with you? No. Yeah.
Thank you.
Stanley, can you hear me? I'm talking to you.
Run in another liter. Let's repage surgery.
BP's dropping.
Set up for a central line. Let's prep the rapid infuser.
He's not breathing.
Bag him, Gallant. What drugs you want, Pratt?
120 of sux, 20 of etomidate.
Sats coming up. 94 percent.
Eight-oh ET and a three Mac. Drugs are in.
I thought this was my tube.
Go for it.
Hey, I'm running this.
Teaching hospital, Pratt.
Come on, give him a shot.
If he doesn't get it, it's mine.
Yeah, don't hold your breath.
Okay, pressure's better, 110 systolic.
All right, keep running it in. I'll give you a crichoid.
You ready?
Okay, okay.
Don't chip his teeth.
Tell me what you see.
Just the back of his throat.
Epiglottis.
All right, lift towards the feet.
Harder.
Good.
Okay, yeah, give me the tube.
Tube.
Just watch it go right through the cords.
Okay...
Okay...
I got it. I'm in.
Easy intubation.
Carter was looking for you.
Oh, he found me.
He didn't seem real happy.
No, he's not.
It's going to be okay.
When Allan fell, he tore a blood vessel in his head.
Can't you fix it?
The neurosurgeon will speak to you
but the CT scan shows damage that they feel is unrecoverable.
But he's still alive.
The ventilator is helping him breathe.
And we're giving him medicines
to stabilize the pressure in his brain
but if we discontinue them
he'll die.
I'm sorry.
Hey, hey, hey, hey. What are you...?
Nice, jag off!
Yeah, what about Mercy?
DISPATCHER: Mercy?
Yeah, Mercy.
Let me check.
No. we got nothing at Mercy.
Okay, 10-4.
Nobody matching your niece or your sister's descriptions or names
have showed up at the morgues or the hospitals.
That's good.
Yeah.
This happens all the time.
You know that, right?
People decide to go somewhere
forget to tell their family members they're going.
All right, thank you. Thanks for looking.
Any luck?
None.
Was your sister and her husband
having problems with their marriage?
Not that I know of.
Was he having any kind of personal problems?
Like what?
Like drugs or alcohol or gambling?
No, he's the one who straightened out my sister.
Straightened her out?
Chloe had a substance abuse problem
for awhile.
She's been clean for five years.
Joe helped her get her life back together.
You should've told us she's a drug addict.
She's not a drug addict.
She had a problem and she beat it.
She's a responsible wife and mother.
If she's so responsible then why are you here?
Surgery's on their way.
You sure you know how to work that?
You spend almost a year at the VA
you learn to work the hardware.
They got a whole floor of vent-dependent Gomers there.
Hey, don't call them that.
Why not? That's what they are.
No, they're veterans who gave themselves
so you could live the life you do.
Nobody ever gave me anything.
Third unit of type specific is up.
Maybe Carter should call surgery again.
They only have so many ORs. They'll come when they can.
( alarm )
Run of ectopy.
Open a crash cart.
100 of lido I.V. push.
Okay, pressure is holding.
Let's start a drip at two milligrams per minute.
Should I get Carter?
( alarm )
It's V-tach.
V-fib. Charge the paddles to 200.
Come on!
ACLS.
We both have a card.
Asystole. Definitely asystole.
Thoracotomy tray.
What?!
Look, I am going to get Carter.
No time! CPR, Gallant.
Get with the program.
Do not do this, okay. They are coming.
They're coming.
What's that?
Notes.
No, no, no, no.
See one, do one.
You heard what Carter said.
This is a teaching hospital.
There's no pressure.
Step back.
Step back!
Okay, fourth to fifth
intercostal space just below the nipple.
I am not doing this! Abby!
Would you shut up? I'm trying to concentrate.
Okay. Okay.
Anything that bleeds, clamp it. Pass me a snap.
Here, this?
No, that's a Kelly.
It'll do. Give it me.
Rib spreader.
Right up here. Yeah.
All right, come on, crank it.
Come on, come on, wider.
Crank it.
What are you doing?
Go get somebody.
Crank it. Wider.
Okay! There, there, there.
Carter your students just cracked somebody's chest.
Whoa.
Pericardium was full of clot.
Are you guys insane?
I need to cross clamp the aorta with that big ass clamp.
If you don't know what it's called
then you sure as hell shouldn't be using it.
Statinsky.
Get out of the way.
Page the OR. Let's get a trauma surgeon down here.
Why didn't you come and get me?
The guy was dying.
Well, if he wasn't, he is now.
BOSCO: All right, I'll check this one out.
Hey, Daryl.
How's my good friend?
You're looking dapper today.
I need some information.
You seen any junkies around?
I'm looking for a junkie with a six-year-old girl.
You seen her?
Man, I ain't seen no little girls, man.
Okay, well, go get the owner.
You know, Bosco's not as bad as he seems.
Come on, go get... what are you ignoring me? Huh?
Go get the owner now before I break your face.
Stupid ass.
Excuse me.
What was that all about?
Daryl wasn't being helpful.
Did he see the mom or the daughter?
Did you even show him the picture?
He went to get the owner.
You know what, you better tone it down
with a civilian in the RMP.
She's wasting our time.
You guys finally going to shut this place down?
Who are you?
Neighborhood watch.
Yeah?
They're hookers, you know.
I believe the politically correct term
is street hostesses.
In and out of this dump day and night.
Stopping traffic up and down the street.
I've been documenting their activity.
Nice work.
Been calling the precinct for months.
Didn't think you guys would ever come.
Yeah? You see that drunk outside the deli over there?
Yeah, I called about him, too.
You got a picture?
I can't arrest him without a picture.
It might be a custody thing with her and the husband.
Right?
Maybe this chick isn't even missing.
Maybe she's hiding from her controlling lunatic of a sister
who jumps on a plane
the minute she doesn't answer the phone.
She flew in from Chicago, Bosco.
She's worried and she's scared.
Junkies go missing all the time.
We aren't out hunting for them.
Well, the sister said she's clean.
Right.
Oh, no, this is a bloody mess.
What did you use to crack his chest, a hand grenade?
Hey, we saved him.
Who the hell are you and why are you talking to me?
You're supposed to be chief resident, aren't you?
Yeah.
Well, you better start acting like one
before your students kill off the rest of your patients.
What's his problem?
His problem is you just hacked up a patient
you shouldn't have been touching.
The guy would have been dead.
Shut up.
Go to the lounge, both of you.
For what?
( sighs )
For once, just do as you're told, Pratt.
Thanks a lot.
Hey, where you going?
To save some more lives.
Yeah, I rented it to a woman on Monday.
They seemed like nice people.
Cute little girl.
Just the two of them?
Yeah.
Did they have any visitors?
Around here we specialize in anonymity.
That and $20 nooners.
Hello.
Hello?
Hello.
The cell's dead.
Yokas!
We should have been working this angle from moment one.
He moved a little.
It wasn't voluntary.
Trees, monkey bars, fences...
He was always climbing.
I swear
he was half monkey.
He's not going to get better, is he?
He's got what we call an axonal injury.
Even if we could remove the blood
the force of the fall damaged the connections of the brain.
Is he suffering?
I think he's gone.
This is just his body.
We want to let him go.
Okay.
Excuse me.
Where's Pratt?
I don't know.
I told you both to wait in here for me.
Yeah, and I'm here.
How's Stanley?
He's still in the O.R.
That was really stupid.
Look, it was not my idea.
You should have come to get me.
I tried.
If I would have left Pratt
the patient would have died for sure.
What was I supposed to do?
Well, you weren't supposed
to crack the guy's chest.
All right, you're on scut duty
for the rest of the day, both of you.
Yes, sir.
You know Dr. Malucci?
No.
That's because he got fired.
He was a hotshot, too.
Killed a guy because he thought he knew everything.
You two pull another stunt like that, you're out of here.
Look, I don't blame you for being angry, Dr. Carter
about what happened, but please, don't confuse me and Pratt.
WEAVER: Gallant!
I thought I told you to get rid of that guy.
I was pulled into a trauma.
Well, it doesn't
look like you're in one now.
The healing will begin.
Forget it.
Pratt, turf that guy.
Yeah, okay.
More suction!
This the GSW?
What's left of him.
What happened?
Well, he had the unfortunate luck
of passing through the ER butcher shop.
Where were you? I paged you about a dozen times.
I had to break the bad news
to the parents of a little boy
with a severe head injury.
Oh. Huh. Right. That old excuse.
Dr. Corday, you have a phone call.
She's busy!
Take a message please.
It's your stepdaughter calling from Hawaii.
She says it's an emergency.
Go.
Metz!
Rachel.
What's going on?
YOKAS: There he is.
Oleg!
Oleg, I want to ask you a few questions.
Come here.
Don't make me get out of the car.
Damn it.
Hang on.
Have you seen them?
How you been, Oleg?!
Get out of there.
Get out of there.
Stand up.
Shut up.
Oops.
What do we have here?
Illegal narcotics?
I'm shocked, man!
Let's do this again, huh?
Look again. Have you seen them?
I'm not good with faces.
Keep looking.
Maybe. There's a shooting gallery in back
of the old carpet factory.
How long ago?
Maybe an hour.
Was the girl there?
There's no kid.
You sure? Huh?
( gasping )
Maybe she
was there-- I don't know.
I didn't see her.
Show some respect for the badge, Oleg.
You're bleeding all over my car.
You may have broken his nose.
Nah, he was always that ugly.
( laughing )
All right. Okay.
Carter, Pratt just did a perfect tap.
Congratulations, now you can go home.
Come on, man.
I told you to wait in the lounge.
What good does that do anybody?
You want to stay here?
You do what I tell you, when I tell you.
It's that simple.
Don't make me be a hard-ass, okay?
Okay.
Gallant's in Exam Four.
Why don't you teach him
how to drain a perirectal abscess?
Uh... did I miss something?
( sighs )
We need to keep our eye on him.
He's good.
He's dangerous.
Any word on Pratt's thoracotomy?
I haven't heard.
Do you want to talk about it?
There's nothing to talk about.
Oh, no?
It started after your assault.
I said I didn't want to talk about it.
No, you said there was nothing to talk about.
Whatever. Carter, it's not what you think.
Just relax. Relax, Abby.
I can handle this.
I'm not throwing the program at you.
I'm just trying to help.
Don't need any help.
Six years. You know?
You were sober for six years.
That's right. That was then.
I'm a different person now.
( snorts )
What? I'm not shooting up.
I had a beer. I had a beer.
Stop trying to make it such a big deal.
Well, it is a big deal.
It's not about the beer
you had yesterday...
or the two you're going to want today
or the six you'll want tomorrow.
It's under control. Oh, is it?
Yes, it is, and it's not a reaction.
It's a decision-- my decision.
We have a 35-year-old restrained driver
in a left T-bone. Possible DUI.
Ran a red, airbag deployed.
Sir, can you hear me?
BP's 110/79 initially, now 100 palp,
Pulse 100.
You guys got this?
No breath sounds on the left.
Probably put down a lung.
This the MVA?
Yeah. Drunk driver.
Trauma Two.
He's satting at 96.
Robert. Not now, Lizzie.
I am not having a good day.
I got spanked in the stock market
some moron from radiology backed into my Jag
and I just spent the last several hours
putting that ER victim back together.
I need some time off.
And I need a month in the south of France
with Vietnamese twins.
It's not going to happen.
It's Mark. He's sick.
I thought he was in Tahiti.
Hawaii. Uh... he's got worse.
I don't think he's going to be able to fly home.
Well, you'd better go to him.
I don't know how long I'll be.
We'll survive.
Thanks.
Anything I can do?
Pray.
It's not exactly my strong suit
but, uh, in this case, I'll make an exception.
Sats are still dropping.
This guy smells like a distillery.
Better get that blood alcohol.
Did he hurt anybody else?
I don't know.
Well...
I guess this is the downside of a three-martini lunch.
7.5 tube and a curved blade.
Better open the crash cart.
I'm going to need some O-neg
and a chest tube tray.
I got that.
LEWIS: Chloe!
Chloe?!
BOSCO: Whew! Smell that?
Welcome to urine town.
How hard is it to find a toilet and take a piss?
BOSCO: Fellas, you don't want to be here. Split.
LEWIS: Chloe!
BOSCO: Get lost.
Oh...
Over here.
Over here.
I think it's her.
Let me see. Chloe?
Chloe, oh, my God. Chloe. Chloe!
Where's Suzy? Where is she?
Chloe, wake up.
Is she breathing?
Uh, it's shallow.
This is 5-5 David.
I need a bus at 1047 and East 93rd forthwith. Damn it.
No little girl.
She's not here.
Oh, God.
I can't get a line-- Kim, stop.
She needs more Narcan now.
Who are you?
I'm her sister.
I give up. Let's go.
No, she's barely breathing.
IM Narcan sucks.
She needs a central line.
I can do it. I'm an ER doctor.
Are you licensed in New York?
No.
Hospital's only three minutes out. We'll be fine.
Look out, she's going to blow!
She say anything?
No, she's too out of it.
You need to tube her to protect her airway.
Yeah, I know. Thanks.
You guys going to Mercy? Can I go with you?
You'll need a second set of hands.
No, it's against department policy.
Can you give her a lift?
Yeah, come on. We'll follow them.
Let's roll.
Know what, come on!
Jump in! Come on!
He's dead.
When was his last epi?
Give up, Luka.
You're not going to get him back.
He tore out his aorta.
Time of death, 7:33.
What a waste.
She's a big girl, Carter.
Yeah, with a drinking problem.
I don't tell people how to live.
She was living in your house.
I didn't make her start drinking.
You didn't stop her.
She's not a drunk.
Yes, she is.
Are you stupid or do you just
not give a damn about her?
Or do you want her to keep drinking, is that it?
You like them a little vulnerable
so you can play the caring, brooding comforter?
Don't push your luck, Carter.
What are you going to do, beat me up?
You going to bash my head into the ground?
Get out of my way.
If you're not helping her
you're hurting her.
Another two of Narcan IM.
What's the total? Six.
What can I do to help?
Nothing. I mean it.
Sit on your hands if you have to.
We're good at this.
I promise
she's going to be fine.
( moaning )
Chloe, what were you taking?
( mumbles )
How are we doing?
BP's 140/80
pulse 90.
That's kind of high for heroin.
Chloe, were you doing coke?
Were you speedballing?
Step on it! She's throwing PVC's!
Chloe, where's Suzy?
Call dispatch
tell them that we're...
Lost her pulse.
Out of the way!
I mean it! What did I tell you?
She's in V-fib.
Charging.
You need to intubate her.
Clear!
Nothing.
Charge at 300.
You need to intubate her now.
No. Clear!
Pratt!
I told you to get rid of him.
Pratt!
I told him to do it.
What is with you people?
You can't turf one lunatic?
He cured my sciatica.
What?
I was tossing him out--
he put his hands on my back and my sciatica's gone.
Yeah, so's your brain.
All right. Hey, you!
That's enough.
You're out of here.
Worry not, my child
and put your faith in his powers.
You know what, I need you to...
Believe in his powers!
Let the passion of his love heal you!
Believe in his power!
Get out, get out!
Stop! Get out. Get out of here.
He's going to live-- Stanley.
I did the right thing.
You were lucky.
It could have gone the other way.
But it didn't.
Not this time.
Is Dr. Weaver here?
Is this an emergency?
No. We're from the Illinois Women's Health Coalition.
Dr. Romano said she was working.
All right, I need you to get out!
Get out! Go on, get out!
I don't want to see you in here again unless you're on a gurney!
Go!
Carter.
I just wanted to apologize if I was abrupt earlier.
Um...
But I...
I didn't want you worrying about me.
Well, somebody should.
Not you.
It's too complicated.
What's so complicated?
You and me.
Us.
What us? Is there an us?
Like I said, it's complicated.
I appreciate your concern, and I'm okay.
Thanks.
Hey.
I dreamed you were here.
Chloe, where's Suzy?
She's with me.
She's not with you.
Did you leave her in the hotel room?
Did you take her with you to get drugs?
Chloe?
I don't know.
Chloe, Chloe, think.
Think, Chloe!
Maybe he... maybe he took her.
Who? Joe?
( crying )
Chloe?
Chloe!
He broke my heart.
Where's Joe?
Is Suzy with Joe?
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I screwed up.
Oh, I screwed up.
I'm sorry.
Yeah, Chloe.
You screwed up.
( sobbing )
( banging noise )
( locks rattling )
( tires squealing )
( woman screaming )
( television stops )
( car door closing )
Dr. Lewis?
Nothing?
We've got officers out
canvassing the entire precinct.
How's your sister?
She's stable.
The detectives want to talk to her.
( sighs )
She doesn't remember anything.
Uh, the longer she's missing
the worse it gets, right?
Because I heard that if you don't find them
in the first 12 hours...
Do you have a place to stay?
If you want, I can take you to a hotel.
No, I couldn't sleep if I wanted to.
Where's your partner?
He's out looking.
When's your shift over?
Oh, um...
It was over a few hours ago.
( crying )
She's only six years old.
Yeah.
