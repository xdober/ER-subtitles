LEWIS: Elmira.
CARTER: Mexico?
Upstate New York.
Chloe stayed at a motel there for two weeks.
The cops told you that?
No. It showed up on Joe's credit card bill.
Who's Joe?
Her husband... or ex-husband.
He's driving up there.
Will you hold this?
Is that numb yet, Mr. Cannillo?
My whole face is numb.
Maybe I should, too.
God knows what she's doing
and Suzy needs to be in school.
Ow!
Got it. Okay, let's watch that back cast
next time, Mr. Cannillo.
Chloe could lose her in a heartbeat
and we might not be so lucky again.
I need that woolly bugger back.
It's on the tray.
You could have her declared an unfit mother.
Then Joe gets Suzy.
If he wants her.
I don't know.
Hey, lady, where in the hell's my leg?!
I believe it was amputated.
Not the real one, you moron. My prosthetic.
You sure you had one when you came in her, Toby?
Hell, yes. She took it. Give it back.
What would I want with your leg?
You tell me, you pervert.
Can you describe the leg?
Yeah, it looks just like this one
only it's plastic.
Okay, we'll see if we can't get you one.
Haleh, fly fisher needs a tetanus shot
and can you check central supply?
See if we have any extra orthopedic legs.
Somebody stole Toby's leg again.
Uh-huh.
Thanks for defending me.
The guy needs a free leg. You got both of yours.
Is this server down again?
A half hour. We're loading new software.
Did we get the LP results back on Jessup?
Do you know where the fax machine is?
Hey, Frank, did a match letter come for me today?
Do I look like the Postmaster?
They hand out match letters at the Dean's office.
Yeah, I know that, genius.
I forgot to pick it up
and they said they sent it here.
You forgot to pick it up?
I had a date.
Hey, when did this come in?
What?
This letter. Dr. Greene.
Stick it in his box.
I'll mail it to his house.
No, it's from Dr. Greene.
To who?
Everyone, I guess.
What's it say?
Says, "Dear ER gang."
Ooh, we're a gang now?
We got a secret handshake and everything.
While you were in Phoenix.
Go on, Carter.
"Dear ER gang.
"So here I am out on the beach at 5:30 in the evening.
"Elizabeth is sitting with me drinking juice
but I'm all about the Mai Tais."
What's he reading?
Dr. Greene sent a letter.
"The sun is going down
"Rachel is dipping Ella's toes in the ocean
as they head off on a quest for the perfect seashell."
"Wish you were here" would have done it.
Yeah, he doesn't have to rub it in.
"I find myself thinking, 'You know what would make
"'this moment complete?
"'Some jogger dropping to the sand short of breath
"'so I can swoop in with a piece of bamboo
to perform a nice clean intubation...'"
What's this? It's Mark.
"'...fix the guy up and send him off
with a good, simple dispo.'"
The day I start fantasizing about critical procedures
is the day I leave, too.
"Which, I guess, is my way of saying that I miss you all
and that dingy place."
Kovac, you want another five...?
Shh. Dr. Greene.
"Lots of times I thought I should have chosen
"a different career or gone into private practice
"something easier, less grinding, more lucrative.
"But since I've been gone
( clears throat )
"I've realized that outside
"of what I'm doing right now sitting on this beach
"with my family, staying at County all those years
"doing what we do on a daily basis
"was the best choice I ever made.
"I know what you're thinking, but trust me
it's not so hard to appreciate once it's over."
I think that's the Mai Tais talking.
( laughing )
Shut up. Keep reading.
"As much as part of me would like to believe
"that the ER can't go on without me
"the smarter part realizes that you're an incredible group
"of doctors and nurses who approach every day
"with such skill, compassion and thoroughness
"that when it comes to patient care
I know my absence will hardly be felt."
Hmm, I'm not so sure of that.
"As for friendship and camaraderie
"well, that's another matter.
"In order to leave, I had to go the way I did
"but I wouldn't want any of you to think
"that that meant I didn't value each of you
"and the years that we worked together
"or that I didn't have things
"of a more personal nature to say.
"Most of you, I think, have an idea
"of what those things might be
without me writing them down, but still."
Go on.
There's just a couple dots and then
"Ella is laughing and waving for me.
Rachel's found her shell."
JARVIK: Nothing else?
FRANK: Probably jammed.
That damn machine's been on the fritz all week.
WRIGHT: Is there a transmission report?
ABBY: Oh, so he faxes the letter
so he doesn't have to send the macadamia nuts.
( laughing )
What? What is it?
This is from Dr. Corday.
( voice breaking ): "Mark died this morning... at 6:04 A.M.
The sun was rising, his favorite time of day."
( clears throat )
"I sent this on so that you might know
"he was thinking of you all and that...
"he appre... he appreciated knowing
you would remember him well."
( sighs )
Post it on the floor, Frank.
That last part?
The whole thing.
It ain't my heart.
Cold, that's all.
And I need some of that breathing stuff.
PRATT: B.P.'s 100/76.
Sally bolus?
Sally?
Bolus normal saline.
Start an insulin drip.
Why don't we work him up first?
Where's my cart?
CBC, lytes, BUN, creatinine.
Wait, he's a brittle diabetic in DKA.
We need to get his sugar down.
You don't even know his sugar.
Get Dr. Greene.
He knows what to do.
Dr. Greene is not here today.
Then I'll come back later.
No. I'm worried that you might have
some fluid in your lungs, and you have a high fever.
Fever? I'm colder than that hawk out there on a windy day.
EKG, chest X ray, cardiac enzymes.
DKA-- I'm telling you.
And send off LFTs.
You want his bank statements, also?
Last time someone stole my dictionary.
Bet $20 he's over 400.
Dr. Carter?
What?
Just... plug him in.
Dr. Weaver.
( clears throat )
Dr. Weaver?
When did... When did this, um, get...?
You were at lunch.
And you felt the need
to post it on the bulletin board?
Well, he wrote it to the ER.
Do you want us to take it down? No.
Double MVA rolling up. Father/daughter...
Carter and Lewis.
And George cut himself again.
In a minute.
OLBES: Auto versus cement truck.
Ten-year-old unrestrained backseat passenger
Flew into the front, hit the deployed airbag.
I'm Dr. Lewis. What's your name?
Melissa.
Melissa, were you knocked out? No.
Does it hurt?
In my chest.
36-year-old restrained driver.
with hip and pelvis pain.
LOC? No, GCS 13.
Dan, can you tell me where it hurts you most?
Right leg and my throat.
All right, let's page surgery.
Tell RT to get the heliox.
Has his voice changed?
Maybe a little.
Is my daughter here?
Tachy at 108.
Full trauma panel.
Follow the light with your eyes.
BP? HALEH: Cycling.
Melissa, did you hurt your neck at all?
No. Are you sure?
( crying ): Yes.
It's okay, sweetie, it's okay.
We're going to take care of you.
Where's my dad?
Another doctor's helping him.
Okay, I'm going to take this off.
I need you to be really still. Okay.
Like a statue. Yes.
Okay, here we go.
Oh, good girl.
Lateral C-spine, chest and pelvis.
Pressure's 100/70.
Is the fiber-optic in here? Back counter.
CARTER: What's his pressure? 95.
Dad! Is that my dad?!
Tender at left axilla. Might be a rib fracture.
Hemacue times three and a foley.
Dad!
Sorry.
Hang two units of O-neg. I need a crit.
Sats are falling-- 92.
Okay, we're going to crike him.
Give me some cervical traction and oral airway.
Oh, God. What?
Large hematoma right in front of the trachea.
You got to be kidding me.
Can you cut through that?
Nope. I won't be able to see anything
through all that blood.
Pulse ox is not corresponding.
I can't feel the landmarks.
We need an airway.
( sighs ): Damn it.
What do you want to do?
Give me the scope.
First hemacue at 13.4.
Okay, what are we talking about?
Give me some cricoid pressure. On what?
Dial up the source all the way.
Hello, anybody home?
Swollen airway, expanding hematoma
blocking trach access.
How long's he been down?
Two minutes.
And you haven't criked him?
Too many vessels. 11 blade, now.
Wait. I can't see what I'm doing as it is.
Trousseau dilator. Pulse ox 84.
Bradying down.
Just wait one second. I'm almost underneath it.
Cutting. No, wait! Wait! I said, wait!
His heart rate's 60.
Most chief residents know he'll arrest.
And we don't have an airway.
A mig of atropine.
Trauma shears.
What are you doing?
Just clamp.
LOCKHART: BP's 80 systolic.
No, you'll hit the internal carotid.
Tracheostomy.
( man breathing )
Field airway.
Sats are climbing.
Dr. Lewis? Next door.
Call RT for a vent. AC 12, 750cc tidal on 100%.
A little less whining
and a little more action next time, Dr. Carter.
LEWIS: No deformity. No step off.
Dr. Lewis. How about here?
GIRL: A little.
Five by seven mass over the scapula.
Let's have surgery take a look at this.
Susan, it's your sister.
What?
She's on the phone.
No, Chloe, you disappear with Suzy
after almost killing yourself.
You don't call for three weeks.
Yeah, well, I hope so.
Are you in an out-patient program?
Where's Suzy going to stay?
He took you back?
Oh, damn it.
No, no, not you Chloe.
You know what?
Fine, fine, fine.
Just give me the number, okay?
Yeah, Chloe, listen.
Yeah, I have to go.
Chloe, I have to go.
Yes, I love you, too.
( sighs )
GALLANT: CT's ready.
Urine is dip negative for blood.
Forget the foley. Page peds oncology.
Calcified mass in the lung field.
She has cancer?
KOVAC: Keep your ankle cocked.
It's hot. It'll warm as the fiberglass hardens.
I tried to be careful.
Don't touch it.
That was too long. It's fine.
It's too long. It'll itch.
Okay, I'm done.
Who's picking you up?
I took the train.
I'll get you a cab voucher.
Keep it dry... Plastic bag, like before.
Come back in ten days.
GEORGE: There were buns.
I saw on TV..
those cutters...
where you put the bun in a covered white thing
and then press down on the handle
and it slices without using a knife.
I asked Lance to get one of those
and he said those guys are crooks
and it would break right away.
What are you doing?
This one's too long.
Stop it. Stop it.
George, I told you not to touch it.
Damn it, George.
I'm sorry.
I don't care if you're sorry
I don't care if you're stupid. You don't listen!
If you don't listen, it'll never heal!
Kerry, I'll do it.
You should go home.
( choked up ): I'm sorry. I'm sorry, George.
I'm sorry.
( crying )
Casper's Foley bag is full.
I know.
I don't know why I bought hoops.
They were cute.
Yeah, the three-year-old in Four thought so, too.
Did you think it was going to happen so soon?
He stopped treatment.
Yeah, I know, but still.
He was just here, working.
I keep expecting to see him
walk around the corner or something.
He was 38 years old.
Too soon by any calculation.
Yeah.
Hey, uh, when are you off?
Now.
Just don't feel like going home.
What do you say we go out and get plastered?
I would say that's an appropriate response.
Susan, I have to go.
Bohan is an IUP, 12 weeks and spotting.
Ultrasound's otherwise negative.
Okay, Carter's on for another couple hours.
I'm just waiting on a parent to transfer a girl to oncology.
Okay.
I'm sorry about Mark.
Yeah.
Hey, Kerry...
Hey, Kerry, we're going out for drinks.
You want to come?
Uh, thanks.
I'd like to, but I can't.
Yeah, sure, you can. The Lava Lounge on Damen.
I have other plans, but thanks anyway.
Okay.
Good night. Bye.
Lava Lounge?
Yeah, you kind of have to see it.
Dr. Romano needs you.
Tell him I'm icing my ear.
He's putting a chest tube in your patient.
What happened?
He came down for a consult.
I canceled that consult.
28 French on a vascular clamp. Hang in there, Melissa.
What are you doing?
Where's her CT?
Oncology has it. Oncology?
Incidental finding. Likely Rhabdomyosarcoma.
She have a hemo-pneumo? No.
Well, she does now.
What is it?
We're going to put a tube in your chest
to help you breathe better, okay, sweetie?
I'm in. Thoraseal.
Probably outgrew its blood supply
and bled into her chest cavity.
Come on, my dog fetches faster.
Is my mom here yet?
Yeah, she's on her way.
Call the O.R., tell them we have a red blanket.
You, get consent.
Her father's in the SICU. You criked him, remember?
Melissa, sweetheart, you need an operation.
What? We're going to take care of you.
200cc's already. Second signature.
Let's go!
Don't worry.
( sighs )
We'll blow it off and go some other night.
No, you changed your shift.
Kerry, the guy died.
You should be with your staff tonight.
They were being polite.
They're your friends.
They're people I work with.
When one of our guys goes down
the company gets together, and we get drunk.
It's more for the unit than the guy who's gone.
I'm not a firefighter.
Basically the same job, isn't it?
You put out fires.
Mark and I always butted heads.
I was always trying to maneuver him
gain some kind of edge
like it had to be a competition
and he just wanted to do his job well and go home.
I've known this was coming for a while
and I never imagined that I would feel like this.
You've lost a friend.
I think I have.
All I got out of him was that they put him on dialysis
for three days upstairs once, and he hated it.
Then he passed out.
As in vagalled?
As in old.
Did you find his old chart?
Still pulling it. I need a forklift.
His temp's down, but he's altered.
Called me son once.
Glucose is over 400-- you owe me 20 bucks--
started that insulin drip.
And he could be uremic.
You know, your basic MIMP.
Mimp?
Multiple Medical Problems.
You just make this stuff up?
What? Multiple Medical Problems. MMP. Mimp.
All right, start with a urogram
and do a repeat Chem 21.
I repeated it twice already. Scratch that.
Just CT his belly and his pelvis and then call nephrology.
Nephrology won't take him; he's septic.
Well, then we'll dialyze down here
until we can admit to the unit.
Or we could turf him to medicine
and let them figure it out.
Right now he belongs to us.
Okay, okay, I'm going to write this down now.
You sure you're not going to change your mind again?
Pratt, your letter.
Where was it?
Filed "N" for "Ne'er-do-well."
What's your first choice?
I ain't saying.
See you at the Lava Lounge, Dr. Carter?
What?
Couple people going out for drinks.
Don't feel like doing much else.
Who?
Dr. Kovac, Dr. Lewis, Abby, Haleh.
Uh, yeah, maybe, I don't know.
I got some dictations I need to finish.
Okay, if you change your mind.
Good night.
Bad news?
Yeah, you could say that.
Second choice?
Last choice.
Well, someone's got to get their last choice.
Where is it?
Here.
Oh. Good for us.
I know I better be getting my damn locker.
MAN: Well, that was fast.
What?
You haven't even had a drink yet
and you already got somebody's number.
Oh, my God, what is that?
Two Sacrificial Virgins.
How much alcohol is in there?
Enough to make you forget
you're being thrown into a volcano.
Oh, I get it... I think.
Do you need some help?
Yeah.
Can I start a tab?
Sure... Susan.
Thanks.
Oh, my God, those are our drinks?
Too tacky?
Oh, no, not for this place.
I'm just bummed I forgot my grass skirt.
Yeah, I was going to wear my coconut bra
but it's so itchy.
How did you even know about this place?
Mark had a birthday here once.
It seemed appropriate.
KOVAC: Thanks.
Haleh?
Martini.
Coke.
Where'd they find all this stuff?
It's kind of creepy.
I keep expecting Vincent Price to show up.
What?
So, should we, uh, toast or something?
Good idea.
Me?
You knew him the longest.
I'm not very good under pressure.
Someone else go first.
( sighs )
( speaking Croatian )
What the hell.
I'll drink to that.
( chuckling )
Looks like we're going public.
Hey, Kerry.
Hi.
Well encapsulated, discrete mass.
No extension to the visceral pleura.
Pick-ups.
Did you talk to Dr. Corday?
Yes, Shirley.
I'm at the top of her list.
Right after the funeral home.
( yells )
What?
Penetrated the rib cage.
We are going to be here all night.
At least you caught it.
Amazing how the human body can turn on itself.
The very process we need to grow in the womb
to regenerate ourselves, systematically eating us alive.
And no one's sacred.
Little girls, fathers with little girls...
Cancer-- brain cancer, liver cancer, breast cancer.
It's... the same traitor--
the same merciless, unrelenting predator
like time itself.
I hope you're not driving.
LEWIS: No.
You're not on call, are you?
What are you, some sort of Nazi bartender?
Ah, I prefer to think of myself as magnanimous.
Hey. Hmm.
Hey, Carter.
We thought you were going to blow us off.
Did you pick this place?
She's outside.
Who?
John Carter makes an appearance.
Abigail Lockhart sits alone.
( laughs )
It's a nice jacket.
Is it new?
What, do you have ESP?
No. Your car's right there.
I saw you circle the building twice.
Thanks for yelling out directions.
Well, I didn't want to encourage you.
I don't think
you should be hanging around in bars.
You got me there.
Great letter, though.
I especially enjoyed the surprise ending.
I didn't write it.
Well, that's the last time
we let you read out loud then.
Suddenly antisocial?
Well, you just missed my table dance.
Hula?
Oh, yeah.
Oh, I'll have to stick around for the second show.
( laughs )
How many lives do you think?
What?
How many lives do you think he saved?
Oh.
It's hard to say.
One a shift on average, I guess.
Five shifts a week.
Over ten years.
It's like two or 3,000 people.
Yeah.
Forget Superman.
I'll take Mark Greene.
Well, if I knew you felt that way
I would have shaved my head a long time ago.
Are you okay?
Come on.
Come on, what?
Let's get out of here.
And ditch our friends?
I think that they'll get over it.
Okay.
You know I have a free tiki mask in there.
I'll buy you another one.
Okay.
Where are we going?
I know a place on Franklin.
The titty bar?
No.
Well...
Oh, the tattoo parlor?
No. No.
Where are we going?
Bill's place.
( giggles )
No. Whoops. No, thank you. No, no, no.
Come on. There's a meeting that starts at 1:00.
Well, that's great, go on ahead.
I'll catch up. When's the last time that you went?
What do you think?
Well, then what's it going to hurt?
Well, it'll kill my buzz for starters.
Come on, Abby. One step at a time.
No. I was your sponsor, remember? Save the dogma.
And besides, you're screwing it up.
I'm screwing it up? Yes.
Would you say that I'm drunk? Yeah.
You're not supposed to go to meetings drunk.
I think that they'll overlook it.
And it's voluntary. The program is voluntary.
Well, get in the car voluntarily.
Come on, out of my way, Dudley.
Abby, you are going to the meeting
even if I have to carry you.
Carter, really, thanks for caring.
I appreciate it, but not tonight.
Yeah, tonight.
No. Slow down, tough guy.
Get in the car. No.
Get in the car. No. No.
No.
Hey. Hey, no!
John!
You're going.
Stop. Stop it.
Help! Help!
Aah!
Son of a bitch!
You bit me?
You dropped me.
I cannot believe you just bit me.
I told you to put me down.
I think that might be bleeding. Good.
Everything okay out here?
Yeah. Yeah.
I'm sorry, I just... I can't.
I can't go to a meeting tonight.
I won't do it.
Let's go get something to eat.
Come on, a cup of coffee.
( laughs )
Thank you.
I think I'm going to stop at a pharmacy.
I'll, um, get some gauze, and I'll bandage that.
A crate?
Four feet by two feet.
Greene gets a crate of live lobsters
for a pericardiocentesis?
Every Memorial Day.
Wow, I gave a Heimlich to a kid at the zoo once.
I didn't even get a "thank you."
I've been working up to a fruit basket.
Wait, is this the surf and turf we had on the roof?
Yeah.
Oh, that was good.
We can't tell him.
Tell him what?
That he's dead.
We have to keep it coming.
That's a survivor talking. Mm-hmm.
WOMAN: We're starting breakfast.
You want anything?
Yeah, two mimosas, please.
Excuse me?
No, we're fine.
Started on my birthday.
What?
I didn't start drinking when Brian hit me.
I started drinking before that.
And I probably wouldn't have been stupid enough
to open the door if I hadn't been.
Self-pity excuse.
Well, it's one of my better ones.
What time is it?
Oh, God, it's almost 6:00.
Oh, my God, I have to work tonight.
You sober?
Ugh, unfortunately.
Good, then I have got just enough time
to drop you off at a meeting.
Mmm... no.
I have to go to bed.
Let's go.
Nope.
But if you quit bugging me, I promise I'll go later.
When?
Before my shift.
CHEN: Oh, hey, good, you're here.
Uh, I was going to page you
but Jerry said you were on at 7:00.
You're on at 7:00?
Yeah, I've done it before.
What is it?
It's your homeless guy.
Six beat run of ectopy.
Well, how long has that been going on?
Almost an hour.
I needed to start lido, but I couldn't get a directive
in his chart, and he won't tell me.
( muttering ): She doesn't listen.
70 milligrams I.V. load
and then start a drip at two per minute.
Wait, so he's full code?
There he goes again.
I don't know. He was like
Greene's private patient or something.
Yeah, we lost his pressure.
Mr. Ervin?
No pulse.
Okay, starting CPR.
You sure?
No.
Slow PEA.
Mig of epi, prep an amp of atropine.
Well, guess that clears it up.
Intubation tray.
I'll do it.
Uh, 7.5 ET and a three mac blade.
V fib.
Okay, charge paddles to 200.
No pressure, no pulse.
And clear.
All right, charge again to 300.
Back to sinus.
I've got a pulse.
Tough old bird.
Okay.
20 of etomidate, eight of Pav.
Wait, wait, wait.
Carter, I think he's trying to talk.
( muttering ): Dr. Greene...
No...
What?
No tubes...
and no shock.
What did he say?
He said, "No more."
( footsteps )
Thanks for destroying my night.
Did you get it?
Bled like stink.
Control was nearly impossible around the ribcage.
I was inside and outside the chest on the tonsil.
Did you get it?
Yeah, I got it.
Resected fully.
Margins are clear.
How's Daddy?
Breathing over the vent.
Reflexes fully intact.
Should be extubated by this afternoon.
It was lucky they got plowed
by that cement truck.
These suckers rate 50% mortality once they break out.
( sighs ): I'll tell Mom.
You should get some sleep. You look like crap.
Dr. Romano?
Are you sure you got it?
I got it.
CARTER: The only thing he's been consistent about
is not wanting any medical treatment.
You know, if he had discussed this with Dr. Greene
then there should be a note in the charts.
Well, maybe Dr. Greene expected to be here.
( woman speaking Italian )
Fine. He's your patient.
I have no idea what you're saying.
I'm sorry, I don't...
Should someone save him?
No.
I don't understand.
Arrivederci.
What's the problem, Pratt?
I don't speak Portuguese.
That's Italian.
That either.
( speaking Italian )
Grandma was baby-sitting
and he woke up with this rash.
She can't tell me if he's got any allergies
and I can't find the parents.
Strawberry.
What?
Strawberry.
Jelly, jam. Maybe cereal.
Probably eating it before he went to sleep.
Oh.
Hey, um, you know anybody at Northwestern?
Yeah, I know a few people.
Well, could you do me a favor and call them
and tell them that they made a mistake?
That they should take me?
No, 'cause I'd have to believe that.
Come on. You know I'm good.
Too good to be wasted at County?
I didn't say that.
Look, we're an underserviced community.
We need doctors.
For better or for worse, we drew you.
Blood sugar over 400. Good pick-up.
Yeah, thanks.
( sobbing )
Oh...
I shouldn't have sat down.
If I don't sit down, I won't cry.
You have to sit down eventually.
Yeah.
Can't I just pretend he moved to the South Pacific
and lived happily ever after?
In a way, he did.
A girl and her father
are hit by a cement truck on the way to ballet class.
A malignant tumor invades her chest
and we find it by happenstance.
She'll walk out of here in a week
with not a care in the world.
Mark walked the halls of a hospital every day
and didn't know about his tumor till he presented with symptoms.
Well, we save who we can, right?
It has to make more sense than that.
You're looking for a reason?
I miss him already.
Me, too.
I went away for five years.
I... thought of him on occasion.
Talked to him sporadically.
But I miss him.
I thought he'd always, always be here.
Well, it's good to miss him.
It's the missing him that keeps him here.
( sniffles )
Yeah.
Oh.
Hey.
( sighs )
You should write for Hallmark.
( chuckles )
I have hidden talents.
I'm sorry.
No, no, it's okay.
I should get back to work.
I have a pilonidal cyst in Five
waiting to be lanced.
Give it to Pratt. He needs the humility.
Nah, it'll be cathartic.
Where'd you get that?
What?
The combination.
Oh, Personnel.
Pratt matched at County.
Yes, I know.
He keeps bitching about it.
He needs a locker.
Thought I'd spare Elizabeth the chore.
Heard you had some trouble with Romano yesterday.
He was right.
I took too long making a decision.
Well, you don't have that luxury anymore.
Never really thought I did.
( unfolding paper )
Mark's gone.
That means you've been here longer than any other doctor.
People will look to you to step in and fill the void.
Big void.
Yes, it is.
( voice breaking ): I can't do this.
Will you do this?
Hmm.
Thank... thank you.
Shotgun to the face.
This is going to be fun, huh?
Cheaper than plastic surgery.
How's the bite?
I'm not howling at the moon.
There is no moon.
How'd it go?
What?
The meeting.
It was boring.
You went?
Yeah, I just said it was boring, didn't I?
Sorry, they didn't give me a card.
You went for you
or because you promised me you would?
Is this guy going to look like hamburger?
More like, uh, ground chuck.
Lovely.
I went for you.
( vehicle approaching )
You're going to need some more people.
Why?
( screaming ): No...!
Come on. Hard restraints.
No I.V.?
Got in 20 of morphine before he pulled it out.
Sir, we need you to hold still.
Come on, Gallant, keep him on the table.
100 of Fent, two of ativan.
Page Surgery, Plastics, and Head and Neck.
Could be PCP.
Or the gunshot wound.
Sir, we're going to help you, but you got to hold still
while we get the morphine into you.
Okay, pressure 100/80.
Pulse 150.
Get access. We need to sedate him.
Give me 7.5 E.T.
Won't be able to use it.
Break open lap pads and a crike tray.
Gallant, hold down his arm.
Seven steriles, and an 11 blade.
Drape his neck.
All right, Fent's in.
Get some O2 on him-- 100% by mask.
I'm pushing meds.
Gallant. Gallant.
Okay, okay, okay.
He's settling down. Betadine.
20 of Etomidate.
Are we tubing him or criking him?
Tubing him. Criking him.
I just want to take a peek.
All right, Bradying down.
( groans )
Yeah, he aspirated too much blood.
Open the crash cart.
All right, Gallant
I need you to unroof his jaw
and hold it out of the way.
I need to see the epiglottis.
Mig of atropine.
Susan, just take your finger
and hook it under his tongue.
I can't do this.
Don't you move, Gallant.
Just abduct the mandible.
I need to sit down. Don't move!
V-tach.
All right, I'm in.
Let go, Gallant.
Charge to 200.
Hyperventilating. Sats are 90.
Hold on, hold on. Sinus rhythm.
Okay, full trauma panel, c-spine, chest and pelvis.
Gallant, why don't you go outside
and get yourself some air.
You want a facial C.T.?
Yeah, that's a good idea.
Why don't we get a full head series?
Call R.T., let's get a vent.
Give him four of ativan and seven of pav.
Nice work, John.
Bet that was a new one.
Yeah. Yeah.
Look, I'm sorry.
Uh... I just thought I was going to be sick.
It's better if you keep your head down.
( sighs )
It'll be okay.
It just, uh, just caught me by surprise, you know?
Relax. Take a minute.
You know, sometimes I don't think I can do this.
You know, there's two kinds of doctors.
There's the kind that get rid of their feelings
and the kind that hold onto them.
If you're going to hold onto your feelings
you're going to get sick every once in a while.
That's part of it.
You know, people come in here
and they're sick
and they're bleeding, and...
sometimes they're dying.
And they need our help.
And helping them is more important than how we feel.
( sighs )
But hell, I've been doing this eight years--
I still get sick.
Take another minute.
Did he go up?
O.M.F.S., E.N.T., and Plastics all in.
Both carotids and I.J.s intact.
He must have turned right when the blast hit him.
Good.
How's he doing?
Oh... he'll be all right.
How are you?
( sighs )
Ask me tomorrow.
Good night.
Good night.
He might need some fluid soon.
Nah. Morphine boluses of ten.
I heard you were gone.
No, I'm still here.
Good.
You know, I don't like nobody else helping me.
I know.
You've always treated me like a man.
Just try and relax.
( alarm sounding )
What's that?
That monitor's just a little sensitive--
that's all.
I'm scared.
There's no reason to be.
Everything's okay.
I could have been a better person.
I could have done more.
You did enough.
Stay with me.
It won't be much longer.
I'll stay right here.
Let me see.
I think I singed my eyebrow.
I need to see.
You thought it was a good idea
to put kerosene in your barbecue?
I thought it was lighter fluid.
Well, it doesn't look burnt
but I'll check for corneal burns with an ultraviolet light.
I need everything documented--
Workers' Comp. You're a chef?
It was my summer office party.
Oh, I don't think that counts.
Ah, any word on the air-conditioning?
Yeah, they think they might have it fixed by winter.
Ah, I can't work like this.
You want a Big Stick?
No. Why did I buy these shoes?
'Cause they were cute.
Some help here.
Yeah, what is it?
Car rammed into a picnic at Lincoln Park.
I got three rigs right behind me.
John? Yeah, I got it.
Intubated, regular pulse, good sats.
Get neurosurgery.
Warn C.T. they're going to get busy.
A 12-year-old boy
B.P. 100/60, pulse 120.
Hey, I'm Dr. Carter.
What's your name?
What's that?
Okay, we're going to take care of you.
Somebody set me up a 30 French.
A thorocostomy tray in Two.
Trauma panel, dip a urine, spin a crit
call for a portable chest, and have two units of...
