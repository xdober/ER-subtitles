Previously on ER
Who's that?
GREENE: It's Susan Lewis.
We're supposed to have lunch.
You didn't say anything about having a lunch.
If you want the Chief Residency
it's yours.
Jackie, it's Peter.
If you're there, pick up.
Hey, Roger, it's Peter.
I need you to pick up Reese from school.
I found her.
It's your mother.
Is that breast milk? You're contaminated.
Scrub out, Elizabeth.
What do you want me to do, Rachel?
You could let me stay here.
It's a big move.
Do you guys have a satellite dish?
Well, you're not winning me over.
Signed you up for Tuesday.
You serious?
Yeah, it's, uh...
No, it's my pager number.
Yes, Dr. Kerry Weaver.
No. It's nothing serious.
I just, uh, have some personal information for her.
All right. Thank you.
Oh, good morning.
Good morning.
You all set?
Oh, yeah. I forgot how jammed
the El can be during rush hour.
Is there any chance I could get a locker?
Oh, sure.
Fourth to the right.
I'll have them take the name off.
Welcome back.
Thanks.
MAN: Hey!
Watch out, coming through.
I heard it, but I didn't believe.
Malik.
Oh, we missed you.
They actually talked you
into coming back and working here?
Bad idea?
I didn't say that.
Frank, could you call housekeeping?
Someone took a dump in Exam Two.
Hey, Frank, our mad crapper's back, huh?
If I catch him, he'll be pooping in a bag.
What happened to the board?
Weaver. Weaver.
Hey, Spanky's in Curtain Three
complaining of incontinence.
I'm not touching him.
I'll take him.
I don't think you want that on your first day back.
Here. Leg injury, Curtain One.
Oh. MALIK: Welcome back, Dr. L.
Thanks, Malik.
So what's the story with Spanky?
He likes nurses... a lot.
Oh.
Oh.
Dr. Lewis?
Are you Susan Lewis?
Yes.
Cleo Finch. I'm the Senior
on nights this week.
Nice to meet you.
I have a few pass-ons.
Okay.
Curtain Three, worst headache of his life.
Do a spinal tap if the head C.T.'s negative.
Okay, no problem.
Well, well, well, Dr. Susan Lewis.
Dr. Benton.
Just when I thought it was safe to come to the E.R.
I missed you, too, Peter.
I know.
So, can I buy you breakfast?
I just got here, but you can get me lunch.
Oh, sorry.
I have to sign out and get to Schaumburg.
Another interview?
Nope. The job's all mine.
I'm meeting the medical director today.
Oh, congratulations.
Nosebleed and sutures-- Scott Marisol.
Check on him in 20 minutes and wear a mask. He's a spitter.
Right? Are you going somewhere?
I've been offered the chance
to run a pediatric urgent care.
Five doctors, eight-hour shifts.
No overnights.
Yeah, but it's...
What? In Schaumburg.
It's 40 minutes away.
Uh, I.V. drug user with a shooter's abscess.
Whisked off to eco before I could drain him.
Anything else?
Yeah, they just brought in
a homeless lady with maggots
and I'd see her before they start crawling away.
Oh.
Thanks.
( loud whistling over TV news )
CORDAY: Mark, can you get the water?
Have you seen my vertigo notes?
I got it. What?
My vertigo notes.
They were right here.
We need to leave in ten minutes.
Oh, I'm ready as soon as I find my notes.
Hello. Uh-huh. Oh, hi.
When did you last have them? Last night.
Yeah. Uh-huh. That'll be fun.
Okay, hold on.
Uh, Dad, can I go to a party tonight?
It's a school night.
Something's burning.
Just for dinner. It's Claire's birthday.
Who's Claire?
A girl from the school.
Sorry. Do you want some cereal
or something? Uh, no.
I'll get something later. Dad.
Uh, let me talk to her mother.
Is your mom there?
Mark, I have an 8:00 thyroidectomy.
Hi, this is Mark Greene.
Yeah, Rachel's dad. Yeah.
I just was wanting to see that you were going to be there.
How did you meet Claire?
She's my partner in art class.
Mm-hmm. What are you working on? Yeah, okay, All right.
Sculpture. Call me after dinner and I'll come pick you up.
Cool.
Mmm.
( doorbell rings )
Katherine's early.
Good. I don't need to get dressed in the car.
Hi. Is Rachel ready?
Who are you?
Dad, this is Andrew.
He's giving me a ride to school.
It's nice to meet you. Here are your notes.
Dining room table.
When did this happen?
Oh, sorry, I forgot.
Andrew has a car while his dad's out of town.
You have a license?
Yeah, well, I got it in June.
I have no accidents, you know.
Yeah, we can take you to school.
No, it's good.
Now you guys won't be late for work.
Well, I guess she's making friends.
I don't like taking my clothes off.
LEWIS: You'll have to if you want to be examined.
Can't you just listen to my stomach?
I think something's, like, blown loose.
It keeps making these weird noises.
Maybe you're hungry.
Yeah, and maybe I'm bleeding into my belly.
Could it be a complication from my surgery?
I don't know.
My X-ray vision isn't working.
Are you mocking me?
No.
'Cause it sounds like you're mocking me.
No, I'm taking you very seriously
which is why I'm going to examine you
as soon as you get undressed.
You just want to see me naked.
I want to examine you.
Yeah, examine me naked.
Can I get a male doctor in here?
A straight one?
First day of school
and you're already making new friends?
Oh, yeah, I'm a shoo-in for homecoming queen.
So far, so good.
Oh, yeah. A foul abscess
a neurotic granny, naked boy here
and I had to break into Chen's locker.
Did you steal her stuff?
Weaver gave it to me.
Oh, what are you using for maggots these days?
Cetacaine?
Good thought, but Kerry's immune to it.
You're enjoying this, aren't you?
Colonel Dixon's Magical Maggot Mix.
Seriously. You paint it on with milk.
The admit desk, the patient status board.
The paramedic radio is over this.
Dr. Greene and Dr. Lewis--
two of our attendings.
Welcome. Don't kill anyone
and I'll mix you up a fresh batch.
Dr. Lewis is a wealth of medical knowledge
but do not ask her where anything is.
She is just getting reoriented
after a five-year sabbatical herself.
Five years?
Post-traumatic stress.
What happened?
You don't want to know.
Here, fill these out, and then come find me.
Do you have a pen?
Come prepared.
Want the tour?
I think I can find my way around again.
All right. New group of neophytes?
Yeah, I get to baby-sit 'em, too.
Hey, it's the burden of being Chief Resident.
You've heard. Yes, I have.
Yes. Oh, uh, nurse, nurse?
Nurse?
Are you talking to me?
I'm sorry. I don't know your name.
Oh, you haven't met Abby yet. No.
Abby Lockhart, Dr. Susan Lewis. Dr. Susan Lewis, Abby Lockhart.
Hi. Susan used to work here.
That's the rumor.
Abby, could you set me up for suturing
in Exam Three? Set you up?
Open a kit, some 4-0 nylon, #7 gloves, betadine.
It's all in the room.
New chest pain in two.
Altered LOC over here.
Hey, Mooney. I'll take it.
I want you to get started on the chest pain here with Abby.
You know the routine. Yay!
Oxygen, aspirin, nitro, times three.
I can't believe you are back.
Stanley, you're with us.
You look great. I love your hair.
Thanks. My brother could be dying here.
Oh, Howard Norden.
Ready, steady, lift.
No response to Narcan.
We were just talking. That's it.
Talking.
Is he taking any medications?
Uh, not that he's told me about.
Lack of disconjugate gaze and conjugate deviation
rules out a structural lesion.
LEWIS: CBC, chem panel, 12 lead
tox screen and a Head CT.
Did he have a stroke or...
It's too early to say.
The abrupt onset suggests
CNS bleed, seizure, even cardiopulmonary anoxia.
Pulse ox is 99.
Don't let him die.
No tremor, asterixis, of myoclonus
suggestive of a metabolic encephalopathy.
I'm trying to listen.
You want a portable chest?
Ask Professor Carter.
MOONEY: How would you describe your pain?
It hurts.
Is it stabbing, burning, tearing?
What's the freaking difference?
Okay. I'm going to give you some medicine under your tongue.
And open.
Let me know if it's better.
Was that three sprays?
Yeah, nitro times three.
At once?
I don't feel so good.
What's happening?
We're just going
to put your head down
for a minute there, Mr. Stegman.
I feel so dizzy. What?
Everything's blurry.
Okay, you're going to feel a little bit more oxygen
flowing through your nose.
How's the pain in your chest?
Worse. Oh!
80/60.
Is it bad?
No, just a little bit low.
Was that the wrong medicine?
No. Everything's okay.
This just happens sometimes.
Dr. Mooney is one of our best.
I'll got write my note.
Yeah, do that.
Neuroleptic malignant syndrome.
It's in the differential.
Where did you come up with that?
Photographic memory.
Mm-hmm.
Oh, and I delivered a lecture on coma last week.
Ridiculous. What?
Time. Yesterday, it seems you couldn't start an IV.
Oh, it was longer than yesterday.
LOCKHART: Carter! Yeah.
That kid Mooney saw my patient.
Oh, how did he do? What did you tell him about nitro?
The basics. Three sprays. Three sprays-- that's right.
Bam, bam, bam.
All at once? No, no. You're supposed
to give them every five minutes.
I think you left that part out.
How's his pressure?
Zero over zero. He's dead.
I'm kidding.
Ha, ha.
I pulled him through.
Keep a short leash on your students, huh?
All clear.
I'm going to go check on this guy.
You got this?
Yeah, I think so.
Did you see him get hit?
No, um, I went to return the shopping cart
and he was just laying by the car.
What have you got?
Weak pulse, shallow resps.
What's your dad's name?
It's Alan.
Alan, can you open your eyes?
GCS is 245.
Is he waking up?
Uh, not just yet.
Mark, look at this.
We need a backboard.
Blood count's normal.
( metallic drilling )
Chemistry is okay.
Nothing on the tox screen.
All his labs look good.
Why is he still in a coma?
How much longer up there?
Has he ever seen a psychiatrist?
I don't think so.
Sorry.
GREENE: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Coming through. Need a portable chest and pelvis.
Your brother has signs of psychogenic coma.
What's that?
When we try to open his eyelids, they flutter.
He responds to a Q-tip in the nose.
I don't think it's a real coma.
What do you mean, he's faking?
( drilling stops )
What about the...
shaking and the frothing at the mouth and everything?
I'd like to get a psychiatric consultation.
Yeah, yeah, that'd be great.
He has been under a lot of pressure lately.
Hey, what's taking so long?
You're still dressed.
We'll move him to a quieter room.
Great. Don't I get a gown at least?
I could catch cold.
It's bad enough I'm bleeding out.
Go back to your bed
and the nurse will bring you one.
How long till the psychiatrist gets here?
I'll let you know.
Can I just talk to my surgeon?
A British chick with red hair.
Will you shut up?
Systolic's up to 100.
All right, let's roll him.
Set up the Sonosite for six.
Large abrasions to the back.
Did a car crush him against something?
Uh, I-I didn't see.
Tracy?
Daddy.
GREENE: Sir, you're in a hospital.
Do you know what the date is?
Daddy, I'm so sorry, Daddy.
She didn't see me.
Alan.
What's he saying?
I don't know.
Sorry for what?
Were you in the car?
I'm sorry.
Looks like a liver lac.
I'll got get her.
All right, let's intubate, etomidate, and sux.
Where were you stationed?
In Birmingham.
I have an uncle in Birmingham.
Does he work in the steel mills?
The university.
We handled mail for seven million soldiers.
65,000 pieces every eight hours.
My goodness.
Nothing beats a letter from home.
Mm-hmm.
( groaning ): Ooh!
What do you think?
It's a perforation.
A small hole in the colon.
It's from her diverticular disease.
I'm afraid you'll need an operation to fix it.
But she's so weak.
It's really the only option.
Well, can't we wait a few days?
Then she'll become extremely ill
and surgery could be dangerous.
If I were your mother
would you recommend the operation?
Absolutely.
Then we'll do it.
LEWIS: Dr. Corday?
I have a Mr. Ashman, says you repaired his hernia.
Chubby, drug-seeking hypochondriac.
I don't know about drug-seeking.
Complains of abdominal pain.
What's his exam like?
Didn't do one.
Then why are you talking to me?
Some surgeons like to treat their patients primarily.
Not this one.
Well, he's going to say he's tender.
You'll be seeing him eventually.
Maybe, maybe not.
Oh, I'm pretty certain.
Abby?
Malik. Who gets the vent?
Curtain Three.
I have to start a dopamine drip.
Curtain Two, abdominal pain.
He's still fully clothed.
Okay. He needs a gown, don't you think?
Sure.
( loud whacking )
Stop!
Ow!
Hey!
Somebody! Ah!
You thought you could fool me? Is that it?
Mr. Norden.
( screaming )
Stop it!
Security.
You take a loan from Mr. Bennett
he expects his money back.
You pay it by Monday or next time
it's going to be your head.
You understand?
I need a nurse in here.
Oh, my God.
Are you all right?
He broke my legs.
He's not your brother?
Would you like me to call your mom?
No.
It's just us.
God, we were having such a great day, too.
He just...
He took me out to lunch 'cause I got into law school.
Early acceptance?
He even...
He even laminated a copy of the letter to his toolbox.
Well, what is that?
What are they doing?
They're just taking X-rays.
Oh, is something broken?
He may have a crushed pelvis.
I mean, is that really bad?
Possibly.
He might need surgery.
Oh, God.
He had to have been run over or pinned against something.
It...
It was a wall.
What?
Look, I...
I thought I was in reverse.
It was such a tight space.
He was out front, waiting for me to back out.
I thought...
I thought it was in reverse.
Mr. Stegman's troponin is positive.
I sent Mooney to the library.
Good call.
C.P.K. on Norton.
That's Susan's patient.
Dr. Lewis.
She always been so high-maintenance?
She's not high-maintenance.
She's great. I like her.
Abby, could you get a rectal temp in Room Four?
Anything else?
That should do it.
Hey, I heard about your hit man.
Oh, more like an enforcer.
Well, never a dull moment.
I could use a dull moment.
Okay, pick a chart, any chart.
This is a setup.
No, just go ahead. Pick.
You sure?
No.
( giggles softly )
Female abdominal pain?
What you got?
Suture removal.
This is definitely a setup.
On a scrotum.
Oh, maybe not.
All right, where is he?
Who?
Mr. Ashman, I assume.
You paged for a consult.
Curtain Two.
Epigastric tenderness on exam.
As predicted.
I have the touch.
Better hurry before he finds his clothes.
Dr. Corday, there's a code in the S.I.C.U.
One of your patients.
You'll have to keep them hidden.
Amal?
WOMAN: Yes.
Hi, I'm Dr. Lewis.
How long have you had your stomach trouble?
Since yesterday.
How long is this going to take?
Well, I don't know.
It depends on what's wrong.
Well, I need to be home in two hours.
No matter what.
MAN: Pressure's good: 110/60.
BENTON: T.K.O. the saline.
Send up the last two O-neg.
Is he going to be okay?
He's responding to blood transfusions
but he needs surgery to repair his liver.
Hold the elevator.
Well, can I go up with him?
Malik, can you take her to the surgical waiting room?
Why don't you just wait right here
and I'll come back and get you.
MAN: Dr. Greene.
You want one shot I.V.P?
We'll do it upstairs.
That's two-plus for heme.
Got it. Dr. Greene.
Did you get a B.A.L. on the daughter?
What?
I smelled alcohol on her breath.
D.U.I. with bodily injuries is a felony.
She wasn't driving.
Now she says she was.
Did you get the C.T.? Radiology's waiting.
Peter took him straight to the O.R.
She's changing her story.
It's an admission of guilt.
Kerry, did you smell alcohol on the daughter?
Uh, I don't know. Maybe.
Okay, is she in custody?
Are you arresting her?
You could still draw a level.
Give her a break.
Her father's in critical condition.
Because she hit him with the car
while under the influence.
Doesn't seem drunk to me.
Forget it. I was asking a favor.
But I'll call a phlebotomist from...
Wait, hold on. You'll get your draw.
Just wait until her dad's out of surgery.
How long is that going to be?
Couple hours.
My sergeant wants me back on the streets.
I can't stay here and baby-sit.
Well, come back. She's not going to go anywhere.
Take your time, and think it over.
No, you don't understand.
I have to have an abortion.
You have other options, you know.
No, not for me.
My parents are so strict.
They'll kill me.
Everybody thinks that.
No, it's different for us.
I have to be a virgin on my wedding day.
I think if you give them the chance...
No. If they find out that I've had sex...
I'm no longer their daughter.
They'll send me away...
out of the country
and I don't want to live there.
I can't.
Hmm...
What?
Do you know what an ectopic pregnancy is?
A miscarriage?
Not exactly.
It's where the fetus grows in the Fallopian tube.
So, then I have to have an abortion.
It's more complicated than that.
You'll need surgery.
An operation?
Right now.
Well, how long does it take?
You leave the hospital by tomorrow.
No, I have to be home for dinner in an hour.
If you don't have surgery immediately, it could rupture
and you'll bleed to death.
Then I'll come back Saturday.
You may not make it to Saturday.
I don't care.
I need a doctor in Trauma One right now.
You know what, we'll figure something out.
Pregnancy is confidential.
We don't have to tell your parents.
Dr. Lewis, status epilepticus.
Okay. You stay right there.
I'll be right back, okay, Amal?
Amal, okay?
TAKATA: Paramedics gave four of Ativan
but she's still seizing.
How's the airway?
Pulse ox is borderline. You may have to tube her.
Give another two of Ativan.
Oh, you got this one?
Who are you?
Susan Lewis. It's, uh, my first day.
Oh. Resident?
Attending.
Tachy at 130.
Right.
We'll do it together. Okay.
How long has she been seizing?
MAN: We got the call 20 minutes ago.
Any history?
Husband only speaks Spanish.
Okay, let's prep a gram of Dilantin.
I'll intubate. We should intubate.
Go ahead.
Push 70 of Zemuron. TAKATA: What?
Rocuronium.
I have to go to the pharmacy.
It's the best nondepolarizing agent.
Maybe, but we don't stock it.
100 of sux.
I'll get the airway.
( clears throat )
Push the Dilantin.
360. Clear.
Still in fib.
How long since Cordarone?
20 minutes.
360 again. Give an amp of epi.
I just did.
Trying to raise the dead, Lizzie?
Clear.
Septic hemocolectomy
maxed out on Dopamine and Levophed.
Asystole.
Go directly to the morgue. Do not pass "Go."
Do not collect $200.
Okay, that's it.
I'll call the family.
Not that I'm keeping score
but isn't this your third postop death
this week?
Congratulations.
We call that a hat trick.
Thousand of Dilantin on board.
Get ready with phenobarb.
The husband.
Sir, does your wife have epilepsy?
?Epilepsia¿ Creo quo no.
Can we get a translator?
No, it's okay.
?Esta tomando medicinas¿
Solamente una.
Es una droga para prevenir
tuberculosis.
?Come se llama medicina¿
Tengo la botella.
She's on an anti-TB med.
Isoniazid.
?Toma algunas mas¿
No. Como dice alli, once cada dia.
?Once pastillas¿
Si.
No, solamente una al dia.
What?
It's an overdose because the label
is in English.
It says, "Take once a day."
"O-n-c-e."
In Spanish that means 11-- once.
She took 11 pills a day?
We need Pyridoxine.
At least six grams.
It's the only way we're going to stop this.
?Doctora
puedes ayadarla¿
Si, vamos a ayudar.
Pavulon while we wait.
What did you say?
I said we'd help her.
I am diabetic. I need water.
Well, then, we'll start an I.V. for you.
Oh, nyet.
I drink, I throw up, I feel better.
No, no, nothing to drink.
You have gall stones the size of golf balls.
( speaking Russian )
I have golf stones?
You have gallstones.
Abby, can you start a line here?
What? The crash cart. He's crashing.
What happened?
It looks like V-tach.
CARTER: Does he have a pulse?
I don't think so.
Charge to 200.
Stanley, have you ever shocked a patient before?
Uh, no.
Okay, this one's all yours.
No, that's okay.
I am right here.
Charged and ready.
I want you to apply firm pressure
and before you press the buttons
back off... say "clear."
Okay.
Clear! ( Carter groans )
Did you get shocked?
You were supposed to say "clear" before, not after.
Normal sinus rhythm! I've got a pulse!
Well, so does he, thank God.
Were you touching the bedframe?
E.K.G. lead?
No, his arm, right here...
Ouch! Hold on.
I'll get you an ice pack.
Feels like someone kicked me in the chest.
Well.. consider yourself lucky, Mr. Stegman.
How long has she been seizing?
Almost an hour.
Four grams of Pyridoxine on board.
She needs one gram per gram ingested.
Give another four.
We don't have another four.
Go to the pharmacy.
I can't.
Send another nurse.
This is all we had in the whole hospital.
Okay, send couriers to Mercy, Northwestern, Parkside...
Parkside closed last year.
Every nearby hospital.
We need all the Pyridoxine
we can get.
V-fib. Starting compressions.
Charge to 200.
( sighs )
Damn it.
The daughter was driving?
Yeah. Crushed him up against a brick wall.
You wonder why I don't have kids.
Lizzie, what you got?
Perfed diverticulum.
Yeah, well, be sure you clean under your fingernails.
Don't want another postop infection.
Dr. Benton, there's a Roger McGrath on the phone.
Dr. Benton's in surgery.
Take a message.
He says it's important.
All right, hold the phone.
He's crashing!
Get me four more units of packed cells!
Let's go, Peter. Good news can wait.
Bad news will never go away.
I'll call him back.
LEWIS: Hold compressions.
Asystole.
Start pacing at 140.
Courier's got Pyridozine from Mercy.
Will be here in ten minutes.
Turn up the gain.
No capture.
Resume compressions.
How long has she been down?
No cardiac activity for 35 minutes.
You want to keep going?
pH is 6.8.
( sighs )
We'll never get her back.
I'm calling it.
Stop C.P.R.
Put the husband in a quiet room.
I'll be right there.
Good pickup.
Once.
I would have missed the diagnosis.
Lot of good it did.
Feeling any better?
Yeah, the boys bounce back quick.
Ow! Oh, I think I might've tweaked it again.
You want to have another doctor take a look at your back?
How about your front?
( woman retching violently )
She's tossing her cookies.
No, cookies. Chicken, potato, and ice cream.
Oh, Dr. Carter. I'm really sorry.
It's not your fault.
Should we order an X-ray?
No. It's just a spasm.
It could be somatic dysfunction at the myofascial junction.
What?
I studied alternative medicine in Hong Kong.
I could try a muscle energy technique.
You know, I think you've done enough for one day.
Okay, help me mobilize the liver.
Bovie and pickups.
Peter! Where's Reese?
What?
Reese isn't in the playroom.
You were supposed to pick him up at school.
I tried; he wasn't there.
Free up the falciform. Where is he?
I thought you had him here in daycare.
No.
Who let this guy in?
Carla's mother pick him up?
No.
Systolic's down to 60.
Four-sucker bleed. Lap pads, let's pack off the liver.
All right. Her name is, uh, on the card at school.
Okay. I'll try her.
Yeah, good idea. You call Grandma, you call Grandpa
and I'll roll this guy over
so we can all kiss his ass good-bye!
Sign here.
Corday finally see him?
No. I drank that Russian water.
Yetna's water?
Yeah, I'm better now.
No thanks to you.
Here, take this; you're going to need it later.
Have you seen the girl in Exam One?
She took off. What?!
She said she'd be back at 9:00.
Why didn't anyone get me?
Because you were busy with the arrest.
She has an ectopic.
Well, you didn't tell me that.
Where's her chart? It's here, somewhere.
Could you find it, please? Okay.
Could you pull up Razavi on the computer
Sure. and print out her "redge" sheet?
Excuse me. We're here to see Dr. Carter.
She fainted.
I did not faint. I was dizzy.
You'll need to see a triage nurse.
Is that you?
Through those doors and to the right.
I think we should go through those doors
and right back to the car.
Please, John Carter... Dr. Carter's very busy.
John!
Excuse me. If you want to see a doctor
you need to sign in at Triage.
Gamma, what are you doing here? Ask him.
She fainted outside Marshal Fields.
I did not. Did you hit your head?
No. I didn't faint.
This is your grandmother?
Uh, Gamma, this is Susan Lewis.
Pleasure.
I'm terribly sorry, ma'am.
Well, I guess you're only rude to strangers.
Mrs. Wilson!
Mrs. Wilson, your surgery went very well.
( mumbling ): Yeah.
You're finished?
Yes. You're on your way to Recovery.
Good.
I need your address.
I got to send you at thank-you note.
Dr. Corday? Dr. Corday?
Yes.
Carmen Torino from Infection Control.
Do you have a minute?
What do you need?
To speak to you in private.
Okay. Keep her fluids at 125 an hour.
Vitals Q-15, CBC in 30.
You lost another patient today, from sepsis.
Uh, yes, but, uh, he was debilitated before surgery.
I understand.
However, his death triggered
a formal investigation by my department.
Excuse me?
You need to be cultured.
Cultured?
In case your body's carrying bacteria
that's infecting your patients.
Can you stop by the clinic in an hour?
I'm afraid that's impossible.
I have a patient waiting for me downstairs.
Your surgical privileges could be suspended
if you don't cooperate.
If you have concerns, talk to my chairman.
I already have.
Drs. Romano and Anspaugh have given us
their full support.
GREENE: Did she sign out AMA?
No.
Call her back.
She thinks she'll be deported if her parents find out.
Tell her parents that she needs surgery for an ovarian cyst.
And falsify a consent form?
I'd rather keep them in the dark.
She's pregnant. They don't have to know anything.
Hmm. You trust her to come back?
I think so. I hope so.
Dr. Greene, Dr. Corday on Two.
You home yet?
Susan, hi.
Uh, I heard you lost one, the INH overdose.
Yeah.
Yeah, those can be tough.
How long is it going to take?
Um, anyway, I've been meaning to talk to you
Uh-huh. about the nursing shortage.
That blood alcohol came back just over the limit.
What?
The girl, who hit her father-- .092.
Is he still in surgery?
Want me to tell a cop?
No. I will.
Anyway, if you could pitch in a little
it'll make everyone happy.
The nurses are complaining?
Yeah, I explained that you're used to better staffing
so, you know, they'll cut you some slack
until you're up to speed.
Okay, okay. No problem.
Can you cover my last hour?
Aw, my first day back
you're already dumping on me.
Elizabeth's stuck. I have to get home to the baby.
L.P. results are pending on Etzler
and Nguyen's getting a V.Q.
Anything else?
Yeah, you could pick me up some milk and Huggies
on the way home.
B.P.'s 120/80.
ROMANO: Excellent. Take down the packing.
Peter!
Carla's mom has been home all day.
Try Jackie.
I tried. I got Joanie.
Did she pick him up?
No.
Retrohepatic caval injury. More suction.
Call the police, now. I got to go.
Lost another two liters.
Sternal saw. Peter, do a pringle before the guy bleeds out.
Shirley, go get Edson.
Prep a number eight atrial shunt.
I need to be relieved.
Peter, you take your hands off his liver
and he's going to die!
Your EKG looks good.
I told you, I'm fine.
Alger means well
but sometimes, he's annoyingly condescending.
You gave him a scare.
I was a little woozy getting out of the car.
We call that near syncope.
I call it skipping lunch.
You need to eat.
I'll do it.
You been sleeping okay?
( sighs )
Are you, uh, depressed?
I miss him, John.
Me, too.
Have you thought about therapy?
I said, I miss him.
I'm not mentally unstable.
Sometimes, it's good to talk about it.
What's to talk about? He's gone.
And I have things to do.
If I leave now, I can still make the Donor's Reception.
Whoa. We need to monitor your heart overnight.
In here? I don't think so.
Well, let's just wait
I've been waiting.
I've already missed two appointments.
If everything checks out
you'll be back on your feet tomorrow.
There are no more tomorrows, John.
This is it.
Your grandfather and I used to think
we had a lifetime of tomorrows.
Hello, is Amal there?
Oh, I'm sorry.
Uh, this is Susan, her friend from school.
I just had a question about our math homework.
Oh, okay, great.
Yeah, I'll call back after dinner. Okay, thanks.
Dr. Lewis, Mr. Gadasco's still waiting?
Who?
His wife died-- the overdose.
Oh, my... Oh, damn it! I completely forgot.
Señor Gadasco...
¿Como sigue, doctora?
Le dimos el antidoto, pero siguido convulsionando.
Parace grave.
Convulsiono tanto que le dio un ataque del corazon.
Dios mio.
Le dimos choque electrico y todo el medicamento
para salvarla, pero no respondio.
Trabajamos con ella por dos horas
pero se murio.
No.
No!
No! No! No!
Lo siento mucho.
¿Como es posible que eso paso?
Emilio...
¿Que voy a hacer, señora?
¿Que voy a hacer?
Once. La bottella decia once.
Yo se. Calmate, por favor.
Calmate.
Seguimos las direcciones.
Pensabamos que estamos haciendo todo bien.
Yo se... que debe ser dificil...
¿Que les digo a mis hijos?
¿Porque tuvo que pasar?
Lo siento.
¿Porque tuvo que pasar?
Lo siento mucho.
( gasping )
Sorry.
It has to be a nasopharyngeal sample.
Oh!
Ooh, sorry.
Felt more like a brain biopsy.
The enterobacter from you patients is a very resistant strain.
I'm aware of that.
You may be colonized.
Open wide.
Quick swab of the tonsils.
( choking )
God...
So, are we finished?
Just need to do a pelvic.
You've got be kidding.
A surgical tech in Ohio was passing nocardia
from her vaginal flora.
Thank you for sharing that.
I'm nursing.
You want a sample of my milk as well?
Absolutely.
Then a cath'd urine and a stool sample.
If you can't go now, you can take it home
and bring it back in the morning.
ROMANO: Inflate the balloon and tighten the rumel.
WOMAN: How is he? Is he going to be okay?
They're still working on him.
Why did you leave him?
There's another surgeon with him.
How much longer? Look, I have another emergency
so just wait in the room, okay.
They want us to come to the station and make out a report.
This is Dr. Benton at County General.
Listen, I need you to send a detective down here.
I don't care! My son is missing!
So get off your ass, do your job and send someone down now!
What's the ETA? Two minutes.
Flip you for the airway. He's already intubated.
What are we getting?
Mercy's sending us a GSW, and we're out of beds.
You coming? Yeah, I need gloves.
Move Trauma One to Exam One... Whose chart is this?
Oh, that's mine.
Code the charts at the time of discharge
so they can go to billing.
I'll do it right now.
Yeah, and be sure the nurse's notes...
Did this patient leave the hospital?
I'm not sure.
You're not sure? She an ectopic.
It's under control.
What do you mean? She's not here.
It's complicated.
I'm trying to protect her privacy.
You should be trying to protect her life.
She'll be back in two hours.
If she's still alive!
Lost his pulse on the scene.
I gave her my word I wouldn't tell her parents.
You're putting her life at risk
so she doesn't get into trouble.
You have to trust me on this one.
Prep for a thoracotomy.
Okay, give me the gown.
Call your patient right now.
You're being completely irresponsible.
If she's sick, they can bring her in.
Not if she's dead.
You got too many names on the list.
Everyone helps out.
How's the school supposed to keep track of ten people?
Any stranger could say he was his uncle.
We've never had a problem before.
You sure you got there on time?
Yes.
Hey, what are you doing here?
Where were you?
Hey.
( sighs ) What's going on?
You picked him up from school?
Yeah.
He was acting out. He bit a little girl.
You were in surgery, so they called me.
Yeah, well, you had us worried.
I left a message on your voice mail.
It wasn't Peter's night to pick him up, it was mine.
You're still picking him up?
We have dinner every Tuesday and Thursday.
He's had three fights at recess this week.
Hey, you fighting?
The teacher wants to know
if there are any problems at home.
She thinks he may need a little more stability.
What are you trying to say?
Just telling you what she said.
He wasn't getting in fights when he was living with us.
Know what? Maybe he should just live in one home for a while.
Peter, he's my stepson. We've got an agreement.
Yeah, but we need to think about what's best for Reese.
Well, if he's acting out
maybe it's because he lost his mother.
Hey, hey, hey, look. We'll talk about this later.
I just need to go call the police and get him home.
All right?
Dr. Weaver?
Yeah?
O.R. called. They don't think
Mr. Pomeroy's going to make it.
Okay, I'll go up. Can you do the coroner's forms?
Yeah. Hey, Chuni, can you tell my grandmother
I'll be about five more minutes?
And see if Dr. Lewis called that ectopic girl.
( sighs )
Gamma!
What are you doing?
It's late, John. I've been a good sport.
No, no, no, you cannot leave.
Fainting can be a warning sign
for a heart attack, for stroke...
I'll take my chances.
Well, if you leave now, you're going to be
signing out against medical advice.
I've already done that.
Come on, there's still
some more tests we can do.
I'll see you at home, John.
Don't forget to turn out
the porch light when you come in.
Check on her in about an hour.
Good night.
Sorry if I offended her.
Oh, don't worry about it.
She never takes me seriously.
What do you expect? She changed your diapers.
That's true.
Any focal neuro findings?
EKG changes?
No, I monitored her for three hours.
Yeah, she should be okay.
Weaver's looking for you.
Did you call your ectopic girl?
I'm going to give her till 9:00.
It's a bit of a risk.
Danger is my middle name.
Any other catastrophes?
It's been like an acid flashback
without the good parts.
I don't know what I was thinking
when I said I'd come back.
You weren't, but at least you're working with friends.
Yes.
Excuse me, uh, Pickman's got a woman in active labor.
Show time.
( woman groans )
Denise Frankel. Full-term.
She's crowning.
"Show time" is right.
( screams )
Oh, I need to push.
Go ahead, push.
( moans )
Membrane's ruptured, fluid looks clear.
How many other kids have you had? Two.
ABBY: This one's coming fast.
( sighs )
Take your foot off the pedal.
I'm not on it. The bed's rising.
Your foot must...
I'm nowhere near it.
Must be... a short?
What's happening? Just a little technical difficulty.
Oh, man.
Water broke, it must have flooded the switch.
Late decel. Okay, we have to get this baby out.
I can't deliver the baby like this.
Well, get Luka. He's tall.
Carter, take over.
What-- where are you going?
What are you doing?
Excuse me? Get down. Get down.
Okay, just blow, just blow through the pain.
Drop your arm over the side. I need to start an IV.
Give me a hand.
Oh, you're kidding me?
What are you doing?
Just setting up some equipment.
Fetal heart rate's 140.
Don't drop my baby.
Don't worry, Dr. Carter
used to be in the circus.
Yeah, as a clown, right?
Human cannonball... until I got fired.
Okay, give a big push. Push.
Push.
Head's out. Relax.
Cord's tight around the neck.
Can you reduce it?
Uh, I don't think so. How about a clamp?
Toss it.
Second clamp.
Scissors.
Is it a boy or a girl?
One more push, and we're about to find out.
( groans )
( yells )
It's a boy.
Is he okay?
Oh, he's beautiful.
Can I see him?
Yeah, as soon as we strap on a parachute.
Ooh, yeah.
Hi, Mom.
( sighs )
( laughs )
( sobbing ): I killed him.
I killed him. I killed him.
I'm so sorry.
I killed him. I'm so sorry.
No. No...
I need to see him.
I need to see him.
Miss Pomeroy? What?
We're going to have to leave now.
What? What do you mean? What are you talk--
I'm required to place you under arrest.
It was an accident. He was my father.
Is this really necessary?
We only had a couple of glasses of wine.
We only had a couple of glasses of wine.
Let her say good-bye.
Where is he? Where did you put him?
Let her say good-bye. Where is he?
This way.
Oh, God, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I got Ella's diaper culture.
Oh, you didn't need to do that, Mark.
Hey, not with the food.
I triple-bagged them.
Did I hear a phone ring?
No.
She still hasn't called?
Not yet.
The party was over at 8:00.
I know.
So, call her.
I don't have her phone number.
Look it up.
I didn't get Claire's last name.
Mark, if your daughter's at a party
you need to know these things.
Yeah, well, I talked to the parents.
I thought everything was okay.
We don't even know where she is.
RACHEL: I told you about the party.
Do you know what time it is?
It's only 10:15.
You were supposed to call me two hours ago.
I'm sorry.
How'd you get home?
Andrew.
I think I'll check on the little one.
All they had were hot dogs and burgers
so some of us went out to eat.
Uh-huh, "some of us," or you and Andrew?
Dad?
I need to know these things.
That sounds like something Mom would say.
I wasn't drinking. I'm not doing drugs.
I'm just making some new friends, okay?
All you had to do was call.
I tried.
The pay phone was broken.
If you don't believe me, call the restaurant.
Don't ever let this happen again.
Okay?
Okay.
You know, if I had a cell phone
we could keep in touch.
Yeah, right.
Seriously, just for emergencies.
We'll see.
Thanks.
You guys do good work.
So do you.
I'll call you when it's time to build his tree house.
( laughs )
Amal?
Dr. Lewis.
I'm so sorry I'm late.
It was really hard to sneak out.
I am so glad you came back.
I told the nurse I'd be here at 9:00.
Well, people say a lot of things.
You said it was important.
Mm-hmm. Abby, can you find us a room?
Yeah.
Good to see you.
Uh... where's her chart?
Weaver's got it.
Amal's chart?
Yeah. Why?
I don't know. Where is she?
I don't know.
She's on a call in the lounge.
Oh, damn it.
Get off the phone.
Yeah, I work at the E.R. in County...
She's here, you don't have to call.
Susan...
I told you, she'd be back.
Who?
Amal, the ectopic.
I didn't call her.
Oh.
Hello. Hi.
I'm sorry we got disconnected.
No, actually, I got your number from an investigator
who specializes in finding birth parents.
Did you give up a daughter for adoption?
I understand.
No, I-I...
I am sorry.
I thought this was from a reliable source.
I won't-- I will not bother you again.
Good night.
