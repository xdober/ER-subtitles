Previously on ER:
Do you want to do something?
Like go out?
Yeah.
CARTER: If Mom wants to walk
around in a bubble for the rest of her life
then fine, but don't
let her keep holding you inside of it.
ABBY: I know what won't make him happy.
A made-up life.
He's going to figure it out.
He's not stupid.
I'm not pregnant.
The DNA analysis shows that I'm
not Reese's biological father.
Reese lived under my care and my roof for most of his life.
All I'm asking for is some kind of arrangement that recognizes that.
Do you want to keep your son? What do you think?
You need to start setting priorities
and making some hard choices.
CARTER: The Phoenix Suns.
LEWIS: Is that a crime?
You root for the Phoenix Suns?
I didn't pay much attention
to basketball until I moved there.
Susan, you grew up in Chicago.
I dated a guy with season tickets.
And you didn't pay attention to the Bulls?
( chuckling ): Whatever.
I'm starving.
Big Diamondbacks fan, too, aren't you?
I didn't even get breakfast out of this deal.
Oh, sorry. My manners.
Roach coach?
You live in a mansion
and you're buying me a donut?
I'll spring for the coffee, too.
( laughing )
Hey, there, big spender.
( phone ringing )
Hello?
Hey, how was your flight?
Yeah. No, she was walking around
a little bit yesterday.
I've been meeting her for lunch.
You want to hook up there?
Oh, you're getting me a yogurt, too.
What's that? Grab me a bagel.
Really?
No, that's great that...
Yeah, okay, well, I'll see you there.
They're staying for the holidays.
Your parents?
First time in nine years.
Just like sex, isn't it, Peter?
What?
Vascular surgery.
Messy, fun and when done right
you leave satisfied.
D-5 half normal at 125cc's per hour.
Real good hands in there, Peter.
Thank you.
Which is why you get to assist me
in the Millburn surgery.
Fifth District Alderman
wants his cardiac bypass done here.
Why?
I believe the correct response is
"Thank you, Dr. Romano. I'd be honored."
No, I am, but I... Clear Dr. Benton's calendar
for Monday afternoon.
No, hold on. I need to talk to you about my schedule.
He's on trauma call in the ER. Well, dump that on Corday.
Unlike the rest of us, she actually likes it down there.
Listen, I have a situation with my son.
What else is new? Well, I need more flexible hours.
In by 12:00, out by 4:00
and we all make the evening news.
No, whoa, I'm not just talking about this surgery.
Well, look, if you're not interested
by all means, Peter, pass.
I've got 20 other guys who'd kill for this gig.
I didn't say I wasn't interested.
So, are you in or out?
I'm in.
Did I ever tell you you're my hero?
( clanging bell ): Ho, ho, ho!
Merry Christmas!
Ho, ho, ho!
Feed the poor! Feed the poor!
Ho, ho, ho!
Hey, feed the poor?
Sorry, I don't have any.
Come on!
You think it's easy being a female Santa in a man's world?
Sorry, ma'am, no soliciting.
You're going to have to leave the premises.
I work for the Salvation Army.
Oh, do you? Let me see your ID.
Okay, I eat at the Salvation Army.
Get out of here.
Hey! I'm going to call the cops.
( bell clangs ) Stop ringing that damn bell!
Luka, you're late.
Sorry.
Don't be sorry. Be punctual.
This is a hospital, not a department store!
When's she going on Christmas vacation?
Scrooge? Never.
Merry Christmas, County General, ER.
I think she thinks you were shopping.
Shopping for what?
It's a joke.
What's going on?
I went to the bar.
No one's heard anything.
About Nicole?
Yeah. They said she took money there, too.
Guess you were right.
She lied about everything.
Okay, Abby, can you run Cynthia Cohen's sputum?
( children yelling ) LOPEZ: Hey, cut it out.
Hey, I got a couple of kids with some snow-related injuries.
Quiet! Shut up!
Freak, freak, freak, freak...
Hey! Freak, freak, freak, freak!
Shut up! Stop, all right? Both of you!
Shut up! Hey!
And be glad you're not sleeping in a grate
or eating out of the trash!
Nyah-nyah-nyah!
Haleh, get these two out of here.
Stop! Freak, freak, freak, freak...
You this side. You, over here.
He hit me!
Since when did Fire and Rescue start transporting
pediatric walk-in cases? I'm telling Mom!
I don't care! Since these two took headers out by the firehouse.
Shut up! You notify the parents?
( sighing ): Yeah, I left word.
Hey, you didn't call.
I'm sorry?
You didn't call about getting together.
What happened? You change your mind?
Uh, no, I was just...
JARVIK: Dr. Weaver? Exam One's
having chest pain.
I'll be right there.
Dynamic changes on the EKG.
I'll let you get back to work, okay?
Three nitro sprays and titrate six of morphine.
Mm-hmm.
LEWIS: Cops found him wandering
around O'Hare with a suitcase, but no ticket and no ID.
He fell on the escalator
trying to get away from them.
I'm missing my flight.
Laceration's down to the galea.
I go home for Christmas every year, I think.
Looks intact. No sign of fracture.
Which doesn't explain the amnesia.
He doesn't know who he is or where he's going.
I know there's lots of kids around
and the women make a wonderful supper.
Blood supply looks good.
The plastics should be able to tack it back down.
We still need to get a head CT.
The boys and the men
they settle around the TV, watching sports.
You think his memory loss is temporary?
Peter?
He's four years old.
And deaf and traumatized
by the death of his mother.
I emphasized all of that. Thank you.
Well, then, appeal it.
I can't.
What am I paying you for?
He denied the motion, Peter.
It's not irreparable.
The hell, it isn't. He's asking my son
to decide which one of us loves him more?
It won't be that specific.
What is he going to do? Ask who makes the best
macaroni and cheese? For whatever reason
Judge Alter has the feeling that by interviewing Reese
it will provide him with some relevant insight.
Reese knows what's going on. He can sense it.
How much more damage do you want to inflict on him?
Hey, I agreed to represent you.
You're the one who's choosing to fight.
If you want to pre-empt this, Roger's attorney
approached me yesterday. No.
They want to make a revised visitation request.
I said no.
And I need to be honest.
We don't have the edge here.
On paper, Roger is coming across as the better father.
And if I were his attorney
I would advise him to give you no more deals.
Yet you're advising me to accept one?
I am advising you to at least listen to one.
You're still here.
I was on my way out.
You keep those kids from killing each other?
Yeah, one has a corneal abrasion.
The other has a strained wrist.
Look, hey!
You know, I'm not, uh, very good at this.
* And though it's been said
What? Follow-up?
* Many times, many ways
You want to have lunch tomorrow?
* Merry Christmas to you
No sushi.
What? I don't like sushi.
* Chestnuts roasting on an open fire *
Okay, anything you want.
I'm going to remember you said that.
* Jack Frost nipping at your nose *
Why is he here? Somebody finally kick his butt?
Who? Mr. Karaoke, over there.
Hey, Stan...
* Yuletide carols, being...
How about a little "Jingle Bell Rock," huh?
You know him?
Oh, yeah, Stan?
He lives behind a dumpster on 57th and Dorchester.
He's homeless?
Unless you count the dumpster.
LEWIS: Hello!
Hello!
Where are you going?
Whatever that lady told you out there is not true.
Your name isn't Stan?
No, no, no.
You don't live at 57th and Dorchester?
I don't remember where I live.
That's why I'm here.
Mm-hmm.
Besides, this Stan character sounds rough.
Bet he's got a record.
I wouldn't be surprised.
And no family to speak of.
No place to spend the holidays.
You know, if he were smart
he'd clean himself up
get himself a suit at a Goodwill...
And go to the airport.
You mind if I stay a while?
It's kind of Christmasy here, you know?
The Alderman thinks you're such a brilliant surgeon, then you operate.
Where are they? They asked us to show up early.
I don't know. JACKIE: Hey.
Hi.
What's going on?
We're waiting for Roger and his lawyer.
I thought we were here to see the judge.
Well, we're hoping that won't be necessary.
Peter, what's going on? I don't know.
They want to talk about some kind of deal.
Ms. Prager, Dr. Benton
sorry we're late. We ran into a lot of traffic.
Well, we don't have
a lot of time. What have you got?
Visitation, every other weekend, plus two weeks
during the summer.
PRAGER: One week during the summer
and we'll think about it. No.
WHARTON: We're only asking 38 days a year.
31 days.
I said no.
Peter, it's only 31 days. No.
You know what? I'm not doing this.
Peter, listen to me.
No, you listen to me, all of you.
I'm not negotiating over my son.
You'd rather take your chances with the judge?
MILLICENT: A martini in first class
works just as well and takes a lot less time.
Well, like you, I enjoy the occasional drive.
Gives you time to clear your head.
Hey, Dad.
John.
Did you know your father's been here since last night?
Yeah, late last night. He went straight to the hotel.
Oh, God, am I dying?
Rigor mortis hasn't set in just yet.
Well, why else would my son
deign to spend Christmas with us?
Mom's coming, too.
Ah, I knew there was a catch.
Eleanor will be here later this week.
You'll stay at the house until then?
Sure, why not.
Wonderful.
Here's Helga to turn me like a pancake.
We'll give you some privacy.
I'd settle for a little dignity.
Believe it or not, she's thrilled.
This means the world to her, you being here.
This year more than most.
Yeah, I suppose.
It means a lot to me, too.
Yeah, it should be fun, huh?
Reese...
I have to make a decision.
And I need you to help me
by answering some questions.
Can you do that?
Okay.
Who's that?
Daddy.
ALTER: Okay.
And who's that?
My other Daddy.
You love both
your Daddys very much, right?
He says he doesn't know.
When you are sick...
who makes you feel better?
Mommy.
Which Daddy gives you the best care
when you get a boo-boo?
He has Band-Aids with cartoons.
Right now I'd say he needs consistency.
Reese, Carla and I-- the three of us were a family.
That's how we planned our lives.
That's how we approached every day, every week.
I've been with Reese through earaches, flus
almost every scrape he's ever gotten.
If you count the hours that I spent with my stepson
it would far exceed the time that Dr. Benton has spent
with a child he believed to be biologically his.
Reese and Carla were my life.
And now Reese is my life.
He comes first...
ahead of my personal needs, ahead of my job.
And I think that's in his best interest.
Oh... John.
Diverse selection.
The burgers are good.
You already know what you want?
I'm still working on what to drink.
( sighs )
Well, this is nice.
We haven't done this for a while.
Since we had lunch together or Christmas?
Both.
So... what kind of business keeps Mom in Costa Rica
in December?
How's the chopped salad?
She broke her hip, Dad.
Mom can't spend five minutes with her
in the hospital?
What, is she going to avoid her for the whole month?
Your mother's not coming.
John, we're getting divorced.
What?
It's amicable. Divorced? After 30 years?
( sighs )
What happened?
This probably isn't the best place...
Is there somebody else?
Neither of us is running off with anyone.
What is it? She's not happy?
She's bored?
She wants to stay in Europe?
I'm the one who's leaving, John.
No, this can't surprise you.
You saw it before I did.
I was suffocating...
I think we're ready. Um, chopped salad, please.
Uh, burger, medium rare, please.
BENTON: I agree with Mr. McGrath that consistency
is the best thing for Reese right now.
See, I... I let Carla take on a lot of the parenting
while I pursued my career.
But I did that because it felt right
to leave Reese in his mother's care.
But all that's changed now.
And my responsibilities have changed, too.
Because of that, I've made arrangements to work fewer hours
so that I can become Reese's full-time caretaker.
JUDGE: At County General?
Yes, sir.
What sort of hour reduction are we talking about?
7:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. weekdays, weekends off.
JUDGE: And you can provide proof of this new schedule?
Yes, sir. Yes, I can.
Have it in my office by day's end.
Unless there is anything else
court's adjourned.
( bangs gavel )
I-I need to talk to him now.
Well, pull him out.
Oh, fine, let him know I'm on my way.
( screeching tires )
Going back to work?!
Get out of my way.
Got another shift?!
Roger, get out of my way.
Where's Reese, huh?
Oh, let me guess. Jackie? No, no, Cleo. A nanny?
What do you want me to do?
You want me to hit your car, huh?
You lied, man.
Now on top of everything else
you're a liar.
And a perjurer at that.
You know what. You need to back off.
Whatever it takes, is that it? Huh?
He's not a trophy, man!
You can't win at any cost just to win
so you can give your sister a son!
You got
to raise him!
Go ahead. Get in my face.
Come on.
Roger, you need to shut your mouth, all right?
Think, Peter.
You can't change who you are.
WEAVER: You know, I'm sure it was on this block.
It's called Nazim
and it's got a kind of blue awning.
Well, I don't see it.
I don't know. We must have missed it.
You know, I don't like Indian food anyway.
Well, why didn't you say something?
I just did!
All right, well, why don't we go
to that Italian place across the street?
They got great risotto.
Oh, wait a minute.
That would be great if it weren't closed.
You're kind of a pain in the ass, you know that?
Well, some say.
I'm starting to regret this whole thing.
That's too bad. I'm starving.
Okay, let's just forget
about looking for a decent place here.
Why don't we go home and order something in?
Ah, I like a take-charge kind of girl.
My apartment?
Lead the way.
BENTON: Dr. Romano?
Did you hear something?
I need to talk to you.
That sounds like the voice of a doctor
who makes promises he can't keep
and then hangs up...
on the guy he breaks the promises with.
I need to talk to you now.
Talk is cheap, Peter.
I need to scale back my hours
and I need it in writing.
"To whom it may concern: No friggin' way."
I'm serious.
Is this about your kid?
Yeah.
All right, what do you need? Every other Saturday?
No nights, no weekends.
( laughing ): That's a good one.
I prefer the one about the rabbi and the goldfish.
I need to spend more time at home.
Never needed to before.
His mother died.
Yeah, well, his stepfather is still alive.
Split custody with the guy. Keep doing what you do best.
I'm not asking you for your advice.
Newsflash: This is an urban trauma center.
Until people start planning their MVAs and GSWs better
you are not going to be punching a time clock.
That's not me being a hard-ass. That's the job.
You are a surgeon, aren't you?
Are you going to do this for me or not?
Not-- you'll work when I need you to work
or you don't work at all.
Well, then consider this my resignation.
All right, all right
all right...
Don't go getting dramatic.
Weekends off.
And what about weekdays?
It's my best offer, Peter. Take it or leave it.
I'll finish out the week.
Are you really going to do this?!
You're going to throw away your career
so you can play Mr. Mom?!
What a waste!
Hi. Hey.
Newborn for the nursery.
Birth in the ER?
Marshall Field's.
Mother was doing some last-minute shopping.
She's on her way up.
The paramedics delivered?
No, a shoe salesman.
Wow.
Room 424, do you have a chart?
Was she an ER patient?
I just have to follow up on something.
How far along was she?
Eight weeks. It was simple. No complications.
She's in recovery for a few more hours.
Thanks.
Hi, I need to see Dr. Finch, please.
Uh, I'm not sure if she's still here.
Let me check.
All right, thanks.
Peter, what are you doing here?
I need to meet the Surgi-Center Director.
You gave him my CV, right?
Yeah, but...
I quit County.
Romano wouldn't give you the hours?
You said there was a position here.
I want it.
Okay, I'll introduce you to him tomorrow.
No, no, I need to show proof of employment now.
Peter, he's probably already gone
for the day.
Check, please.
I just started working here. The man barely knows me...
Cleo, Cleo...
I need to talk to him.
Hi.
I thought you left.
Tonight.
Luka's been looking for you.
Could you wait, please?
( sighing ): Do you want... do you need something?
You told him you weren't pregnant.
I'm not. I don't understand.
You don't need to.
Look, I'm sorry.
I-I was wrong.
No, you were right.
He did everything he could.
I thought his kindness was love, but it's not.
Abby, he deserves not to know.
Thanks.
BARBARA: But Tuesday's impossible.
He's got colorectal procedures then.
A fissurectomy at 7:00, a hemorrhoidectomy at 8:00
another at 9:00
and it looks like
he's squeezed in an inguinal hernia, too.
No, he's got a lunch date.
After that, he sees patients
until 5:00.
Thursday might work, actually.
Judge Alter, Judge Alter!
I got that, uh...
employment letter for you.
I wanted this yesterday.
I know, it, uh, came in after hours.
This is not your hospital.
No.
Schaumburg Surgi-Center?
I actually worked out a better situation there
than if I had stayed at County.
All in the last 12 hours?
Well, it was always a possibility.
It just needed to be ironed out.
You didn't mention it yesterday.
I know.
I said I'd cut back my hours, and I did.
True. I'm now working 8:00 to 5:00, no weekends.
This letter confirms that.
That may be so
but you told a different story yesterday
and I don't like being lied to.
I'm doing what I have to do for my son.
Hey, Elizabeth.
What, are you sneaking coffee?
Tea.
You look nice.
You going on a date or something?
No. Court date.
Right.
What's the latest?
Ah, it's out of my hands now.
I suppose it's best to keep busy while you wait.
Yeah, well, I owe a lot of hours before I go.
Before you go?
Yeah, end of the week, I'm out of here.
What?!
Yeah, I had to quit.
You're not serious?
I need to change my life.
Romano won't cut me any slack.
Yeah, well, I'm sure he'll make some accommodation.
No.
I asked; he won't.
You'd really leave County?
I got to go.
How'd he fall?
Hanging lights on the house.
Parents are signing him in.
What do we got?
12-year-old fell from a ladder.
Parents are here.
Is he okay? We brought him right over.
Has he been unconscious the whole time?
His sister put the hose on him.
He only woke up for a second.
Did he hit anything on the way down?
A bike.
CARTER: We got some
involuntary guarding here.
He's waking up. That's good, yes?
BENTON: Coming through, coming through.
What do we have?
We got a possible liver or splenic lac.
He's stable, but he might need to go to the OR.
Okay, hemacue?
Second's eight from 10.
Does your belly hurt?
All right, he's stable for CT.
Let's control the pain.
Probably watch him overnight.
He's got free fluid by ultrasound.
Well, I don't want to remove the spleen
before I know we have to.
Remove? That's okay.
He can live without one.
I can give him mine
if it matches.
No, that's not necessary.
Our family's in Chicago. Someone will match.
We don't transplant spleens.
Let me show you where the waiting room is.
WOMAN: We can at least give blood...
Whoop, she's going down. Amparo!
Ma'am, you okay?
Have you fainted before?
Never.
How do you serve Christmas dinner for all those people?
Start cooking early.
No problem.
All right, OR's got a few elective cases
they can push if we need to.
How's she doing?
Please, I'm fine.
Tell me about Ben.
Well, his blood counts are stable, which is good
and his first CT only shows a small injury.
His school band plays in a concert on New Year's Eve.
I don't want him to miss it.
How long have you had this node?
I don't know.
Is this tender?
You don't have to examine me or run tests.
I know I'm sick.
Have you been diagnosed with something?
Lymphoma.
I'm sorry.
Don't tell them, though.
Your family doesn't know?
There will be plenty of time to talk after Christmas.
WOMAN: Dr. Benton?
Janice Prager called.
She wants you to meet her in court right away.
Go. I'll get another surgeon.
Okay. Your son will be fine.
Good.
They got me right in the store.
It's tough to hide two pairs of skates.
The guard jumped me in front of my kids.
Can we keep the ice skates?
No.
They hate getting used stuff all the time.
I thought for Christmas, I'd get them...
They want to take you to the station house when we are done.
I know.
Do you have someone to stay with them?
Their mother?
I'll be right back.
Abby?
Are you going to be in jail for Christmas?
I don't know.
Maybe I should post bail for him.
They need money.
Do you know where they've been living?
In a motel room.
Probably can't pay a security deposit.
No, he has a job, but it's $5.15 an hour
so he has to steal
to get his kids a decent Christmas present.
We could call the food bank.
No, the food banks help out this time of year.
What happens to them in three months?
There's only so much you can do.
Yeah, I guess.
I just, uh...
Miss your kids?
( chuckling )
Yeah.
I'm sorry.
It's sort of worse at Christmas.
Where's the judge?
In chambers.
Gentlemen, your counsel with you?
Uh, they're on the way.
While we wait for Ms. Prager and Mr. Wharton
I was wondering
if I could talk with Reese once more.
Only if you both agree, of course.
Sure.
I don't see why not.
Thank you.
Nancy, will you ask him to come with me?
It's okay.
Go on. Go on.
Just Reese this time.
( sighs )
He'll have exploratory surgery
and they'll repair any injuries he might have.
( family talking at once in native language )
He'll be home for the holidays?
We'll just have to wait and see how he does.
So we celebrate a day or two late.
It doesn't matter.
Thank you, Doctor!
( all talking )
Hey, did you get him upstairs?
Yes. Along with his parents, aunts, cousins...
Right. Hope they all fit in the waiting room.
Are you ready for this?
God...
What? I forgot.
I mean, I didn't forget. It's at home.
Yours. Oh.
I don't know where my head is at, though.
Do you want to open it anyway?
Can we wait?
Sure.
Sorry.
Is something wrong?
I'm having family problems.
Your grandma?
No, no, it's...
my mother.
She's not coming home for the holidays after all.
She and my father are, uh...
splitting up.
Oh, no.
I don't think it's sunk in yet.
Well, maybe it's a blessing in disguise.
How do you figure?
Did you ever meet my parents?
I met Cookie.
Right. Well, she and Henry aren't divorced
and they should be.
S...
Still, I'm sorry.
Thanks.
I'm so self-centered.
I thought it was something to do with me.
No. You're about the only thing going right in my life.
You shouldn't have let this happen.
I didn't want to seem defensive.
What'd he think of your new job?
He wasn't overly impressed.
There you are.
ALTER: Thank you for all rushing over.
Be seated.
( clears throat )
We're in a unique situation.
In a traditional custody case
win or lose...
the parents maintain the title given to them by their biology.
They're still Mommy and Daddy.
Here, I'm asked to declare that one of these two men
is not, in fact, Daddy
but they both love Reese
and they have both made sacrifices to be with him.
Though I will say Dr. Benton's effort was late in the game.
And I am uncomfortable about the way he handled it.
I'm not convinced he was exactly forthright with the court.
But the fact is
that I do believe
Reese would thrive in either of your households.
And that makes my decision even harder.
But based on the evidence provided by Dr. Benton
that he will be more available as a parent in the future
and the fact that Reese has always believed him
to be his father...
the court grants custody to Peter Benton.
Mr. McGrath will be given
visitation with Reese every other Saturday.
BAILIFF: The court calls a 20-minute recess.
Thanks again.
Okay. We'll talk soon.
We might have to go out and get one.
No, go ahead and use the angel.
No, I always have a star.
Okay, here we go-- one, two
three!
( Cleo clapping ): Yay!
Yes, it is pretty.
You finish your part?
Hey, baby, come here.
Come over here. Come lay under the tree.
( sighing )
You should get going.
Oh, I got a half an hour.
Don't want to be late for your last shift.
What are they going to do, fire me?
( chuckling )
What are we doing?
This is the best way to look at a tree.
When I was Reese's age, I used to do this for hours.
It's beautiful.
Yeah.
Hey, how long is the commute to Schaumburg?
Depends on when you leave.
Because I was thinking if, you know
we're both working there...
Yeah?
Maybe we should relocate.
We?
Yeah.
I mean, this whole thing has...
I don't know. It's made me focus.
It's like all my life
I've been... chasing something, you know.
That time when I can...
make it into the end zone and spike the ball and...
( chuckling )
It took almost losing my son to realize
the end zone's not out there.
It's right here.
You're good raw material.
I can work with you.
Oh, you can?
Yeah, I have to get you in shape.
( laughs )
Oh, what kind of shape?
Mmm.
Hey, you found it!
Hey, I knew it was in one of those boxes.
You want to put it up there?
All right, come on.
Agh!
Hut! Hut!
Agh.
( clapping ): Yay!
That's good!
I'm working New Year's Eve? I don't think so.
Someone has to. Someone else.
OLBES: Got a six-year-old GSW.
WOMAN: Please, you have to save him.
What happened?
.30-caliber bullet wound
right thorax, crossed the mid-line.
Vitals?
BP: 70/30. Pulse 130.
He's so pale.
Are you his mother?
What's his name?
Ma'am, what's his name? Teddy.
Decreased breath sounds on the right
full trauma panel.
He's going to need a chest tube.
It's just the two of us.
How'd it happen? I shot him.
Peter.
I guess I should say congratulations.
Did you really get a new job?
You going to call me a liar again?
Here you are, Christmas Eve.
Well, it's my last shift.
What's your excuse?
I wanted to give you Reese's Christmas presents.
You can leave them over there.
See you in two Saturdays.
Yeah.
Merry Christmas.
( sighing )
Hey, Roger...
You can come over to the house tomorrow
and give them to him yourself.
Thanks.
I'm not doing it for you.
Dr. Benton?
The ER.
Sux is on board. Our tree's right by the window.
Five and half ET tube.
There have been so many
break-ins in our neighborhood.
O neg's running. Systolic's low at 70.
Call for a vent. I was sleeping.
I've had the flu. Ten blade.
He was supposed to be in bed.
I heard glass break.
Long vascular clamp.
He dropped an ornament. I thought
it was someone breaking in. I'm in. Bag him.
GSW?
Six-year-old, accidentally shot
by his mom.
Heart rate's down to 30.
Lost his pulse. Starting compressions.
Thoracotomy tray.
Let's move. What does that mean?
We may have to open his chest
to repair the damage.
Four more units of blood.
Scalpel. PAULA: Oh, God.
Paula, why don't you come with me?
500cc's out the right side.
Ready with the rib spreader.
Suction on high.
All right.
Hang on. Hang on.
Come on. Crank it now. Come on.
Agh.
Looks like two liters in there.
Damn it.
Pericardium's filled with blood.
15 blade.
Call the OR. Tell them we've got
a red blanket.
Page Romano now!
Who the hell takes a gun to a six-year-old?
She thought he was a burglar. More packing.
A burglar who shakes the presents under a tree?
Ten blade.
I'll clamshell the chest.
SHIRLEY: Ready with the sternal saw.
Are we really going to go through the motions here?
Knife back. Metz.
I guess we are.
Pickups. Come on, pickups.
Damn it.
There's a fragment
of the slug.
Looks weird.
BENTON: Saw. Let's move.
That's a "black talon."
It's a fragmenting bullet.
Multiple jacket fragments at the hilum.
Looks like razor blades spread all over him.
That's sort of the point.
( saw buzzing )
We order more FFP? On its way.
ROMANO: It's a lost cause, Peter.
There are fragments in all four chambers
and God knows what hit the great vessels.
Dr. Corday is here.
Oh, she's going to love being brought in on this.
What do we have?
Organ donor.
BP dropping: 60/30.
Hang two more units packed cells.
He'll go into DIC.
We can stay ahead with cryo and platelets.
We've got other surgeries lined up, Peter.
Looks like a transverse colon injury
and a bunch of dead bowel.
We're still in the chest.
I've already repaired defects
in the left ventricle and right hilum.
Hope you brought your magic wand.
Either help me or get the hell out of here.
Knock yourself out, Peter!
Either way, you are out of here.
You do know we need to rebuild the IVC
from the kidneys caudally?
More 2-0 silk on a Teflon pledget.
Come on. Keep them coming. Peter.
Elizabeth, we can do this, all right?
Prep a venous cardiac snare.
Did I kill him?
We don't know what his chances are.
But he does have the best surgeons I know
working on him.
How could I do this?
You were scared.
I keep telling God how sorry I am.
That's all you can do.
I don't even believe in God.
Teddy never gets up from bed.
I just wanted to protect our home.
I never thought he'd...
You want me to take you to the OR?
Somebody turn off the damn heat. Another vicryl.
Okay, GI stapler. Let's move.
There's not much stool in the abdominal cavity.
That's a good sign. I would've expected more.
Gut's done.
What's the pressure?
80/40.
All right, well, that's something.
All right, let me get another clip.
Not much.
Well, here we go.
The SMV is done.
Cut.
Shirley, take down the balloon on the Pruitt.
( sighs )
Here we go.
Catheter out.
Balloon down.
Let's throw in a good knot
and see if he stops bleeding.
Come on, Teddy.
Come on, man.
Come on.
Look at that.
Yeah.
That's incredible.
Yeah, well, uh...
All right, here we go.
Releasing the clamp.
How the hell did you do that?
I have no idea.
Well, let's make sure of the count.
Is that the mother?
Yeah.
You go tell her. I'll close up.
Okay.
Thanks, Elizabeth.
You know, Peter, that was truly remarkable.
A little going-away present.
You know, despite anything Romano may say
this place is really going to miss you.
I wish I could say the same.
It wasn't all that bad.
We had our moments.
Your son lost a lot of blood.
However we were able to repair the damage.
He's got a long road ahead of him, but...
he's going to make it.
I don't know how to thank you.
Well...
just get the gun out of your house.
( sighs )
( groaning )
I guess Santa didn't buy you that bike you asked for.
Carter, what are you doing here?
Cleo told me this was on your route.
Come on. You want to join me?
( chuckling ): No.
If I want to get my heart rate up
I'll have another cup of coffee.
I got your message.
I guess there's no way to talk you out of it, huh?
Nah, done deal.
Well, I got you something.
Carter, come on.
Open it.
You're a tough guy to shop for.
An El token?
The second week of my surgical internship
we got 11 traumas in one night.
5:00 a.m. the next morning
we were still patching together this little girl
that had been dragged under a car.
And I was so tired I couldn't even see straight.
And I asked you if I could take a break
and you kicked me out of the OR.
I couldn't even drive home.
I was so exhausted
so I just sat down and started crying
right there in the hallway.
You came out of surgery, and you gave me that
and you said I could use it to go home
or I could commit to what I was doing
and use it to come back the next day.
( sighs )
No Rolex, huh?
( chuckling )
I figured if you get tired of Schaumburg
you can use it to come back.
Carter, they don't use tokens anymore.
Then call.
And I'll come pick you up.
Look, I want you to know...
I know.
...that I owe you.
( sniffling )
Carter...
I'm getting cold. I better move on.
Merry Christmas.
Same to you.
Hey, Peter?
I'm a good doctor because of you.
No, you're not...
but keep trying.
