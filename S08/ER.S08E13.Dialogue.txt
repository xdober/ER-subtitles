Previously on E.R.:
Mark, she's out of control.
You need to stop lying to me.
Why? You don't believe me anyway!
You search my room and go through
my private things! I was looking for drugs.
I'm getting my job back
with the following conditions...
I didn't agree to any conditions.
I failed your brother.
Mom... He was tired
before we even left for France.
It delayed the diagnosis by less than a month.
I just sat by
while it was eating him alive.
JOYCE: Stop it!
BRIAN: Shut your lying... filthy... mouth...
It's not the way it seems.
Our walls are pretty thin, Joyce.
Rachel, I want you to stay here.
Chamomile tea?
Oh...
Feeling better?
Well, I haven't been to the bathroom
in ten minutes.
I guess that's progress.
Hey, at least someone's happy.
She should be.
She TP'd the bathroom, the hallway
and half the kitchen
while I was making your tea.
God, she's not even walking yet.
Did you take your temperature?
Yeah, but...
Okay.
Should I call or do you want to?
I'm presenting at grand rounds.
Not with the stomach flu you're not.
Mark...
Hi, I'm calling for Dr. Corday.
Yes, she's projectile vomiting.
Do you still want her to come in?
Ha ha, very funny.
Thank you.
You know I'm calling right back.
I just need some loperamide and I'll be fine.
What you need to do is stay in bed, okay?
( baby fussing )
What about Ella?
Katherine's coming over.
Well, who's going to look after her till then?
RACHEL: I'm not doing anything today.
Hey, Rach.
I can watch her if you want.
I wouldn't want you to give up your Saturday.
It's freezing out anyway.
Sold.
I'm late.
You, stay in bed.
Haleh, the gallstone in Four needs toradol
and can you check the labs on Cathy Jensen?
Upper GI bleed? Yeah.
Is Dr. Chen in yet?
Nope.
You get the message he was looking for you?
...men for their virility and women for their sex drive.
LEWIS: Oh, really?
In just a swim cap?
Yeah, and a Speedo.
You've got to try it.
In January in Lake Michigan?
It has an almost spiritual quality to it.
You wanted to see me, Robert?
Yeah, I was just discussing with Dr. Lewis
what a tough year it's been
what with personnel changes and lawsuits and whatnot.
Can you believe Dr. Romano's a member
of the Polar Bear Club?
Can you excuse us for a moment?
No, no, no, stay.
I've come up with a solution
for the administrative bottleneck
you've been experiencing down here. What bottleneck?
Well, to start with, your QAs are a month behind.
Which you'll have by day's end.
Uh, I'm sorry.
Does she really need to be here for this?
Actually, I have a patient.
Well, that was elegant.
Look, you can't expect me
to do low priority administrative work
while I'm clocking more clinical shifts
than anybody in my department.
You're overburdened, there's no question about it.
Which is why I've asked Dr. Lewis to pitch in.
How?
Covering meetings, uh, overseeing teaching
in your absence.
Which is what the chief resident does.
Well, Carter's not an attending
and Dr. Lewis is.
Why are you doing this?
I'm feeling unappreciated here, Kerry
particularly since I'm trying to lighten your load.
No, you're not.
You're jerking my chain.
Why would I do that?
Because you can, Robert.
Yeah, well, for the time being
consider Dr. Lewis your unofficial assistant.
No, I don't need any help.
And, um, try to keep
the public displays of affection to a minimum.
This is a workplace, not a parade.
I have some messages for you, Dr. Weaver.
Thank you.
So, you're gay, huh?
Yeah, Frank.
I'm gay, all right?
You know you're going to hell, right?
An entire bottle of wine?
Topped off with a couple of Xanax.
Oh, was she embarrassed?
Kind of hard not to be
when you're puking your guts out.
You know what the worst part about it was?
You had to put her to bed?
It was a 40-year-old bottle of Bordeaux.
Is this a new thing?
Apparently, she's been taking them
on and off for years.
Really?
Mortality reviews.
Seems you get to finish them for me.
They're due by day's end.
Great.
Should I have some soup sent over?
Is Elizabeth still sick?
Listen, if you change your mind, call me, okay?
Hang in there.
Love you.
She's been on the toilet all night.
Mm, I'm not sure, but that may be more
than I need to know.
So Romano conned you into picking
up the slack, huh?
Oh, God, I agreed to help.
Was that stupid?
A little bit around the edges.
Kerry's lucky to have you.
I don't think she sees it that way.
She's never liked me very much.
She doesn't like anyone.
CHEN: Don't people work around here?
Ah, glutton for punishment, huh?
Yeah, something like that.
Oh, hi, welcome back.
Yeah, to you, too.
Thank you.
You're here.
I was hoping you would have come in earlier.
I wanted to acquaint you with the new forms
for the CPT. codes.
I'll be fine.
Suit yourself.
Good for you, girl.
You still owe me $20 for Cleo's going-away present.
Suddenly I feel like I never left.
You lost your locker so you can keep
your stuff in here for the time being.
Wait, there- there's dirt in here.
It's doughnut sprinkles.
( groans )
Donald Brower, 35.
Face, neck and chest injuries from some sort of explosion.
Unknown LOC, GCS 14
hypotensive, 80 palp, pulse 130.
Mr. Brower, can you hear me?
Can you tell me what happened?
Mail...
Sorry?
Exploded.
What happened?
He opened some kind of letter bomb.
Daughter's in that rig.
Give it to me.
Jessica Brower, six.
Near amputation of the right hand.
B.P. is 100/70, pulse 120.
Estimated blood loss? 300cc's.
Couple of big bleeders at the right wrist
controlled with the cuff up.
Okay, I'm Dr. Lewis.
We're going to take care of you, all right?
It hurts!
Yeah, I know it does, sweetheart.
How's the airway?
GREENE: He's talking now.
GCS 14 here.
BP 80/40.
CHEN: Sir, can you see out of this eye?
I'll get it. What?
Peaked iris
probable globe rupture.
Follow the light.
He needs a chest tube.
Betadine and chest tube tray.
BROWER: It's her birthday.
Whose birthday, Mr. Brower?
I let Jessica pull on the bow.
Do you know why someone
would send you a package bomb?
My wife...
Your wife?
Mr. Brower?
CHUNY: Sinus tach at 120.
Did you get that chest tube in yet?
That's the pleura.
Open your eyes, Mr. Brower.
CHUNY: Pressure's dropping, 70 systolic.
He's out.
Vascular clamp.
Another thoracostomy tray.
I've got it, Kerry.
I wonder how Susan's doing
over there with the kid.
Okay, I'll put in the second chest tube
and you can get the airway.
Airway's fine.
LEWIS: A gram of Ancef, IV piggyback.
Where are we?
Superficial flash burns, face is fine.
Lungs are clear, pelvis is stable.
All the money's on the hand.
Pressure's steady at 100/70.
No visible deformity
of the shoulder or elbow. Ow!
WEAVER: Hold on, Jessica.
at your hand, all right?
Thumb's intact.
HALEH: First hemocue's 8.
Ring and little finger are missing.
We're going to need
hand surgery, ortho and probably plastics.
Okay, let the cuff down.
Surgery will be here in a minute.
I said take the cuff down.
Whoa!
( screams )
Okay, Jessica.
Okay, sweetheart.
You just relax.
We just need to know
the exact injury.
Well, now you know.
HALEH: You want hemostats?
Yeah.
Just direct pressure.
Blood supply intact.
Probably salvageable.
We're okay here, Kerry.
HALEH: Sinus at 100.
CBC, Lytes,
BUN, Creatinine coags and...
We already ordered pre-op labs.
Fine.
CARTER: Two more morphines.
Get an x-ray tech down here.
Carter, your mom's here.
She brought in a kid from her leukemia center.
Go ahead, I got it. Yeah?
They come in on a rig?
Nope, she brought him in herself.
He has... weakness and a slight fever.
Thanks.
And she's nicer than I remembered.
Oh, John.
Thank goodness you're here today.
Who's your friend?
Mickey is the center's Child of the Year.
We were photographing him for the spring mailer
and he suddenly became lightheaded and warm.
So you brought him here?
We tried phoning his doctors but it's Saturday.
Is there someplace else I should have taken him?
Did they give him anything yet?
Your friend gave him some Tylenol.
How long has he had leukemia?
I'm not sure
but I do know he's been in remission for a year.
Did you call his parents?
He's an orphan.
So he lives in a foster home?
With three other special needs children
and foster parents he barely knows.
Hey, Mickey. How you doing?
Not so good.
Yeah, well, we're going to see if
we can't figure out a way to make you feel a little better, okay?
Okay.
A private room would help.
Swing your legs up there for me.
CHUNY: Unit six going up
pressure 90/50.
AC 12 on 100%
tidal volume 500, peep of five.
You holding up okay?
Yeah.
Fluid in Morrison's pouch...
You can't let Kerry get to you.
...and in the left pericolic gutter.
Where the hell is surgery?
It's like riding a bicycle.
Yeah, one with square wheels.
Ectopy.
V-tach.
GREENE: Okay, charge the paddles.
Open a thoracotomy tray.
Get ready.
There's no pulse.
You'll be fine.
Charge to 200.
Clear.
Charge to 300.
Ten blade.
Clear.
CHUNY: Asystole.
Go ahead. Open the chest.
A positive is up. B.P.'s 100/60.
TKO the other fluids, but bring another dose of Fent
just to be sure. Jessica?
Are you her mother? Yeah. Baby?
Okay, she's stable right now
but she's had extensive damage to her right hand.
We need to get her up to the OR.
Jessica, can you hear me?
We've given her some pain medication
so she may not be able to respond.
It's Mommy. Why don't you come with us to pre-op?
The surgeon and anesthesiologist
will need to talk with you.
Wait, where's my husband?
He's in there, they're working on him.
Mrs. Brower!
Mrs. Brower!
CHUNY: P.E.A.
Don? V-fib.
Oh, God.
Shock him.
You the wife?
Your husband's injuries caused
his heart to stop beating.
We're trying to bring him back.
A thoracotomy.
You a doctor?
Researcher.
CHEN: Clear.
Still V-fib.
Witnessed arrest.
CHEN: Charge again.
Ten percent chance.
Clear.
I told him not to worry...
Still V-fib.
Charge again.
I told him it was safe.
Clear.
Agonal rhythm.
( sobs )
He's been down for 30 minutes.
You can stop.
He's gone.
GALLANT: Are you currently being treated for your diabetes?
Look, I'm, uh... I'm blind, I'm not stupid.
I do okay.
I mean, it's not easy to get someone
to measure out my insulin, but, uh, that's life.
Look, you know, I'm just here for the-the toenails, right?
Yes, sir, yes, sir.
You know, uh, it's been getting worse all week.
I think it was the new shoes.
Yeah, when did you have them clipped last?
Oh, uh... April, maybe.
They seem to be, uh
pretty overgrown.
Oh, listen, you think it's hard to get someone
to give you a sugar shot?
Just try asking them to clip these puppies.
( chuckles )
Well, you know, I can do that for you.
Of course, you can.
You're a gifted doctor.
Or at least, you will be.
Hold on.
Someone smells beautiful.
( sneezes )
Bless you. Hi, I'm Dr. Chen.
I've heard a lot about you.
I mean, good things.
Oh.
And the bad things aren't really your fault.
Excuse me?
Manny here has a sixth sense about people, or so he says.
Well, with my eyes
I had to get something out of the deal, right?
What is this?
It's Mr. Kindlevich's Seeing Eye dog.
But where's his harness?
He isn't official.
But trust me, he's my eyes.
I need him.
All right. Just keep him on a leash-- a short one.
GALLANT: Yes, ma'am.
Dr. Chen, can I speak with you privately?
What do you want?
You know, eventually this has to stop.
This attitude, this resentment you have towards me.
Does it?
We have to work together.
I can't allow patient care
to be compromised because you don't like me.
I wouldn't let that happen.
Good, because the last thing
I need is a divisive medical staff.
Then maybe you should quit.
The police want to talk to you.
I told them to wait
until after your daughter's surgery.
Has it started?
Yes.
I should have told him about the threats.
We're trying to create stem cells.
Using embryos?
DNA.
Cloning?
This was meant for me, not him.
Not Jessica.
Can I observe the surgery?
It's probably not a good idea.
I'm a doctor.
You're also her mother.
I'll see what I can do.
Okay.
( sneezing )
Ow! Easy, kid, easy.
Almost there.
Hey!
Sorry about that.
Damn medical students.
( laughter )
He's all bark.
You know, you remind him of his son.
Uh, I'm black, sir.
Oh. Well, I can't see.
( sneezing )
Did you want two sets of cultures?
Mm-hmm.
My best friend Eddie has the flu.
Yeah, there's a lot of that going around.
We were shooting outside.
It's freezing.
I know.
I tried to tell the photographer that
but he wouldn't listen.
Abby here's going to draw some of your blood.
I have a good vein here.
Okay.
LOCKHART: Take a deep breath.
Exhale.
You don't have to watch.
I'm fine.
Just a couple more vials
and we'll be all done.
Where are you going?
I have other patients.
Hi.
Are you feeling any better?
Hardly.
Is she keeping you busy?
Yeah. I tried to get her down for a nap earlier
but she wouldn't do it.
Ah.
Sometimes stroking her earlobes helps lull her to sleep.
Can I get you anything to eat?
Oh, Rachel, I don't think I can keep anything down.
How about some tea?
Sure, sure.
( whispering to baby )
Careful, you don't want to get her sick.
Okay, why did I wear these shoes?
Ah, because you forgot that around here, it's, um...
...comfort first.
No, I didn't forget.
It's just I'm not ready to go back to ugly sensible shoes.
I heard that you did some really nice work in that trauma today.
Well, doesn't count if they don't make it.
Jing-Mei, why did you treat pylo with Bactrim?
Because the PMD sent a culture two days ago.
I have the sensitivities.
There's been a lot of resistance to Bactrim.
Not for her.
Well, if you don't have a culture
start with Levaquin or an aminoglycoside.
Hey, looks like you made a friend.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, knock it off.
Gallant, get this dog out of here.
This is a hospital, not a kennel.
Thanks a lot. What did I do?
Tried to let her off the hook.
Whose side are you on, anyway?
Oh, I'm not on anybody's side.
I'm trying to play this very neutral.
No, no, you have to be on someone's side
and it better be mine.
Well, Deb, she's my boss.
You like her, don't you?
I don't dislike her.
Huh. That makes a lot of sense.
What makes a lot of sense?
Well, your taste.
Excuse me?
( chuckling )
John, it's obvious
you have a thing for older women.
What?!
Yeah, Weaver, Lewis and, oh
that pediatric surgeon.
What was her name?
Oh, come on.
Oh, come on.
Younger women just too much for you?
Oh, no, see, I can handle myself either way.
Yeah, sure you can.
Carter, your mom's out there asking for you.
What do you want me to tell her?
WOMAN: Where's my kid?
You can tell her I'm with a patient.
What did you do with my kid? Hey, Doris, how's the leg?
Much better, thanks. What you got?
Leslie Miller, unrestrained driver
slow speed MVA, drove her car into some bushes.
Found her and her daughter sitting on the curb.
Only injury is a scalp lac.
Where's the daughter?
Right behind us.
Hey, Leslie, I'm Dr. Carter.
Oh, I'll just bet you are, sweet face.
B.P. 130/80, no LOC and enough alcohol on her breath
to start a small fire.
Hey, I resent the implication...
Hi, what's your name? Stacy Miller.
13 years old, no LOC.
Says she wasn't hurt.
All right, we're going to check you out
make sure you're okay.
You feeling pain anywhere?
Oh, hey, what's with the straps? Yeah, a big one.
You guys a bunch of friggin' perverts or something?
In my ass.
Excuse me?
That looks pretty superficial.
What?
The cut on your head.
There's a cut on my head?
( laughing ): I'm sorry.
I'm just kidding, you know...
Ow!
Softer hands, honey.
I'm sorry, but I ain't "honey."
Why is everybody so serious around here?
This is a pretty serious thing
that happened to you, Leslie.
No, no, no.
See, this is a bump.
What's seriously wrong is what's in here.
You having chest pain?
I have a broken heart.
Two great weeks
and he leaves me without a word.
What the hell kind of fiancé is that?
Trauma panel, urine tox and a dip
BAL and hang a banana bag.
Suture kit?
I'll get it.
Banana bag?
Is that the daughter?
Yeah.
Lucky me, huh?
Stacy, we need to get you into a gown
so I can examine your chest and belly, okay?
I said I wasn't hurt.
You want to get out of here, right?
Go home, clean the house, get your homework done.
How did you know?
I'm very smart.
And besides, the quicker you get into this thing
the quicker you get out of here.
Ouch.
At least you were being responsible.
Mom says seat belts are too confining.
Nice example to set-- driving drunk and belt-less.
She wasn't driving. I was.
You're 13.
Almost 14.
You don't have a driver's license.
Neither does my mom
but she still drives.
I just take over when she's had too much to drink.
Have you been doing this for a while now?
Three years, and not one accident.
Till now.
Okay, we'll be right back.
We just need to go get some more supplies.
That is completely nuts.
Or brilliant, depending on your point of view.
A 13-year-old driving her lush mom
around is a good thing?
No, but neither is a lush mom
driving her 13-year-old around.
Somebody's got to be the adult.
You know, it was going along just fine. I was...
( baby crying )
Elizabeth, you awake?
( baby screaming )
What's wrong?
I don't know. She's all sweaty
and she just started crying.
Let me see, let me see.
Oh. Did you give her milk?
Um, no, just-just mashed bananas.
Here, just take her one moment.
I'll just get the thermometer.
( baby crying )
How long's she been crying?
Oh.
Elizabeth, she just threw up.
Oh, dear.
Oh, come here, sweetie.
Maybe she caught what you have.
Oh, it's okay.
Hey, what's this?
RACHEL: What?
Get me the phone. What is it?
It's a pill fragment.
She swallowed something.
Oh my God, her heart's pounding.
It's okay.
Rachel!
It's okay, it's okay.
It's all right, darling.
It's all right, darling. It's okay.
Oh, my God.
Come on, answer, damn it!
It's okay.
It's-it's E.
What?
It's-it's Ecstasy.
I had some in my backpack.
( baby crying )
Um, yes, sorry.
No, hold on, hold on.
How many? What?
How many pills are missing?
Um...
Uh, just one or two.
Yeah, sorry.
I have a baby with an amphetamine overdose.
Yes.
1211 Dupont Drive.
Please hurry.
( baby screaming )
It's all right.
Yeah, but letting her sober daughter drive is worse?
I don't know if it's worse
but it's child endangerment
so you got to get Social Services involved.
So that means Stacy goes into foster care?
That may not be such a bad thing.
So, you want to call the cops, or should I?
Abby, we need to find Dr. Greene.
Okay.
Abby?
I'll take care of it.
Oh, sorry.
Sorry, I got a little busy there.
Has his fever broke?
No, and he's very uncomfortable.
No one's given him anything to eat.
I'll make sure that he gets something.
I talked to the Pedes Oncology fellow.
He's going to come down and see him.
Aren't you going to do something?
Yeah, I sent off his labs.
No, I mean in terms of treating him.
There's no obvious infection
so the oncologist can take it from here.
Oh.
It may be a while if you want to go home.
I can't leave.
His foster parents still can't get here?
No.
Well, I'm sure there's somebody from the Center
that can relieve you.
I'm from the Center.
Are you sure that you want to do this?
I mean, stay involved?
Do you think she'll remember him?
My daughter was six.
She broke her arm in two places
riding her bike
and the only thing she remembers
from that year is seeing
Muppets on Ice.
They remember the good things.
She won't forget her father.
ROMANO: Mrs. Brower?
Yes? I'm Dr. Romano.
I've finished my part of the surgery
which went well.
Will they need to amputate?
Uh...
She's a doctor.
Oh. Well, there's stable bone on the remaining digits
blood supply and enough skin to cover grafts, so...
So she'll have use of the hand?
Limited use.
But kids can adapt.
( knocking on window )
Dr. Greene, Dr. Corday and the paramedics
are on the way with your daughter.
What?
Came over the M.I.C.N.
as an Ecstasy overdose.
Did they say how much Rachel took?
All I know is she's vomiting.
Is she awake?
Uh, uh, I-I... they didn't say.
Who didn't say?
I didn't take the call, Haleh did.
( sighs )
What were her vitals?
I'm sorry, I don't know anything.
I knew she was doing this.
I knew it.
I should have trusted my instincts.
I've got to take the stairs.
Excuse me.
Move, move!
LOCKHART: Sorry.
HALEH: I got the charcoal!
We need a Pedes I.C.U. bed!
Where are they?
Trauma One.
Move, move, move!
How's her airway?
HALEH: She's breathing on her own.
Tachy at 180 and febrile.
CHEN: Serum aspirin
and acetaminophen levels.
Cath urine for tox screen.
( baby crying )
Oh, God.
CORDAY: She's diaphoretic.
CHEN: Let's get a rectal temp.
What the hell happened?
She swallowed Rachel's Ecstasy.
What?
I'm not sure how.
She's sympathomimetic toxidrome
and we couldn't get a line in the rig.
Where was it?
What?
It was in her backpack!
She had four pills-- two have disappeared
and-and, Ella vomited a fragment of one.
Bolus 100 of I.V. saline.
Ten milligrams of, uh, charcoal by N.G.
Prep a milligram of Ativan.
They blew two veins in the field.
I'm going to try an intraosseous.
No! No, she's got a good antecubital.
( alarm sounds )
Oh, God! Heart rate's 250.
Looks like a narrow complex S.V.T.
I need a glove full of ice.
Let's have one of adenosine.
CHEN: Dr. Corday, what is her weight?
Uh, ten kilograms
at the pediatrician's last week.
Okay, here we go.
Come on, sweetheart, come on.
24 gauge in the right A.C.
Push the adenosine.
No, lungs are wet.
She's in failure.
CORDAY: We need to break
the tachycardia.
The C.H.F. is rate-related.
And can somebody get me
a stool, please?
LOCKHART: It's still in S.V.T.
Are you all right? Yes, I'm fine.
Just worry about my daughter.
Okay, we're going to need the crash cart.
What?
She's hypoxic
with pulmonary edema in S.V.T.
The protocol is to synch cardiovert
at half a joule per kilo.
No! No, we're not shocking her.
She's hemodynamically stable.
Maybe we should get Dr. Weaver in here.
Nope.
Let's try two of adenosine.
Abby, get Dr. Weaver.
Mr. Kindlevich, are you still being treated?
No, discharged.
Just waiting for the van to pick us up.
Oh... Stinky!
Uh, why don't you have a seat? Here we go.
Here, step straight back.
There you go.
He never leaves.
I'm sure he'll be back soon.
Stinky!
( sneezing )
Stinky, is that you?
Stinky? Stinky?
Hey, Stinky....
Oh, Stinky!
Oh... Stinky.
I figured he needed to take care of business.
Gallant, you're a student, not a dog walker.
Bless you.
I think I'm allergic to d-dogs.
( sneezes )
Apparently.
Next time, use a plastic bag.
MARQUEZ: Dr. Weaver, they need you in Trauma One.
Dr. Greene's daughter's in trouble.
LOCKHART: Second round's on board.
Sat's down to 90.
Put her up to 15 liters of O2.
Still in S.V.T.? Yeah.
Have you tried...?
Push three of adenosine.
Mark, we both know how difficult it can be
working on a family member...
Okay, get ready with Diltiazem.
...and your own child, in particular.
I've got it, Kerry.
No.
No, you need to step aside.
I said I've got it, Kerry.
WEAVER: Calcium channel blockers
can cause cardiovascular collapse and death
in kids under one.
Mark?
Push one milligram of Inderal.
WEAVER: You're soaking wet.
Kerry, please.
Your pulse is thready, you have a fever.
It's just gastroenteritis.
Sinus rhythm.
Thank God.
Number eight French N.G. for the charcoal.
WEAVER: Let's get Elizabeth to bed, and run in
two liters of saline.
I'm not leaving!
If you don't, you're going to pass out
and that won't help anyone, least of all Ella.
She's okay.
She's stable now, okay?
Go lay down.
I want to be able to see her.
I'll set you up in Exam Two.
( alarm sounds )
Damn it!
Pulse ox is down to 88.
Lungs are full of fluid.
15 of Lasix.
We should think about intubation.
I can get her out of failure.
She's retracting.
And using accessory muscles.
She's in respiratory distress.
Give the diuretics a chance to work.
Put her on the Broselow tape
and bag her on 100%.
No, you'll hyperinflate the stomach.
Mark, your baby is hypoxic.
I know you want to avoid
unnecessary procedures
but if we don't intubate now you're making a big mistake.
Now, step aside.
Rate... the failure was rate-related.
I-I... we could... we broke the S.V.T...
But now she's in pulmonary edema.
If this wasn't your baby
you would have intubated her
a long time ago.
I'm trying to save her life.
Premedicate with point two of atropine
15 of lidocaine.
Induce with three point two
of etomidate and paralyze with 22 of sux.
What size tube?
4-0 uncuffed
and a number one straight blade.
Call for a pedes vent.
Tidal volume of 100cc's.
Sats are up to 92 with bagging.
Feels like we should be doing something.
There's nothing we can do.
They got three doctors in there.
We'd just be in the way.
Yeah. Did you hear how it happened?
Yeah.
It is amazing the drugs
that kids can get a hold of.
Oh, my God, is that Rachel?
Yeah.
Oh. John?
Mickey's been upstairs for an hour
and he still hasn't been seen by a doctor.
Yeah, that's not uncommon.
Well, it's unacceptable.
I was just going to get some coffee.
Do you want some?
Yes, I'd love some.
I was hoping you could tell me
what all this means.
You stole his lab slips.
Yes.
I heard that they were back
but no one gave us the results.
What is it?
He's, uh, in blast crisis.
He's had a recurrence.
His bone marrow is full of leukemia cells
and he's not going to be able to fight infection.
Is there something we can do?
I'm sure they're giving him antibiotics.
The oncologist will know exactly what to do.
Yes, of course, but he's just a number to them.
Maybe if-if you spoke to the doctors
they'd take him more personally.
Why are you doing this?
I mean, you've been here all day.
You've been holding his hand
clipping his chart, bugging the staff...
I'm trying to help a sick child.
Mom, he has leukemia.
I know that.
And he may not survive.
Look, if you've got some kind of
twisted need to relive this, that's fine.
I'm not going to do it again.
I made my peace a long time ago.
Let's pull the tube back five millimeters.
Are you in the main stem?
At the carina.
You should be in bed.
Heart rate's down to 100.
Pulse ox is 99.
When can we extubate?
They'll probably keep her sedated in the PICU
rest her overnight in the vent
and extubate her first thing in the morning.
Mark, we need them to get a rollaway in the room.
I'm staying the night.
Elizabeth, you're sick.
Well, you're not leaving, are you?
No. Mark?
I found her wandering the hallway.
Dad?
Rachel, where have you been?
I was just waiting outside.
Is she okay?
Does she look okay?
I'm sorry.
You're sorry?!
Mark...
Stay out of this.
You bring drugs into our house
and leave them out for a baby?
It wasn't mine.
Stop lying! I'm not.
They were just for a party
and I wasn't sure I was going to take them.
Well, your sister did.
But she's going to be okay, though, right?
It was just one pill.
Are you really that stupid?
Ella is nine months old!
I know. She almost died.
Dad, don't...
Don't what?
Don't call you a liar?
Because that's what you are, Rachel.
You promised me you weren't doing drugs.
She could have long-term brain damage
learning disabilities, low I.Q., memory impairment.
She could still die!
I know, Dad.
Please, please, Dad, I-I'm sorry.
I'm... Dad, I'm...
Daddy, I'm sorry.
( crying )
Dad...
( crying continues )
She still seems a little warm.
We'll get a repeat temp.
She can have ibuprofen by N.G.
I'll check the orders.
Is this the overdose?
Do we have a post-intubation film?
Uh...
I-I want someone else.
Let's see how she's satting on 70%.
No, no, no. You're not touching her.
What's the problem?
Can you page me another doctor?
There's no one else on service.
Elizabeth, if we're going to control toxicity
we need to wean down the oxygen.
Yes, well, I want my own pediatrician.
Is this your daughter?
You are not touching her.
I have to. I'm the critical care attending.
No, no, you do not touch my child!
Do you hear me? You stay away from her!
Lizzie, we have to check the blood gas.
No! You get out! All right, you heard what she said.
Get out! Go on! Get out!
Get Dr. Rosato in here.
GREENE: Kerry?
Yeah, how's she doing?
Vitals are stable. Satting well on 50%.
Sounds like her lungs are drying out.
Yeah, we've got a long ways to go.
My prayers are with you all.
Kerry.
Thank you.
CARTER: Taking off?
Yep.
Hang around here much longer, I'm going to start to cry.
Is your mom still upstairs?
Don't know.
Don't care?
Hi.
Hey, I thought you left.
I wanted to say thanks.
The officer said
that they'd book her for the DUI
but that I could post bail in a couple hours.
Whoa...
They're charging your mother with a DUI?
And I made an appointment at that treatment center.
Great.
But you were driving.
No, I wasn't.
I thought you said she was driving.
No, I didn't.
What?
Anyway, I've got to catch a bus.
Good luck.
You said you were going to call the police.
No, you said I was going to call the police.
No, I specifically asked you
"Are you going to take care of this...?"
She's her mother's best chance for recovery.
I think you know that.
Night, Carter.
Night.
( Stinky whining )
Hey, Gallant?
Your guy's dead.
Rachel's here.
Did you call the police?
She wants to talk to you.
I can't.
Elizabeth?
I'm sorry, Mark.
I can't.
Let's get you something to eat, okay?
LEWIS: I want to stop by
but they probably just want to be by themselves.
Yeah. Hey, you want to go in on dinner for them?
Have it sent over, so they don't have to leave?
Yeah, that'd be nice.
Bye, Kerry.
Bye.
Good night, Dr. Weaver.
Good night.
GALLANT: Stinky!
What are you doing here?
( panting )
Huh?
Been trying to catch him
but he keeps running around in circles
and comes back here.
( sneezes )
Oh, for God's sake.
Go inside and take an antihistamine.
Yes, ma'am.
Oh...
( sneezes )
Come here. I don't like dogs.
( barks )
And I don't like your name.
Oh, give me a break.
( sighing )
All right, here we go.
You better be housebroken.
LOCKHART: Who is it?
Abby, it's me. Let me in.
Joyce?
Please hurry!
Hey.
What's wrong?
Joyce?
Turn out the lights.
What?
Turn out all the lights.
Well, what's going on?
I'm sorry, I had to get out.
I hope it's okay that I came here.
Well, of course it is.
But, but... Joyce?
( loud knocking )
BRIAN: Joyce, you in there?
Oh.
No, no, don't go! He's probably just looking
anyplace he can think of.
( pounding door ): Open up, damn it!
I'm calling the police.
No, it'll just make it worse.
He just needs to calm down.
Joyce, you in there?
Joyce, we can't hide in here all night.
Joyce!
( sobbing ): He'll go away.
When?
Open up, damn it!
( pounding louder ): Bitch!
( sobs )
( door slams )
I think he's gone.
Can I stay here for a while?
Sure.
( sobbing )
( television broadcast plays low )
She's pretty tired.
Okay.
How you feeling?
Kind of better.
Yeah? They treating you okay up here?
They don't tell me much.
They tell her, mostly.
You know what's happening to you, Mickey?
I know it's back.
But...
I don't think it'll be as bad this time.
I was by myself before.
( sobbing )
( clicking and beeping )
( sobbing ): She looks asleep...
but she's not.
( sighs )
Hey, you want me to...
you want me to take over for a while?
No.
( sobbing )
She is going to come out of this.
Well, she may not.
( sobbing )
She may never open her eyes again.
Elizabeth...
I don't understand why this has happened.
( sobbing )
Ssh...
It'll be okay.
( sobs )
Mark, you don't know that, do you?
( voice breaking ): No.
No...
