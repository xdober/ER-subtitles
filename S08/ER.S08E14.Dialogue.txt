Previously on ER:
I have a baby with an amphetamine overdose.
Joyce, you in there? I'm calling the police.
No.
I'm trying to help a sick child.
Mom, he has leukemia
and he may not survive.
If you've got some kind of twisted need
to relive this, that's fine.
I'm not going to do it again.
I made my peace a long time ago.
What the hell happened?
She swallowed Rachel's Ecstasy.
She could still die!
I know, Dad, please! Please, Dad, I'm sorry!
I don't understand why this is happening!
WOMAN: Dr. Lewis, you need to get up.
Dr. Lewis!
What?
You need to get up.
Oh...
What time is it?
Almost 7:00.
Oh, my God.
I was just going to lie down for a second.
When was that?
1:30.
( chuckles )
( groans )
Oh, I need to get home.
Animal attack from the zoo in 15 to 20.
Oh, no, I'm not on till noon.
Weaver needs you now.
Yeah, and I need a hot shower and some mouthwash.
Dr. Greene's still up in the PICU.
Someone has to cover
his shift, and you happen to be curled up in the lounge.
Is she extubated?
His daughter? Yeah.
They're waiting
on another blood gas.
Is she triggering the vent? Not yet.
Did neurology read the EEG? I don't know.
We're talking bagels and cream cheese.
No one is taking a bribe.
Promotions like this add to the cost of pharmaceuticals--
marketing expenditures passed on to mostly elderly consumers.
I'm elderly.
There's no free lunch, Frank.
This is breakfast.
Uh, yes, this is Susan Lewis in the ER.
I need to speak with the charge nurse.
They weaned her down to 30%.
She's off sedation
and the PICU fellow ordered a CPAP trial.
Oh, uh, thanks.
Uh, n-never mind.
Okay, I'll take the rack.
You clear the pass-ons.
And get this borborygmi out of Four.
You want to at least ask me to cover all day
after staying all night?
All night was your choice.
And welcome to management.
You know you sleep with your eyelids open?
Partly open.
Still...
kind of freaky.
Yeah, not as freaky as watching you eat
with your mouth open.
Any strawberry?
Wait, wait, wait, wh-what are you doing?
Looking for a knife.
Next to the pen lights.
All right, you're going to eat that?
Why not?
The next time you get a pneumonitis
and you have to prescribe Reprotrex
or the cheaper, just as effective, generic drug
you're not going to feel even slightly beholden?
By a bagel? Yes.
No.
Are you sure?
Okay, I'm going to go to Doc McGoo's
get some breakfast, find a toothbrush, change my underwear
and then I'll clear your borborygmi.
15 minutes.
If I stick with the underwear I've got on
can we at least keep the food out?
It's all right, it's all right.
( sighs )
You can't titrate a little Versed so she won't remember?
Any benzo decreases her ventilatory drive.
Oh... then do it.
But if you're going to allow
the sedation to wear off
you have to be ready to go.
Well, I need to warn you.
Extubation's a leap of faith with little ones.
I can't do an NIF.
PEEP's under two.
CO2's normal.
( clears throat )
Let's go.
Okay. Have the ambu bag ready.
Disconnecting the vent.
And tape is clear.
And... tube.
Suction.
All right, come on, Ella.
Big cough
big cough.
She's not breathing.
Blow by O2.
Give her time.
Give her time.
Break open the airway box.
Draw up a milligram of Midazolam. Mark?
Come on, Ella.
Positive pressure now.
No, wait.
( coughing )
( baby crying )
Ah, that's a happy sound.
CORDAY: Yeah, we're here.
We're here.
It's all right.
We're here.
Is his car still there?
Sometimes he skips marketing
but he won't skip cost accounting.
If you want to wait
I can be there when you do it.
No, I'm going to ask him at school.
He'll stay calm in front of his study group.
You can't ask him, Joyce.
Right, right.
And you have to actually leave if he doesn't...
I know. I know.
Do you want to come to work with me?
Can I just stay here until he leaves?
Of course.
Call me after you talk to him.
Abby...
These groups, they really work, right?
'Cause he only lasted two sessions in counseling.
Oh, Joyce... I know. I want to try and help him.
I know it's worth a try.
Yeah, and you can always go back to him
if he gets better, or you can file a complaint
and a judge can make him go...
He'll do this.
If he knows I'm serious, he'll do this for me.
Call me.
Thanks, Abby.
Lock the door.
( door unlocking )
Abby?
You seen Joyce?
Abby, my wife, you seen her?
What?
No.
She didn't come home last night. I'm getting worried.
She didn't call you?
No.
Did you call the police?
No. We had a fight.
She might just be mad at me.
Oh.
If you hear from her
can you have her call me on my cell?
Yeah, sure.
Thanks.
Have a good day.
She's moving extremities?
All four.
Fixing and following.
Good color.
Oh, Mark, that's great.
Yeah, no seizure in the next 48 hours
we should be home free.
What's that for?
The breast pump up in OB is missing
a collection tube.
She's eating?
She's about to try.
Thanks for covering.
Oh, don't worry about us.
Just take care of your daughter.
Positive LOC.
Now GCS 13, postictal.
This is the zoo trauma?
Yeah. He got bit by a monkey.
It was a sloth.
What is a sloth?
It's like a monkey.
MAN: No, it's not.
They're not anything like primates.
Looked like a monkey to me.
Dr. Greene?
I hear your baby's doing better.
Yeah, off the vent.
Oh, good. That's really good news.
So far.
Um, look
I didn't file an H5122 with the chart.
A what?
Mandatory reporting of illegal substance abuse.
Oh, right.
Well, I just wasn't sure.
I thought maybe you'd want to...
Yeah, I'll take care of it.
Okay.
( sighs )
( alarm beeping )
Um...
Sometimes it takes a little longer
during shift change.
Shift change?
When one nurse goes home, another comes on.
Oh, right.
I'll go get her.
Atopicide?
Two CDA.
You piggyback in the second phase.
CARTER: Hey.
His IV has run out, and there's an alarm going off.
It's only a pretreatment solution.
Nurse will change it when they move him.
Move him?
To the, uh, treatment room.
His cells are almost 100% leukemic.
He'll need a second, uh, chemo induction immediately.
And then a bone marrow transplant?
Well, he's already failed one.
Another one's just going to make him a lot sicker
and be a lot more dangerous.
And chemotherapy alone is going to save him?
Maybe.
He's going to get a set of drugs
he didn't get before.
You've decided to experiment on him?
I haven't decided anything.
Look, it's as much luck as science involved
at this point.
You look like you need a rest.
No. You're going to pump that junk back into his veins
I'm going to stay right here.
I've been meaning to get the ring sized smaller
but I didn't get the chance.
How did you swallow it?
He likes me to suck on his fingers.
I see.
Nothing to panic about.
It should pass
in two or three days.
Pass? Two or three days?
She'll be fine.
Just add some fiber
to your diet, and let nature take its course.
He's not worried about me.
He's afraid his wife will notice
his wedding ring is missing.
Oh.
There's nothing we can do?
I could try an endoscopy.
I don't like the sound of that.
It's where we stick a tube
down your throat.
I got to get to work.
Honey, I need my ring!
Yeah, well, I need my job.
I'm on stage in an hour.
And my bowels ain't for sale.
Oh, please, Ginger, Ginger...
Dr. Lewis, Abby's ready for that vag bleed in One.
I called registry to fill in for me.
You're leaving?
I'm on my second dose of Compazine.
I'm still puking.
Honey, I ain't doing that.
Five hundred.
Hey, much would you charge to stick a tube down
your throat?
You two negotiate.
I'll be right back.
( wheezing )
Frank, are you sick, too?
I ain't praying!
( vomiting loudly )
How many pads?
Two so far.
Started bleeding yesterday.
Hi, Valerie, I'm Dr. Lewis.
When was your last period?
Um, two months ago.
Do you think you could be pregnant?
My parents would freak.
My older sister just had a baby.
Abby, line two, it's your neighbor.
Just relax. I need to take a look, all right?
Joyce?
Okay, wait. What-what-what...?
Hold on, hold on.
What?
Okay, uh, come here, and I'll give you my key and...
Do you have a coat on?
Maybe she's not hungry.
She hasn't had anything in 12 hours.
Come on, Ella, come on...
We could put a little TPN in her line.
Hey, there!
There, she's taking it.
Yeah, you're hungry, aren't you?
Yeah.
Dr. Greene, your daughter's on the phone.
I'll call her back.
Where is she?
At home.
Katherine stayed over.
Did they charge her with anything?
Who?
The police.
No.
Well, what did they do?
You didn't tell them, did you?
Well, I wasn't the attending physician.
Mark, she was in possession
of a controlled substance
that could have killed our daughter.
She wasn't trying to hurt her.
There were just three pills.
I don't think they're going to waste a lot of time on it.
Waste a lot of time?
You know what I mean.
You're already making excuses for her.
No, I'm not, I'm...
Well, you're certainly not doing anything, are you?
What would you like me to do? Huh?
You-You want me to have her arrested?
You think Rachel should go to juvenile hall?
You think that will make things better?
I want you to do something.
You haven't even bloody well called her mother.
I've been a little busy with Ella...
There's a phone.
She's in court all day.
No, no, you're avoiding.
Even now you're refusing
to deal with a problem you should have handled
way before this ever had a chance of happening.
Are you blaming me for this?
( baby crying )
Oh, damn it!
Her stomach's just upset.
Trauma Two. Have fun.
I'm going home before it starts coming out of both ends.
No, no, no, wait. Who's working the desk?
Personnel is sending a temp.
Frank, I'm already down four nurses.
Abby is coming back
I called for reinforcements
but this is going to get worse before it gets better.
Anybody who ate one of those bagels
and that damn cream cheese
is going to be blowing chunks.
Excuse me.
( vomiting loudly )
I ate one of those bagels.
I'll add your name to the class action suit.
Oh, my God.
Joyce, I thought you said you were just locked out.
He came back.
He left, and then he came back.
Where are your shoes?
I just started running.
I hid down the street until he left again.
Okay, let me see. ( whimpers )
Joyce...
Can you just let me inside?
It's freezing out here.
You need to come to the hospital.
I'm okay.
No. I have to get an X ray.
It's not as bad as it looks.
Yes, it is, Joyce. Your cheekbone's broken.
( groans ): Pulse ox is 82 on two liters.
No, not you, too? Yeah, I had the garlic.
No breath sounds on the left.
Let's go with a chest tube.
Am I dying?
The icicle collapsed your lung.
Pressure's down to 70.
Oh, God, this is it...
Squeeze in two liters of saline.
I'll put in a tube to reinflate it.
WEAVER: I reached
Dr. Kovac-- Mark's coming down
until he gets here.
No, leave him alone. We can handle this.
I have to go home.
No, if I'm working a double
you're not stiffing me after a few hours.
No, I really
have to go home.
Wait... wait!
You ate the bagels?
It's a teaching hospital.
I'd still prefer you to do it.
Mm-hmm...
Hey, what's your mom doing in there?
I thought he was an orphan.
You should at least be supervising her.
I can see her from here.
John, something's wrong. He's coughing up blood.
Well, they gave him a blood thinner.
A little hemoptysis is normal.
This isn't normal.
Did you hit the lung?
No, I slipped it right in the subclavian.
Pulse ox is 95.
Let's bring him up to two liters.
Is he thrombocytopenic?
30,000 this morning.
Ah, pretty low for a central line...
They transfused him right after the treatment.
Please stop debating it and help him!
( vomiting )
What do his other coags look like?
He got platelets, cryo, and FFP.
John, he's in pain. Help him. Two of morphine?
Pressure's low already. Don't want to bottom him out.
You can always add more blood in.
Sure, blood in, blood out.
( boy sobbing )
Let's page Dr. Neiser.
CBC, PT/PTT, portable chest and a blood gas.
And call the blood bank
have them prep another ten-pack of platelets.
Get an X-ray. Let's check placement.
How you doing there, Mick?
Are you having any trouble breathing?
( pounding )
Mom.
Mom... what are you doing?
I can't.
Please, take care of him...
No, the only reason I'm here
is 'cause you asked for my help.
I can't see him in that kind
of pain, not again...
What did you expect?
I don't know.
You cannot get this kid's hopes up
and then leave.
You're really going to do this?
You're gonna drag me back here
and then bail when it gets too tough?!
The kid does not think
he'll have to go through this alone again; don't leave him!
Thank you.
OLBES: She was by herself at an all-you-can-eat buffet.
Acute onset, shortness of breath and wheezing at a restaurant.
( moaning )
Are you allergic to any foods?
Did you give epi?
It got worse as we pulled up.
Go upstairs. I got this covered.
I saw the board.
You're getting buried.
I'll close to trauma.
It's bad enough that you're stuck with my shift.
It's not a problem.
( wheezing )
Are you sure that you've never had any asthma
or trouble breathing before?
All right, put her on a pulse ox
and get respiratory down here.
What were you eating?
Shrimp and lobster.
Shrimp and lobster?
Where do you keep the pulse ox cables?
Second drawer to the right.
Did you eat a lot?
( gasping ): Uh... huh.
50 of benadryl, 125 of sol...
( wheezing )
Solumedrol?
Yeah, IV now.
And let's get a crash cart ready.
6.5 ET and a 2 mac.
No, really, Mark, I got this.
Ella's doing great.
Okay? She's sleeping.
I need the distraction.
They're not here.
Well, then, try next door.
GREENE: Okay, she's not moving air.
Let's get her on a nebulizer, push one cc...
Where are the pulse ox cables?
Who are you? Registry.
Uh, outside, third
supply cart to the left.
You know, most of the time we totally click
we totally get each other.
He makes me laugh. Okay, sit back.
He's considerate.
Okay, that's good.
And then...
other days he's just a different person.
He... becomes a different person.
Chin up.
And then I become a different person.
I know he's all the same man.
It's just... hard to walk away from the good part.
You have to hold still, Joyce.
95% of the time, he's my best friend--
my husband.
( metal clanging )
That's hard to walk away from.
Well...
looks like he answered your ultimatum.
I didn't have a chance to give it.
I think he answered it all the same.
Yeah, well, how long's that going to take?
Look, this isn't just any patient; this is my daughter.
Yeah, call another neurologist if you have to.
I want that EEG read.
She smiled at me.
That's good, right?
She's smiling?
Yes. That's good.
I was thinking about taking one at a party.
They were in my bag. I forgot about it.
I'm so sorry.
I know there's nothing I can do
to make it right.
You can leave.
You can pack up your things and leave my house.
I... I have to call my mom.
Then call her.
Dr. Lewis, I need a facial lac repair in Two.
Simple or complex?
She's going to need a couple of sub-Q
and I'm waiting on a facial series.
Okay, send her over to CT and clear this hallway.
Why is there a pregnant woman squatting
in the hallway?
I don't know, but I need you to see her.
Susan! Uh, yeah, in one second.
( scoffs ): Who's running the desk?
That's Bouser from Accounting.
Oh, of course, that makes sense. Dr. Lewis...
One second.
She's never been allergic to anything.
Shellfish allergies come on suddenly
especially with large amounts.
This is Dr. Lewis. I'll be right back.
She's wheezing. That'll go away, right?
Dad, I talked to Mom.
Mom says she'll buy the tickets.
You just have to drive me to the airport.
Slow down. No one wants you to leave.
Elizabeth does.
No, you've just got to give her space
for a few days, okay?
Once everything's okay
with Ella... No, she told me to leave.
You talked to her?
Upstairs. She wants me out of the house.
You caught her at a bad time. I'll talk to her.
No, it's okay, Dad. I understand.
She's not my mother.
And she cares about Ella, and I hurt her baby.
I don't want to cause you any more trouble.
I should just go.
You're not going anywhere, Rachel.
Mom says I should go home
if Elizabeth doesn't want me here.
Your mom's not here and she doesn't...
( groaning ): Ow!
Are you okay?
Um, listen, um...
just go home and we'll figure this out tonight, okay?
Dad...
Rachel, please, now.
LEWIS: How long has she been overweight?
JUDY: Just recently-- she put on 15 pounds
in the last couple months.
Oh, uh, okay, well, I can send a nutritionist
to come speak with you if you'd like.
Yes, please, I can't seem to stop her from eating.
Well, we'll move her to another room.
And we'll monitor her breathing for the next couple hours.
Thank you. You're welcome. I'll be right back.
Hey, what happened?
Oh, I bit my tongue.
Oh, you did
a really good job.
How's Rachel?
I don't know. Let me see.
Oh, I just need to keep pressure on it.
Come on. Stick your tongue out.
( sigh )
You bit it on the right side. I can't see when you do that.
Do what?
Stick it out straight.
I did.
What?
Well, it's-it's not so bad.
Just keep applying pressure.
Why didn't you call for backup?
What do you think you are?
Clear the rack. I'll take the fast tracks.
Dispo the pityriasis in Three. Please.
What? I've been flying all night.
Flying all night was your choice
and it's not my fault you answered your phone.
Lower GI bleed in Five.
LOCKHART: Dr. Lewis, CT shows a non-displaced
zygomatic arch fracture.
Is she worthy to be seen yet?
Luka's here. Give it to him.
Hey.
Hey.
You're back.
Yeah, this morning.
I was getting worried.
I thought I'd at least get a postcard.
You need to get e-mail.
Didn't take you long
to get sucked back into this insanity.
No, but it's good to see you, though.
You, too.
How long you been on?
I was supposed to be off an hour ago.
Joyce Westlake.
Her husband beat her up this morning
broke her cheekbone.
LEWIS: Don't let me open them.
Good strength.
Check the lower branches.
Show me your teeth.
Nice and symmetrical.
Okay, blow out your cheeks with air.
Fine. Cranial nerves
two through 11 intact.
But not 12.
It's an isolated dysfunction of the right hypoglossal nerve.
It's a recurrence.
You don't know that.
I couldn't say "solumedrol."
I do that all the time.
Especially if I haven't had my morning latte.
JARVIK: Pedes MVA rolling up.
Airbag burn.
Okay, in a second.
If you're worried, get an MRI.
Yeah.
Mark, it could be a lot of things.
You're under an enormous amount of stress.
I'll check it out.
You could have inflammatory changes
from your tumor vaccine.
Airbag? First and second degree.
BP's 110/70.
He was in the front seat?
We were in a rush.
You don't put kids in the front seat.
It was just the parking lot.
Hey, Mark, we're good. Luka's here.
Good, well, I got this one.
And you can get out from under it.
Any medical problems?
Hay fever in the summer.
Okay, let's start with a lateral c-spine.
( humming )
What are you doing?
I'm on a break.
Hello! We're getting killed here.
I still get a break.
Where is she?
Uh, what?
Did you bring her here?
Joyce?
Yes, Joyce.
Um, no, why? Come on. I know
she stayed at your apartment last night.
I know you picked her up this morning.
So stop lying to me, okay? Okay, I know you beat the crap
out of her. Did she tell you she swung a bat
at my head? Right here. You want to feel?
No, thank you. Just tell me what room.
You're kidding me, right?
You know, it's really none of your business.
I thought you figured that out.
Okay, you want to see her? Fine, I'll take you there.
She's talking to the police. I'm sure they have
a couple questions for you, too.
KOVAC: Abby, can you get me the slit lamp?
Yeah, sure. I need to check for hyphema.
Who was that?
The husband.
Any belly pain?
Soft, nontender.
Needs a BP, titrate four of morphine.
Probably corneal burn. BP 120/50.
All right, we need alcaine
fluoroscein and a woods lamp.
What exactly is alcaine? And where do you keep it?
Mark.
Can you get gentamycin ophthalmic from the pharmacy?
Didn't you get my page?
Uh, I got a page from neurology.
Yeah, I was in neurology looking at your daughter's EEG.
You got this?
Yeah.
Let's coat the facial burns with Neosporin.
Any spikes or sharp waves?
Nope. Normal K complexes and spindles throughout.
Good, good, that's a good sign.
Yeah, for now.
You missed the consult.
I thought you were only going to be
down here for half an hour.
They got swamped down here.
Swamped?
Yeah.
What?
Your daughter's in the PICU, Mark.
Yeah, breathing on her own, showing signs of all reco...
You just run away, and you leave it all up to me.
Look, you know what? I'm going to go home.
I'm going to shower. I'm going to change my clothes, okay?
Be careful, 'cause the evil daughter's there waiting for me.
Just go upstairs and sit with your baby.
You told her to leave.
( sighing )
She asked me what she could do.
You're serious?
I'm perfectly serious.
I can't do that. Can't do what?
I can't turn her away, not now.
What has to happen, Mark?
Does she actually have to succeed in killing her?
Elizabeth...
No, no!
This time I'm doing something.
She's out.
I am not choosing between my two daughters.
You don't have to. I'm choosing for you.
And what am I telling her by letting you ship her away?
That she needs to grow up.
That she needs to take responsibility.
That what she does has very real consequences
for people besides herself!
She realizes that. Do you think she would actually hurt Ella again?
Either she's out of the house by the time I take that baby home
or I'm not taking that baby home!
Hold on, calm down. Take a breath
before you start issuing ultima... She's my child, Mark!
I know that! She's mine, too!
Then start acting like it!
Ma'am, we're trying to help... You called the cops?
Well, he fractured your face. No, he didn't.
What did you think I was going to do? No, he didn't even touch me.
We just need to know where we might find him.
Did you check the University?
Abby, no! That's a big area.
He's not at the apartment.
Sometimes he hangs out at a bar down the street.
I don't want to press charges.
It's called The Windbreaker. It's on Fourth and Ashland.
There's obvious signs of abuse, ma'am. It's not up to you.
Abby, tell them no. Tell them not to do this!
We'll check it out. Call if he shows up
here again. Thanks.
He was here?
Joyce, you need to sit down... What did he say?
...and let the doctor finish stitching your head.
We're going to find you a shelter
someplace anonymous where he can't hurt you.
I don't want to go to a shelter. I want to go home!
What if you have a kid with him?
Is this what you want for your children?
You want him to beat them like he beats you?
He wouldn't do that.
Oh, wake up, Joyce!
This is it.
This is your chance to get away, right now.
It doesn't matter how wonderful he can be sometimes.
If you go back now, you're telling him
it's okay to do this to you, and it is not okay.
It's not okay.
Your car's here.
I managed to get a flight to Logan
but I'm on standby.
Can you imagine?
I'll call you from the Cape.
I'm sorry.
John, I really am...
Kids, you know...
They get over stuff.
I bet if you went back, Mickey would forget about today
as quickly as he can down a milkshake.
No, you were right.
I became too involved.
I'm thinking maybe I wasn't right.
You see that tree?
You and your brother built a fort on that big limb
and you played Tarzan.
Bobby played Tarzan.
I played Cheetah.
Hmm...
You fell down and you sprained your wrist.
And you never even thought about telling me that he pushed you.
You knew?
You two had your secrets.
You stuck together.
I saw no reason to pull you apart.
I didn't spend much time
thinking about how your brother's death affected you.
I didn't spend much time on anyone.
Do you have time now?
I won't betray another little boy.
Betray?
You don't want to give up hope.
You can't.
Hope is all either of you have.
Your brother believed me when I told him he'd get better.
It didn't matter where he was
how he felt
what the doctor said.
I told him he'd get better.
He died believing me.
No.
He was pretending for you.
That was another one of our secrets.
I was supposed to not let you be sad.
I was supposed to make you forget.
To make you happy.
He made me promise to make you happy.
( voice breaking ): I'm sorry, Mom.
Oh...
I love you...
Do you hear me?
I love you!
( sobbing )
LOCKHART: Uh-huh.
Well, if there's no money, it should be fairly...
( buzzer sounds )
Can you hold on one second?
Yeah?
MAN: Campanelli's. I got your pizza.
Come on up.
If there's no money
it should be fairly straightforward, right?
Well, there's a counselor there, isn't there?
Well, talk to her tomorrow.
I don't know. I guess you just go
and get what you need when you know he's not there.
( knocking )
You know, you did the right thing, Joyce.
Okay, can you hold on one second?
We, uh...
we like this place, too, good fettuccini.
I'm going to have to call you back.
Where's the delivery guy?
Oh, I got it. It's on me.
No, that's okay.
Where do you want it, over here?
Yeah, that's fine.
We were still planning on inviting you for dinner.
Brian...
Listen, I screwed up.
I have a problem. I need to get some help for it.
But I love my wife.
I just have these strong feelings.
You know? And that's not an excuse.
And she might not talk to me.
And I understand I don't deserve to have her forgiveness
but I just want to tell her I'm sorry.
County social services can get her a letter.
So, she's in a group home or something?
I can't talk to you about this, Brian.
I just want to make sure she's all right.
She will be.
Just tell me where she is. I promise I won't hurt her.
I think you should leave now.
She's my life.
Don't you get that?
She's everything to me.
You can't take her away from me.
I didn't.
Abby, please, where is she?
No.
Where is she?!
All right, listen.
You have to leave right now, or I'm going to call the police.
And I'm pretty sure you're not interested
in talking to them again, right?
You're right.
I'm sorry.
Good night.
( knocking )
Brian! Brian!
( groans )
( siren approaching )
Oh, my God.
( siren wailing )
( sobbing )
Did she recommend a diet?
Did she talk to your parents?
My mom.
Tim is my stepdad.
Well, I know it'll be hard at first
but if you start eating better, you'll start feeling better.
I know I'm fat.
I don't care.
Well, I'm glad you're comfortable with your body.
That's very important.
But you've put on
a lot of weight in a short amount of time
and that can cause some serious health problems.
And you know, you'll be going to high school soon.
You'll be interested in boys...
I don't like boys.
Well, you say that now, but trust me
in a couple of years you'll want a...
No, I won't.
I hate boys.
Why?
Why do you hate boys?
Do you have problems with boys?
With men?
I don't want boys to touch me.
Ever.
Ariel, when did your mom
marry your stepfather?
OLIGARIO: Dr. Lewis, we need you.
In a second.
Was it within the last year?
Three months ago.
Dr. Lewis
it's Abby. She was assaulted.
What?
KOVAC: Pupils are four millimeters and reactive.
How long were you passed out?
I don't know.
What happened?
My neighbor got pissed
because I sent his wife to a battered women's shelter.
Follow my finger with your eyes.
The guy that came here today?
Chest is clear.
He's your neighbor?
Yeah, he wanted to know, uh, where we placed Joyce.
Good bowel sounds. Any belly pain, Abby?
Not really.
And he knows where you live?
Obviously.
Ow!
Tender at the right costal margin.
No, it's my nose.
Oh, sorry.
Um, can I get a gown?
Right here.
Okay, head and facial CT.
CBC and dip a urine, and titrate up to ten of morphine.
No, Tylenol.
Abby, you may have broken your nose.
Yeah, I don't want any narcotics.
At least take some Vicodin.
Just Tylenol.
Six-centimeter contusion
medial aspect of the right thigh.
Did you get kicked?
I don't know. Maybe when I fell.
Is there a chance you were raped?
No.
No, I don't think so.
Set up a lighted speculum and rape kit.
No, I was unconscious. I wasn't in a coma.
We just need to be sure.
Did she eat?
Just passed out.
Have you?
What?
Eaten.
No.
Go. I'll take her.
We need to talk.
No.
I don't want to discuss it anymore.
Not tonight.
LEWIS: Okay, just one more swab.
A little vaginal aspirate.
And we're done.
Have you had intercourse in the last 72 hours?
No.
No signs of abrasion.
No signs of trauma.
No semen.
I didn't think so.
You can put your feet down.
So, uh
this guy lives on the same floor?
Yeah.
I'd think about moving.
No, I'm not moving. He's moving.
Well, you definitely have a nasal fracture
but it's non-displaced.
So, as soon as the swelling goes down
you'll look as good as new.
CBC's normal
no blood in the urine.
Could have been a lot worse.
Yeah.
You should be careful
about getting in the middle of these things.
You know, I was trying to help the girl.
I did help the girl.
I mean, somebody needed to do something.
Is there someone I can call?
Your mom?
No.
Well, we don't need to admit you.
Is there somewhere you can stay tonight?
Yeah, I'll be fine.
You can't go home. Not until they find that guy.
You can stay with me.
I'm... I'll...
I'm just going to get a hotel or something.
Really, I'll be fine.
Mm-hmm, and do you have your wallet with you?
I'll figure something out.
Abby, stop it.
It's a pullout, but it's comfortable.
It's free
and it's safe.
Thank you.
The radiologist cleared the head CT.
And the facial cuts?
Uh, just the nose.
Was she...
No, no. No evidence of anything
except getting pummeled in the face.
Did they find this guy?
I don't know.
Triage is cleared.
Can you prep the pass-ons?
I still haven't unpacked.
I've lived here five months. I haven't unpacked.
Yeah, bail.
We did catch up.
Yeah, now that you've got
a professional behind the desk.
Jerry?
Dr. Lewis.
They let this place go, huh?
Yeah. What are you doing?
Working.
Since when?
Eh, I've been temping a little bit
since I've come out of retirement.
Where'd you get that?
What? The bagel?
I found it under the desk.
Somebody threw away perfectly good dip, too.
You want some?
Oh, you should go home. Now.
I don't have a problem with you, man, okay?
I have a problem
with you.
You hit women by mistake, huh?
I screwed up.
Let's see you hit me, huh?
Come on.
I didn't mean to. I lost my temper.
Lose your temper with me.
I'm going to go to the cops right now
and turn myself in...
Wait, just wait.
Better start swinging back.
Hold on.
Wait.
I was wrong.
I got angry.
She took away my wife!
You took away your wife.
I know, I know
I know
but I loved her.
She's everything to me and I lost her.
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
I won't mess with Abby again. I won't.
I won't even talk to her.
I'll move.
I'll move out of the building.
Please, I'm sorry.
Please.
You touch her again...
I'll kill you.
