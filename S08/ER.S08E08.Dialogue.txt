ANNOUNCER: We had a break in the system for a couple of hours around noon
but now a second low-pressure cycle...
They clear the Eisenhower yet?
Forget about it.
I swear I took out $40 yesterday.
Are we doing this thing?
'Cause I have a pilonidal cyst waiting for me.
She's finishing her last patient.
Chuni, Wilmont's PTT is 96.
Hold off heparin for an hour
then reduce the rate to 1100.
Okay, after the party.
How long is that?
Five minutes, don't go anywhere.
You may want to stick this in the fridge, it's melting.
I'm still waiting on that L-spine series.
She only had a couple sutures to go.
Does she know we're waiting for her?
No, it's supposed to be a surprise.
Oh. What surprise?
Dr. Finch's last day.
Already?
Yeah, and you owe me ten bucks
for the massage and facial we got her.
It's not here. Can I pay you tomorrow?
Whatever, I offer rolling credit.
Are you backing up?
No, kicking butt-- storm knocked out
six traffic lights south of Division.
Three sets of multiple MVA's all tucked in.
Check it out-- construction on Wacker's all mud.
A crane fell in the river.
Hey, Abby, when you get a chance, I need a repeat CBC
and a Beta HCG in Four.
Where are you going?
Come get me when she gets here.
Me, too.
No. You guys leave, other people leave
and then no one will be here when she gets out.
I have to pee.
Well, then pee.
Gallant-- I got a disimpaction for you in Three
and then go help Finch with her sutures when you're done.
You were going to supervise my first couple.
No, no don't send him, she'll just take longer.
All right, just clean the old girl out then.
Haleh, medical records needs help downstairs.
I don't work for medical records.
The basement is flooding.
They're losing charts...
Well, then call housekeeping.
...payroll.
Be right there.
Dr. Weaver. Yeah.
Michael Gallant. I'm a third year on E.R. rotation.
I know. Frank, did maintenance get sandbags
out in the Bay yet?
I doubt it. Okay.
I didn't see any. Well, call them.
I don't want water coming through the doors again.
And then you can help Haleh.
Can I talk to you about this warning letter?
Be specific. I write a lot of letters.
Well, I had to miss journal club last night.
I had another commitment.
Well, we all have a lot of commitments.
E.R. conferences are a requirement of your rotation.
Is she here yet?
Hey, Abby, can you call telecom?
The switcher is in the basement
and I don't want our internal lines going down.
You know their number?
Find it.
Well, I had a mandatory exercise involving my scholarship.
Financial aid offers multiple assessment meetings.
No, no this is Army Reserve duty.
Oh, okay, all right.
Just review the notes.
So you'll remove the letter from my file?
Yes. Give me a schedule. Dr. Weaver
stab wound to the abdomen
en route. Five to ten depending on traffic.
Prep Trauma Two
break out a cutdown tray
and page surgery.
So, did I miss the cake or what?
We're still waiting for her to finish her shift.
A messenger dropped this by for you.
"Genetadine Labs."
What, are you having yourself cloned?
Genetadine-- that's the cloning place, right?
They mainly do DNA analysis.
Yeah, cloning.
Hi.
Hey.
You need something?
No.
I said, "Any history of heart disease?"
No, you didn't. Yes, I did.
No, you didn't. Yes, I did.
Mark, do you get Spiral CT's to rule out P.E.'s now?
Hold on. How many heart attacks have you had?
Just one. Angioplasty fixed me right up.
Angioplasty?
Till this morning when I woke up, that is.
So, instead of seeing a doctor
you stayed on your feet all day, directing traffic.
Aren't you a doctor?
Now it's too late.
What, I'm going to die?
No, I just meant
any damage you did to your heart is already done.
I'm going to be okay though, right?
I need you to stay overnight for observation
and stay on the monitor.
No, we're still doing VQs
because they keep promising us a better scanner.
Uh, what kind of bedside manner was that?
The idi has had an MI after stenting
and he stands out in the rain for eight hours.
I don't think yelling is going to help.
It might.
You know, you might want to think
about getting out of the E.R.
Oh, that advice is only
about nine years too late, but thank you.
No, seriously.
You never use to talk to patients like that.
I've had an epiphany.
ABBY: Dr. Greene, Medivac coming in
diverting from Children's-- near drowning.
Did he arrest?
I don't know, but he must be pretty sick
if they're flying him in this rain.
It's supposed to be a surprise.
I hate chocolate mint.
Yeah, I didn't pick it.
You think I should stick around?
Yeah, they're going to gather everyone again soon.
Hey
you're not supposed to see that.
I'll be upstairs.
Page me if anyone needs me for anything.
I'm sure that we will.
Uh, Carter, isn't it?
John Carter?
And you would be...?
The girl by the pool.
Oh, right, yeah.
The one without the answering machine.
It broke in the move.
I haven't had time to go shopping.
Well, that's convenient.
Hey, I called you.
Did not.
Yeah, I spoke to your manservant-- Harry?
Henry? The night butler?
He didn't say anything about it.
Uh-huh.
You can get voice mail.
And you need to get better help.
Are you volunteering?
Any benefits?
Well, there's the outfit.
Dream on.
Hey, Carter.
Hey, how'd it go?
He did good.
A couple pounds of stool. He only gagged once.
Yeah, those old ladies can surprise you, huh?
Yeah. How do I know when I'm done?
You'll develop a feel for it.
Chuni, where's the stab wound?
Should be here by now.
Call dispatch, make sure it's rolling up.
Gallant, you're with me.
Don't worry about it.
It'll only hurt for a day or two.
Do you think I'm mean to the patients?
Only the ones who deserve it.
What about the ones who don't?
You're nicer than I am.
That's not much solace.
Sorry.
Oh, my God!
I distinctly heard him.
Who?
The weatherman this morning.
He said, "Partly cloudy, chance of rain."
Well, he warned you.
12-year-old boy.
One story fall and near drowning.
Moderate respiratory distress
crackles on the right.
What's his name?
Daniel. Daniel, you having trouble breathing?
I let go of him.
Who? Joey.
I couldn't hold on.
His brother. They were
playing by the river.
Where is Joey?
Rescue's still looking for him.
All right, let's slide him out.
Ah, here it comes. ( sirens approaching )
( siren fading )
Must be a police car.
Does it usually take this long in the rain?
It shouldn't.
Do you need a jacket?
No. We won't be out here long.
I can go get one for you
if you... I'm fine.
Okay.
Sorry I haven't looked at your file.
You're, uh, military?
Yes, ma'am. U.S. Army Reserve.
ROTC?
No, I did a year of active duty.
Now I'm in a scholarship program.
Oh. So working the E.R. might not be so crazy to you.
Well, I think it's a whole different kind of crazy, ma'am.
There you are.
I was upstairs looking for you.
No, listen, I need to see you.
Yeah, I'm going to pick up my son
and I'm driving to your office.
Well, if you're not there, then I'll get another attorney.
You're damn right, I'm upset.
You told me not to...
You told me not to fight this thing.
Now Roger is going to try to hang me with it.
Fine.
I'll see you in a half an hour.
What happened?
The DNA analysis shows
that I'm not Reese's biological father.
Oh, God, Peter, I'm so sorry.
I told myself a long time ago it wouldn't matter, that I'm his father.
I'm not going to let that son of a bitch change it.
Well, hold on, I'm going with you.
No, they're getting ready to throw a party for you.
I don't give a damn about a party.
Let's go.
Frank, where the hell is this thing?
What thing? Cleo, are you done?
I'll come back to say good-bye.
What happened to the stab wound?
I don't know. I was sloshing around downstairs, remember?
I'm going to bill you for these shoes.
Find out what happened, see if it got diverted.
Dr. Weaver, it's here.
24-year-old female pedestrian
hit by a car in the crosswalk on LaSalle.
Can you tell me your name?
Jill. He hit my dog.
Probable LOC. GCS 13.
B.P.'s 100/70.
Pulse 95.
Where were you stabbed? What?
Dude, she was hit by a car.
Hey, where's the stab wound?
What stab wound? Get her inside.
Your dispatch needs to get it together.
We didn't know you were coming
and the one we're waiting on is
over a half an hour late.
FRANK: Dr. Weaver
Unit 37 got slammed by an SUV at a downed intersection--
Ashland and Western. Who's 37?
Our stab wound. Pickman.
Rescue's trying
to cut them out.
I better go help. Is she okay?
I don't know about the driver. Sounds like the
pregnant woman's in bad shape. The stab wound's pregnant?
And bleeding.
Okay, wait! Wait!
I'm going with you.
What, you're leaving?!
She could be abrupting.
Have Carter cover my cases.
I'll be right back.
What do I do?
Get in.
( sirens blare )
( grunting ): I couldn't... hold onto him.
Daniel, I need to listen.
He's retracting.
ABG, decreased on the right.
BP's 80/palp.
Did you get a hold of the parents?
I think the firefighters did.
Well, get on the radio and make sure.
Oh.
Sucking chest wound. Abby
Vaseline gauze and elastoplast.
Chest tube tray and page surgery.
Daniel, you've got a hole in your chest sucking in air
every time that you breathe, okay?
We need to plug it up, all right?
BP's 110/70, still no sats.
You ready?
Yeah.
Okay, that should be better.
Did they find Joey?
I don't know.
That's what we're going to ask the firemen.
Please, you've got to find my brother.
Relax, everything's going to be okay, all right?
Ten blade.
Stay close to me and watch where you're going!
You okay here?
Yeah. Both airbags deployed, but he has a bad seat belt sign.
Sir, do you know where you are?
In the middle of the street.
Blake had a flail chest.
We just moved him to Mercy, but Pickman's stuck
in the back with an open tib-fib.
Is she conscious?
Yeah, but her patient
might be hemorrhaging.
Okay, listen to his lungs on the way in.
You might need to needle him.
( sawing )
Okay, got it.
You okay, Doris?
Uh, I messed up my leg pretty bad.
It's open
but I got a pulse in the foot.
I had to move it myself.
LOPEZ: Ma'am, I need you to stand back.
I'm an emergency physician
from County. Good for you.
Stand back.
We need to open up this can.
You help us.
What's the status of your patient?
One, two, three.
A 28-year-old-woman
eight-months pregnant, mugging victim.
Ah! Son of a bitch!
You okay?
I cut my hand!
Gallant, help them!
WEAVER: Do you have vitals?
Okay, again! One, two...
BP 90/60.
...three!
Did you give yourself anything?
I couldn't reach the bag.
WEAVER: Get her out, then titrate
ten of morphine. I got the board.
Get the C-collar.
What's her name?
Vicki.
Vicki, my name is Dr. Weaver.
Where are you having pain?
All over.
( screaming )
Can you see the bone?
Careful. Careful.
Does it feel like
you're having contractions?
( electrical crackling and humming )
Brody!
No, don't touch him!
Gallant!
Brody! He's Not respnosive. Get a monitor and lets roll him. Checking for corated,
He's not breathing.
No pulse.
You know CPR?
Start compressions.
I'll do it.
No. I need you to check on that woman.
He's in my unit!
Check on her.
Zadro, I need the defibrillator
and an ambu bag.
Coming.
Come on, breathe.
That was stupid. That was really stupid.
You could have both been electrocuted.
Stop.
I'm sorry. It was instinct.
I told you not to touch him.
You're okay as long as your feet don't touch the ground.
It's raining. Water conducts electricity.
I'm all right.
You were lucky.
Still no pulse.
Bag him.
Charging to 200.
She's okay.
The tires are insulating the rig.
I can't get in.
That hot wire keeps lighting it up.
Is she conscious?
Yes. She's in labor.
You go back and tell her
she's going to be okay.
He's one of my men!
Do it.
300. Clear.
He's venting.
Got it.
Got a rhythm?
Intubate him.
100 of lido down the ET until you get a line
then two milligrams a minute.
Please call my husband.
Hang in there, honey.
We're going to get you out of there.
Vicki, it's Dr. Weaver again.
Did you feel a shock?
I don't think so.
Is he breathing?
We got him back for now.
Vicki, tell me if you're bleeding from your vagina.
The baby's not moving!
I need you to feel down there
and tell me if you're bleeding.
( screaming )
Hold on.
I'm coming in.
I can't let you do that.
Her baby's probably in distress.
First rule of an accident site--
Don't create more casualties.
Casualties?
Hey, they're not showing a fault
in the power grid.
LOPEZ: It looks like a fault to me.
What can I tell you?
Hey, I told you
not to do that!
Just turn the damn power off!
Did you hit your head at all?
Did you lose consciousness?
I don't know.
I just remember walking into the street
then seeing Gordon lying in the rain.
Gordon?
Her dog.
B.P.'s 100/40.
He kept scratching at the door.
I had to take him for a walk.
LEWIS: Breath sounds equal.
No hemotympanum, but I want to get a head CT.
Is this the hit-and-run?
He didn't stop?
HALEH: Pulse ox is 94 on four liters.
OFFICER: Miss, can you describe
the car that hit you?
It was silver, I think.
You sure?
No... ( groans )
Does that hurt?
Yes.
Did you take my dog to the vet?
I'm afraid your dog died.
CARTER: Okay, full trauma panel
c-spine, chest, AP pelvis, foley.
Let's give her ten of morphine, too.
LEWIS: Hemocue is 9.8.
Let's get an ultrasound before CT.
Dr. Green is using it next door.
Go see if he's done.
What kind of dog was he?
Um, he was a terrier mix.
Yeah, those are the best kind.
You know, he probably went really fast.
No dorsalis pedis pulse.
Get me a doppler.
A little fluid in Morrison's pouch.
Dr. Greene, can we have that when you're done?
It's all yours.
Page pedes surgery.
Another crit in 20 minutes.
You want a cath'd urine?
And a CPK, and another portable chest.
Daniel, you're doing much better.
We just need to keep an eye on you
for the next couple hours
just in case you need any surgery.
He's dead, isn't he?
What?
Joey. He drowned.
I don't know.
They're still looking for him.
He didn't want to go.
Where?
To the river.
He was scared, but I called him a baby.
You didn't know this was going to happen.
He's only six.
Parents are on their way.
They're really going to hate me now.
LOCKHART: They're going to be happy that you're safe.
It should have been me.
Watch the monitor; his heart's irritable.
Okay, looks like regular sinus rhythm.
Okay, let's go!
Shut the door!
Okay. Okay.
Hey, stay clear of that rig!
( woman screaming )
It's okay, it's okay. Is she okay?!
Hypertonic contractions!
B.P.'s dropping 68/40!
That's way too low, right?
What?!
Nothing, Vicki.
I need you to be quiet.
I just need to listen.
What was that?!
The power line!
( crying )
Fetal heart tones are 70.
Is that bad?!
GALLANT: Maybe the transformer
will blow out and kill the line!
( labored yelling )
Dr. Weaver!
I need your help!
Can you get in here safely?!
Yeah, I'd have to jump!
Okay, then jump.
( Vicki yelling )
Got it.
Search through the cabinets.
Find me an amp of cardiac lidocaine.
Lidocaine?
Just do it.
Vicki, your placenta is detaching.
It's bleeding into your uterus.
( sobbing ): Oh, God!
Hey, I told you to stay away from this damn vehicle!
She's bleeding out!
Why is the power still on?!
There's a crew on the way!
The only way to stop the bleeding
is to deliver your baby surgically.
It's too early!
No, it's not.
36 weeks is full term.
( sobbing ): Take me to the hospital!
Honey, I want to, but I can't right now, all right?
Shut it off from the plant!
It's supposed to burn through on its own!
They need to override it at some panel!
Vicki, Vicki, I need you to listen to me.
I'm an emergency physician.
I'm trained to perform a c-section
only after the mother has died
and in about 15 minutes, that's what's going to happen.
Meanwhile, your baby is in danger.
But I might be able to save you both
if we take the baby now, and stop your internal bleeding.
Are you willing to take that risk with me?
( sobbing ): I think so.
Are you sure?
( electricity crackles )
( sobbing )
You've observed a c-section?
I haven't done O.B. before.
So you'll be ahead of the curve.
Lidocaine.
You know how to take a blood pressure?
Yeah.
Okay, take one.
I need it every couple of minutes.
( sobbing )
Squeeze that saline bag
and find me every four-by-four and bandage we have.
( screaming )
Okay, Vicki, Vicki, hang in there.
I'm going to give you a shot in your spine
that will numb your belly and legs.
( screaming )
All right, find me a ten blade.
That's a scalpel.
When's the last time you've done this?
Peter, the DNA test was inevitable.
There has to be a precedent.
Not in a custody battle between two men without genetic ties
to a child they both helped raise.
Stepfather versus stepfather.
I'm not his stepfather.
I'm his father.
Sorry. Father.
Until Carla died
Roger never questioned that Peter was Reese's dad.
Carla put my name on the birth certificate.
And if she were alive
Carla couldn't contest the paternity.
But Roger can? Ironically, yes.
Peter, you are going
to have to allow Roger to resume partial visitation.
No. No way.
As we speak, Roger's attorney
is drafting a pretrial motion
for visitation until this is resolved.
If you don't stipulate now
you will lose that hearing, and be painted as the heavy.
I'm the heavy?
He's trying to take my son from me, and I'm the heavy?
You need to be seen
by the judge as someone
who's only interested in Reese's well-being.
I am.
Good. Then you need to listen to me.
You have to stay focused on the end game
and not let anger or fear
impede that goal.
Vicki, stay awake.
I need you to stay awake.
B.P.'s dropping 50, I think.
Spike another liter.
What does "spike" mean?
Take the pointy end of the bag and hang it up.
Hey, you!
Firefighter!
Lopez!
Lopez, I need more light!
Scotty! Scotty, turn up your brights!
Get out of the way.
I need you over here. Get out.
You're doing a vertical incision?
Yeah. Be ready with that hemostat.
We're going to clamp the big bleeders
and pack off everything else with gauze.
All right, here we go.
I need you to put your hands there and pull back.
Where?
Just do what I do from the other side.
( moaning )
Vicki, do you feel that?
I just... I'm just so groggy.
Okay.
Okay, fascia's exposed.
Okay, separate the rectus
down through the fascia.
All right, more retraction.
Okay.
Pull back.
( groggily ): Is that my baby?
Hang on, hang on, Vicki.
Okay. I'm into the peritoneal cavity.
Here's the uterus.
Give me the scalpel.
You want me to let go?
Scanner One will be ready in ten.
Let's add on a chest.
Jill, they're going to take you upstairs now
and they're going to scan your whole body
for other injuries.
I want you to tell the nurse
if you need any more pain medication, okay?
Okay.
Sorry about your dog.
What?
"He probably went really fast?"
She was upset.
She could have solid organ rupture.
The dog is the least of her concerns.
It can be traumatic to lose a pet
especially if you saw it happen.
What was his name?
Who? Your dog.
Happy. He was a lhasa apso
and he got run over by a car when I was 11.
Oh. Did he go really fast?
No-- crushed his pelvis.
Someone drowned?
Brother of the boy in Trauma Two.
Oh, sorry.
Did they find him?
Not yet.
Damn it, you can't leave anything around here.
What?
Some derelict stole my Palm Pilot.
Maybe you just misplaced it.
No, I had it here two minutes ago.
Dr. Carter!
Alger. Alger, what are you...?
It's your grandmother.
Again? What happened?
I found her in the driveway in the rain.
She may have broken her hip.
Get a gurney!
She said she slipped
but there's a cut on her head.
She was driving?
She went out during the break in the storm.
Gamma?
John, it's terrible. It hurts.
Okay, I know it does.
Just lay still.
( yelling )
Did she pass out?
Her right leg is shortened and externally rotated.
I think I broke my hip.
I think you did, too. What happened to your head?
I thought it was best if I drove home.
I didn't realize how much I was bleeding
so I slipped on the driveway.
You were in an accident?
Well, I-I don't...
It was raining.
I couldn't see.
I think I hit a dog.
Where were you, Gam?
Where were you driving?
It was supposed to be clear.
It was supposed to be sunny.
The autorecloser's stuck open or something.
He's trying to bypass it.
I don't care. Just shut it down.
It ain't that simple, lady.
Damn it. What?
I cut a uterine vein. Another clamp, now!
BP's dropping, 60 systolic.
Keep squeezing the saline.
Doesn't she need any blood?
I don't have any blood.
All right, fundal pressure. What?
Push the baby down towards me from the top of the uterus.
Okay, right here? Okay. Yes, yes.
Now, is the other ambulance here?
Pulling up.
Call County General.
Tell them we need an OR, an OB attending and a neonatologist.
Grab the bulb syringe.
Okay.
Suck out his nose and mouth.
Is he supposed to be that blue?
Is there an exit wound?
Sure is. Blew off his boot.
Transthoracic current pathway.
You saw it happen?
He lit up like a Christmas tree.
Mark, I need the room. Post-arrest electrocution.
What's open with a monitor? Come on.
He's a fireman.
All right.
Daniel, we got to shuffle you to another room.
CK's normal.
Tox screen tested positive for marijuana.
Marijuana?
KOVAC: C-spine, chest, pelvis.
You were smoking dope? I'm sorry.
You're sorry? For getting high and taking Joey out
to the river in this weather?
I didn't smoke today.
I knew it, I knew it.
We saw the river on the news. We just wanted to see it.
We? Joey's six years old.
He said he wanted to see it.
Oh, you're going to blame it on him now?
No, it's my fault.
You're damn right, it's your fault.
All right, hold on. Hold on. I'm Dr. Greene.
We need to get Daniel into a room
and then I'll come back out
and brief you on your son's condition.
I'm sorry, Mom. Have you heard anything
from the fire department about Joey?
Not yet. They're still searching.
It's between each clamp, right?
Yes. Okay.
Vicki, Vicki, are you still with me?
Is that my baby?
Yes, honey, you have a boy.
( baby cries faintly )
He's crying.
You hear that? He's crying.
It could be stronger.
You need to get a heart rate.
Okay, ten minutes.
They're going to shut the entire grid off.
Why can't they do it right now?
They have to warn emergency facilities
they're going off-line.
Okay, it's 88, I think.
You think, or you know?
It's 88.
One minute APGAR, seven out of ten.
It'll get better, right?
You need to wrap him up.
Okay.
He needs fluids, oxygen, maybe blood.
But you said we didn't have any blood.
You need to get him to the hospital.
Nine minutes.
Vicki?
Vicki, wake up.
Damn it, she's exsanguinating.
I have to... I have to clamp off the uterine arteries.
Oh.
Okay, I'm going.
Get out of the way.
No.
It's this, or I throw him to you.
No, no, tell him to stop.
Go! Blow by O2 at 15 liters. Have the paramedics start
an IO line if his heart rate drops below 80.
Is he okay?
I got him.
Okay, get him out of here, go!
Come on. Let's go, go, go.
The transformer just blew.
Does that mean the circuit's dead?
I'm going to sew this up
and you won't feel anything.
You okay?
I see a lot of fathers who come in here.
And they're upset when their kids are hurt or missing.
Sometimes they say things that they don't mean.
He's not my father. He's my stepfather.
Joey's their real kid.
And that makes you...?
A pain in the ass.
MRS. PENDRY: Did it come back?
What?
You were waiting for a chest X-ray.
Right, uh, lungs re-expanded.
Tubes in a good position.
I'm repairing the chest laceration now.
Mom?
So, he's fine?
For now. He'll need to be monitored in the PICU.
Mom, I'm sorry.
You shouldn't have been out there.
I know.
Mrs. Pendry...
Why'd you take him there?
You didn't think.
You never think. I-I know.
I should have been the one that drowned.
It should have been me.
Yes.
But it wasn't, was it?
Mrs. Pendry?
It was Joey.
Mrs. Pendry?
I need to talk to you outside.
In here.
( clears throat )
What are you doing?
My son is missing. No one can find him.
Right, and your other son is in there
who needs your comfort, needs your love.
This is none of your business.
You want him to feel responsible?
Guess what. He already does.
You want him to blame himself, to hurt? He already hurts.
You want him to hate himself? Keep it up.
They found him.
What? They found him.
He's stuck downriver. Is he all right?
I don't know. They're trying to get to him.
It'll be okay, Peter.
Yeah.
We don't know that.
I see you two together.
I know.
Hey, hey, hey.
What'd you do that for?
You wanted to?
( knock at door )
Are you expecting someone?
Yeah.
Peter.
No, no, Peter. Get your foot out of my door.
This doesn't have to go any further, man.
Get your foot... Look, look, please.
Just hear me out, okay?
Come on.
Look, Reese lived under my care
and my roof for most of his life.
All I'm asking for is some kind
of arrangement that recognizes that.
It's too late for that.
Look, come on, brother.
You really want to put him through a trial?
I'm keeping my son.
I guess I'll see you there.
Yeah, you will.
( TV plays indistinctly )
Swiftwater 43, County General waiting.
Open channel two.
Is he alive?
I don't think they know.
Frank, call the burn unit.
Brodoff is going to the OR for a fasciotomy first.
Is that your electrocution?
Compartmental pressure is almost 60.
Otherwise, he's lucky.
Does anyone want anything from the store?
It's pouring outside.
Malik and Yosh don't like the coffee in the lounge.
It hurts their stomach.
Grande Vanilla Cappuccino.
It's okay. It's on me.
Okay, he's in arrest. In that case, Venti.
But they're flying him in. ETA, 15 minutes. No cinnamon.
Does he have a pulse? PEA.
Luka, our new med student's coming in, BOA.
Weaver opened up a pregnant woman
trapped in an ambulance.
What do you mean "opened up?"
C-section. In the field?
She's going to have some explaining to do.
Can I get you something, Abby?
Nope. Cigarettes?
( beeping )
Uh, no, thanks.
What's that?
What?
What time is it?
7:00.
What's wrong? Give me your bag.
What? Let me see inside your bag.
No.
Hey, Frank, what are you doing?
My palm pilot alarm goes off at 7:00
to remind me to take my Vioxx.
Come on, let go of her bag.
After I see inside.
Frank! Where is it?
Fabulous.
First you steal it. Then you break it.
That's not yours. The hell, it isn't.
I'm calling the police. Wait, hold on.
This is a mistake.
Oh, yeah, yeah, my stuff just leapt into her bag.
Nicole?
And it's not just me, pal.
She's ripping off everybody. Ask Abby.
Nicole?
GALLANT: I need some help here.
Newborn.
Luka, the baby.
Dr. Weaver says he might need a transfusion.
Is he premature?
No, we gave him O2 in the ambulance, but he needs an IV.
Elevate her leg. Cycle the Dynamap.
Tilt the monitor toward me. I got it.
Hey, hey, I said I got it. How bad is that hand?
It'll keep.
Sats are plummeting. She's not moving air, Doc.
Stop! Airway box.
I thought you had to move her.
I need to protect her airway. Cricoid pressure.
There, cover.
Exposed flexor tendon.
You're going to need a hand surgeon.
I need to control the scene.
Get somebody else. All right.
I'm in.
Bag her.
Let's go.
Draw a milligram of epi
and have atropine standing by.
Get in.
No, I'm good.
No, you're not.
Go on, get out of here. Come on.
You know, people think
kids don't listen to their parents, but they do.
And if they tell you you're nothing
you think you're nothing.
How cold do you think that water is?
I don't know. 40?
Hope it's colder than that.
Did you get a pulse?
No. No pulse.
No spontaneous resps.
GCS 3 for real.
How long was he under?
I don't know.
We found him tangled in some debris about a mile
from where he fell in.
I thought it was P.E.A.
No, asystole the whole flight.
Hey, Gamm.
Does it still hurt?
On a scale of one to ten...
It hurts, John.
She had the full amount?
In two doses.
Let's give her four more of morphine.
Okay, but I'll put her on the monitor.
Well, Gamm, you definitely broke your hip.
Oh.
Looks like an impacted fracture
of the femoral neck.
Please, speak English, John.
I need to get a more sophisticated scan
to determine if you need surgery or not.
I should have listened to you about the car.
I'm sorry.
Gamma...
I think you hit more than just a dog.
You also hit a young woman.
She's okay.
We're taking care of her here.
I called Mr. Stearn
in case you need an attorney.
I hit a girl?
Yeah. ( knocking )
I left. I drove away.
You didn't know.
Well, I should have checked to see.
Oh, my God. No, Gamm...
Gamm, you were confused.
Okay? It's crazy out there. Visibility is terrible.
I'm going to be right back, and when I come back
I'm going to take you for that scan.
What's wrong? What-what is it?
Nothing. It's just another patient.
Page surgery. I need a hemocue.
What happened?
Dropped her sats in the elevator. 88.
Any chest pain?
No, just passed out.
BP's 80/60.
Oh, I can't see the cords.
I need a Fiber-Optic scope.
All right, ABG.
Set up the ultrasound
and mix up 7,500 units of heprin.
There's a lot of fluid in here.
It could be pulmonary edema.
If we're lucky.
Grab the thomboylics box.
DIC panel, troponin, CK, EKG and a portable chest.
Let's go!
Two large-bore IVs.
Nuke the saline in the microwave.
Get that collar off him
and we're going to need a bear hugger.
Coming.
Oh, God, he's blue.
Okay, number five-and-a-half uncuffed ET tube.
Suction.
Still no pulse.
Asystole on the monitor.
Joey. Wake up. Baby, wake up.
Ma'am, you need to back up.
Oh, my God.
What is that?
What is that?!
River water.
Cords are closed.
I need a Fiber-Optic laryngoscope.
Prep the neck.
I might have to crike him.
Daniel...
get back to bed. I'll come get you.
ABBY: I can't get a line in
and he's totally clamped down.
GREENE: Two cut down trays.
Daniel.
Now! Lily, can you...?
You heard him! Out!
Get out of here!
You, too.
What?
Out!
Cross and match her for six units
two units FFP, stick her and send the clot.
Is the O.R. ready?
Oh, they're waiting for you.
Have an emergency C-section.
Yeah, no kidding.
I can see that.
Coburn called me screaming when she got the page.
I told her she must've heard wrong.
28-year-old woman trapped in an ambulance
abrupted and hemorrhaging.
Yeah, and E.R. docs
don't perform C-sections until the mother arrests.
Well, she will if we don't get her upstairs.
BP's up to 90.
Okay, have dopamine standing by.
Add a coag panel.
I got it from here, Kerry.
Go back in the E.R. and stay dry.
Don't want you dying of pneumonia
before your public flogging.
I could have let everybody die.
Yeah, well, that would have been the safe play.
Now, if she lives, you're a hero.
If she doesn't, I don't know you.
The baby.
Chuny, where's the baby?
He's pinking up.
They're waiting for the NICU fellow.
Nice save, Dr. Weaver

Hurry up. She's going to arrest.
I'm in. I think.
Sats are falling.
There's too much edema.
Is Mark done yet?
I need that Fiber-Optic.
No, you're in the stomach.
What are you doing?
I'm going to try to suction the cords.
Deflate the balloon.
Keep it in, you'll have a better shot.
No, just here.
Pull it back, really slowly.
All right, go.
Slowly, slowly.
A little more.
All right, there are the cords.
Give me the tube.
We're in.
Open the crash cart.
Draw one of atropine and an amp of epi.
Come on, hold on.
Hold on.
HALEH: 89. 90.
Pulse ox is climbing.
Good breath sounds.
Nice work.
ABBY: Saline's running.
Dilute two migs of atropine and one mig of epi down the tube.
How high does the temp go on that vent?
40 centigrade.
Set tidal volume at 200 on 100%.
Still no pulse, and no pressure.
That's all right.
Keep warming him.
Got to get that foley in.
We're going to irrigate the bladder.
We're going to save this one.
You want me to...?
No, no. He can stay.
Cycle the lavage fluids
repeat the temp, max out the blower.

Looks like P.E.A.
That's good.

We will.
Pacing pads.
Good lung sounds.

Bingo.

GREENE: Wait and see.
10 blade.
Hey. It stopped raining.
Impaction with mild or no displacement.
Probably a Type I.
The fracture line traverses
straight from the greater to lesser trocanters.
What do you think, orthopedic surgery?
Depends on the orthopod, but I'd try
to keep them away from her if you can.
One third of the elderly
who go under the knife for these kind of injuries
die within a year from post-op complications.
MAN: She's panicking.
Heart rate's up.
BP's falling. Get her out.
Get her out!
Gamm?
John? John, are you there?
It's okay, I'm right here.
I want to go home.
We're all done.
Not quite yet.
Call your grandfather
to pick me up.
I want to go home.
Grandpa's not here.
Get him.
Grandpa's dead.
Where am I?
You're in the hospital.
You were in a car accident.
Remember, Gamm?
You broke your hip?
Oh, yes.
Of course.
I hit a dog. I hit a dog!
He was in the middle of the street.
Is she okay?
No.
Not really.
That baby okay?
Yeah.
Dr. Greene revived a drowned hypothermic boy tonight.
He came in ice cold and not breathing
no pulse and he got him back.
It was a miracle.
You all right?
What is it?
She's pregnant.
Who?
Nicole.
( groans )
I see.
Is that why she was stealing?
No, that's, uh...
that's a habit.
She doesn't know how to trust people.
Her trusting people isn't really the problem.
Her father kicked her out when she was 16.
She's had to learn to live on her own.
Her father?
She panicked, I-I guess.
I...I don't know.
I was just trying to help her.
I-I didn't think I'd... be with her.
It just happened.
You sure it's yours?
Or that she's really pregnant?
She's not like that.
You don't know her.
Do you?
We gave him what's called an EEG--
which is a brain scan--
and everything looks completely normal.
So, that's good?
That's good.
You're going to get your brother back, Daniel.
T-Thank you for saving him.
You're welcome.
Is my mom with him?
Yeah, they're going to move him upstairs.
Then you're going to be up in the same room soon.
I want to tell you something
but you can't tell any other kids, okay?
Okay.
Parents don't always know what they're doing.
Just because they're adults
doesn't mean they know what's right.
In fact...
some adults are wrong most of the time.
I-I know that.
Good.
Then I want you to promise me something.
W-What?
Don't listen to them.
Don't believe that you're not just as good as your brother...
just as smart...
just as special.
One day they may realize that.
But you can tell them it doesn't matter
because you already knew.
You knew before they did.
Dr. Weaver.
Dr. Romano is looking for you.
The mother came out of surgery.
They had to perform a hysterectomy
but otherwise, she's doing all right.
Crit is stable.
Yeah, I know. Thanks.
He, uh, he also told me
if I'm going to survive medical school.
Well, nobody actually listens
to Dr. Romano down here.
Yeah, I figured that.
It was, uh, it was pretty amazing
what you did out there.
Oh, I was a little out of my element.
You wouldn't know it.
Thank you.
So, why don't you go up and take her baby to her?
Oh, they'd let me do that?
Yeah, it's one of the perks.
She's going to think you're an angel.
Yeah, well, she did almost see me glowing.
Hey, you did great.
I mean, you-you took a risk
stayed focused, listened.
You did what was necessary.
That's an E.R. doc.
Yeah, I was little scared out there for a while.
Gallant, I was scared the whole time.
Right.
The fireman is sitting well in ICU.
He's going to keep his hand.
His cardiac activity is normal.
Good. He got quite a jolt.
We saved everybody, didn't we?
I mean, there are people all right now
because we were there.
Some days are good days.
Yeah. I like the good days.
Enjoy them when they come.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Good night.
