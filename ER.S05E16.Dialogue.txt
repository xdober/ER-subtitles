PREVIOUSLY ON E.R.:
I THINK THESE RESULTS
DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE ACCIDENT.
ALL THIS TIME, I'M WORRYING ABOUT HIV
AND I GET HEPATITIS "C"?
WHY DON'T YOU DO WHAT I DID?
APPLY TO A LOCUM TENENS PROGRAM
FILLING IN FOR VACATIONING SURGEONS IN RURAL HOSPITALS.
THEY PAY YOU A BUNDLE TO STEP IN.
OH, YEAH? WHAT'S A BUNDLE?
EIGHT, TEN GRAND FOR A COUPLE WEEKS.
CAN YOU SAY "FATHER"?
CAN YOU SAY "DADDY"?
YEAH.
Corday: PETER.
MORNING.
HEY. MORNING.
WOW, ALL THIS FOR JUST TWO WEEKS?
WELL, IT'S BEEN 30 BELOW IN NORTH MINNESOTA.
WILL YOU BE THE ONLY SURGEON IN THIS HOSPITAL?
NO. ONE OF THREE.
YOU'RE ALL SET?
YEAH. I MEAN, IT'S TOUGH GETTING REESE SQUARED AWAY.
CARLA CAN'T PICK HIM UP FROM DAYCARE ON THURSDAY
AND THAT'S JACKIE'S ROUGH DAY
BUT, YOU KNOW, OTHER THAN THAT...
WELL, I CAN COVER.
NO, NO, NO.
I COULDN'T ASK YOU.
YOU DIDN'T. I JUST OFFERED.
WHAT ARE FRIENDS FOR?
OKAY. YEAH.
HAVE DR. EDSON FOLLOW UP ON THESE BEFORE DISCHARGE.
THE WEATHER CHANNEL SAID
A FRONT'S MOVING ACROSS THE ROCKIES.
HOPE YOU PACKED YOUR LONG JOHNS.
I'M WEARING MY LONG JOHNS.
PETER. GOOD THING I CAUGHT YOU.
THE LOCUM TENENS FOLKS JUST CALLED.
YOU ARE NEEDED AT ANOTHER LOCATION.
YOUR FLIGHT FOR ATLANTA LEAVES IN AN HOUR.
I'M GOING TO ATLANTA?
YOU'RE CONNECTING FROM THERE TO BILOXI.
I DIDN'T SIGN UP FOR BILOXI.
BILOXI'S WHERE YOU'RE PICKING UP A RENTAL CAR.
THEN YOU STILL HAVE A FEW HOURS' DRIVE TO LAVERNE.
LAVERNE? WHOA, WAIT A MINUTE.
I SIGNED A CONTRACT.
THESE PEOPLE CAN'T JUST SWITCH THIS AT THE LAST MINUTE.
WELL, THAT'S WHAT
THE FINE PRINT IS ALL ABOUT, BUT I'M SURE
IT'S A MEDICAL NECESSITY
AND YOU CAN'T BACK OUT NOW, OR ELSE WE'LL BOTH LOOK
VERY UNHIPPOCRATIC.
BESIDES, YOU'RE GOING TO NEED THE DOUGH
IF YOU ACCEPT THE CARDIOTHORACIC
FELLOWSHIP NEXT YEAR.
YOU'RE OFFERING ME A CARDIOTHORACIC SPOT?
WELL, NOT OFFICIALLY UNTIL MAY, BUT BETWEEN YOU AND ME...
THAT THE MOST PRESTIGIOUS FELLOWSHIPS
ALWAYS PAY THE LEAST?
IT'S LIKE YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE HONORED
TO LET THEM PUT YOU DEEPER IN DEBT.
HAVE A GOOD TRIP.
Woman: I'M SORRY.
IT'S THE RULES.
LET ME UP. I WORK HERE.
PLEASE, MA'AM, I COULD LOSE MY JOB.
I FEEL LIKE AN IDIOT IN THIS THING.
HEY, JEANIE, YOU BEING DISCHARGED TODAY?
YEP. ONE FINAL INDIGNITY.
EXCUSE ME, MISS, I'M RUNNING OUT.
I'LL TAKE OVER FROM HERE, OKAY?
BE MY GUEST.
GO, GO, GO, GO.
SO, YOU'RE LUCKY YOU DIDN'T, UH, BREAK ANY BONES.
YEAH. APPARENTLY, THE WINDSHIELD LOOKS A LOT WORSE THAN I DO.
YEAH. HEY, LISTEN, I'M SORRY ABOUT THE HEP C.
HEPATITIS DOESN'T SCARE ME.
DR. MAKADON THINKS I'LL RESPOND WELL TO THE MEDS.
WHERE YOU OFF TO?
OH, I'M DOING A STINT AT A RURAL HOSPITAL.
AT THE LAST MINUTE, THEY STUCK ME IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE--
IN MISSISSIPPI; A PLACE CALLED LAVERNE.
YOU'RE KIDDING? LAVERNE?
YEAH, YOU KNOW IT?
I HAVE AUNTS AND UNCLES
ALL OVER THAT PART OF MISSISSIPPI
ON MY FATHER'S SIDE; THE MURDOCKS.
I CAN GIVE YOU SOME PHONE NUMBERS.
I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH FREE TIME I'M GOING TO HAVE.
MMM. I HAVEN'T BEEN THERE SINCE I WAS A KID.
I USED TO LOVE THAT PLACE.
OH, YEAH?
I USED TO CLIMB TREES AND GET DIRTY
AND THEY'RE ALL GREAT COOKS.
WELL, UH, I'LL KEEP AN EYE OUT.
LISTEN, IF YOU RUN INTO ANY OF MY RELATIVES
JUST DON'T MENTION MY HIV STATUS.
OF COURSE NOT.
I HAVEN'T TOLD ANYONE IN MY FAMILY.
JUST GIVE THEM MY LOVE.
YEAH, YEAH, SURE.
HEY, HOW YOU DOING?
CAN'T COMPLAIN.
IS THERE A PHONE INSIDE?
SORRY.
MY CAR BROKE DOWN.
I NEED TO CALL THE HOSPITAL IN LAVERNE.
SON... YOU IN LAVERNE.
IS THERE A HOSPITAL HERE?
WHO YOU LOOKING FOR?
OKAY, TAVIUS, THIS LOOKS REAL GOOD, BUT I WANT YOU...
Man: MAUREEN?
...TO KEEP THE PATCH ON IT FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS.
EXCUSE ME A MINUTE.
THIS GENTLEMAN LOOKING FOR YOU.
MISS CHAPMAN, I'M DR. BENTON.
WELL, I'D GIVEN UP.
THEY SAID YOU'D BE HERE YESTERDAY.
I DIDN'T KNOW I WAS COMING HERE TILL THIS MORNING.
YOU'RE HERE FOR A MONTH?
NO, NO, NO. TWO WEEKS.
( half-hearted laugh )
HEAR THAT, LEG?
YOU'VE GOT TWO WEEKS.
I'M A NURSE PRACTITIONER.
I'M SUPPOSED TO STAY OFF MY FEET
BUT ALL THESE PATIENTS KEEP GETTING SICK.
SO, THERE'S NO HOSPITAL HERE?
I MEAN, JUST A CLINIC?
OUR NEAREST HOSPITAL IS 80 MILES, IN GREEN COVE.
WHAT, YOU WALK HERE?
HIS CAR BROKE DOWN ON BARNEY JONES ROAD.
OH, WELL, MY BOY IS GOOD WITH ENGINES.
SONNY?
HE'LL TAKE CARE OF YOU.
IS THE HEAD DOCTOR ON DUTY NOW?
DR. BENTON, YOU ARE THE DOCTOR
AND PLEASE DON'T TELL ME THAT YOU'RE A DENTIST.
OKAY, SWEETIE, I WANT YOU TO KEEP THAT...
I'M A FIFTH-YEAR SURGICAL RESIDENT.
OH, LORD.
( laughing )
SONNY
DR. BENTON'S CAR BROKE DOWN.
YEAH, I SEEN IT.
YOU THINK YOU CAN FIX IT UP?
Sonny: YOU'RE HURTING.
GET TO BED.
WELL, I NEED TO HELP DR. BENTON GET SETTLED.
NO, NO, NO, NO. YOU KNOW WHAT?
THERE ARE ONLY A FEW PATIENTS HERE
SO, UM...
WHAT TIME DO YOU CLOSE?
WHEN THE LAST PATIENT'S GONE.
HAVE YOU EVER PRACTICED MEDICINE?
I CAN HANDLE IT.
Sonny: LET'S GO.
Chapman: ALL RIGHT, SUIT YOURSELF.
UM, WEATHER LIKE THIS, FOLKS SIT OUT HERE
AND YOU SEE THEM INSIDE, AND, UM...
I EXPECT YOU'LL FIND EVERYTHING WHERE IT SHOULD BE, AND...
OH, EVERYBODY, THIS IS DR. BENTON
FROM CHICAGO.
HE'S GONNA TAKE CARE OF Y'ALL.
ALL RIGHT.
WHO'S NEXT?
BENTONS.
I DON'T RECOLLECT ANY BENTONS.
MY FAMILY'S NOT FROM AROUND HERE.
SO... WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU TODAY?
MIGHT'VE BEEN SOME BENTONS OVER NEAR HATTIESBURG.
I BELIEVE IT'S SO.
COURSE, THERE WAS THIS SCHOOLTEACHER BENTON
OVER TO WINONA.
SHE WAS A WHITE LADY.
DIED OF CONSUMPTION.
COUGHED HERSELF TO THE GRAVE.
MS. JOHNSON, UH, WHAT IS YOUR COMPLAINT?
( chuckling ): OH, I AIN'T GOT NO COMPLAINT.
NO NEED TO COMPLAIN, AND COMPLAINING MAKE IT WORSE
WHAT THEY SAY.
DO YOU HAVE A MEDICAL PROBLEM?
NO. J-JUST THE BURN.
OKAY, SO, WHERE'S THE BURN?
I BELIEVE THERE'S SOME BENTONS UP OFF THE RIVERFRONT.
OR MAYBE BENDERS.
MAYBE THEY WAS BENDERS.
MMM. BENDERS.
( sighs )
MR. McCOY.
RUTH BLALOCK?
THEY LEFT?
APPEARS SO.
JESSE MORGAN.
THAT'S ME.
I FIGURED I-I'D LET YOU TAKE A LOOK AT MY LEG.
THAT'S OKAY, MR. MORGAN, YOU CAN STAY SEATED.
SORRY IT TOOK SO LONG.
THAT'S A PRETTY NASTY-LOOKING ULCER.
YES, SIR.
I TRIED MUSTARD SEED ON IT.
THAT USUALLY STOPS MY LEG FROM ACHING.
NO, NO, NO, NO.
YOU'RE GOING TO NEED SOME ANTIBIOTICS
AND YOU NEED TO STAY OFF THIS FOOT
AND YOU NEED TO SOAK IT THREE TIMES A DAY
IN WARM WATER, OKAY?
STAY OFF IT?
AND SOAK IT?
Woman: WHERE DO I PUT THIS, DOCTOR?
EXCUSE ME? OH, I'M SORRY.
UH, YOU CAN PUT IT ON THE COUNTER INSIDE.
WE'LL SEND IT OUT TO THE LAB
OR HOWEVER THEY HANDLE IT.
DOES MISS CHAPMAN HAVE A NUMBER
WHERE WE CAN REACH YOU?
OH, MAUREEN TELLS ME ON THE SPOT.
YOU TAKE THIS
IN THE BACK ROOM, AND YOU DO YOUR TEST.
MR. MORGAN.
MISS PEARL.
Chapman: HOW ABOUT THE GREENS?
YOU CAN PICK OUT THE HAM HOCKS.
Benton: NO, THANK YOU.
I'LL JUST HAVE ANOTHER BISCUIT.
AFTER DR. RAJIV-- HE LASTED ABOUT A MONTH--
WE SORT OF GAVE UP.
IT'S HARD TO KEEP A DOCTOR HERE.
WELL, I CAN SEE WHY.
NO OFFENSE.
OH, NONE TAKEN.
WE WAS DOING FINE UNTIL YOU THOUGHT
YOU WAS MORE STUBBORN THAN THAT MARE.
FRACTURED YOUR LEG, HUH?
LIGAMENTS IN MY KNEE
AND HERNIATED CERVICAL DISC.
( crickets chirping )
I GUESS IT'S LUCKY THAT YOU DON'T MIND LARD.
I'M SORRY
YOU MISSED YOUR SON.
WHAT, HAD HE GONE TO BED?
I HEARD YOU SEND YOUR LOVE.
NO.
( clears throat )
MY SON IS DEAF, SO THE PHONE IS OF NO USE TO US.
I'D ARRANGED FOR A VIDEOPHONE HOOKUP
AT THE HOSPITAL IN MINNESOTA...
BUT I GUESS YOU DON'T HAVE ONE HERE, HUH?
MAYBE IN GREEN COVE.
NOW, DID YOU...
SONNY GET YOU SETTLED IN THE TRAILER?
I DON'T WORK FOR HIM.
MAYBE YOU SAW THE MOTOR HOME
BEHIND THE CLINIC.
I'M AFRAID IT'S
A LITTLE COZY FOR A MAN YOUR SIZE.
IT'LL BE FINE.
A-AND TAKE CARE WHEN YOU OPEN THE DOOR.
OR DID YOU GET IT GROUNDED, SONNY?
( glass breaking outside )
DAMN!
TAKE THE BABY'S TEMPERATURE
EVERY FOUR HOURS, AND CALL ME IF...
OR SEE DR. BENTON AT THE CLINIC
IF IT DOESN'T DROP BELOW 100 BY TOMORROW.
THANK YOU. MM-HMM.
BUSY DAY?
NO, NOT AT ALL
SINCE HALF MY PATIENTS ARE COMING HERE.
WELL, IT'LL TAKE TIME FOR... SOME OF THEM TO ACCEPT YOU.
NO, IT WON'T.
I'M NOT STAYING.
YOU DON'T NEED A SURGEON
AND IF YOU'RE GOING TO GET ANY REST
YOU NEED A DOCTOR THAT EVERYONE CAN... ACCEPT.
THIS ISN'T JUST ABOUT RACE.
I DON'T CARE WHAT IT'S ABOUT.
WELL, SO YOU ONLY CAME FOR THE MONEY?
YOU CAN GET BY WITH A NURSE.
SONNY HASN'T GOT YOUR CAR RUNNING.
THAT'S OKAY.
I'LL FIND A RIDE.
( sighs )
SO... THANKS FOR THE RIDE.
OH, BEST REASON WE'VE HAD TO GO TO WORK ALL YEAR.
OOH, OOH, OOH, WHEN WE GET TO THE DOCK
YOU MAKE SURE EVERY WOMAN COMING ON THE SHIFT
SEES YOU GETTING OUT OUR TRUCK.
AIN'T THAT RIGHT, ANNIE?
YOUR JAKE HEARS ABOUT THIS, HE WON'T BE GOING OUT
ON NO BOAT NO TIME SOON.
OOH, AMEN TO THAT.
NOW, TELL ME SOMETHING.
NOW, IS YOU REALLY A DOCTOR?
YEAH.
WELL, TAKE A LOOK AT ANNIE HAND THERE.
BECCA, I'M DRIVING.
GO ON, GIRL, SHOW THE MAN YOUR HAND.
MMM. NOW, HAS YOU EVER SEEN ANYTHING THE LIKES OF THAT?
LOOKS LIKE A PRETTY BAD INFECTION.
AH, IT'S FROM THE SHRIMPS.
THEY GOT POISONS IN THEY HEAD.
IF I WERE YOU, I'D TAKE SOME ANTIBIOTICS.
GIVE IT A REST. GIVE IT TIME TO HEAL.
STOP WORKING?
( laughing )
NOT UNLESS YOU GONNA STOW ME BACK UP TO CHICAGO.
( laughing )
I DON'T KNOW IF I COULD AFFORD TO KEEP A WOMAN LIKE YOU.
OOH!
( laughing )
WHAT, UH... WHAT'S THAT?
WHAT THE HELL?
Man: HELP!
HELP ME!
HELP ME!
RUSSELL! HELP HIM!
SIR, SIR, SIR, LIE DOWN, LIE DOWN.
I'M A DOCTOR.
BRANCH CAUGHT IN THE THROTTLE.
I COULDN'T GET IT OUT OF GEAR.
OH, MY GOD! DON'T MOVE.
RUSSELL. MY BOY. FIND MY SON.
YOUR SON WAS ON THE TRACTOR WITH YOU?
IN MY LAP.
OKAY, DON'T WORRY.
I'LL FIND HIM. HE'S ONLY FOUR.
HE COULDN'T HAVE GONE FAR.
LADIES! OVER HERE!
WHA...?
OH, MY GOD! OH, MY GOD!
I NEED YOU TO DRIVE TO A PHONE!
WAS HE RUN OVER?
NEAREST TOWN'S FIVE MILES.
SIR, DO YOU HAVE A PHONE?
YES. NEXT DRIVEWAY.
GO! CALL AN AMBULANCE!
TELL THEM IT'S A MATTER OF LIFE OR DEATH!
COME ON. COME ON.
( dog barking )
MORNING, DOCTOR.
HEY.
YOU STAYING OFF THAT FOOT?
SOAKING IT THREE TIMES A DAY.
( laughing )
WHAT?
ANYBODY EVER TELL YOU THAT SMOKING WILL KILL YOU?
NAH. YOU THE FIRST.
HEY, ADELINA, YOU BEEN SHOPPING?
WHAT IT LOOK LIKE?
YOU GOT SOMETHING FOR ME?
YOU KNOW SHE DO, HUBERT.
YEAH? A SMACK UPSIDE YOUR HEAD.
( boys laughing )
WAIT. YOU NEVER SHOWED US WHAT YOU GOT.
AND I AIN'T GOING TO.
Shrimp: THAT GIRL CRAZY.
Maureen: YOU KNOW, I THINK
IT'S LOOKING A LOT BETTER, TAVIUS
AND, UH, IF YOU COME BACK IN A COUPLE OF DAYS
I BELIEVE WE'LL BE ABLE TO TAKE IT OFF THEN. ALL RIGHT?
DID YOU DECIDE NOT TO GO?
YOU CAN GO AND GET SOME REST.
I'LL, UH... I'LL TAKE OVER.
SOMEBODY'S WAITING FOR YOU. SALLY?
I'M SALLY MANNON.
WE DIDN'T REALLY GET A CHANCE TO MEET LAST NIGHT.
OH. I SAW YOU.
SHE TOLD ME ABOUT THE TRACTOR ACCIDENT.
SO, HOW'S YOUR HUSBAND AND SON?
FINE, THANKS TO YOU.
I BROUGHT YOU A PIE--
SWEET TATER. I HOPE YOU LIKE THAT.
SWEET POTATO PIE? MRS. MANNON, ARE YOU KIDDING?
THIS IS MY FAVORITE. I'M GOING TO DIG IN RIGHT NOW.
Sally: DR. BENTON GAVE MY BOY OXYGEN ALL THE WAY TO GREEN COVE.
YOU BAGGED HIM FOR 80 MILES?
MM-HMM.
Sally: IN THE BACK OF A PICKUP.
MMM!
THIS IS DELICIOUS.
I'M SORRY. WHOO!
THIS IS THE BEST THING I'VE HAD
SINCE I'VE BEEN HERE.
I GOT TO GO.
GOD BLESS YOU.
MM-HMM.
OH... THANK YOU.
YOU GOING TO STAY, THEN?
IT'S NOT THAT BUSY.
WELL, THAT'S 'CAUSE
I MAKE ROUNDS ON TUESDAYS.
ROUNDS?
HOUSE CALLS.
I HEARD ONE OF THE EBEE GIRLS IS PREGNANT
AND THE EBEES LIVE FAR OUT.
I'M SURE SHE HASN'T HAD ANY PRENATAL CARE.
I HAVEN'T DONE O.B. SINCE... MED SCHOOL.
WELL, NEVER MIND. I'LL GO.
NO, NO, NO. LOOK, I'M NOT
SAYING I WON'T GO.
I'LL GO IF I CAN BORROW YOUR TRUCK.
SONNY HASN'T FIXED MY CAR YET.
YOU CAN'T GET THERE BY CAR.
( laughing )
( engine running )
Woman: WHAT Y'ALL WANT?
I'M DR. BENTON.
MISS CHAPMAN SENT ME TO CHECK ON YOUR DAUGHTER.
SHE DON'T NEED CHECKING.
THAT IT?
ALL RIGHT. HURRY UP BEFORE YOUR PA GETS BACK.
YOU KNOW HOW HE IS.
ALL RIGHT.
SIR?
DOCTOR, SIR, IF YOU DON'T MIND?
I WAS FEELING FAINT YESTERDAY.
YOU WANT ME TO EXAMINE YOU?
MA SAYS YOU CAN CHECK ME OUT HERE.
Sonny: BELIEVE ME...
YOU DON'T WANT TO GO IN.
Benton: WELL... I'M CONCERNED ABOUT YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE.
IT'S A LITTLE HIGH.
HAVE YOU HAD ANY OTHER
PROBLEMS BESIDES DIZZINESS?
UM... A LITTLE BIT OF BLOOD CAME OUT LAST WEEK.
WELL, I'M NO SPECIALIST, BUT, UH...
I THINK YOU SHOULD GET AN ULTRASOUND AND BLOOD TEST.
WHAT'S GOING ON?
UH, PAPA, DR. BENTON IS LOOKING AFTER ME.
WELL, THIS WOULD BE THE DOCTOR FOR YOU, WOULDN'T IT?
SIR, YOUR DAUGHTER NEEDS SOME TESTS.
SHE DON'T NEED NOTHING FROM YOU.
HER BLOOD PRESSURE IS ELEVATED.
MELANIE IRENE, GET ON INSIDE.
GET THIS MAN OFF MY PROPERTY.
MELLY'S HAD ENOUGH HELP FROM HIS KIND ALREADY.
WE'LL SEE WHAT THE AUTHORITIES HAVE TO SAY.
WELL, YOU CAN CALL THE PRESIDENT AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED.
AIN'T NOBODY GONNA TELL ME HOW TO DO FOR MY KID.
R-E-E-S-E.
REESE...
WASH...
WASH YOUR HANDS, REESE.
REESE, WASH YOUR HANDS.
MR. MORGAN?
OH, MORNING, DOCTOR.
I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU TO STAY OFF THAT FOOT.
YOU ALSO TOLD ME TO WASH IT THREE TIMES A DAY.
RIGHT. SO WHAT ARE YOU DOING WALKING ON IT?
NOW, I CAN'T WASH MY FOOT WITHOUT WATER, NOW CAN I?
HAVE A GOOD DAY, DOCTOR.
YOUR GLUCOSE LEVEL IS TOO HIGH.
NOW WHAT DO YOU WANT IT TO BE?
ADELINA, ANSWER THE DOCTOR.
BETWEEN 70 AND 120, SIR.
MM-HMM. NOW, NURSE MAUREEN DIAGNOSED YOU A MONTH AGO.
YOU SHOULD HAVE BETTER CONTROL OVER YOUR DIABETES BY NOW.
HAVE YOU BEEN CHECKING YOUR GLUCOSE LEVEL THREE TIMES A DAY?
DID YOU CHECK IT THE OTHER DAY
AFTER YOU DRANK THAT BOTTLE OF SODA?
ADELINA!
I ONLY TOOK A SIP.
THAT'S ONE SIP TOO MANY, OKAY?
IF SHE DOESN'T KEEP HER GLUCOSE LEVEL
UNDER CONTROL, SHE COULD DAMAGE HER KIDNEYS, HER HEART
NOT TO MENTION GOING BLIND.
SHE COULD HAVE ANOTHER SEIZURE LIKE SHE HAD LAST MONTH.
WELL, IT WAS MY FAULT FOR NOT BRINGING HER IN.
I DON'T THINK TOO HIGHLY OF DOCTORS
SINCE WE LOST ADELINA'S MAMA.
ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT. SO, YOU GOING TO SHOW ME HOW TO INJECT THIS?
NO, SIR.
ALL RIGHT. WELL, I'LL SHOW YOU.
BEEN SHOPPING?
YEAH. THOUGHT I'D COOK SOME VEGETABLES TONIGHT
IF YOU DON'T MIND.
BE FINE.
HOW'D THE CLINIC GO?
ADELINA YOUNG CAME IN WITH A GLUCOSE LEVEL OF 280.
HER GRANDMOTHER CLAIMS THEY HAVEN'T GOTTEN
A SUPPLY OF INSULIN OR GLUCOSE STRIPS.
OH, LORD.
THE GRANDMOTHER DOESN'T UNDERSTAND THE ROUTINE.
ADELINA SHOULD'VE BEEN ADMITTED TO A HOSPITAL
FOR DIABETIC TEACHING.
WELL, THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.
OR TRY A SUB-Q INSULIN PUMP. HAVE YOU HEARD OF THOSE?
SOMETHING NEWER THAN LEECHES?
LOOK... I'M JUST TRYING TO RAISE THE STANDARD OF CARE HERE.
WE SHOULD EXPECT 100%.
I DO, BUT I'VE LEARNED TO SETTLE FOR 60%.
60% IS FAILURE.
IT TAKES TIME FOR PEOPLE...
THEY'VE HAD A MONTH.
ADELINA IS AN ATHLETE
AND SHE'S PROBABLY SCARED TO DEATH
THAT THIS IS GONNA END ALL THAT.
SHE COULD GO INTO A DIABETIC COMA.
DON'T YOU THINK I KNOW THAT?
I... I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU KNOW.
Eli: MAUREEN!
MAUREEN, YOU GOT TO COME.
SOMETHING'S WRONG WITH MELANIE.
SHE'S BEEN A-LABORING AND...
WELL, THE BABY WON'T COME.
DR. BENTON.
NO, I WANT YOU, MAUREEN.
YOU'RE A DAMN FOOL, ELI.
I CAN'T MOVE THAT FAST.
JUST THINK OF MELANIE.
WELL, COME ON.
( Melanie screaming )
OH, SWEET JESUS!
I NEED MORE LIGHT!
THE GENERATOR'S BUSTED.
YOU KIDS GET ON OUTSIDE. GO ON!
OH, MAMA, HELP ME!
OKAY, OKAY. MELANIE, MELANIE, I NEED YOU TO RELAX, OKAY?
I KNOW, I KNOW.
COME ON. I DON'T THINK THE HEAD
IS ENGAGED.
AH, DAMN IT. I FEEL THE FOOT.
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
THE BABY'S UPSIDE DOWN.
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?
I'M LOOKING UP HOW TO DELIVER THIS BABY.
YOU DON'T KNOW HOW?
I'M A SURGEON, NOT AN O.B.
DO YOU HAVE ANY FLASHLIGHTS?
BATTERY LANTERNS.
GET THEM, AND BLOW OUT ALL OF THESE CANDLES.
I'M GOING TO USE ETHER IF I CAN FIND IT.
OKAY, MELANIE, I NEED YOU TO BREATHE NICE AND EASY.
Melanie: I CAN'T.
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO TRY.
WELL, WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING TO HER?
SHE HAS TO BE SEDATED.
IF HER UTERUS RUPTURES, IT COULD KILL HER.
I MIGHT KILL HER MYSELF ONCE I SEE THE BASTARD.
YOU HUSH.
MRS. EBEE, I NEED YOU
TO HOLD THIS BOTTLE OVER MELANIE'S FACE
LETTING IT DRIP INTO THE MASK.
SHE BROUGHT THIS ON HERSELF.
MR. EBEE, CAN YOU READ?
OF COURSE I CAN.
OKAY, GOOD. GO.
I NEED YOU TO READ OFF THIS COMPUTER SCREEN RIGHT NOW.
YOU DO IT, MAMA.
"INSERT
"THE RIGHT HAND
INTO THE KER..."
CERVIX, CERVIX.
OKAY, THAT'S IT. COME ON. GO ON.
"PUSH THE HEAD
"AND WITH THE LEFT HAND EX-TER-NAL
BRING THE RUMP DOWN..."
RUMP...
DAMN IT. STOP.
OKAY, OKAY. GO ON.
UH, "LIFT THE FEET UP
"AND PUSH THE HEAD
"OVER THE PEL...
PELVIS RIM."
DAMN IT.
ALL RIGHT.
COME ON.
COME ON.
ALL RIGHT.
OKAY, I GOT ONE FOOT OUT.
ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT.
THERE'S THE OTHER ONE.
COME ON.
AH, DAMN IT.
THE HEAD'S STUCK.
OH, PLEASE, JESUS.
OKAY, OKAY, OKAY. COME ON, COME ON.
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT. WE'RE ALMOST THERE.
ALL RIGHT. OKAY, STOP THE DRIP.
( baby crying )
HEY...
YOU GOT A GRANDDAUGHTER.
OH, SHE LOOKS JUST LIKE AN EBEE. SEE, ELI?
I SEE.
( baby crying )
MELANIE'S DAMN LUCKY.
HEY, HEY, HEY.
HOW YOU FEELING?
HAPPY.
IS MY BABY OKAY?
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. SHE'S FINE.
( clears throat )
YOU KNOW, FROM WHAT YOUR FATHER SAID
I HAVE TO ASK-- IS THERE ANY CHANCE
THAT THE FATHER OF THIS BABY IS BLACK?
YOU SEE HER BABY.
SHE'S WHITE.
YEAH, I KNOW.
JUST SO THAT YOU KNOW...
A LOT OF AFRICAN-AMERICAN BABIES
DON'T GET THEIR FULL PIGMENTATION
UNTIL A FEW DAYS LATER
SO IF THERE'S ANY CHANCE OF THAT HAPPENING
FOR YOUR BABY'S SAFETY AND FOR YOURS, YOU...
YOU NEED TO LET ME KNOW, OKAY?
( baby gurgling )
Maureen: I GOT WORRIED.
IT WAS A BREECH.
MOTHER AND BABY ARE FINE, BUT...
I'M GOING TO TAKE THEM BACK TO LAVERNE.
NOT IN MY BOAT.
HEY, DOC.
DON'T TAKE OFF JUST YET.
HERE.
THERE'S NO CHARGE.
MAUREEN?
MUCH OBLIGED, ELI.
THAT TOOK A LOT FOR HIM TO OFFER TO PAY YOU.
I DON'T WANT HIS MONEY. THE BABY'S JAUNDICED.
CAN SHE AND THE MOM STAY AT YOUR HOUSE FOR A FEW DAYS?
JAUNDICE USUALLY GOES AWAY.
NO.
EXPLAIN TO THE EBEES
HOW YOU DOING?
I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT.
GOOD.
I DIDN'T COME HERE TO TALK.
COME ON.
MORNING, DOCTOR.
HEY, HOW YOU DOING, MR. MORGAN?
DID YOU DROP THAT BIG JUG OF WATER OFF ON MY PORCH?
YEAH.
I SURE WANT TO THANK YOU
BUT I HAD TO COME TO TOWN ANYWAY.
IF I DON'T SIT IN THIS CHAIR
WHO'S GONNA DO IT?
COME ON.
HEY.
HEY.
YOU'RE ON YOUR FEET AGAIN.
I ONLY GOT YOUR HELP FOR A FEW MORE DAYS.
I THOUGHT MAYBE WE COULD HOLD DOWN THE FORT HERE
AND SEND YOU TO PICK UP FROM THE PHARMACY.
HOW'S THE BABY?
HER JAUNDICE DOESN'T APPEAR ANY WORSE.
MELANIE'S ITCHING TO GO HOME.
SONNY, WHY DON'T YOU GO GET DR. BENTON HIS KEYS.
YOU KNOW, IT'S ONLY BEEN THREE DAYS.
IF THE BABY'S PIGMENT WAS GONNA DARKEN
IT WOULD HAVE STARTED.
PROBABLY.
THAT WAS SMART THE WAY YOU HANDLED EBEE.
YOU KNOW...
YOU MAY HAVE A FLAIR FOR COUNTRY MEDICINE AFTER ALL.
( chuckles )
I DON'T THINK SO.
OH, I DON'T EITHER.
LOOK, I REALLY DON'T FEEL LIKE DRIVING 80 MILES.
ADELINA AND HER GRANDMA ARE WILLING TO KEEP YOU COMPANY.
THE GRANDMOTHER SAYS SHE DOESN'T TRUST HOSPITALS.
WELL, SHE MUST BE SWEET ON YOU.
AND I HEARD THEY HAVE THE VIDEOPHONE HOOKED UP.
MIGHT COULD SEE YOUR SON.
Adelina: BUT DR. BENTON SAID
THE PUMP IS BETTER.
Doctor: I'LL CONSIDER PUTTING YOU ON ONE
IF YOU LEARN TO CONTROL
YOUR GLUCOSE LEVEL
BY THE TIME WE GET THEM.
HOW'S THAT?
I'M A LITTLE MORE CONCERNED
ABOUT ANOTHER FINDING THAT WE GOT HERE.
DR. BENTON...
DID YOU DETECT A PANSYSTOLIC MURMUR?
A MURMUR?
OH, YES, SIR.
WHEN I LISTENED TO HER CHEST
I THOUGHT I APPRECIATED A SLIGHT MURMUR
ALONG THE LEFT STERNAL BORDER.
THE ECHO SHOWS A V.S.D.
WHAT'S THAT?
NO, I DIDN'T LISTEN TO HER CHEST.
SHE'S WAS IN FOR DIABETES MONITOR.
WHAT'S WRONG?
ADELINA HAS A SMALL HOLE IN HER HEART.
A HOLE?
FROM THE DIABETES?
NO, MA'AM, IT'S UNRELATED.
SHE'S PROBABLY HAD IT SINCE BIRTH.
UH-HUH.
SHE SHOULD JUST GET IT REPAIRED
BEFORE IT GETS ANY WORSE.
EXCUSE ME.
WHAT DOES HE MEAN BY REPAIRED?
IT'S A SIMPLE SURGERY.
I'M HAVING SURGERY?
I DON'T WANT HER CUT.
YOU NEVER SAID I NEEDED SURGERY.
I MISSED IT.
DR. BENTON...
CALL'S READY.
EXCUSE ME, PLEASE.
( baby laughing )
COME ON, BABY, WASH YOUR HANDS.
OKAY.
Oh... they're actually saying that we've got to go now.
OH, THANKS, ELIZABETH.
UM, JUST FOUR MORE DAYS TO GO.
I'LL BE HOME ON FRIDAY.
He'll be thrilled to see you.
OKAY, REESE, OKAY... I GOT TO GO.
BYE-BYE.
BYE-BYE. COME ON, REESE.
SAY BYE-BYE.
YOU GOING HOME THIS FRIDAY?
WELL, UH, YEAH, BUT DR. BROOKES WILL FIND YOU A GOOD SURGEON.
AND WHAT ELSE IS HE GONNA FIND WRONG WITH HER?
MISS DEANE, I KNOW IT'S HARD TO PLAN AHEAD SOMETIMES
BUT IF WE COULD JUST SET A DATE...
I'LL THINK IT OVER.
YES, MA'AM, I'M SURE YOU WILL.
YOU REALLY SHOULDN'T PUT THIS THING OFF.
WHAT WAS WRONG WITH NEXT WEEK?
I HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IT.
BUT YOU WILL CALL DR. BROOKES, RIGHT?
AS SOON AS I CAN.
THAT TOOK A WHILE.
IGNORANCE, JUST IGNORANCE.
THERE'S NO REASON WHY A KID IN THIS CENTURY
COULDN'T HAVE THAT SURGERY...
WHAT HAPPENED?
THEY FOUND JESSE DEAD
IN FRONT OF SUGGS' STORE
ABOUT AN HOUR AFTER YOU LEFT.
WAS IT AN M.I.?
I MEAN, WHY DIDN'T YOU PAGE ME?
IT COULD HAVE BEEN HIS HEART.
IT COULD HAVE BEEN A STROKE...
OR AN EMBOLISM.
HE SAID HIS LEG ACHED.
I SHOULD HAVE CHECKED HIM OUT.
HE WAS AN OLD MAN, DR. BENTON.
THERE WAS NOTHING WE COULD DO.
GOD REST HIS SOUL.
FUNERAL'S FRIDAY.
I'VE BEEN SAYING
JESSE WANTED TO LAY WITH HIS WIFE
IN OUR CHURCHYARD
BUT HE BORN A CATHOLIC
AND I KNOW HE'D WANT THE SISTER TO OFFER A PRAYER.
WHAT SISTER?
MAY THE ANGELS LEAD YOU INTO PARADISE
AND MAY THE MARTYRS COME TO WELCOME YOU
AND TAKE YOU TO THE HOLY CITY--
THE NEW AND ETERNAL JERUSALEM
AND MAY THE CHOIR OF ANGELS WELCOME YOU
WHERE LAZARUS IS POOR NO LONGER.
MAY YOU HAVE ETERNAL REST.
ETERNAL REST GRANT UNTO HIM, O, LORD.
AND LET PERPETUAL LIFE SHINE UPON HIM.
AND MAY HE REST IN PEACE.
GOOD-BYE, JESSE.
AMEN.
All: AMEN.
YOU'S A LIAR... YOU DO NOT.
I DO TOO.
YOU JUST STICK IT AND PUSH THE INSULIN.
THAT'S RIGHT.
ADELINA THINKS MAYBE SHE GONNA BE A DOCTOR HERSELF ONE DAY.
HUBERT.
THAT'S WHAT YOU SAID.
SO, WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT?
ADELINA WILL MAKE A FINE DOCTOR.
I CHANGED MY MIND.
OH, YEAH, WHY IS THAT?
'CAUSE DOCTORS ACT LIKE
THEY KNOW EVERYTHING WHEN THEY DON'T.
YEP.
WE MAKE MISTAKES.
I MADE A MISTAKE WITH YOUR DIAGNOSIS.
BUT I LEARNED SOMETHING.
IT'S BECAUSE OF YOU.
I AM SORRY, ADELINA.
THAT'S OKAY.
IF YOU'RE THINKING OF ARGUING WITH GRANDMA DEANE
I'D SAVE MY BREATH.
ADELINA NEEDS THAT SURGERY.
I JUST CAN'T LEAVE.
WELL, I'LL WORK ON HER.
SHE'LL COME AROUND.
FINISH PACKING?
MM-HMM.
I APPRECIATE YOUR STICKING IT OUT HERE.
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.
WHAT?
WELL, MAYBE NOT BY
CHICAGO SURGEON STANDARDS
BUT YOU TOOK GOOD CARE OF LAVERNE.
I LOVE THIS TOWN.
I GUESS THAT'S HARD FOR YOU TO UNDERSTAND.
YEAH, WELL, I'M NOT THE MISSIONARY TYPE, YOU KNOW?
I NEVER DID WELL
WITH A DOCTOR OVER MY SHOULDER.
THIS IS A GOOD PLACE FOR A NUN
WITH AUTHORITY ISSUES.
WHAT'S YOUR SPECIALTY GONNA BE?
I BET YOU GOT THAT FIGURED OUT.
YEP. FIVE YEARS AGO
I DECIDED TO GO INTO CARDIOTHORACIC.
WELL, NO WONDER IT STUNG YOU
TO MISS THAT HEART MURMUR.
WELL, I MISSED IT, TOO.
YEAH, BUT YOU'RE A NURSE.
LOOK OUT, NOW.
THIS LAST YEAR, I'VE BEEN...
I'VE BEEN DISTRACTED, YOU KNOW
WITH MY SON AND ALL.
IT'S NOT EASY RAISING A CHILD.
YEAH, WELL, YOU WOULD KNOW THAT.
OH, I'VE JUST HAD SONNY THE LAST FEW YEARS.
I TOOK HIM IN WHEN HIS FOLKS DIED.
BEING A PARENT'S A FULL-TIME JOB.
YEAH, IT'S HARD WORK, BUT...
I LOVE BEING WITH MY SON.
OH, MAN.
WELL, BEING WITH PEOPLE.
IT'S AS SIMPLE AS THAT, ISN'T IT?
AND WHAT A BLESSING
WHEN YOU CAN HEAR THE SOUND OF YOUR OWN HEART.
HEY, SHRIMP BOAT BLEW DOWN AT SOUTH PORT.
HOW MANY HURT?
I'M A DOCTOR. HOW BAD?

THIS ONE HAS A FLAIL CHEST WITH EVISCERATION.
OTHER ONE HAS A PARTIAL AMPUTATION

LET'S LAY THEM DOWN OVER HERE.
CRAZY FOOLS DIDN'T SECURE THEIR PROPANE TANK.
ROLLED DOWN INTO THE ENGINE ROOM
HIT THE CLUTCH ON THE BOILER-- WHOLE BOAT BLEW.
IF I CAN STABILIZE THE CHEST WALL, HE MAY BE ABLE TO BREATHE.
COME ON, DON'T DIE ON ME.
I NEED THE SMALLEST FISHING FLY YOU CAN FIND AND SOME LEADER.
DOES ANYONE HAVE PLIERS FOR TAKING OUT FISH HOOKS?
GOT A NEEDLE NOSE IN MY TACKLE BOX.
ALL RIGHT, GO! SONNY, ARE YOU WITH ME?

WILL DIE WITHOUT YOUR HELP.
I NEED YOU TO FIND PLENTY OF SARAN WRAP.

WHERE IS THAT ICE?
I GOT SOME FLIES AND FISHING LEADER HERE.

MAUREEN, HOW YOU DOING?
HE'LL LOSE HIS LEG
IF WE DON'T GET THIS TOURNIQUET OFF.
THIS ICE AIN'T THAT CLEAN.
IT'LL DO. LET'S JUST PACK IT AROUND HIS LEG.
HOW'S YOURS HOLDING UP?
I GOT A FAINT PULSE.
THANK GOD FOR SMALL MIRACLES.
WHERE THE HELL IS SONNY?
THEY WOULDN'T GIVE IT TO ME, SO I HAD TO STEAL IT.
LISTEN CAREFULLY. I'M DEPENDING ON YOU.
COME ON, OVER HERE.
I'M GOING TO STABILIZE HIS CHEST WITH THE SARAN WRAP.
WRAP IT AROUND HIM.
HERE WE GO, BOYS, HERE WE GO.
ROLL HIM, ROLL HIM.
LIFT HIM UP. HERE WE GO.
NOW, LET'S GO.
MAUREEN!

I USED IT UP ON THIS FELLA.
I NEED SOMETHING TO HOLD THIS GUY'S GUTS IN WITH.
HOW ABOUT MY T-SHIRT?
YEAH, FINE. TAKE IT OFF.
HERE, GIVE ME YOUR HAND.
PUT IT RIGHT THERE.
NOW, YOU FEEL HIS PULSE?
AS LONG AS YOU CAN FEEL A PULSE, HE IS ALIVE.
IF IT STOPS, YOU LET ME KNOW.
NEEDLE'S THREADED, DOC.
ALL RIGHT, YOU READY?
COME ON, COME ON, COME ON.
I'M GOING TO TIE OFF
THE SUPERFICIAL FEMORAL ARTERY
TO STOP THE BLEEDING.
ALL RIGHT, NOW
