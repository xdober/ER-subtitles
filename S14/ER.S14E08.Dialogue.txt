Previously on ER:
We miss you.
I miss you too.
Brian, why are you here?
I feel like he's not telling me stuff. Yeah.
Come on. Let loose for a night. I'll think about it.
Who wants a drink?
No, we're good. Anybody?
You should really take a cab home right now, really.
I was not aware that I was flirting.
I'm not stupid, you know.
Mr. and Mrs. Riley have legal custody.
It's not going to be for a long time, I promise.
You've been lost?
Haven't you?
GATES: All right, so tell me again.
Who were those weird forest chicks?
The Wilis, they're the spirits of girls
jilted in love, left to haunt the woodland.
And that Macarena thing they were doing?
Oh, they were trying to make the prince dance
until his heart gave out,
but Giselle came to his rescue. Right.
Yeah, well, I guess that happens, huh?
Oh, you don't like ballet. Not about haunted
girls in the woods.
I like sugar plum fairies-- it's Christmassy.
Well, this was actually pretty groundbreaking.
I mean, Gautier created the whole idea
of investing emotion and sincerity in ballet.
Uh-oh, you're one of those smart girls, aren't you?
You've only just noticed?
I've been in denial.
Oh, you'll get over that.
Or else what?
Or else, I'll make you dance
till your heart gives out. Oh...
You know, I have The Nutcracker DVD
back at my place.
It's got bonus features.
How long you been living here?
Uh, two months.
It sucks, huh? Shut up, Kim.
It's not that bad. Yes, it is.
Isn't it, Sarah?
Yeah, it kinda sucks.
Yo, losers, meet our friend.
This is Sarah, she's new. Hey.
New from where? Chicago.
Chicago, that's dope.
I haven't seen you around.
Yeah, I'm not your year. What are you?
Sophomore.
Cool.
It's crazy in here.
I'm gonna go out front.
Wanna come?
(door closes)
Come on in.
It's, uh, very... dark.
Oh, yeah.
Look, I have one of these. Watch this.
Huh? It's nice.
It's not bad.
It's, uh... it's not bad at all.
Is this Sarah? Mm-hmm.
Yeah, that's her at Halloween a few years ago.
You said she lives with her grandparents?
She's a beautiful little girl.
Yeah, she is.
The party's lame.
You want to go for a drive?
Here, give it back if you're not going to smoke it.
Well?
Wait, I'm coming.
I'm coming. I'm coming.
You want some?
Oh, no, I try not to.
I think it's the way God would want it.
Oh, you know, the Rastafarians consider it a sacrament.
I'm very ecumenical.
Mm. Mmm!
What?
Was it something I said?
Oh, no, this was, this was great.
"Great"? It was nice.
"Nice"? You know, it was...
fun.
What did we just do, go to Disneyland?
You rocked my world, okay?
But I don't like sleeping over
this early in a relationship.
Wow. All right, well, just
leave the money on the dresser on your way out.
I still have to go.
(phone rings)
Oh, good, this is my next appointment.
Hello?
Tony, I need you to come!
I messed up. I'm in trouble.
Sarah, what hap-- slow down, what happened? Where are you?
I don't know! I don't know where I am.
Sarah, where are you?! Tony, just come!
I'm kind of busy, Dad. I've been up all night working,
studying for my history midterm.
Yeah, I can tell you look a little worn-out.
Maybe you should just try getting a little more rest.
I just told you I've been up...
Did you not-- did you not hear what I just said?
No, I heard you.
I heard you. Sorry.
I just wanted to check in
and see if, um, you had given any thought
to what we discussed the other day.
If Obama wins, do you think...
do you think there's going to be riots in the streets?
Brian, look, I wanted...
I mean, 'cause, Dad, people have to unify.
Like, you know, right now.
I've been reading about Watts.
I mean, it's just like-- do you remember that, Watts?
Well, yeah, I-I-I mean, I know about it. Yeah.
White America is so racist.
It's... it's such a shame.
Right. I mean, this country, Dad,
is a crock. Yeah.
Look, Brian...
did you see that therapist?
You want the answer to your question, Dad?
Is that what you want to know?
The answer to your putrid question?
None of your damn business.
Okay... I have privacy rights,
which means you need to leave me the hell alone.
Or else you can go to jail.
Okay, okay.
That is not what we're talking about, all right?
What we're talking about is-- I'm just asking you.
I gotta go.
Hey, look... I gotta study.
The, uh, this thing is in, like,
a couple of hours.
I want to go to the gym first.
Okay, but look, son, look,
wait a minute.
Can you just talk to me, son?
Thanks, Dad.
Thank you so much
for your paternal concern.
And Dad? I hope one of your patients
stabs you with an AIDS needle.
So you're back on, huh?
Yeah, I took a few days.
I, yeah, that's, uh, I have a seizure patient.
CT shows an AVM.
I was going to admit to Neurosurgery.
Oh, right, good. Just make sure that you call IR...
I did that.
Okay, good. Thanks.
Hey, look, Abby...
And Grady has a hip dislocation in Three
that he wants to run by you before he sends to, um, Ortho.
Okay.
GATES: She wouldn't go to the police.
She wouldn't do anything till I got to her.
I don't see her.
This guy...
Hey, buddy.
You know who Teri is? I talked to someone named Teri.
You here about the little girl? Yeah.
She's in the back.
It's okay.
It's all right now.
Oh, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Take that.
Hey, I haven't seen you in a few days.
You okay? I'm fine.
Are we okay?
You know, that night outside of Ike's,
it got a little ugly. Oh, that was no big deal.
You haven't been yourself lately, Abby,
and I'm not the only one who's noticed it.
This place is a breeding ground for gossip.
It's not gossip, it's more like worry.
Well, maybe they should worry about themselves.
(sighs)
It's just hard with Luka not here, that's all.
I'm fine.
When is the big Croat coming back?
Well, he was going to try and get a flight out today,
so, hopefully, he'll be here by tomorrow.
Well, that should make things easier.
Yeah, it should.
Marcus Faneca, 20-foot fall from a ladder.
No LOC, complains
of chest and right hip pain.
How'd thIS happen, Marcus?
I was cleaning leaves from the gutters.
BP 100 over 60,
tachy at 120, had two of MS in the field.
Hey, buddy, how old are you?
I'll be 13 in January. Where are your parents?
It's just my father. He's coming behind.
We couldn't fit the chair in the rig with us.
My dad's a paraplegic.
He gave me a sip of something out of a flask,
and started touching me.
Sexually?
Yeah.
It's okay, you can tell him everything.
So I reached down and grabbed something
on the ground, and hit him with it.
Hit him with what?
I don't know.
It was, like, metal,
heavy, kind of like an "L" shape.
A tire iron?
I guess so, maybe.
You hit him with a tire iron?
Okay, Marcus, we're going to sit you up now.
My dad, he might need help...
getting in here.
It's okay, the hospital's wheelchair accessible.
(Marcus groans) A little more morphine?
Uh, no, his pressure's borderline.
Another .250 of saline first.
Small pneumothorax, gonna need a chest tube. Okay.
(groans): Damn it.
Okay, displaced femoral neck fracture, right?
You're asking me?
No, that's what it is.
Okay, I'll get a Hare Traction.
No, I want to try five pounds of Buck's traction.
You sure?
Yeah, Sam, I'm sure.
Sorry.
Hey, pal, I got here as fast as I could.
How you doing?
I'm sorry, Dad.
I should've had the ladder angled better.
Oh, hey, no.
No, th-that was not your fault.
Are you his doctor?
Yeah, I'm Dr. Lockhart.
So... what's the deal?
Well, your son has a collapsed lung.
We're going to need to insert a tube into the chest cavity
to expand it while it gets better.
How bad is that? Is that bad?
Not too bad, it'll heal.
He also has a fractured femur.
What? A broken hip bone,
which the surgeons will take a look at,
and we're going to try to reduce it
under general anesthesia. And if they can't, then what?
Well, why don't we wait for the consult...
Wh-what could happen?
Sir, maybe we should talk out here, huh?
I'll be right back, pally, okay?
I don't think either you or your son
need to be worrying about... What?
Worst case scenario?
Why the hell shouldn't we?
(removes gloves)
Okay, avascular necrosis of the femoral head,
chronic pain, a total hip replacement at a young age,
he never walks normally.
That's what I was afraid of.
Mr. Faneca,
what I'm trying to tell you is, Damn it!
the surgeons should be able to realign
and stabilize your son's leg.
It doesn't need to get to that.
Yeah, like I've never heard that before.
ZELINSKY: Two-layer closure?
Yes. And what else?
Oh, and a psych consult.
The guy's a total nut job.
Right, well, get on it.
By the way, I need to be out of here by 6:00.
It's my girlfriend Lacey's homecoming tonight.
Big deal. Right.
MORRIS: Go, go, Badgers. What?
That's their school mascot-- the Woodland Badgers.
Americans. You ready, stallion? Huh?
You got your moves all worked out?
Wait, wait, okay, let me see.
First, you have the yawn reach-around.
(grumbly yawning)
Nice.
You yawn like a horse.
Oh, then, there's the earnest-emo shoulder hold.
I really, really care about you, Lacey.
Oh, please.
FRANK: Is that even a move?
And finally, the false drop, intentional,
accidental, face-to-face.
(chart thuds on floor)
Oh, excuse me.
How... how clumsy.
Please, you're making me queasy.
I'm letting him have the sex machine for the big night.
Oh, wow, I really appreciate it.
I got it specially detailed.
You're gonna love it.
I thought you were mad at him about your car.
Nah. MORETTI: Haleh.
No more dings, okay?
Can you go man the Triage Desk?
We got a backup in Waiting.
No, but I can "woman" it.
Abby's bitching about where Surge is for her chest tube.
Yeah, we're on our way.
Let her sniff your hand first.
Is there a problem?
Uh, yeah. What?
Abby keeps going like this,
I'm gonna slap her with a colostomy bag.
At least I only have to take it for a few more hours
before I switch over to my O.R. shift at noon.
O.R. shift? Mm-hmm.
It's part of my transpo training
for intubation experience.
Morris, go and supervise, okay?
Uh, maybe you should.
I was just about to see this "swimsuit model
with knee pain after slipping on runway."
I'll take that. You go deal with Abby.
(sighs)
Well, well, look what the cat dragged in.
Hah!
Three centimeter incision over the fifth rib.
Uh... how's that?
Good. (sighs)
Okay, 36 French tube.
RASGOTRA: 36? You mean 28, right?
Right, sorry, 28.
Tunnel over the intercostal space. Uh-huh.
You all right?
Yes, I'm fine. Why?
It's just, a kid under 50 kilos needs...
I know what he needs.
Another vascular clamp.
Make it a curved vascular clamp.
Are you're kidding me? Okay, you know what?
Neela, you want to show off to your little sidekick here,
that's fine, it's all you.
What? What's wrong?
RASGOTRA: Uh, nothing.
Everything's fine, sir.
I stay superior to the rib, right?
Yeah, if you were to go inferior...
I could bag an intercostal artery
and then he'd bleed out.
How old are you?
What I lack in experience, I make up for in enthusiasm.
What? Yeah.
This being my first chest tube ever,
I am really committed to getting it right.
You're kidding.
Is he kidding me?
This is a teaching hospital and Dr. Zelinsky
is a very qualified resident.
Well, I don't want him.
I want someone with more experience.
Her-- why can't she do it?
Uh, hello?!
I thought you were coming home tomorrow.
I caught an earlier connection from Frankfurt.
What? Nothing. I-I...
I just wish you'd told me
'cause I would've taken the day off.
It was a last minute, so I just thought, what the hell,
I'd surprise you. No, it's nice.
Yeah? Yes.
Are you exhausted?
No, I feel good.
I just want to go home and see Joe.
You should definitely go home and see Joe.
I mean, Marnie probably has him at swim class right now,
but they'll be home by the time you get there.
I just wanted to stop by and see you.
The look on your face.
And, uh, I got you something.
You did?
Mm-hmm.
It's, uh, it's licitar.
I know it's corny, but it's Croatian,
and it's what you're supposed to get your girl
when you haven't seen her in a long time.
And since you had a blackout, I thought,
you know, candle...
You know, like...
I missed you.
Oh, I'm sorry. Oops, sorry.
Sorry.
Hi. You must be Dr. Kovac.
Yes. I'm Kevin Moretti.
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you, too.
I hear you've really whipped the place into shape.
Yeah, well, you know, I've certainly tried.
Well, uh... So, how, uh...
was your, uh... Sorry. No, being...
Being chief is a lot of responsibility,
and after we had the baby,
I decided I'd rather spend the time with my family.
Yeah, well, yeah, I mean, it's a tough job, but...
Someone's got to do it.
That's right. Someone's got...
MORALES: I got an open distal tib/fib fracture, contaminated.
Five of morphine in the field.
Okay, you'll excuse me. Yeah.
Okay, nice to meet you. A pleasure.
Nice to meet you, too. Thanks. Bye. Okay.
Well, doesn't seem like such a bad guy.
No, he's all right, I guess.
You called him Mussolini.
(laughs): Yeah.
Okay. I'll see you later.
I'm gonna run by the desk,
I got some souvenirs for the guys.
And when you get home, I have a surprise for you.
Luka.
Hmm?
I missed you, too.
(sighs)
(retching)
Boy, you got some nerve, don't you?
You don't want to start this, Hank. I don't?
Sarah got in trouble, and she didn't call you.
Maybe you should think about that.
Maybe you should think about why she didn't turn to you
when she felt like she needed help.
I know why-- because we have rules here, and discipline.
We don't just let her talk or dress
or do whatever the hell she wants.
BECKY: Hank.
Go finish with the horses.
I can do that later.
Hank.
Sarah's taking a bath.
She likes me to wash her hair for her.
More coffee?
No, thanks, we've got to go.
Let's go, Julia.
Where you from, Julia?
I was an Army brat.
My family moved around a lot.
Mostly the Midwest though.
What part?
Indiana...
and some time in South Dakota.
I got some apples that need peeling.
How are you with that?
Where's your paring knife?
Hey, Abby.
Sorry.
We should talk. We don't need to.
Hey.
Hey, what's going on?
Hey. Uh, Mr. Faneca, I...
Sorry. Excuse me.
I was just reviewing your son's chart.
Yeah, well, where did you go?
You just left.
Well, the chest tube was placed, and I'm here now.
Uh, repeat CBC is back?
Hemoglobin's stable.
Okay. Ortho ready for him?
Still tied up with an open tib/fib.
I'm concerned about his chest pain.
(weakly): It hurts when I breathe.
Take it easy, Marcus, it's going to be okay.
Okay, Harold, I'll try.
Should I repeat the chest X-ray?
Mm... no.
Breath sounds are good, sats are fine, BP's normal.
Try four of MS.
I'll try to get an ETA on ortho.
So it's all good?
Yeah. It's normal to have a little bit of pain
when you have a tube in your chest.
And the morphine should help that.
You know, you-you seem distracted.
Should I ask for another doctor?
Excuse me?
I need you to fix this, get things moving along here.
It just seems like we're wasting time.
Just calm down, sir. We're doing our best.
We really are.
Look, he's my kid, okay?
He's all I've got.
Guys, excellent.
I need a little fashion help here.
You can say that again-- look at your tie.
For Harold.
Which one should he wear to his homecoming tonight?
Go black.
All right, Sam, that's what I'm talking about.
The black's a little short,
and Harold is lankier than he seems.
I was measuring his inseam earlier...
Oh! TMI.
All right, I got to pick up
a coledocojejunostomy for Dubenko.
Greg, what is up with ortho?
We need to get that roof fall kid up there.
They were still working on the tib/fib when I left.
The washout was a little gnarly.
It's going to be a bit longer.
Hey, I heard Luka was here.
You told me he was coming back tomorrow.
Yeah, I know, it was a surprise.
Um, I kind of need to hurry it up, up there.
That's what I've been telling them for the past 15 minutes.
And thanks for taking care of that chest tube.
That was really Harold.
Tell Luka I said hello.
Hey, Benito left this stack of preemptive orders
for you to sign off on.
Where is he now?
I'm not sure-- he went to take a call.
Something about his kid.
You people and your dysfunctional families.
HALEH: Hey, sir, you just can't go in there.
Thank you, luv. A little help, mate?
He's hurt his ankle rather badly.
Uh-huh, and how did you do that?
Cheese-rolling.
Cheese-rolling?
It's an old, rather pointless, pagan ritual
that some of us in the local ex-pat community
periodically reenact. They roll the wheel
down the hill and then you tumble after it.
The first one down wins the cheese.
Morris!
This one is all you!
What can I do for you?
He's hurt his ankle.
Oh, wow-- wait,
are you one of those cheese-rollers?
Yes, I am. Cool, cool.
I've read all about that, let's find you a bed.
Dr. Morris, I heard you were looking for me.
Yeah, go check out that rack over there.
Pick out a suit for tonight.
What? Really?
Wow.
Hey, are you a cheese-roller?
Yes, I am. Sweet.
So, you're the lucky winner, huh?
Enough Double Gloucester for a year.
You must be proud.
He's quite a catch.
(moans)
Well... probably just a sprain,
but I'll get an X-ray
to be sure, give you something for pain.
This won't take long, will it?
We really must be on our way.
We've got to pick up some biscuits and mustard
at the market. I'll get you moving
as I can, "guv-nah."
(chuckles)
On your way then.
Good chap.
Still waiting on ortho?
Yes, Doctor.
Nice suit.
You look... good.
Oh, this? I have a date.
But I wanted to check in with my buddy Marcus
before I sign out for my big night.
You rock, Harold.
Pressure's down to 80 over 40.
What?
(raspy gasping)
Uh, harder to breathe.
Oh, that's not good.
Sats are dropping.
(gasping)
Oh jeepers, subcutaneous emphysema.
(gasping)
Go get an attending!
No,
you-you stay, help them-- I'll go!
What's happening? Marcus, because of your fall,
the air in your chest is leaking
into your neck and torso.
70 over 30.
It's constricting his chest, I need a ten blade!
Come again?
I need to open him up.
He needs more sedation!
No, his pressure won't take it.
And there's no time for a local.
Marcus, this is gonna hurt a little bit, okay, buddy?
I'm scared.
Me, too.
(crying)
(screaming)
Harold! Harold!
What are you doing? Wait!
Oh, my God. Harold!
(screaming)
(crying)
(groaning eases, breathing slows)
Sats at 99, pressure's 120 over 85.
Wow.
(gently): Sorry about that.
Dude.
That's a rental.
Hey, they said you wanted to see me ASAP.
What's going on? Yeah, um...
housekeeping's gonna have to clean up this sink--
it smells like somebody puked in here.
Uh, yeah, okay, I'll get right on that.
Um, I have to go.
Frank is working on getting me a flight,
but I'm gonna go to the airport and just...
wait.
Okay.
Where are you going?
I'd like you to cover the shift.
I know that you've expressed, you know,
uh, the desire for more responsibility
in the past, and, um...
let's use this as a trial run.
Okay?
Oh, okay.
Thanks.
Until when?
I don't know.
Um...
I don't usually...
let my personal obligations interfere with my work--
and-and I expect the same of my staff--
but... I, this, um, there's...
Hey, you okay?
It's my son.
He's having a tough time at school.
He got very agitated during an exam in a lecture hall.
Agitated?
And he accused the kid next to him of cheating.
And then when the professor tried to intercede, he just...
he lashed out at her.
So...
I...
I'm sorry, I didn't realize.
Yeah, no, no, I didn't either.
Maybe I should have.
All right, if there's anything I can do...
Thanks.
All right, that's it.
Okay.
TAGGART: Okay, here goes.
Harold, why don't you get changed
and get out of here.
You mustn't be late.
Are-are you sure?
But Marcus... Yeah, you'll have plenty
of other chances to scrub in on O.R. cases.
Okay, I see the chords.
Tube.
Only one high school homecoming.
Well, actually, it's my third,
but okay, if you say so.
Okay.
I'm in. Nicely done.
Yeah, wow, congratulations,
Sam.
Well, bye, Marcus.
I'll check in on you tomorrow.
Well, it's a night of many firsts.
Let's keep our fingers crossed for one more.
Bye, everybody!
What is taking so long?
You should be to the joint capsule
by now. What?
Kidding.
(quietly): Ortho.
Ten blade to...
Neela. Rasgotra. Trauma.
Okay-- ten blade to her.
Between the sartorius and the tensor fascia lata, right?
Trauma surgeons, so serious,
I love it.
Can we get some tunes going in here?
She's good at that, Tony.
Must have some farm experience.
Only a little.
Oh, fold that right, that's no good.
Did you know Meg, my daughter?
No, ma'am, I didn't.
She was good at her chores,
helping out around the place.
Then she got older,
bored, a little wild.
And she moved away.
She doesn't need to know all that.
No, it's fine.
I'm very interested.
You're here, you seem nice enough,
maybe you can help him understand.
Understand what, Becky?
Sarah's been changing--
talking back, disappearing, having trouble at school.
She's becoming more and more like her mother.
Now we love her--
and we never want to lose her from our lives--
but we're old, and we've been through this once before.
You fought to keep her.
You're the ones who wanted it like this.
The child's not happy here.
She's 13 now, it'll only get worse.
And we don't have it in us
to go through again what we went through with Meg,
all the struggle.
You never thought about this before?
We were grieving for our daughter--
looking for a way to hold onto her.
And trying to do
what we thought was best for Sarah.
We made a mistake, Tony--
but out of the best of intentions.
I don't want to punish her because we were wrong.
Much better.
I knew the black one wouldn't fit.
I told those guys you're lanky.
This is pretty hardcore. Oh, yeah, I like it.
Ooh la la.
Oh, can't be late.
Don't want to keep the little lady waiting.
No, actually, Lacey's five foot ten.
She's on the volleyball team. Okay.
Now, this is for her wrist,
so you don't have to jump into
the deep end right off the bat.
And this is nonalcoholic, but you can always hope
for the placebo effect, right?
I gotta get back downstairs.
My gimpy limey cheese freak is waiting
to get his ankle wrapped.
I... I wanted to show Neela before I go.
All right, but don't dawdle,
or your chances of getting some tonight are gonna be ruined.
Oh, I almost forgot!
Remember, there's a reason we have speed limits.
Come here.
Yeah, yeah.
RASGOTRA: Looks like the perisoteum
flipped into the fracture.
GROSSMAN: And we will flip it back out.
Debakey. First liter of NS is in.
You want me to hang another bag?
Uh, don't bother, we'll be done in a minute.
Whoa!
Whoa! Vascular clamps!
Damn, damn,
damn.
TAGGART: Pulse 144, 78 over 45.
Okay, hang O-neg, saline, whatever we've got.
PVCs. Go as proximal as you can.
Hi.
Something bad's happening.
It appears the, the broken bone injured the artery.
Once they repositioned it,
the tear started bleeding.
It's rare, there's no way the doctors
could have predicted this.
How bad is it?
It's bad. I mean,
the body's entire blood volume can just--
Dr. Rasgotra is a wonderful surgeon, she'll save him.
I thought you had somewhere to go.
Nah.
I'm gonna stay here with you
until Marcus is okay.
I'm sorry, Grandma.
What about?
The way I acted.
Oh, listen here--
you acted the way you needed to, to make me see.
I wasn't gonna see it any other way.
And now, things'll all turn out how they're supposed to.
So no being sorry.
You watch her now.
I'll be coming to Chicago soon, so you be ready.
He's gotta be here somewhere.
May I help you?
There he is!
MAN: Hey!
Aw, man.
You stole my cheese!
Oh, sod off!
I won it fair and square!
Gareth crossed the line first!
Get off him, you plonkers!
We have proof, you little slag! Hey, hey!
Bollocks!
Break, break it up, guys!
Get off!
Ow! Ow!
(grunting)
David Beckham is a wanker!
(nervous laugh)
Just kidding.
Relax. Love the guy.
Terrific.
Okay, until we decide
the rightful...
(grunting)
...owner...
I will be the keeper of the cheese.
Heard he was flying out tonight.
Frank's getting him a flight.
Really?
Mm-hmm. Something about his kid.
Pretty serious, from what I hear.
It must be.
Mind if I leave you to this?
I got to check on Pratt's MI in Three.
Sure. I got it. Okay.
HALEH: See you soon, Dr. Moretti.
Okay. Sure thing, Haleh.
(ambulance door shuts, engine starts)
Take care, Abby.
Kevin?
I hope everything works out.
TAGGART: Heparin's in.
GROSSMAN: All right. Good flow, no leaks.
We were able to stop the bleeding
and repair his artery.
We have every reason to believe he's going to recover fully.
And the leg?
Going to need a few screws,
but in time, it should be as good as new.
(sighs) Awesome.
All right, kid, get out of here.
Are you sure?
I wanted to see if Marcus would...
You-You can talk to him in the morning.
Go-Go to your thing.
Okeydokey, then.
Um, congrats on a successful outcome.
(door closing)
Nice kid, that one.
A little weird.
Yeah.
A little.
GARETH: That's Margaret.
She saw the whole thing. Coming up
right... there!
MAN 3: See? See? See? Gareth won.
LIONEL: He passed out before the finish line!
He didn't. After you pulled me down!
Oh, poor Henry.
They had to cart him off
in a stretcher.
All right, all right, all right.
After careful review of the tape,
I am ruling it a tie.
You each get half.
You're gonna cut the cheese?
(laughing): Well, I mean...
Yes, that's right.
Fine! Split it in two, so I can go home.
GARETH: No! No, no.
He can have it.
The cheese should not be divided.
I would rather see it absconded by a cheater
than be split in half.
I knew you'd cave.
MORRIS: Oh, not so fast.
Gareth, the cheese is yours.
Wait. But you just said...
Uh. According to the wisdom of Solomon,
Gareth has shown himself as the true cheese-lover
and its rightful guardian.
He was willing to forfeit the cheese
rather than see it torn apart.
Oh, thanks for nothing, Doc.
(laughter)
Yeah. What a bunch of gits.
Hey, tossers.
Frank?
Your, uh, roof kid's doing well.
They're moving him to Recovery.
Oh, great.
Oh, well, I... I thought you'd want to know.
Thank you.
Are we fighting?
No. I don't think so.
We're friends, right?
We-We confide in each other?
Yeah, we do.
No. Forget it.
Hey, Neela, hold up, Neela... just...
Uh, look, I know I've been...
I don't know, bitchy or something lately,
but I just hit a rough patch,
and, um... and Luka's home now,
so everything's going to be better.
I'm going to go check on the Fanecas.
Heard he's doing well.
Um, listen...
...I wasn't attentive enough before.
You were right to be angry.
Being angry's kind of my baseline.
I was 28 when he was born,
but I was still a kid myself.
I wouldn't grow up.
I was reckless, out of control.
I had this sweet Ninja ZX-9.
Loved it.
Kayla-- that was his mom--
she was riding behind me the night I had my accident,
holding on around my waist.
When I came to, I saw her
lying on the pavement.
I saw them pull the sheet over her face.
I did that.
One stupid night.
But you're a really good father.
I can tell.
I'm sure that makes up for a lot.
I don't know.
You know, I've just...
I've carried this thing in my gut for so long.
He spends all of his energy trying to make me feel better.
He's my kid.
That's not his job.
You know, you could try to change that.
You know, everybody...
Everybody screws up.
You know, just...
try not to make the same mistake again.
There are some things you can never fix.
(wry laugh)
You can't unring a bell, they say.
No, I guess you can't.
(speaking Croatian)
(laughter)
Hey.
Hey! Hey. Hi.
Uh, so, this is my surprise.
Niko, this is Abby.
Abby-- my brother Niko.
Oh, hi. Wow.
Wow, you didn't, uh, mention that...
After all these years, we thought it was time.
Niko's never been to America before, so...
I hope I won't be in the way.
Oh, no, not at all...
I was just a little bit surprised, that's all.
It's nice to finally meet you.
Hey, uh, Joe's asleep, and we have a pizza coming, so...
Okay, great.
You want some drink?
No, that... I'll get it, thanks.
Um, so your flight was good?
Yeah, the Germans know how to travel in style.
We were lucky to make connection in Frankfurt.
Luka wants to give you a big shock.
Well, he did.
(laughter)
(conversing in Croatian)
Welcome home.
(sighs)
Ow!
(can thuds onto floor)
(quietly): Shoot... Shoot...
(footsteps approaching)
Hey, what are you doing?
(whispers): Nothing. I sp... I spilled.
(whispers): Uh, Niko's almost ready to go to bed,
so we can be all alone, just the two of us.
Okay, I'll be right down.
Okay.
Don't wake him up.
(crying)
(sniffling)
(crying)
(sniffling)
(cries and sniffles)
