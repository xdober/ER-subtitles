Previously on ER:
If you can handle a relationship
with no strings, sex with no commitments.
I'm all good.
These are really beautiful.
It's kind of embarrassing.
Well, I had a good time with you.
I just wanted to let you know.
I'm Simon Brenner.
Seems like a nice bloke.
Is that what you call it?
I quit.
I need something else.
I'm talking about my marriage.
I just... I don't know if I can
face it.
Hi, Sheryl. I'm Dr. Rasgotra.
Four kids. 23 years later, here I am.
You shouldn't have to go through this alone.
It was my choice to end our relationship.
I'm letting you off the hook.
Joe's still asleep.
He had a rough night.
Yeah. How many times was he up? Three?
Four.
You have your interview today, huh?
Yeah.
Are you looking at apartments?
What am I supposed to do?
I told you the truth, and that was not easy for me.
And you know how badly I feel,
and how sorry I am.
We're not doing this now.
What? What do you want? Just tell me.
I swear to God, I don't care what it is.
I'll do it. Did you think coming to Croatia
and apologizing was all it would take?
No, I didn't.
Well, you tell me you were weak,
you screwed up, you broke my trust, you put our son
in jeopardy-- what the hell do you expect?!
I don't know!
I have to get ready for this thing.
We'll talk about it later.
Will we? I mean, that's all I'm asking.
Well, we're not doing to do it now, okay?
Hey.
Hey.
Long time no see.
I know. The shift gods
have been conspiring against us.
Well, I have the perfect solution.
How about a little romantic getaway in Quebec?
Quebec?
It's called the "Little France" of the Americas.
I booked us into a B & B this weekend, and I thought maybe...
Shoot! I made plans to do a wreck dive
in Lake Michigan with the guys.
A wreck dive?
Did I mention it's called "Little France"?
I'll try to get out of it.
Let's talk later, okay? Okay.
Hey, Morris. Doughnut?
Yes! What's the occasion?
Yeah, Gates. I didn't see
any reports of hell freezing over.
Oh, that hurts, Frank.
Well, if you don't want any doughnuts, big guy...
Sorry I cast aspersions on your generosity.
Hey, Sam.
Dr. Gates.
Frank, labs back on my deodorant eater?
Negatory.
Doughnut?
What are you doing?
I'm sorry. You want a jelly?
I thought we agreed to keep this under wraps.
You know, be cool about us.
What? It's a just a doughnut, not a dozen roses.
I bought for everyone.
Sometimes a doughnut is not just a doughnut, okay?
So cut it out.
Aha! There she is!
Miss Croatia.
So how was it?
It was good. Thanks.
And you did actually go this time, right?
Yes, I actually went.
Abby, hey. Have a nice vacation?
Yeah.
What the hell? Damn!
(coughing) You guys all right?
Wow! What is that? Gasoline?
Underground tank erupted in a geyser. Soaked him head to toe.
I tried to cap it off.
We hosed him off at the scene, but the fumes were bad
in the rig. This guy needs to be soaped down.
Call HAZMAT. We can get him cleaned up here.
You two need to be looked at.
Nah. We're fine.
Whoa! Somebody get a gurney!
Hey! Put those cigarettes out!
TAGGART: Reidy, Reidy, are you okay?
PRATT: Is he breathing?
TAGGART: Yeah. Wait, hold on, don't get up.
There's nothing wrong with Internet dating.
So what's the problem?
Well, working in a hospital--
the hours, the intensity-- it can be alienating.
There's no way to date a normal person in the real world.
You don't think that there are doctors online?
Or, God forbid, other hardworking professionals
who might relate even though they've never heard of gentamonium?
Gentamycin.
I'm just saying.
Happiness takes up space.
Everyone has to make room in their life for it.
Not just doctors.
Well, speaking of gentamycin,
the cultures are still negative, which is good.
The fevers could be atelectasis,
so three laps around the ward today, okay?
Cool. Hold on.
I'm posting a profile of you online.
No, you're not.
Yes, I am. I'm pretending to be you.
All right, then.
I... I want a tall, dark symphony conductor
who is fluent in Italian, with abs of steel.
I'm on it.
Hi. How is Mrs. Hawkins?
Still running a low-grade temp.
The graft is infected.
Are you sure?
Well, couldn't that be a hematoma?
No. Not with the stranding and irregular density.
Switch her to linezolid.
We'll take her up to the OR in the morning.
(pager buzzes) Crap!
Well, go ahead and answer that. I'll talk to Sheryl.
No. It should come from me.
It would be weird if it came from someone else.
(buzzing) It's the ICU again.
Look. Let me... let me take care of this,
and then I'll come back and tell her.
Okay. Meet me in the ER when you're finished.
We've got consults piling up.
Hey, we need a line. I got it.
Do I still have my eyebrows?
They'll grow back.
You burn yourself?
Yeah. A little bit.
Make sure you get that checked out.
Yeah, we've got this.
Oh, she's fine.
Sam, you don't need coddling, right?
A human fireball in the ambulance bay.
I love this place.
Sats are good.
Some singed nasal hairs, but the lungs are clear.
We got partial thickness burns
to both the hands. Nothing circumferential.
Burns are minimal.
Maybe five percent BSA.
You got lucky.
We need a doctor on the board.
Brenner's not busy.
Looks like he's about to be.
Who's Brenner? New attending.
Acts like he's God's gift to medicine.
And women. Oh, great.
We can always use another one of those.
All right, Abby, you're with me.
Admit Mr. Sacar to the burn unit.
I want to keep an eye on his airway.
All right.
I've got to say,
I was shocked when Luka quit.
I always thought he'd be a lifer here.
Yeah. Well, change is probably a good thing, right?
Is that why you canceled your interview with Anspaugh?
I didn't cancel it.
I just postponed it, that's all.
I'm going to see what's happening with Luka first.
Abby, you've got 14 candidates going for one attending slot.
It'll be gone before
you get a chance to reschedule.
And, in three months, you're going to find yourself out of a job.
Pratt, I need a doctor here.
I'm on with nephrology.
Got it. Kwan Lee, 19.
He got jumped on the El platform on Addison.
Hi, Kwan. I'm Dr. Lockhart. What happened?
I was waiting for the train.
These guys pulled me off the bench.
Vitals stable.
18 gauge in the antecube.
All right, on my count.
Ready? One, two, three.
I tried to run away.
Pulse 122, sat 98.
Lungs sound good.
You have any family you want us to call, Kwan?
They're in Seoul.
What's your plan?
CBC, trauma panel, chest X-ray,
(coughing) c-spine and radial/ulnar series.
Oh, my God.
It's okay. What's the sat?
98. I think I said that.
Just a little bit of blood. It's probably from your nose.
I want to go back to Korea.
Chicago isn't working out.
So, come on. More about your new hottie.
"Hottie" is too reductive a word.
You're killing me!
Dr. Morris, if dialysis won't unlock your AV shunt,
we'll revise it in the OR. Thanks, Lucien.
She's hot. Yes, she's hot.
But she's also... she's complex,
innovative. She's... she's kind of earthy.
It's completely unprecedented.
I know you know what I'm talking about.
Shut up.
Who is she?
No comment.
Where did you meet?
All I'll say is I love this new job.
I knew it! She works here.
Lucien, shampoo man is going to follow up with you
as an outpatient, okay?
If he must. Lunch later?
That could work.
My office, 2:00?
I'll try to make it.
Hey.
Hey.
She is so hot!
Missy Voltaire, restrained driver,
minivan T-boned by an SUV.
Haleh, page OB. Let's get the ultrasound in there.
When are you due, Missy?
Next month. My husband's going to freak.
He's been totally superstitious about the pregnancy.
Is this your first baby?
No. It's our 13th.
So, you did break your arm.
See? There's your fracture right there.
No, no, no. I've got a critique in a week,
and I've got all the z-depths to do.
What are you talking about?
I'm a freshman at the Art Institute.
I study animation.
Can we take this collar off?
Sure. Laverne, come here.
I'll show you how to clear a c-spine.
I'm going to work my way down your vertebrae, okay?
That sounds fun.
Let me know if anything hurts.
All, right, you're looking for tenderness,
step-offs, any other irregularities.
How long have you had this?
I'm not sure.
It's a bit fluctuant.
Is it infected?
Could be a node or a cyst.
Hey, Abby, Morris could use
some extra hands in here.
Coming.
I'll talk to surgery. Surgery?
Yeah. Just to get a second opinion.
I'll be back in a minute to explain it to you.
I got this.
Came over to meet the famous Abby Lockhart.
I'm Simon Brenner.
Your reputation precedes you.
Right back at you.
How can we help? They all have D names?
This is Missy, 35 weeks, G13, P12. Daria, Dylan, Derek, Diana...
Abby, will you do an ultrasound, please? ...Delilah, Dalton and Daisy.
So, are you Catholic? No.
Mormon? No.
Just really, really fertile. Yeah.
Baby's very active.
Oh, God! You should see after I eat.
It's like Riverdance in there.
Chest and pelvis are stable.
Yeah. After number eight, my husband got a vasectomy.
Three months later-- poof!-- I'm pregnant again.
His boys refused to be held back, eh?
Yeah. We took it
as a sign we were supposed to keep going.
OB's here. What have you got?
35-weeker,
G13, P12.
13 kids?! Are you out of your frigging mind?
Haleh, CBC, chem 7, LFTs,
type and cross for four.
You want to add a Kleihauer-Betke test?
Ooh! ER docs never remember to order that.
That's not true.
Fetal heart rate 156, amniotic index perfect.
Let's monitor the fetus for a couple of hours just to be sure.
Continuous FHT.
I'll be back to check the strip.
Got a minute? Uh-huh.
I'm very curious why a physician with your experience
would want to work in palliative care.
Why would you want to give up the...
Emily, good morning.
...the adrenaline rush of the ER?
I've reached a point where I feel
I need to make a change, you know?
I, um... I'm looking to refocus my energies.
Oh. I see.
And, uh...
my father died a short time ago.
Oh, I'm very sorry to hear that.
I cared for him during his illness,
and I was with him when he died.
WOMAN: Are you calling me a liar?
I'm just trying to help.
Will you excuse me for just a moment?
Sure. Take your time.
Please feel free to look around.
WOMAN: What happened to it?
When my granddaughter comes to visit me, I'm going...
Hi. Nice to see you.
Bull hockey!
Cheese and crackers!
Hey, hey!
You play cards?
Uh, sure.
Good.
I'm dying for some real action.
Actually, I'm dying of cancer.
Sit.
We'll play five-card draw.
Nothing wild but the dealer.
Sit!
(chuckles)
Luka Kovac.
Walter Perkins.
You visiting family?
No, I'm actually here for a job interview.
Oh. What line of work you in?
I'm a doctor.
I used to work in the ER at County General.
Can I have three?
Used to? What, you get fired?
No.
Why in Sam Hill would you want to work here?
Every morning I wake up, there's another empty bed.
Let's just say I'm trying to make some changes
in my life, okay?
You want some advice?
Run from this place and don't look back.
Take me with you when you go.
A straight flush.
You want to play for money?
ABBY: He's distant and angry.
It's like not one thing I do or say isn't wrong.
It makes sense that there would be
a period of time like this.
Yeah, after I got over there and I told him,
I kept waiting for it to get easier, you know?
I kept thinking, "Okay, the bad part's gonna be over now."
It's not easy to be patient.
I don't know.
He's planning things, you know, without including me.
And he's applying for jobs without discussing it with me.
He was looking at the real estate section today.
What does that mean?
This is what you signed up for.
He gets to make the next move.
You get to wait.
SIMON: Do you always use propofol for reductions?
Mm-hmm. It's a great drug;
short half life, easy to titrate, very safe.
Shoulder doesn't seem to want to go back.
You want some counter traction there, old boy?
No, I'm good, thanks.
Ortho generally prefers scapular manipulation.
Maybe we should let Skye here take a shot.
You look fit enough to pop that thing back into place.
I'm more about
finesse than force.
I'll remember that.
Fine. Dr. Wexler, take a shot.
Okay, Simon, we can take it from here.
Then take it.
We're good here, thanks.
And shoulder's in. Wow.
Would you stop the propofol?
That was fast.
I'm good.
Yeah, even the new attending recognizes that.
Brenner?
He's the kind of guy you want to hate,
but somehow can't.
I totally know what you mean.
Yeah, totally.
Hey, you gonna fix my arm or what?
It's all done.
What?
The sedative we gave you can cause you to sort of lose
the few minutes right before we gave you the medicine.
Milk of Amnesia strikes again.
Okay, all done.
Can you run that to the lab for me?
This is what I thought America would look like
before I came here.
I wanted to come here
ever since I was ten.
Sounds like you were a very ambitious kid.
That's not what my parents thought.
They said art was a hobby, not a career.
Well, my family were the same. Science or nothing.
Hi. I'm Dr. Rasgotra
come to check out this neck thing.
I could not afford the tuition, but I sent my portfolio anyway.
You got a scholarship?
Partial. My parents had to give up a lot to send me here.
I'm sure they're very proud, Kwan.
I don't know.
I didn't expect people to be so...
I don't know.
What do you think?
It's probably an infected cyst.
I can do an I and D if you want.
What's an I and D?
Incision
and drainage. I'll open up the area
and clean it out.
Open it up? I don't understand.
It's a very simple procedure.
It's just to make sure the fluid doesn't re-accumulate.
Can this wait until I'm home?
I know it's hard to be far away,
but you're here now, so let us take care of this.
Dr. Brenner, labs are back on your guy with the ear worm.
One step ahead of you, Frank.
Wired to receive lab reports so I get 'em anywhere, anytime.
Really?
Sure. Take a look.
Doesn't that raise confidentiality issues?
Loosen up, Greg.
Oh, excuse me.
Wow, if I'm the uptight one, then this is bizarro ER.
SIMON: Hey, I was just thinking about you.
Get a sputum sample from the homeless guy in three,
nursing man needs a new diaper,
and swab the dripping ulcer on the diabetic.
I was gonna have Dawn help you out,
but I figured you could handle it yourself.
Anyone seen Dr. Brenner?
He's around here somewhere.
Yeah, he still has a few more asses to pinch.
What was that, Doctor?
Anspaugh, where'd you find this guy?
He's a piece of work.
Is he?
Yeah, and I don't want
to be the boy who cries wolf, but this guy...
He's a wolf.
I'm sorry to hear that. He did his residency
in one of the finest hospitals in Melbourne.
Maybe so, but somehow he ended up without a clue on how...
Uncle Donnie.
To what do I owe this pleasure?
"Uncle Donnie"?
You're his uncle?
My sister had a brief disastrous tryst
with an Aussie back in the 70s.
I've been trying to lure Simon
to the northern hemisphere for years.
Think you can squeeze in a lunch at the faculty club?
I'd like to introduce you around.
Mm-hmm.
You can survive without Simon for a few hours,
right, Greg? Definitely.
Excuse me.
Is my wife here?
Car crash, very pregnant?
Missy and the baby are doing great.
And you, young lady, you must be... Daisy, huh?
Your mom told me all about you.
I'll take you to her.
Thank you.
Sam, can we get some videos for these kids in the family room?
ANSPAUGH: Meet me out front in five?
I am so glad this is all working out.
I heard the attending interviews were today.
What time's yours?
I postponed it.
Really? Why?
I, I'm still just, I don't know.
I'm trying to get used to the time change.
Well, it's good to have you back. Thanks.
It's a child-life emergency, please.
I have Swiss Family Robinson here.
I'm not kidding.
A DVD player, a Nintendo, a coloring book.
Steal from the PICU, I don't care.
(sighs)
Do you think we could talk later?
I'm a little busy now. That's why I said "later."
If it's one of those "amends" conversations,
I'd rather not.
It's five minutes.
That's all I'm asking.
Look, Abby, this is not a good day for me, okay?
When they told me it had spread, there was no one for me to tell,
so I figured that's it. I'll go back to Cayeaux.
Where?
Cayeaux-Sur-Mer.
It's a little town on the coast of France.
Spent some time there in the service
right after D-Day.
Met a girl.
I promised her when I left I'd see her again someday.
Did you?
No.
But when they told me I was dying, I wanted to go.
Then the doctor said I couldn't, there wasn't time.
Now look at me. Stuck in this place.
Could have been to Europe and back five times by now.
I just made my first trip back home to Croatia
in almost ten years.
Why'd you stay away so long?
Two.
When I left, it was, it was a difficult time.
Um, I was determined to forget everything.
Forget what?
It's much better now.
It's an amazing place.
But back then, you know things were bad.
There was a lot of chaos and destruction.
Oh, you mean the war?
When I left, I-I-I thought I'd never go back.
It's called healing by secondary intention.
The hole gets smaller as the wound heals from the bottom up.
Did you like Yale when you first got there?
Uh, it was lonely, but it gets better. Give it time.
Trauma Two.
Hey, it's Simon. Is that Sam?
You got me.
I just got a lab report back on my new phone.
Wanted to let you know.
Sparkling's fine and the, uh, grilled radicchio...
Cut.
Anyway, cytology came back on the Korean kid Kwan Lee:
Dr. Brenner, you're on speakerphone.
High-grade large-cell lymphoma.
Dr. Brenner!
Kid's got cancer, node's full of blasts.
Looks very aggressive. Tough break for the...
It's an infection...
NEELA: Kwan...
That's what you said!
You said it was an infection!
No big deal! That's what you said!
Look, it's probably early.
It's good
that we caught this.
No, shut up! Shut up! I don't have cancer!
I'm 19 years old.
I was mugged! I don't have cancer!
Okay, just settle down, okay?
Get me out of here.
Kwan...
I don't have cancer.
I want to go home.
Get me out of here.
What's going on?
I want to go.
What'd you just give him?
Propofol. This never happened.
After all he's been through, he did not need to learn
he had cancer from some crank over the speakerphone.
Oh, okay, so your plan was to erase his memory?
He could be allergic to the medicine.
He could stop breathing.
I know the risk of propofol, all right?
He's waking up.
Come here.
He's a terrified kid all alone.
Yeah, we could have helped him deal with that.
This moment was going to haunt him
for the rest of his life, how ever long that is.
So why not take it away?
Start over, do it better.
Because that's not how it works.
I know how it works...
Look, it's our job to deal with the consequences,
even if we've screwed up.
You can't just pretend something never happened.
Oh, well, thank you for the lesson.
Look, I'll review the slides with oncology
and confirm the diagnosis before I tell him.
He's my patient. How about I deal with it.
Hi. Hey.
So how long do I have to stay here?
I'm kind of starving.
Well, Sam could get you a tray.
No reason he has to be NPO, right?
Listen, um, Kwan, is there anybody here in Chicago
that could pick you up?
I'm fine on the El.
I know, but just, um...
You know after the procedure and everything,
I would feel more comfortable
if there was someone to drive you home.
Is there anybody from school?
A roommate maybe?
My RA might come.
She's kind of weird, but she's always been nice to me.
Okay, well, let's call her.
Thank you.
Sure.
So what brought you to Chicago?
County General.
I thought I'd dive into work,
and leave everything behind, but it's not so easy.
On a good day you maybe delay death for a while,
but you never really beat it.
You should try stand-up comedy.
You're a gloomy bastard.
Sorry.
What made you decide to go back home then?
My father got sick.
I-I-I thought I can maybe fix things.
Bring him back to Chicago, find him the best oncologist.
He wouldn't leave.
No, he wanted to stay in his country,
surrounded by the people he loved.
He decided he wants to die there-- like that.
Good for him.
At first I felt angry, you know, betrayed.
Why, because he didn't want to fight?
But eventually I let go of it.
You know, I... I just tried to be there for him.
So what, you learned you can't fix things?
That made you feel this might be a good place for you?
(chuckles)
Kind of.
Two pairs.
Two kings and two fours.
Aces over eights.
I believe they call that "The Dead Man's Hand."
Hey, uh, listen, if I'm canceling the hotel, I should let them know.
It's the wreck of the Northerner.
A schooner from the 1800s.
Must have been there for over 200 years.
It should still be there after this weekend.
Um...
Okay, Little France will have to wait.
I'm sorry you went through all that trouble.
I feel bad bailing at the last minute,
and I really want to do the dive.
Okay.
Hey, what if I came with you?
Do you even dive?
Once, in Belize.
Kind of hated it.
But I could hang out on the boat,
mix martinis, wait for you to come up.
It'll be cold and boring.
Really?
I'll see if there's room.
I've had it with Brenner.
Anspaugh's Australian love child?
I'm pretty sure that nephew story's just a cover-up.
Brenner's not so bad.
I think he has a refreshing energy.
And I think you've got a man crush.
Don't be ridiculous. What...?
I see the way you look at him.
Just because I can see the appeal of another man...
Forget it.
Besides, having an extra attending
might make it so you can spend some time with Betina.
When's the surgery?
I have no idea.
We broke up.
Oh, no, oh, no.
Please tell me you didn't bail on your sick girlfriend.
No, I didn't bail-- she did.
And I have to respect what she wants, right?
She wants flowers, cupcakes--
women love cupcakes.
Are you listening to anything that I'm saying? Yes. Yes, I am.
Betina is pushing you away
because she's afraid to depend on you.
If you don't see that, you're an idiot.
Oh, wow, wow.
Thanks, Morris.
But you know what?
I really don't need romantic advice
from a guy whose only lasting relationship
was with an inflatable doll.
Cupcakes... with sprinkles.
Damn it.
What? Can't you help?
Me?
Yeah. I can't reach the zofran.
I don't know, Sam, what if someone sees us?
They might get the wrong idea.
Do you have to be such a dick?
I mean, this porridge is too hot,
this porridge is too cold... Porridge?
I don't know how I'm supposed to act around you anymore.
I gave you a doughnut,
Sam, a doughnut.
Nobody cared.
You're acting like I got down on my knee
and offered you up a ring.
Here.
Stop being so nutty.
Sam, we need you in here now.
Oh, God, it hurts! No bleeding.
SAM: What happened?
I don't know. She was fine five minutes ago.
Baby just had a decel into the 70s.
Baby, you're okay. You're gonna be okay. Shut up!
No, it's not, I'm not okay!
What's going on?!
She never did this any of the other times.
She's having contractions.
Yeah, I can see that. Thank you.
You think she's abrupting? I don't know, seat belt injury,
precipitous labor, Seems to fit.
Missy... Missy...
She's hemorrhaging into the uterus.
Systolic's 66. LOCKHART: Okay, Sam, grab some o-neg.
Morris, get the airway box. We're going up. Up? Where?
She needs an OR now. I'll explain to you on the way.
(yelling in pain)
Honey, something's really wrong...
Keep squeezing the blood. (clattering)
I want to see the kids. No, no, no, baby, you're going to be okay.
What's going on? Oh, God, I need to push.
No, no, no, wait. You have to wait. I can't. I need to push!
Hang on.
Oh, damn.
Everybody out now! Go! Go! Go!
Hey, we're going back.
We're going to deliver down here.
That's an arm, Abby. That's way out of our league.
We have no choice. There's an increased risk of cord prolapse...
Push it back in! Can't you push it back in?!
We're not set up to do that.
By the time we get her upstairs, she's going to bleed out.
By the time we get her back there... The treatment for abruption
is delivery-- we can do it now,
or wait till both mom and the baby
are hypoxic or dead.
MORRIS: Go, go, go. Okay, people, move out of the way.
Coming through.
It's rotated at a weird angle.
Where the hell is OB?
Kid's gonna have a brachial plexus injury.
Systolic's 71.
This is taking too long.
The head's the biggest part. It's gonna take a little time.
We don't have time. Heart rate's already under 100.
Forceps? No.
Vacuum? No. Not yet.
I don't know. Uh... uh...
Put her in McRoberts.
What? Put her legs up.
What's the matter? Is the baby stuck?
I just need to turn it. FATHER: Have you ever done this before?
Call OB again. We're screwed.
You're not helping.
Is that meconium? Yes.
Does anyone here know what they're doing?!
Shut up. Everybody shut up.
Morris, suprapubic pressure.
Sam, get her legs back now.
Brenner, get ready to bag.
And Missy... Missy...
What? Next contraction
you go.
Okay? Okay.
Okay.
(screaming)
Right, right.
Down... and through.
Head's out.
That's-a-girl.
All right, bulb suction.
Baby had a presenting arm.
And you delivered this in the ER?
LOCKHART: Mom was bleeding out.
The baby was bradycardic. We had no choice.
You did good.
I told you-- 13th time's a charm, right?
Anyway, nice job. Why thank you.
(baby fussing)
Did you hear what we just did in there?
Or what Abby did, rather.
Got to give credit where credit's due...
What is wrong with you? Excuse me?
Are you a sociopath, a sadist, stoned?
Because I don't understand
how anyone can give a cancer diagnosis
with such a staggering lack of sensitivity.
I was talking to his nurse, not the patient.
You were on speaker phone.
And I swear, it was like
you were smiling when you said it.
I didn't realize that.
And I'm sorry-- but what's done is done.
No, it's not, it's not done.
We will have to live with what happened here today.
And it makes me sick.
Wow, you know, I heard that you were tightly wound,
but I had no idea.
Get the hell away, before I throw that thing against the wall.
What's the deal with the chopper run?
We've been suited up in there for 15 minutes now.
Oh, dispatch called.
There's a wind advisory.
They closed our helipad, so they sent it to DeKalb.
Where you planning on telling us that,
or were you just going to leave us hanging?
Maybe he likes us in yellow.
Well, your secret's safe with me. It better be.
(Brenner whispering)
Okay, I got to work now. Okay.
Saved the last one for you.
Frank, you are an officer and a gentleman.
Thank you.
Lucien. Skye.
I don't think you should join me on the dive.
I shouldn't?
You don't want to be on the boat all day by yourself.
It won't be any fun.
You mean, it wouldn't be any fun for you.
What?
I might get in the way.
Spoil your playtime with the boys.
Is that it?
Lucien... What?
How come I've never met any of these boys?
You're not really doing this, are you?
Doing what?
Look.
I've tried to be cool
with your fluidity and, uh, your independence.
I've scolded myself for being envious
of your dive buddies,
your climbing club,
your bike team.
You don't need to be jealous.
They're all friends.
I happen to have a lot of guy friends.
Yeah, you do.
You do. In fact, you have a pathologic need
to solicit male affection.
Excuse me? You think, you think
I don't see the game you're playing with Brenner? Huh?
Forgive me for being so slow, Skye.
I'm finally getting it now.
Get what? That the whole
bohemian-drifter,
love-the-one- you're-with thing
is nothing but a bogus justification
to screw anything that catches your eye.
Well.
Good.
Good. You finally figured me out,
and you're absolutely right.
I've done everybody--
Pratt... Morris...
Gates...
security guards,
Mel the roach coach guy--
and I'm having a damn good time
with Simon Brenner.
We've worn the varnish right off my desk.
You know, it's too bad.
It really is.
I was starting to let my guard down with you.
Bought this to keep you company on my dive.
Skye... Gotta run.
Scheduled a quickie with Frank.
Wait.
I thought you left.
I was working on a project,
but, um, I really wanted to tell you...
Yeah. You know, what? I'm really not in the mood
for your righteous disapproval
right now, okay? Abby...
And I know, I'm supposed to take it.
I know, but not tonight.
And tomorrow, I promise I will bend over.
Abby, stop.
Good job today.
That's all I wanted to say.
All right, look, I know I've been judgmental.
It's just that I grew up surrounded
by people with problems, big problems,
and I watched them dig themselves into a hole
and not really try to get out of it.
And maybe that's not you.
I hope it isn't.
I'm working really hard for that not to be me.
I know.
Sometimes it's hard for me to be real rah-rah about it.
I hate rah-rah.
All right. Well.
Good night.
Oh. Dr. Anspaugh.
Hi, Abby.
Hi.
Um...
I know I postponed my interview today,
but that was a mistake.
I, I don't know why I thought
I should wait, because I shouldn't.
I want to be an attending here
and I think I would be a good one, so
I was wondering if maybe you could squeeze me in
like tomorrow or the next day or...
I have a few minutes right now.
Come on in.
Honey, listen, a "B" in History
does not ruin your chances of being appointed
to the Supreme Court.
Listen, my doctor's here.
I gotta go, okay, honey?
Okay, I'll call you later.
I love you.
My son Tommy is so hard on himself.
I mean, it's sad.
When I was 15, my greatest ambition
was to date a boy with a car.
Sheryl...
Uh-oh. What?
I don't know how to tell you this, so I'll just, uh...
You've developed a post-operative infection.
Well, I, I knew that.
That, that's why I'm on the antibiotics now.
Right. But now the aortic graft is involved,
and tomorrow we're gonna have to do
a surgery to clean it out.
Hopefully, that will be it, but...
Dr. Dubenko was gonna
tell you hours ago,
but I felt I should do it,
and then I couldn't.
All day long, I've avoided this room. I'm sorry.
Don't worry.
It's not like I have big plans for the morning.
You know, I've given hundreds of patients bad news.
I don't know why I'm being so crazy.
I don't know why I couldn't tell you.
It's because we've become friends.
It's sweet.
And damn it, I... (sniffs)
I don't know why you got infected.
Just...
Just bad luck, you know.
Some, something that statistically...
It's okay, Neela.
Don't cry.
Don't.
Yeah, but you've been, you've been doing so well.
So--
you go back in tomorrow,
you do what you have to do.
I survived a ruptured aorta, right?
I mean, not such a big thing after that.
I'm gonna have the same surgeon, right?
Definitely.
Then I'm gonna be fine.
I'm gonna be just fine.

Hey. Hi.
How'd it go?
Good. Good.
I took the job.
You did?
You don't know how badly I want to tell you I'm fine,
that we can work everything through,
and find a way to fix it.
Luka, you know, you don't need to...
Or that I could
forget and go on,
but too much has happened.
I have to move out.
