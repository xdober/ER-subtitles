Previously on ER:
Joe, uh, fell and hit his head in the park today.
But he's awake now.
We're at the hospital.
It would be a lot easier if I wasn't doing this alone.
(cork pops)
There's no ozone in the tropics.
Our skin will melt off.
Okay, enough. You don't want to go.
I'll go without you.
You can check yourself in the ICU.
Greg. Greg, wait up, wait up.
Thyrotoxic crisis.
You give propylthiouracil or methimazole?
You've got a patient in thyroid storm?
Go with PTU.
What dose? I'll look it up for you.
(makes buzzer sound)... 600 migs.
Then why'd you ask?
Written boards are in a week. Failure is not an option.
If we quiz each other every day, we'll nail it.
Morris, if you don't know your stuff by now,
then you never will.
MORRIS: Did you see that?
See what?
That, that vixen, the way she smiled at me.
What are you talking about?
Yup. They all want a bite of the forbidden fruit. (scoffs)
Seriously, at the coffee shop, at the gym, at the bank,
women are coming on to me like crazy
ever since Hope gave me this ring.
You and Hope got engaged?
No, no. It's a promise ring.
Yeah, what'd you promise?
To be faithful while we're apart.
Aw, that's sweet. FRANK: Or stupid.
No, no. What's stupid is
I should have put this ring on years ago.
Man, I could've tapped so many hotties.
Anybody seen Abby?
No, she's not on until 10:00.
Alright, Morris, belly-pain lady in 3.
No, no. You got to keep me away from the ladies.
She's 85, man. Perfect.
GATES: 60%, 700cc's, AC 14.
Moretti's looking for you.
I'm taking this guy to the ICU.
He's in the break room. Well, he's going to have to wait.
He said it's important. What the hell does he want?
Don't shoot the messenger, geez.
Alright, I'll be right up.
You summoned me?
Ah, Dr. Gates...
Look, I'm playing by your rules, I'm doing my time upstairs.
I don't know what else I'm supposed to do.
I spoke with Dr. Shuster...
Is this about my Coumadin overdose with the GI bleed?
No... I ordered FFP.
The blood bank was responsible for the delay, not me.
Well, I'm not familiar with that case, but...
Pneumothorax on the COPDer?
Even the radiologist missed it.
Alright, Dr. Gates...
When the guy deteriorated, I had the chest tube in
even before they processed the film.
Dr. Gates, if, if I might?
Go ahead. What?
Okay. I just wanted to congratulate you
on your fine work in the ICU.
You do?
Yes. Dr. Shuster has given you rave reviews
for your performance.
She did?
Yep. And I think you're ready to come back to the ER.
I am?
Really?
Yes.
Okay.
Alright.
Then I'll, uh, you know what?
I'll finish up my work this week...
Well, you do whatever you have to do,
but I want you back on the floor today.
Today?
Alright. Thank you.
This was supposed to be a simple bowel resection.
I never should have promised his kid
he'd make it to the Packers game.
The family here?
Yeah, there's a son, uh, named Jeremy.
He just drove up from Notre Dame.
Great.
Hello, I'm Dr. Rasgotra.
Hi, yeah, I've been waiting for you.
Surgery took a little longer than expected.
That's okay. I was fine here.
There were some... complications, I'm afraid.
Sorry to hear that.
Would you like to sit down?
No, I'm good.
Well, during surgery, we think he suffered a heart attack.
Really?
Yeah. He's on a ventilator
and IV meds to maintain his blood pressure.
Oh, man, that's never good.
Are you alright?
I got to admit, I'm a bit little nervous,
but I am really, really, psyched to be here.
Your father's in critical condition.
What? Oh, no. No, he's not.
I don't think you understand...
Actually, I do... Jeremy, this is very serious...
Listen. My name is Harold Zelinsky.
My father died ten years ago.
I'm your new intern.
You are?
Uh-huh.
Excuse me.
Do you have any news about my dad?
(baby crying)
(crying continuing) (phone rings)
Hello?
Oh, hey, Luka.
No, I'm, I'm awake.
(crying continuing)
KOVAC: I've been calling for three hours.
ABBY: I was exhausted,
so I, um, took the ringer off so I could get some sleep.
Is that Joe?
Yeah. So he's okay now?
Yeah, he just woke up.
Hi, baby. Good morning.
I'm sorry I wasn't around.
We got stuck at the hospital.
(Joe crying) (machine buzzing loudly)
I tried calling you at work.
They filled me in. Told me his MRI was normal.
Yeah, yeah. He's fine.
(both speaking in Croatian)
Sorry.
With, uh, with the spinal fracture,
even after surgery, my dad can't move his legs.
So when he gets home,
he'll have to get around in a wheelchair.
We're building ramps for the steps
and handrails for the bathroom...
Yeah. How soon can you fly home?
We need to fix up the house.
It's a lot of work.
You could just call the airline
and just get on the standby flight.
Right? Abby...
And I'm sure there's a seat available...
I'm sorry, but it's going to be at least another week.
Another week?!
Luka, Luka... (Joe crying)
Why can't your brother just finish up?
Hey, I know you don't like it. I don't like it either.
But I need to do this. Okay?
Please... just don't make it harder.
(Joe crying)
Okay.
Okay, but we miss you.
I miss you too.
We miss you a lot.
Alright, let's set up for irrigation.
I'll come back once the skin is numbed up.
Serum osmolality calculation.
Serum "ozzims?"
Two times sodium, plus glucose over 18,
plus B.U.N. over 2.8.
Way to go.
FRANK: Morris, somebody's waiting for you.
You see what I'm talking about?
Here's the Levaquin you ordered.
So you came to drop off an antibiotic?
Sorry, Dr. Morris, I can't say
that I agree with your assessment.
And you're invited to my opening.
Your... opening?
Pharmacy's my day job, but sculpture's my passion.
I do a lot of figures, mainly nudes.
You like art?
Uh, I love it. Uh, you know what?
I'm going to put this up in the lounge in case
anyone's interested.
No, this invitation's just for you.
Assess that, Dr. Pratt.
County General on 2-B.
RASGOTRA: Dr. Morris and Pratt are the attendings.
Frank is the grouchy clerk.
This is Harold Zelinsky, my new intern.
Neela, don't go far.
We've got two car crash victims en route.
Grab your coat from the second floor,
meet me outside Trauma.
Oh! It's going to be awesome
working with you guys.
That kid's an intern?
What is he like, 12?
They keep getting younger.
Or we keep getting older.
Looks like he's in high school.
I asked. He said he was 25.
No way. He's lying.
First one to verify his age wins the pot. Who's in?
I'm with that.
GATES: What do you got?
Bevan Guang, driver of a solo car versus utility pole.
I'm Dr. Gates. Do you remember what happened?
Not really.
WOMAN: I do.
He fell asleep at the wheel and went off the road.
Traci Martinez, front-seat passenger.
I didn't fall asleep.
Are you okay, baby?
I think so. How about you?
I'm okay.
Any neck pain, chest pain?
Dr. Gates, back in the saddle, huh?
Yep. Possible syncope at the wheel.
TRACI: He works all night at a warehouse.
GATES: Wiggle your toes for me. Good. Now squeeze my hand.
I should have been driving.
I don't like you driving when you're pregnant.
Congratulations. How far along are you?
20 weeks.
I got this.
No, I got it. No, I'm good.
Were you wearing your seat belt?
Always. Great.
We'll check you and the baby out,
make sure everybody's healthy.
The success or failure of your interns depends on you.
I'm looking forward to being a good mentor.
No, no, not a mentor.
You're not their friend, you're their taskmaster.
They need to be whipped.
Yeah, well, that's not quite my style.
You should make it your style then.
Fear is what motivates them to learn and excel.
They should hate you.
Well, you know, I think there are other ways...
It's worked for decades of surgical training.
You need to be Lou Gossett to their Richard Gere.
You're from Connecticut, right? Yeah.
There are only two things that come out of Connecticut:
steers and queers.
Which one are you, boy?
I don't see no horns.
Doesn't quite work with Connecticut.
I'm not joking, Neela.
Without discipline, interns screw up.
And if he screws up, you screw up.
You want your first-choice elective?
Bring him to his knees.
(gruffly): What have we got, Zelinsky?
I thought I was supposed to wait out here for you
before I went in.
Do you know what it means to be proactive?
You could be halfway through your assessment by now.
But you... Next time, get right on it.
Am I understood? Where are we?
Uh, good vitals, no obvious injuries.
First crit is 39. Very stable. Is this your new intern?
Harold Zelinsky, Nurse Marquez, Dr. Lockhart.
Hello. Hello.
Hi. I'm Dr. Rasgotra from Surgery.
Nice to meet you.
Okay, uh, fetal Doppler and Surgilube.
Is there anything I can do to help?
RASGOTRA: No, just stand back and observe.
So, Harold, how do you like your iPod?
Yeah, it's cool.
Abdomen's soft and non-tender.
I remember when you had to go
to the record store to buy music.
I bought my first CD when I was ten.
MARQUEZ: Sonosite's ready.
So when was that, like mid-'90s?
Eminem, huh? He wasn't around yet.
Right, right. Probably, uh, Spice Girls then?
Mozart Clarinet Concerto in A Major,
Richard Stoltzman, soloist.
Dr. Zelinsky, take a look.
You might learn something.
No abruption. That's good?
Very good.
Okay, serial crits, fetal monitor, and send off a, um...
A what?
You know...
The test, the test, for, for, for...
fetal-maternal blood exchange.
Kleihauer-Betke. Right.
RASGOTRA: No evidence of previa. Type and R.H. to the blood bank.
Are you alright?
Yeah, I was just up all night with a bad stomach.
It's probably a virus.
So what do you need, an IV? No.
Why don't you go take a nap, get some rest?
No, it's alright. I just need...
Look, it's slow right now. Go, before we get slammed.
Really?
Yeah, go.
What are you doing?
Just taking this off for the x-ray.
Please, don't lose it.
It was my grandma's.
C-spine's clear, let's sit him up.
Do you want cardiac enzymes? No.
How about a head CT?
No. No headache, no focal findings.
(Bevan groans)
I forgot to eat breakfast.
Maybe that's why I got dizzy.
Well, you've got a lot on your mind.
Boy or a girl?
We want to be surprised.
You got kids?
Yeah, I have a little girl.
She doesn't live with me, but...
Okay if I send him to get a chest x-ray?
That's up to Dr. Gates.
We'll get a better film in Radiology.
You know what? Let's leave him here.
If it's simple fainting,
symptoms could last a couple minutes.
His dizziness only lasted a few seconds.
That could indicate a dangerous cardiac arrhythmia.
Valid point.
I've got something dangerous?
Probably not, but we're going to keep you on a heart monitor.
Give you another listen, huh?
Anybody seen the Wood's lamp? TAGGART: Nope.
Are you still okay? TRACI: Yeah.
You know what?
You're working too hard.
How's the baby? Okay.
Shh. They did an ultrasound?
Yeah, they did. We'll let you guys
chat in a minute, okay?
TAGGART: Come on, lie down and relax.
I don't feel so good.
(alarm beeping) V tach!
Bevan! Bevan!
Unresponsive. No pulse.
Charge to 360.
Everyone clear?
(beeping)
Okay, back in sinus.
He's a healthy 22-year-old.
You need me?
No, just the Wood's lamp.
Sorry. I'll put up a "do not disturb" sign.
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.
(sighing)
No ectopy on lidocaine.
Is this going to keep happening?
I don't know.
You ever have chest pain?
Your father have heart disease?
No.
Any drug use?
(sighs)
Look...
we live in a studio apartment.
I'm trying to save up for a two-bedroom
before the baby comes.
I work at a print shop,
then pull the graveyard at a furniture warehouse.
So, you took something to stay awake.
Couple a nights ago, I took a pill.
Like speed?
I don't know.
My friend gave it to me.
You think it messed up my heart?
You know, it probably wasn't that.
Your, uh, EKG has a different kind of abnormality.
It could be a condition that you were born with.
You want to tell Cardiology to come down?
Yeah.
I want to be a good dad.
I'm trying.
I'm really trying.
Harold?
Hey, uh, Security needs
a-a photocopy of your driver's license.
I don't have one. You don't?
I took driver's ed in high school.
I never got around to taking the test, though.
Uh, Dr. Rasgotra's waiting for this.
If you don't have a driver's license,
how do you... how do you get places?
I take the El.
If the weather's good, I ride my bike.
Do you want a copy of my hospital ID?
No, no, I'll talk to the authorities.
Find out what we need.
Repeat crit is 38.
You figure it out? No, he's crafty.
Dr. Zelinsky, your progress notes
and dressing changes?
They're all done.
Does that baby have ascites?
We're focusing on the placenta.
Looks like pleural effusions, too.
I think you're right...
in the way of my screen.
Step back, please.
What's-What's wrong?
Is my baby okay?
No. The heart's beating well.
It could be isoimmunization if mom's Rh-negative...
She's Rh-positive.
What are you talking about?
There are some fluid collections.
Are you with children a lot?
I teach preschool.
Dr. Zelinsky, can you page OB?
If the kids gave her a virus...
I get colds all the time.
20% of hydrops is caused
by parvo or fifth disease.
It's a common infection amongst toddlers.
Is that serious?
There's increased risk of fetal
abnormalities and miscarriage.
(sobbing) Oh, my God.
HAROLD: Parvo is one
of the few treatable etiologies of hydrops fetalis,
so actually, you're pretty lucky if that's it.
Harold... Lucky?
He just said I could lose my baby.
HAROLD: Oh, no, no.
Not with a UV transfusion.
Look... I know this is hard,
but we're going to do everything we can
to help you and your baby, okay?
(sighs)
Vincent Greco, skin infection.
I got two boils-- here, here.
Okay, um,
how long have you had them?
About a week.
Started out like a pimple.
Tried hot compresses, but they just kept growing.
Mm-hmm, and do you work out a lot?
Yeah, I'm a personal trainer.
Uh-huh, well, gyms have nasty germs.
It looks like I'm going to have to open...
Sorry.
Did you have a nice nap, Dr. Lockhart?
Yes, thank you.
Dr. Moretti, can you tell me
why Gates has two patients on the board?
Yeah, he got stuck with a V tach arrest.
Well, is the patient in V tach right now?
Cardiology is on their way. Well, good.
Then he can come down and pitch in.
No, I think there is benefit to his staying with the patient.
Greg, you have something to ask me?
No. Oh, right, the boards.
Uh... I don't know.
Antidote for aspirin overdose is what?
Come on, you call that a question?
Okay, new-new deal. New deal.
From now on, tough questions,
and only when we're... when we're stressed.
That'll recreate the anxiety of test day.
Come on, Morris. Let me check some labs.
Okay. "IceColdShower.com?"
What the hell is that?
I'm ordering herbal anaphrodisiacs.
You need aphrodisiacs?
No, no, no. Anaphrodisiacs.
"Curbs your libido and puts the brakes on sexual energy.
These tablets ensure a lust-free day."
Come on, you've seen what's happening, guys, huh?
I need this stuff.
You want to lose your libido,
get married and have a kid.
Well, I'm impressed.
It usually takes an OB to pick up hydrops.
It was not tough to diagnose.
Ascites was a clear tip-off.
Traci, this is Dr. Coburn from OB.
Hi. Hi.
Your blood test shows you had a recent
parvovirus infection.
I had a bad cold in August.
That was it.
Well, we're concerned about the possible effects
of the infection in your baby's bone marrow.
COBURN: Blood velocity in the brain is 44 centimeters per second.
That is not what we were hoping for.
Indicates a severe anemia.
But I went to the clinic last week.
My blood count was fine.
You're not anemic. Your baby is.
COBURN: So, we need to give
a transfusion directly into the umbilical cord.
Are you sure?
Without it, there's a serious risk of fetal death.
(sotto voce): 70%.
With it, there's a very high probability of a cure.
(sotto voce): 90%.
You want to stick
a needle in the umbilical cord?
COBURN: It's the only way to help.
Although there is a slight possibility of a miscarriage.
Seven percent.
Well, just look at the numbers.
The benefits outweigh the risks by a factor of 12.
I want to talk to Bevan.
He's, uh, with the cardiologist.
Can he be here when you do it?
If it's okay with Dr. Kayson.
I need him with me.
COBURN: Okay.
I'll go get things set up.
Okay.
Uh, Dr. Zelinsky will assist you.
TRACI: When I first found out...
I wasn't sure I wanted the baby.
But then Bevan stepped up.
He said we could do it together.
It made us closer.
Everything was really good.
It can still be good.
I thought it was a blessing getting pregnant.
Now I'm not so sure.
(sighs)
LOCKHART: Is it sharp here?
VINCENT: Can't feel a thing.
Alright, let me know if anything hurts.
That's a lot of pus.
Good thing I came in.
Smells anaerobic. You want a wound culture?
Jin Kim?
WOMAN: Right here.
Are you going to be my doctor?
Nope. Actually, no. No, I'm not.
(whimpers)
MORRIS: Dr. Lockhart, can I take over, please?
There's a lady with foot pain in Exam 2 I need you to see.
Sounds good.
(sighs)
Heart sounds good.
EKG shows S-T segment elevation in V one, two and three.
I'm thinking Brugada syndrome.
Hmm.
What?
Dr. Gates will be back
to discuss all of my recommendations.
Please, can I go in with Traci?
Yeah, as soon as I get back.
It's not Brugada.
Ventricular arrhythmia in an Asian man,
classic EKG findings?
That's not S-T elevation. It's early repolarization.
How do you explain the V tach?
Gee, maybe it has something to do
with the amphetamines in his urine.
Alright, he took a pill three days ago,
but nothing since then.
And every drunk with an ETOH of 500 only had two beers.
Repeat his cardiac enzymes.
If they're negative, I'll clear him
for discharge, or jail for DUI.
He had a cardiac arrest. From the amphetamines.
And you don't think it can happen again?
Not unless he takes more drugs.
Well, I disagree with you.
If it's Brugada, it could happen anytime.
I think he needs an implantable defibrillator.
Well, let's continue this discussion
after you complete a Cardiology fellowship.
This is... This is a good guy here.
MARQUEZ: Excuse me.
Why are you writing him off? I'm not.
He's had eight hours of normal monitoring.
I don't think that's enough.
I think you need to keep him in overnight.
Don't tell me how to practice medicine.
I am not admitting a speed freak.
Can you hold it down?
It was a mistake, a one-time thing.
(loudly): A kid who's popping amphetamines doesn't need the CCU.
He needs rehab.
And you had better learn
to take the advice of a senior consultant
if you intend on finishing your residency.
Uh, any more pain, Mr. Greco?
No, I'm fine. I'm fine.
Dr. Morris, my daughter, Layna.
WOMAN: Hey. Hi.
Uh... he needs to be admitted
to the IV antibiotics for the hospital.
I mean... Uh... you know... you know what I mean.
Let's get a dressing on this.
It looks pretty bad.
It's not that flesh-eating bacteria, is it?
No, No, this'll clear up in a few days.
Thank God. I've got your Clinda.
Are we out of kerlix?
I don't think so.
So, Doctor, may I ask,
what kind of car do you drive?
Uh, yeah. BMW 328.
Not bad, but I'd love to see you in Z-4.
I sell luxury cars,
and a man like you deserves something sexy.
(laughs)
Uh, anything else, Dr. Morris?
Some tape.
So, what's your wife in?
Well, actually, I'm-I'm
(whispers): not married.
Oh, really?
So, the ring's just to sweeten the pot?
All we have is three-inch.
I've heard you can make that work.
GATES: Hey, Sam, where'd you move the boyfriend?
Bevan Guang. Exam 3 with Chuny.
We're still waiting on troponins.
Oh, we still have time.
Will you talk to Kayson?
You want me to override the Chief of Cardiology
and demand admission?
Yeah.
We have to think about working with Dr. Kayson in the future.
We have to think about saving lives now.
Well, sometimes you have to defer to the consultants.
Yeah, well, what if they're wrong? Get creative.
BEVAN: Could the needle hurt the baby?
There's a small chance,
but Traci wants to have the transfusion.
She decided on her own? Mm-hmm.
Can I talk to her about it?
Uh, I don't think she wants to see you right now.
Because of the speed?
It was only once.
It's not like I'm a tweaker or-or...
She's a little disappointed.
TRACI: I won't listen to his crap anymore.
I should have known.
(sighs)
He used to deejay at warehouse parties.
He'd be out all night with his boys.
I thought he was different now.
I think he is.
He lied to me.
He was, like, "I'm going to work hard
and support you and the baby and be a good dad..."
He's trying to step up. He's trying to step up, Traci.
By getting high?
By almost getting us killed?
People change, Traci.
I used to get high all the time.
Made a lot of dumb mistakes.
But I straightened out when it mattered.
He's not like that.
He proved it.
He messed up.
You know, sometimes things aren't always right or wrong
or black or white.
My baby's sick.
Might not even make it.
Can we not talk about this right now?
Okay.
Okay.
You look, uh, very lost.
Um, yeah, I'm looking for Traci Martinez.
They pointed me in this direction.
They said she was in Trauma 1.
Yes, I'm Dr. Gates, and the good news is
you are very, very warm 'cause Trauma 1 is right there.
(sighs) Thank you.
So are you a friend?
Um, not exactly.
Julia Dupree. Ah.
I'm the on-call chaplain.
Right.
Oh, so they called you for a consultation?
Yeah.
Good. Well, listen, I'm very familiar with the case,
so, um, if you have any questions...
No, I think I can manage.
Thank you, Doctor.
Gates.
(clanging nearby) The nerve gets, uh,
compressed and inflamed right here.
So what do we do?
There's a pad for your arch, but you're going to have
to stop with the high heels for a few months.
Are you serious? I'm sorry.
Can you, can you make her stop doing that?
She's expressing her frustration.
Yes, well, so am I.
Emily, give that to Mommy.
(Emily shrieking) I'll be right back.
(shrieking continues)
Your lady has a Morton's neuroma.
Oh, I figured. Thanks.
Well, looks like further surgery won't be necessary.
Mm. How's it going, Dad?
Ah, much better, sweetheart.
Thank you.
This guy... guy's the best.
You ever been inside a Shelby?
Those are some tight little numbers.
Didn't we talk about this?
I mean, I was perfectly clear about my situation.
What situation?
Hey, Sophia. Hey.
I see you've met my sister?
Twins?
We were hoping we could take you out for a test drive.
So... you two work together?
We do everything together. We do everything together.
(whimpers)
COBURN: Advancing the needle.
TRACI: When my friends had babies,
they were all so happy.
I thought I could handle it.
It's okay to be afraid.
I'd be scared out of my mind.
(sobbing): I'm not strong enough to do this alone.
Hey, I think you might surprise yourself.
RASGOTRA: There's the tip. I'm not so sure.
TAGGART: Really shows up.
Do you want to say a prayer?
COBURN: It's etched, echo tipped.
We can do it together.
Go to the right, toward Mom's feet.
There's the cord.
TAGGART: Packed cells and platelets are up.
HAROLD: How big is the umbilical vein?
At 20 weeks, it's about a millimeter.
Alright, I'm in.
You hit that with a 22-gauge?
Sick.
Dr. Zelinsky, I need you to check on the rule-out appy.
Right now? I don't want her to perf. Go.
Pull off one cc for the lab.
TRACI: It's okay so far?
It's perfect. It couldn't be better.
Must have been one hell of a prayer.
TAGGART: Don't worry, Harold. She's having a bad day.
(Harold slams can lid)
I'll be in Trauma if you need me.
Got it. Gates, is that even your patient?
I'm taking care of the boyfriend.
He's very concerned.
Yeah, well, I'm very concerned, too.
You've been working on this case for about eight hours now.
These two have a lot of special needs--
you know, medical, social, psychological.
You know, that's just great, but you're not in the ICU anymore.
Quick. Top three organisms for neonatal sepsis.
You need to be re-booted back to ER mode.
That means stabilize and pass off to the admitting team.
That might be appropriate if it were simple pneumonia or cellulitis...
Dr. Pratt, I need an answer. Shut up, Morris.
Let me just check on this transfusion. What did I just say?!
Kayson wrote the orders, I'm discharging Bevan.
No, you're not. Gates!
I got to deal with this. I'll talk to you later.
Okay, you're feeling some pressure-- excellent.
Name three bacteria for neonatal sepsis.
Bend over and kiss my ass.
Those are not bacteria.
Group B strep, E. coli, and listeria.
Not bad, Abby.
COBURN: It's turbulent flow in the UV. Excuse me.
My intern's in with your belly pain guy?
Uh, okay, but, uh, Dr. Coburn, I had a question for you.
Another consult?
No, not exactly.
Could you find me when you're done here?
Let's go ahead with the platelet infusion.
TAGGART: 18cc's of packed cells are in.
So I hear Luka's in Europe.
Something about his dad?
Multiple myeloma.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Well, things are a little bit better.
He should be home soon.
Must be hard.
You're managing with Joe?
Joe's amazing.
You should see him.
He's walking, babbling, feeding himself.
He loves the books you got him for his birthday.
Good Night Gorilla has to be the last book every night.
You drank?
(sighs)
When?
Last night.
You want to get to a meeting?
(laughing): I don't have time to go to a meeting.
I don't need to go to a meeting.
I just... I had a bad day,
a very bad day, and it was just one time.
I'm not going to start drinking again.
Really?
Are you an alcoholic?
Yes, but... Yes, but?
All those years that you were sitting in meetings,
were you an alcoholic then?
Yes or no?
Okay, keep drinking.
Do the research, see what happens.
I can handle this.
Just let me know how it works out for you.
Okay, I've got a clinic full of patients.
Janet, Janet, you're my sponsor.
I was your sponsor, but now it's very simple.
If you've decided you're not an alcoholic,
I can't help you.
If you are, I'll be your sponsor again
and I'll support you in recovery.
Let me know what you decide.
MORETTI: Really, it's okay.
You can call me anytime.
Okay.
Good luck on your midterms.
I love you, too.
Bye.
That was my son.
In Rhode Island.
He's having a hard time in college.
Really?
Yeah, he's a long way from home.
I don't know if it's the normal school stress
or if it's more...
But... I feel like he's not telling me stuff.
(chuckling): You know.
It's hard to know what's going on
with someone even if they're your own kid.
Yeah.
I'm sorry, but they're waiting for me to sign out.
Oh, good night, Abby.
Migraine lady's still groaning.
Uh, four more of MS.
You out of here? I'm trying.
Frank, did Ortho call back yet?
FRANK: Oh, damn it, another dead end.
MORRIS: You said this would be easy.
PRATT: And you're sure you spelled his name right?
FRANK: Yeah... Frank?
...there's nothing. There's no mortgage.
There's no credit cards, not even any student loans.
Well, maybe he had a full scholarship.
Hello!
Ortho?
Not yet.
I can't even find a birth record for this guy.
What are you guys doing? PRATT: Background check on Neela's intern.
Yeah, we're going to figure out his age.
Oh... I'm here late
because our clerk can't get CT results
or call consults, and my attendings don't have time
to hear about a migraine,
DKA, femur fracture, or an incarcerated hernia because
they're all too busy playing "how old is the intern"?
It was just a couple of minutes. What are you talking about?
We've been here the whole time.
These are my pass-ons.
Hey, Harold, how old are you?
25.
That's an intern?
How old were you during the O.J. trial?
Uh... well, that was, uh, like 1995...
You're not 25.
You're right. I'm 19.
RASGOTRA: 19? No way.
I started college when I was 12,
med school when I was 15. I was home-schooled.
How is that possible?
I got a perfect score on the SATs when I was 11,
so I knew I was ready for college.
Alright, let's go and check on that rule-out appy.
Dr. Gates. GATES: Mm.
Can I talk to you for a minute?
Yep.
I understand that Dr. Kayson wrote a discharge order
for Bevan Guang. Mm-hmm.
And that you cancelled it?
Is this your idea of creative problem-solving?
I didn't know what else to do.
Well, did you consider a holter monitor?
What about a transfer?
Runs of V tach, I need a doctor in here!
Open the crash cart. Call Kayson.
Dr. Morris. Dr. Morris.
Your dad got moved upstairs.
We just wanted
to say good-bye.
You've been very wonderful.
Uh... just doing my job.
It's too bad things didn't work out.
We could have had some fun.
Ciao. See ya.
Frank!
How about the LFTs on my hepatitis guy?
Called five minutes ago.
Well, call again.
It's been three hours. Abby's right.
Why can't anything get done around here?
Tell me the Ottawa Ankle Rules.
Where's his chart?
C'mon, Archie, the ankle rules.
There's only five of them.
I don't have time for your stupid games.
(laughs)
GATES: Going again.
Clear.
Normal sinus.
Strong carotid.
What happened?
Pulseless V tach.
You're kidding.
Well, take a look at the strip.
150 of amiodarone.
Recurrent ventricular
arrhythmias in the absence of amphetamines.
It's possible he'll need an implantable defibrillator.
MARQUEZ: Glad I didn't discharge him.
He would have died on the way home. Yeah.
Good thing we got busy with another trauma.
I'll go prep the EPS lab.
You alright, Dr. Gates?
Yeah.
MORETTI: Jack, hold on.
(moans)
Welcome back.
You know,
sometimes I wish I could just see the patients by myself
without the residents. Huh.
Life would be so much easier. I know.
They don't listen. They don't wanna learn.
They think they know everything.
And you know the worst part? Hmm.
Every now and then, they turn out to be right.
WOMAN: Excuse me, Miss.
Is that yours?
MORRIS: Oh,
I miss you, too, baby.
Is it hot down there?
Really?
So, uh...
what are you, what are you wearing right now,
like a, like a tank top?
All hot and sweaty and clinging to your skin.
(drapes open suddenly)
I need this bed.
Yes, uh, thank you.
Uh, could you please page Urology
for Dr. Morris in the ER? Thanks.
Hope, you still there?
So when you're... when you're all hot and steamy,
what, what do you to cool off?
Oh, I'm so jealous.
You're that close to the Caribbean?
Do they have any topless beaches?
Oh, you are such a bad girl.
Wouldn't mind going skinny-dipping with you
late at night.
Yeah? Yeah, then, then,
then I'll take you back to your tent...
Right, hut.
Oh, I'll, I'll sneak into your hut one of these nights
and, uh...
Hold on. Hold on.
Uh, Bardelli.
Can I, can I use
your rig for five minutes?
I have an administrative tour.
Take your time. I'm gonna grab some dinner.
Okay, okay.
Okay, where were we?
Right, right, right, you... you're, you're, you're,
you're fast asleep naked under satin sheets.
And first, first I gently nibble on your toes,
then your, then your ankles.
Now I'm licking the back of your knee.
My baby's okay?
Yeah, everything looks great.
No contractions.
Hydrops should resolve in a couple of weeks.
Excellent.
So did you hear about Bevan?
Heard his heart was bad again.
Yeah, but this time,
there were no amphetamines
in his system.
So we think it's something called Brugada syndrome.
That means he was born with an electrical problem in his heart.
So it wasn't the drugs?
No.
And he'll need a shock box in his chest.
Okay, but he still took speed.
Yeah, once, to get through work.
And he realized
it was wrong and he promised
from now on, nothing stronger than coffee.
You think he means it?
I guess I should go see him.
If you're ready.
Hey. Hey.
I'm gonna go talk to Bevan.
Good.
I think that's a good thing.
You know that guy Robert Frost?
He was right.
Robert Frost?
He said, "The only way out is always through."
Mmm. Mm-hmm.
Done a great job with her.
Oh, I just held her hand.
Told her it was okay to be mad at God.
Is that right?
Yeah.
I get mad at God all the time.
It's actually done wonders for our relationship.
And I haven't been struck down by lightning.
Yeah, not yet.
Alright, so,
how, how does someone like you
become a, a chaplain?
I mean is there a lot of training?
No worse than med school. Mm-hmm.
So, I guess, um, so I guess,
you'd have to give up a lot of things, huh?
Well, I don't know.
Aren't there like, like, like vows or something?
Dr. Gates, I'm not a nun
and I'm not a saint.
I'm a woman who happens to be a chaplain.
And you don't really get that, do you?
Yes, I do.
Get what?
(chuckles)
That I have a spiritual life, Uh-huh.
and a spiritual career,
but I live in the real world.
That sounds nice.
You should try it sometime.
I don't know.
Maybe it's not too late to switch to something else.
(sighs)
Seriously, I don't think I can take a year of this.
(whispering): Hey, listen, I gotta go. Call you later.
Do you want to start evening rounds?
No, trauma's coming in.
You alright?
Yeah.
Are you...
You're not...
No.
No, I'm fine.
This is all because I've been riding you so hard?
(sighs)
Bollocks. Come on.
I'm not really a mean person.
It's just that my boss told me
that I had to be that way
so you'd work harder and learn more.
It's not working. Yeah, I knew this was stupid.
But you were so convincing.
But I think you're doing a fine job
and from now on, I'm gonna be a lot nicer,
and a lot more supportive, okay?
Okay. No more unnecessary scut,
no more pimping just for the sake of humiliation,
and no more taking credit
for all your good ideas.
Oh, crap. Don't believe
a word I'm about to say. What?
Just play along.
What's coming in, Neela?
Stab wound to the chest.
And don't think you can set foot in that trauma
until you advance all the drains on the service,
write your evening progress notes,
and check pre-op labs
for tomorrow's OR cases.
Am I clear, Zelinsky? Yes.
Yes, what? Yes, Dr. Rasgotra.
Well, what are you waiting for?
(exhales)
Nice!
That's what I'm talking about.
What do you got coming in?
Stab wound under the left nipple.
I can stay if you want. No.
It's alright. We got it.
Good work today.
Nice to have you back.
Beautiful night, isn't it?
Everything okay, Dr. Morris?
Oh, yeah. Everything's good.
Real good.
