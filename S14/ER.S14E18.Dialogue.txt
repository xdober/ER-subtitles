Previously on ER:
I'm in love with you.
RASGOTRA: I don't know why I'm being so crazy.
I don't know why I couldn't tell you.
It's because we've become friends.
Started out with 14. Now they're down to five.
But you're still standing.
But nothing will make them focus on you
like getting another offer.
"Headhunters"? What? Are you leaving us?
I have to move out.
DANIEL: You got to save her!
You got to save her right here, right now
or no one's leaving.
I-I don't know what else to tell you.
It's up to you.
I got nothing.
No, I'm sleeping fine.
Work's good. I'm good...
Surprised... you know, that I'm okay.
Didn't think I would be.
I mean, who would?
But, uh...
I am.
Hostage situations are very traumatizing,
especially when there's a fatality involved.
Yeah. No doubt, no doubt.
Are-are we done?
If you want to be.
Okay, then, yeah. Yeah.
I'm here anytime, Dr. Morris.
Feel free to drop by,
call and set up an appointment,
whatever.
I don't want to go to school today.
Mm, I don't want to have surgery today, but look at me.
Come here and give Mommy a kiss.
Come here.
Be right back. Be back in an hour. Okay, mm-hmm.
Bye, Mom. Bye.
Be good today. We will.
You all right?
Yeah, yeah.
Fourth time's a charm, right?
Yep. I think I heard that somewhere, too.
So you've been at County since you were a nurse, right?
You must like it.
Yeah. Amazing people.
It's hard to imagine being anyplace else.
It feels like home?
Yes, sad, but true.
Yeah, I did some time in a county hospital.
In the trenches, the adrenaline...
it's great and frustrating.
Constantly
fighting the system
or trapped in some bureaucratic quagmire.
Am I right?
Yeah, you're pretty right.
Here, no bureaucracy, no broken system.
Just the best care we can provide
to every patient we treat.
I mean, County's a dinosaur.
We'd love to have you come join our team
out here in the 21st century.
Is that something you might be interested in?
Yes, definitely.
Usual wound dressing.
Excellent work, Nurse Taggart.
So, when are you getting your next break?
Again? Wow!
Uh, I'll come meet you in a half hour.
Okay.
Hey, Frank, can you get me a V/Q scan for Exam 2?
Do I not look busy to you?
What, you finally figured out how to beat the computer at solitaire?
Hey, if you have to know,
I'm adjusting the patient throughput database.
(Taggart yelps)
Always ask your nurse for preemptive orders.
That way you won't have to wait for an attending.
Thank you so much, Chuny. You're welcome.
Frank, do you have the PowerPoint CD and the notes
for the joint trauma conference today?
Check and check. Get the hell away from me, woman!
Come on now! Just put the gown on!
Hey! Mr. Randall! Mr. Randall!
You owe me five bucks!
We're presenting at the trauma conference?
Yeah, hemostatic resuscitation.
Sounds boring. Chuny, did I do this right?
G'day, all. I'd like to introduce
new fourth year, Kaya Montoya. Hi.
Hi, I'm Sam.
Hi, I'm Chuny. BRENNER: Kaya comes to us
all the way from the University of New Mexico.
Be gentle. It's her first day.
You're a Lobo, huh?
I sure am.
I'm a big fan.
Spent a lot of time there as a kid.
Used to go to football games with my brother.
My dad has season tickets. Oh.
Hi. What time did you leave?
I must have fallen asleep.
Red wine...
Dr. Montoya, care to assist me
on a corneal foreign body?
DAWN: Mr. Randall...
RANDALL: No means no!
No!
What, you couldn't wait a half hour?
BP: 175/100. Oh, I know my pressure's high.
I ran out of my pills.
Yeah, for the third time.
The ER is not the place to come for med refills.
(sneezes) Bless you.
Oh, God bless you.
My doctor died five years ago
and I haven't found another one I like.
Well, I'll refer you to County Clinic.
Oh, six months' wait.
Don't know if you noticed, sweet cakes,
but time ain't exactly on my side.
Shh, shh! Oh, it's okay, Purdy.
Come on. Come on. It's okay. It's okay.
(gasps) Hey, you are not supposed
to have that in here.
Oh, she's just a baby.
You know what?
I'm going to give you a two-week supply of meds.
No refills.
I want you to get a regular doctor.
DAWN: Abby, got a couple of rigs
coming in. Brenner told me to get you.
You qualify for Medicare.
We'll help you find somebody.
Won't find anyone I like.
Will you make sure Social Work gets down here?
(Abby sneezes) Bless you.
Who has 27 cats?
That's disgusting. I hate cats.
Did I mention that?
So what's up, girl? How you doing?
I'm fine. This'll go away.
No, I mean with you.
Something's on your mind. I can tell.
No, not more than usual really.
Is it Luka? No.
Well, yeah.
But it's not just that.
I got a job offer.
What? Where?
Payton Medical Center.
Ooh, fancy.
Don't you go and get all stuck up on us.
It is nice.
Bet the pay is nice, too.
The pay is good. The hours are good.
They use a portion of their profits
to provide free care to the uninsured.
It's all good.
Wow, look at you, girl.
I remember back when we were nurses together.
Now you're about to go off and be an attending.
I'm happy for you.
Proud, too. Thanks, Chuny.
Abby, glad you could join us.
I got here as soon as I could. Of course you did.
She says her name is Lois. She was staggering
in a crosswalk before she passed out. Lois Landry.
Is she drunk? Nothing on the breath.
No apparent head trauma. Lois Lan...
150/90. Normal sinus at 62.
You've been partying, Lois?
(wearily): No. We got this one.
BRENNER: What do you got?
Manny Bonilla, mail truck driver,
swerved to avoid the lady.
You're going to want four units of O neg,
a surgery consult, auto versus pole,
abdominal and pelvic trauma.
All right. On my count.
One, two, three.
Hi, I'm Dr. Morris.
Manny.
Uh, trauma panel, C-spine, chest and pelvis.
UA and 12 lead?
Uh, yeah.
Can't believe this.
One second I'm driving along, minding my business,
and there she is.
Right in the middle of the street.
I got the hemocue.
Scleral icterus.
Bradying to 55.
Slow heart rate. Is that why she fainted?
No, her BP's fine.
CBC, chem panel, type and hold, coags,
and have Frank go through her stuff,
see if there's any family to contact.
BRENNER: Kaya, do you appreciate the jaundice? No.
Hemocue 11.2. How do we put it all together, altered and jaundiced?
Maybe she has... I didn't ask you, Laverne.
Do us a favor. Put the patient in a gown.
Is it a head bleed?
No, there's no sign of trauma,
but we do have asterixis.
Now jaundice means liver disease,
so what lab's going to help us?
AST? I can do it myself. No.
ALT? It's ammonia.
That's right, so she may have...?
Hepatic encephalopathy
from acute liver failure? Very good.
45cc's of oral lactulose.
BRENNER: You're quite the teacher.
Yeah, you should try it sometime.
Oh, I teach. I'm just very selective.
Distal aorta's closed. Clamp.
EBL 250cc's. Pressure's good. (phone ringing)
DUBENKO: It's not pretty.
RASGOTRA: How did this happen?
It's just one of those things.
SHIRLEY: OR 2.
Send this for cultures, please.
ICU's got a post-op
heart bleeding out through the chest tube.
Okay. Tell them I'll be right there.
You'll what? SHIRLEY: He'll be right there.
Yep, finish up. The hard stuff's done.
Lucien... Make sure to keep the heparin
at 18 cc's per kilo per hour
and check coags q4. You'll be fine.
(groans): Okay.
Hip's back in.
Pressure's up to 130/82.
Have Surgery meet him at the CT to review the scan.
Dr. Morris, I need to go up to Psych for my debriefing.
Total waste of time.
I don't know why they're making it mandatory.
Shoot, I don't mind.
That man could've killed us all.
You know, these people out here are crazy.
Your liver is, uh...
is pretty damaged, Lois.
BRENNER: Have you had a fever?
Just weak and achy for a few weeks.
Thought it was the flu.
Okay, everybody goes right to hep A and B,
but you should consider other infectious etiologies...
Mm-hmm, like CMV, HSV, paramyxovirus,
hemorrhagic fever.
We'll send serologies.
Are you on any prescription medication?
BRENNER: What kinds were you thinking about?
Certain antibiotics.
Antivirals, antidepressants,
oral hypoglycemics, seizure meds, and NSAIDs.
I gave grand rounds on fulminant hepatic failure last year.
Grand rounds.
Well, I guess I don't have anything to teach you.
I guess you don't.
How long am I going to be here? I work tonight.
Uh... actually, I think you're probably going
to have to stay in the hospital for a little while, Lois.
We went ahead and contacted your family.
You what?
We found your wallet.
Our clerk was able to get in touch
with your mom and she's on her way.
Oh, my God.
Don't worry. We'll figure this out.
You had no right to go through my things.
I don't want anyone here.
Well, you're pretty sick and... I'm fine
on my own; I don't...
I don't need any help.
Everybody needs some help sometimes.
It's nothing to be ashamed of.
More saline at the splenic flexure.
She's got some interloop abscesses.
Fourth liter's up. Oh, crap.
I think the bowel's perfed. Page Dubenko.
You nick it removing the graft?
No, the injury's old and ratty.
Maybe we missed it.
You page Lucien yet?
Yeah. What do you want to do?
GIA stapler?
Lesion's less than 30% of the lumen.
Better off with debridement and primary closure.
Okay, 15 blade, pickups and 3-oh vicryl. Let's go.
I'm keeping my hand in the midline.
Now, elicit a fluid wave.
Laverne, would you mind calling the lab for our results, please?
After that, I'll show you how to check for urine bilinogen.
So Lois, you said you first got sick a few weeks ago?
Mm.
You live with somebody?
Alone.
I left home a long time ago.
FRANK: Abby, I've got the mother here.
Hi. Uh, I'm Dr. Lockhart.
Lois passed out on the crosswalk.
We think that
she's having some problems with her liver.
Lois? Who is Lois?
Where-Where is my son?
I'm sorry?
I'm Edith Landry.
They said you had my son, Lonnie.
I'm right here, Mom.
CLETUS: Let's get pizza for lunch.
No, no, let's... let's get some beefs.
You guys like sweet peppers or hot?
Both.
Me, too. And dipped twice.
Shut up. You're making me hungry.
I haven't had normal food in days.
You got a little fever.
(sighs)
I've had a fever for weeks.
I'm not worried.
Good. We'll check back in a bit, okay?
Why is she still spiking?
Well, it's to be expected,
especially when you've manipulated infected tissue.
Fever, shifting vital signs--
all part of the healing process.
I should have done a resection and an anastomosis instead.
No. Primary repair was the right thing.
You know, maybe my sutures were too loose.
She could be leaking into her... Stop it.
I've watched you do primary repair
of a bowel perf probably a hundred times.
But I just can't be positive that... Neela!
You stepped up. You made the right calls.
(voice breaking): I told you I didn't want anyone here.
(sighs)
She's upset.
(sighs)
You know, sometimes...
...the people closest are the ones
that have the hardest time with the truth.
(sniffles)
I'll be right back.
EDITH: No, I'm fine.
D-Don't worry.
We'll talk about it when I get home, okay?
Okay. Bye.
That was my husband.
I lied to him.
He doesn't know that...
Lonnie is here.
Um, we're not sure yet,
but I think her liver is failing.
Her?
I know. It's a lot. I know.
When you people called me,
you said my son was here.
There was a driver's license in the personal belongings bag.
Our clerk used it to contact you.
We-We had no idea.
Lonnie always had a flair for the dramatic.
We woke up one morning six years ago,
and he was just gone.
My strange, sweet little boy.
Just gone.
He never had many friends, you know.
Kept to himself.
His father-- they, uh... they never saw eye to eye.
Um....
I may have to go check on some of L...
uh, of Lonnie's... tests,
but you can go in there if you like.
I'm-I'm sure...
your child could use the company.
PRATT: What are you guys doing?
I don't see anything.
Watching surveillance footage. Right there.
Charlie and his crew caught some couple
knockin' boots all over the hospital.
MORRIS: I've seen more steam in a shower.
You don't see the gyrating?
Look at the gyrating.
Is that a leg?
Yup. Well, we still got to get the picture enhanced,
bring up the sound levels.
You got cameras wired for sound? Some.
Ah. What a tease.
Hey, Morris, you need to sign off
on my CHF'er.
What are you guys looking at?
Surveillance footage.
Of what?
Apparently, people getting busy
all over the hospital.
What?
No idea who they are, huh? Uh-uh.
Well, hang on to the DVD. Look again.
See if you recognize anyone.
Will do. Yeah.
FRANK: That look like sex to you?
TAGGART: Yeah.
I mean, n-no.
Yeah, not good sex anyway.
Hey, Morris, I got to go to Psych to do my debriefing.
Did you do yours yet?
Yeah. It was lame.
Hey, Gates, uh, come here a sec.
What?
(laughing): It's surveillance footage
of people having sex in different rooms
in the hospital.
I know it's been a long time,
but that does not look like sex to me.
Frank, I've been waiting forever on the LFTs.
Could you check on that for me? Yeah. Sure.
(Pratt sighs) Hey, do you have a minute?
Yeah. Come on. Walk with me.
What's going on with the attending job?
You still haven't heard anything yet?
You know how slow they are.
I got another job offer. What? Where?
Payton Medical Center, and they want an answer today.
Well, can't you get them to wait another day?
I'll go talk to Anspaugh as soon as I can.
They've been waiting for two weeks.
Just get 'em to wait one more day. You're the one
that told me to get out there, so I did.
I need a plan, or I'm gonna end up working in Lubbock.
Abby, got Lois' labs back.
They put 'em in the system under the wrong name.
Bilirubin's eight. AST: 10,000.
Look, I'll get an answer as soon as I can.
Mrs. Landry, I got the test results.
That's him.
Abby, just got the coags.
Protime is 96.
Okay, hang the FFP.
What's happening?
We need to give plasma
because her damaged liver is not making
enough proteins to clot the blood.
I need to go talk to her about this.
I think you should come.
Last hemocue was 11.
Okay, stay ahead four of packed cells.
Hi, Mom.
It's just me.
Don't worry. Your father
isn't coming.
It's been so long.
You didn't call
or even write.
I didn't know what to say.
We didn't know where you were,
if you were even... alive.
Six years.
(sniffles)
I'm sorry.
(sobbing): Please don't hate me.
(sniffles)
Honey... (sobs)
Honey, I could never hate you.
(whimpering)
Uh, Lois... Lois?
Your test results show that you're in liver failure.
Do you take hormones?
(gasps)
Uh, estrogen injections twice a week.
LOCKHART: Where do you get them?
From a friend of a friend.
A doctor?
It's this guy who brings them back from Mexico.
They're... They're way cheaper.
I'm just... I'm trying to save money.
It's okay. Is there a way we can get a sample?
Do you have any at home?
Um... I have a vial in my purse.
I had it with me.
(sniffles)
It's right here.
(mumbles)
I'm sorry. I know they're in here.
It's okay.
There.
Can you get that to toxicology?
Yeah.
You think it's the estrogen?
We'll find out.
Have you had the reassignment surgery yet?
(sniffles)
No. That's what I'm saving up for.
CHUNY: Hey, Abby, can you wait till next Wednesday?
They only do gas chromatography once a week.
LOCKHART: Since when?
CHUNY: Since budget cuts.
I love County.
What do you mean you didn't get it?
What do you mean what do I mean?
Do I have to get it myself? No, I'll get it.
Okay, well, it's right there on the desk.
Aren't you the cutest thing?
Yay! (laughs) Oh!
MORRIS: You going soft on me, Frank?
FRANK: Well, look at the face. Oh!
Not doing it for me.
Let me see. Let me see. Here...
No, that's... (clattering on floor)
Hey, Gates, what the hell's the matter with you?
I'll get it. No, I'll get it.
I'll get it. I'll get it. No.
I've got it. Scram.
You've done enough.
Dr. Gates, broken arm kid is ready to go.
All right.
(gasps): Oh, my God, look how cute.
Her name is Purdy.
(laughs)
Ms. Gaines, what are you doing here?
Uh, stretching my legs.
Well, you left me back there for... forever.
You know, I wrote the discharge at 10:00 a.m.
Here's the prescription.
What does it take to send somebody home?
Forget where you work?
Would you mind?
Right this way, ma'am.
Thank you, Miss.
Messenger from Payton picked up your toxicology sample. Okay.
Abby, Lois is vomiting blood.
Suction's on high.
Push the packed cells.
What's happening?
She's bleeding from either her esophagus or her stomach.
She's had FFP? Two units.
Okay, well, call GI.
We're gonna heat coagulate with an endoscope.
All right, hold on, hold on.
Hold on. Let's use Recombinant factor 8-A.
I don't know. It's a brand-new drug.
It can normalize
the PT in 20 minutes if the FFP fails.
Okay, Grand Rounds, your show.
Four migs per kig IV push.
Okay.
Sensitivities on Sheryl Hawkins.
Cultures came back positive for Acinetobacter.
Resistant to vanco, imipenem, linezolid, everything.
What are you doing?
Calling ID.
There must be another drug. Something that will...
No, Neela, there's not.
She is septic.
If we can't treat this, we're gonna lose her.
I understand that.
Then why are you not upset?
Well, who says that I'm not?
I simply don't feel the need to indulge it.
So what do you suggest I do then?
I suggest you take a deep breath, gather yourself
and go back in there and find out how aggressive
she wants us to be.
(chart thudding)
Hey, there.
Hey.
How you feeling?
Same.
Uh, Is and Os look good.
How's the PCA working out?
You in any pain?
No.
Should that have changed?
Not necessarily.
You already did your rounds.
Why are you back?
I've been here a month.
You never just check in.
Well, there's a first time for everything.
Neela...
I'm a mother of four.
Do you really think I don't know
when someone's not telling the truth?
Where's your family?
Getting lunch.
Well, you should get them back.
NG output has slowed down.
Looks like your factor 8-A worked.
Repeat CBC and coags.
Abby, this is Mr. Landry.
And a Dr. Jensen called.
Said he'd try your cell. Mike?
MIKE: Edith? I told you not to come.
Hemoglobin's 10. You said you were at the hospital.
I thought you got hurt. It's okay.
Keep her NPO. I'm fine.
D5 half at 125 an hour. What's going on here?
If you're okay, what are you doing?
Mr. Landry, I'm Dr. Lockhart. And maybe
you two might want to talk about this outside, okay?
Chuny, can you show them to the Family Room?
MARQUEZ: Sure thing.
Want to follow me this way, please.
Okay, check a KUB for NG placement.
Well, this case just got a lot more interesting,
didn't it? You got this?
Absolutely.
Hi.
Dr. Jensen. Hi.
Listen, I really appreciate you running that for me.
Our lab is... it's a mess.
You know.
Yeah, about that.
I need to ask you for a favor.
Um, yeah.
I was hoping
that you'd give me one more day to make a decision.
Yeah, I know. I know.
I... I...
Right now?
No, you're right.
You're right. I... yeah.
Um...
I accept.
Yeah.
I'll take the job.
Sat's only 77 on 100%.
Lungs are wet.
Send a blood gas and get her on a non-rebreather.
Translation, please.
The infection is causing fluid
to collect in your lungs.
So, what now?
Without a breathing tube,
your oxygen will continue to drop
and you'll...
eventually fall into a comatose state.
Get the tube.
Okay, then.
Give me the tube.
You don't think it's a good idea?
You won't be able to talk.
(breathing laboredly)
You got a point there.
Sheryl,
if we put this tube in, we may never get it out.
So I shouldn't even try to get better?
It's not a matter of trying.
The antibiotics aren't working.
Maybe my immune system
can fight infection on its own.
It would take a miracle.
I believe in those.
I need to be sure
you understand exactly what I'm saying.
If I don't try...
what does that say?
That's what I teach my kids?
(breathing laboredly)
Put the bed...
Can you put the bed up?
(bed whirring)
I want you to be
in my blog.
You can't say no.
Can't say no.
Chrissy.
Okay.
(panting): Hi.
Hi, everyone.
(wheezing): This...
is the beautiful
and talented
Dr. Neela Rasgotra.
She's the one
always avoiding the camera.
(chuckles)
She saved my life.
Don't you say that!
What the hell am I supposed to say, Edie?!
Huh?! Excuse me.
We got the toxicology results back.
It's not great news.
Okay.
The estrogen you've been injecting contains
tetrachloroethane.
It's an organic solvent extremely toxic to the liver.
How can we fix it?
The medicine I gave
is only a temporary fix.
It's okay to look at me, Dad.
Lois...
(sobbing)
Lois...
I don't think your liver can recover from the damage.
We've already seen bleeding complications,
encephalopathy.
If it's very serious, it can cause seizures,
a coma or death.
So what do we do?
Your best hope is for a liver transplant.
Transplant?
How do we do that?
There-there's some kind of list, right?
Yes, um, but that could take a long time.
There's something called LDLT.
If a family member or friend is a tissue match,
they can donate a portion of their liver.
Siblings have the highest odds of being a match.
We don't have any other children.
The odds are also good for a parent.
Yeah, we're not doing that.
Let's go. Mike...
Damn it, Edith, no!
We're leaving!
(sobbing)
Mr. Landry,
please. Please what?
You're her only parents.
You already lost her once... How many times
I gotta say no?
Well, you're just gonna walk out of here and let her die?
I'll do it. Edith!
I'll do it.
Test me.
Frank... Hmm?
um, if you're not too busy,
could you help me with something?
Well, I need somebody big and strong
to help me put a box on a shelf in Sutures.
Okay, Sam.
Chivalry's not dead.
Oh, I have to forward the phones.
All right, and last but not least,
first trimester bleed, ultrasound
and quant beta HCG pending.
Hey, so I heard you made the short list for chief.
All right.
When's your final interview? Next week.
You ready? You got your game face?
Yeah, I'm good.
So where you going anyway?
It's personal, Morris.
Oh, okay,
international man of mystery.
All right, it's Betina.
She needs a few things and it can't wait till my shift's over.
Post-op things.
Cupcakes worked, didn't they?
It's cool.
You don't have to give me credit. My advice worked.
I know you know.
And I know you know I know.
Hey, Pratt. Hey.
Did you talk to Anspaugh?
I haven't had a chance yet. Why?
'Cause I took the other job. What?!
Why would you do that?
Because they wouldn't give me another day.
And it's a really good job.
All right, look, I got to go,
but when I get back, we're going to fix this.
Okay, everyone, let's get started.
The five-year war in Iraq
hasn't yielded any weapons of mass destruction,
but it has given us some advances
in trauma resuscitation.
Hemostatic resuscitation
is about replacing coagulation factors
and platelets early.
So, soldiers who received plasma on a one-to-one ratio
with PRBC transfusion have lower mortality.
Lights, please.
TAGGART: Ooh, you're such a tiger.
(Gates roaring) (Taggart moaning)
GATES: What'd you call me?
TAGGART: I called you a tiger.
GATES: Say it louder. Yeah.
Tiger! What?
Yes! That's my kind of presentation.
Ooh! That's the tiger...
That's right. Ooh, come to Mama.
Hey.
Hi. I got everything.
Drainable pouches,
no-sting prep wipe, stomahesive powder.
You romantic fool.
So, you need anything? I got to get back.
Um, more water? Sure.
There you go. Oh, with ice, please.
Sure. No problem.
Is there anything else I can get you?
Kiss, please.
So, I was thinking...
I should stay here for a few days.
Why?
Look, we both know
that you shouldn't be alone right now.
I can sleep here on the couch,
and tend to your every need.
And not because I'm supposed to,
but because I want to.
Get it?
Got it.
Good.
Come here.
Mmm.
I missed you, Mama.
I missed you, too.
Mrs. Landry,
we got your lab results back.
And they show that you are a tissue match.
Oh, thank God.
How soon can we do it? We can't.
The tests also show that you have cirrhosis.
I used to be a drinker,
but I thought I was okay. I haven't been sick.
You are okay now,
but it's too risky for you to donate.
Mr. Landry...
Don't even say it.
Mike.
V tach. No pulse.
She's still ours!
Charge to 300!
That is not my kid!
Clear! Clear! I don't know
who that is!
MARQUEZ: No change. Mike! 360.
Standby with epi and lidocaine. Okay, clear. Don't you walk out of here!
She's still ours, Mike!
Pulseless V tach.
All right.
Continue compressions, intubation,
get 8.0 ET tube and suction.
Chuny, what was her last creatinine?
MARQUEZ: 2.9.
All right, push an amp of calcium.
That's not in the algorithm for... Just push it.
MARQUEZ: It's not in the crash cart.
What are you thinking-- hyperkalemia?
EDITH: Hyper what?
MARQUEZ: Abby. LOCKHART: Too much potassium.
I thought you said it was her heart.
She's had six units of blood; that's a huge potassium load.
And if she's in hepatorenal syndrome...
Her kidneys can't clear it and her heart will stop.
(gasping): Oh, God.
Calcium's in. All right, hold compressions.
Got a pulse.
Nice work, Abby.
Amp of D50, amp of bicarb, ten units of insulin.
Pressure at 100/60.
(gasping): Oh, thank God.
Oh, thank you.
Great work, guys.
LOCKHART: All right, send out a chem panel and call renal.
(sobbing)
Uh... he's okay now, right?
Lois is in critical condition.
She's going to keep arresting or die until she gets a new liver.
Hey, what's up, man?
What are you doing out here?
Oh, it's slow. Just taking a breather.
So how'd that trauma conference go?
(chuckles) Oh, probably the best one ever.
Really? Oh, yeah.
Mm. Wow.
How's Betina?
Ah, she's a little sore, but she'll be all right.
You did the right thing going back to her.
Well, actually, it's weird.
You know, I've never felt like this before.
I used to think that falling in love was like...
getting sick or something.
(chuckling): So you try to avoid it, right?
Yeah, I know what you mean.
You know, I was thinking about, uh,
that thing that happened to you.
You know, that hostage thing?
Oh, yeah?
Yeah, well, you know how those things like that go.
I mean, you keep thinking about 'em even when you don't want to.
So... if you want to talk, man,
it's cool with me.
What, what is there to talk about?
I don't know.
It's just sometimes it helps.
I know I've had to do it.
So, if... you want, you could talk to me
or somebody more qualified.
There's no shame in that.
(sighing): You know, I-I already did
their mandatory little psych debrief.
I don't need it.
I'm... I'm good.
All right, cool.
I'll see you inside.
Oh, that's right, tiger, yes, yes.
(laughter)
No way.
We kid you not. It was great.
Didn't know you had it in you, Tony.
Yeah, well, now you do.
You all do.
Sorry, still doesn't look like sex to me.
Oh, my favorite part was the linen cart.
All right, you know what? Whoa!
There, you got us.
Gates is my boyfriend.
Are you happy now?
Show's over.
Now go back to work.
Yeah, what she said.
(laughter)
Hey, cover for me, will you?
I got to go see Uncle Donnie.
Sure, mate, been covering all day.
Why stop now?
Dr. Brenner, we're ready to present.
Ah, the dutiful, young fourth-years.
I'm all ears. Present away.
56-year-old woman with a history...
Let's start with the chief complaint
that brought her in.
Okay, uh, chief complaint is headache, backache,
nausea, dizziness...
That's four complaints,
so go back and find what the biggest problem is.
Kaya, take a look at the nosebleed in 2.
We're going to pack it together.
Okay.
Dr. Brenner.
Yes?
Why are you treating me like this?
Look at me.
What the hell was last night, huh?
Boring.
To be honest, dull, mundane, mechanical.
Thank God I had two bottles of Bordeaux in me.
You know, I don't know why I thought
that you'd be a better student
in bed than you are here,
but I guess the Bordeaux helped with that as well.
You don't want to see me, fine,
but you still have to teach me.
Well, for that to be possible, my dear,
you would actually have to have the ability to learn.
I could get you fired for this.
Really?
And risk sullying that spotless reputation to become
the student that sleeps with attendings
and then rats them out?
That? That would be something, wouldn't it?
(sighs)
You can fill out all the admit papers up in the ICU.
Nurse Marquez will show you there.
I think she's saying thank you.
Uh, hey, Mr. Landry, can I talk to you for a second?
You know, the people you love,
they can't always help who they are, and they do stuff
we don't understand,
but you have to just try and get past that,
especially when they need you.
Okay, um...
okay, there is a clinical trial.
It's called a bioartificial liver...
Okay.
Okay.
I'll donate if I can.
(sighs)
How do I get tested?
We can do it here.
(clipboard clanks lightly)
(typing)
(music playing, laughter) SHERYL: I'm home! I'm home! I'm home!
Baby, baby, baby.
Come here, my love, come here.
* Ah, ah, ah, ah. *
You got no moves, Dad.
(laughing): He's got moves.
Shake it, baby.
CLETUS: Yeah.
(Sheryl laughing)
Those are moves. Oh, yeah.
Those are moves.
Whoo!
CLETUS: Look at Mom move.
(rhythmic clapping)
(laughter)
* Singing, as we danced in the night *
* Remember how the stars stole the night away... *
Family seems to be taking it well.
Should have been an attending there this morning.
The outcome would have been the same.
You don't know that.
I've been operating with you for three years now
and I do know that.
If I had stayed with you,
the patient in the ICU would have died.
What, so instead it's Sheryl?
Look, you're emotional because you got close to the patient.
That's okay, but it's clouding your judgment.
You know, if wanting her
to get the best possible treatment is clouded,
then, yes, you're right. Neela,
Neela... You could have approached the perf differently.
Neela... I can't even be sure
I got all the abscesses.
Stop now, okay?
I know what it's like to be close to a patient,
but you're not a little intern anymore,
and I expect you to handle bad outcomes like a professional.
What does that mean?
That I should stop giving a damn?
No, it means that no matter how much we care,
sometimes the people we try to save die.
Are you trying to rationalize this?
'Cause we both know
you should have never left that room this morning.
That's enough.
Please.
There are more patients
than there are doctors in this place,
and I can't be everywhere.
None of this should be news to you.
This is the job.
(sighs)
Oh, Abby,
Exam 2 lady finished her Dilantin load.
Okay, she can be dispo'd.
Thank you.
Take care. You, too.
(clears throat)
Laverne, you know how to bury the knot?
Okay, just start at the base of the wound,
sub-Q, good,
and now go sub-Q to the other side.
There you go.
Gives you better approximation and cosmesis.
Thank you, Dr. Lockhart.
Sure.
Hey, Abby, wait up.
So I talked with Anspaugh.
Yeah, I told you I already took the...
Yeah, I know, I know, I know.
Just hear me out, okay?
(knocking)
Hi.
I'm not interrupting, am I?
No, not at all.
I was, uh...
hoping maybe you had a little time next week.
To talk.
Where have you two been?
Nowhere. Exam 3.
Dr. Gates, GYN has a bed,
but they can't take your PID for two hours.
All right, everybody, listen up.
I have a wonderful announcement to make.
It is with great pleasure
to introduce Dr. Abby Lockhart, our newest attending physician.
(cheering and applause)
Cider, anyone?
What happened? You're staying?
Yeah, wild horses.
TAGGART: Congrats, Abby.
Glutton for punishment, huh? Guess so.
A party? Of course no one told me.
No, Abby's the new attending.
Oh, that's great. Way to go. Thanks.
Frank, how about a little for me, huh? Me, too.
Yeah, just cool your jets, everybody.
Hey, Luka, I thought I'd catch you.
Um, I know I'm gonna see you in a little bit
when you come to pick up Joe,
but I just wanted to tell you that I got the job at County.
Thought you'd want to know.
