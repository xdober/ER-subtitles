Previously on ER:
I'm a third-year resident.
The tube gauze is in Exam Two, center cabinet.
Thanks.
In my line of work, I see you guys get hurt
and killed.
So you worry about me?
This disease is invariably fatal.
Well, there must be some sort of experimental treatments.
Right? Trials?
But it's so quiet with Luka away,
and besides, I could use some free babysitting.
I guess Joe needs to get to know his Auntie Neela.
(Joe crying) Aw...
Come on. Come on.
Aw, Joe.
Eat some food.
No, come on, you love bananas.
Come on.
No?
Want some of these?
(phone ringing)
Come on. Want me to get that?
Um, no, it's probably Tanya,
calling to say she's stuck in traffic.
Hello.
Hi, Tanya, I was just going to call you.
RASGOTRA (sing-songy): Hi, Joe.
The doctor?
Well, y-you didn't tell me he was sick.
LOCKHART: No, n-n-n-n-no.
Of course, of course.
No, I understand, you should.
I'll just, um, I'll call my neighbor.
Okay, let me know how he's doing.
Her kid has pneumonia, she might be out all week.
What are you doing? I'm looking for...
(crying loudly)
...um, Miriam's number,
'cause maybe she can watch Joe.
Well, I'll watch Joe.
I don't-- you know, I swore I had it on the fridge.
I'm serious, I'll watch Joe.
I don't need you to watch Joe,
I need to find the friggin' number.
You're having a meltdown. I'm not having a meltdown.
A meltdown involves throwing things.
This is like a pre-meltdown.
You know, sorry, sorry,
I get, I get that Luka's father had surgery,
all right? But, you know,
the chemo could take, like, six months, and we have a life here.
Joe could be walking soon.
Meltdown. I'll watch Joe.
LOCKHART: No, you need to rest.
I'm fine, look.
See?
He, he-- I know he loves me.
He loves me, he loves me, Joe.
(Pratt and Betina kissing, moaning passionately)
PRATT (laughing): Oh, baby.
Oh... that was nice.
Mm, yeah, really nice. Oh, baby.
(both sighing)
Mm...
We should get to work.
Why? What's up?
Nothing.
(grunts)
Hey... what's up?
I'm fine.
Come on, what?
What, you didn't, uh...?
Of course I did.
Betina?
You didn't.
Okay, so I didn't.
(huffs)
But it's no big deal.
No, no, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Look, I know this is hard to talk about, okay...
Greg, let it go.
But if you didn't have one, why would you say you did?
I'm a woman, it's easier.
It's easier to lie?
Well, kind of.
What's "kind of" supposed to mean?
DAWN: Dr. Pratt, we got a syncopal kid over here.
Go. We'll talk about it later.
DAWN: 16-year-old passed out
after two days of vomiting and diarrhea.
Where's Moretti?
At a conference. You and Morris are running the floor.
Okay. Finn Andrews,
16 years old, no evidence of trauma,
pulse: 122, BP's 93/45.
There's a bug going around his school. Access?
20 gauge in the hand. Any medical history?
I'm okay. My son's always been healthy.
All right, come on, let's go. I'm Dr. Pratt.
It's probably just dehydration from a stomach virus.
All right, so you're not enrolling
the pediatric cohort now.
I got that.
No, listen, this kid would be perfect for the IGF-1 trial.
You're not listening here.
That's not good enough.
He doesn't have six months, okay?
No, no, I want you to have Dr. Subrin call me
and I want to hear it from him.
Got it? (doorknob rattling)
Sarah!
Tony?
What are you doing here?
I ran away.
What?!
What's the matter with you? I told you I was gonna
visit in a few weeks, didn't I?
Yeah, but I couldn't wait that long.
You know what could have happened to you?
I'm fine.
You're fine, yeah, you're fine now.
You know what?
Your grandparents are probably worried sick about you.
Don't call them!
Please, Tony?
I told them that I was having a sleepover at Janet's.
Janet's in on this, too?
I told them that we were going to the mall today
and that I was staying there last night.
Sarah, you're killing me.
You know, I have to be at work right now.
I'll come with you.
We can talk about it there.
No, you stay right here, okay?
You stay here, I'll call you later, and we'll discuss this.
Stay here!
And lock the door.
Copy that, 42's.
Repeat vitals.
All right, we'll see you in five.
Double trauma on the way.
GSWs-- belly and chest.
One's a little shocky.
They're cops. Okay, clear the trauma rooms,
alert the blood bank and the OR.
Got it. Dr. Morris. FRANK: ER.
I got a pregnant woman I need to present.
Well, for the guy that picked up temporal arteritis
on a lady with an earache and can do a three-layer closure,
I'll hear anything. Shoot.
Morris, line two. Well, take a message.
I'm schooling my favorite intern.
It's your cousin from Iowa, he says it's important.
Give it to me quick.
I got a 29-weeker with vomiting and abdominal pain.
Bolus a liter of NS, page OB, then meet me outside.
We got a double trauma coming in.
Don't tell me you got another DUI, Johnny.
Now even Randi's not available.
Well, if you're that hard up, why don't you call Jerry? What?
Maybe he wants to work. Didn't you hear? He moved to Alaska.
He's slinging pitchers of beer somewhere outside Anchorage. No way.
Well, then you're on your own.
No duh.
I can't believe this.
DAWN: 1,000 cc's in.
PRATT: All right, let's hang another liter.
Feeling any better?
FINN: No, not really.
I have a wrestling match
next week.
I need to get better.
Do you think I should call his father?
He lives in Ohio, but he could get here in a few hours.
My chest feels funny.
You're having pain?
FINN: It's pretty bad.
He's in v-tach.
DAWN: No carotid, lost the pulse.
All right, let's charge to 360.
What's happening? Clear.
Still v-tach. Starting compressions.
Charge again. Finn, please wake up!
Standby with epi.
(Pratt breathing heavily)
Lockhart, I need you to jump on this!
Good morning to you, too.
(tires screeching)
You all right?
I'm fine.
We got two auxiliary cops down.
What the hell is that? They're volunteers
out of our precinct
without the badge. Who's with me on this?
Grady. I don't know if this is such a good case for an intern.
It's a great case.
What about Pratt?
Pratt's busy with a kid in v-tach.
We'll be fine. 20-year- old female,
through and through GSW
to the right upper quadrant, 90/62,
tachy at 120 after a liter.
How's the other one? Stable chest wound.
Larry, you're with me.
You two, chest wound.
Left lateral chest.
.22 caliber casing at the scene.
Vitals? BP's up to 110 after a liter.
All right, Grady, what's the pulse ox?
Oh, I don't... it's not picking up.
Move the probe. Oh, it hurts like hell.
Okay, let's go.
MARQUEZ: Systolic's 120 with the second liter.
C-spine is non-tender.
No elevated JVD.
They let you guys work without vests?
No guns, no vests.
We're volunteers.
Breath sounds are equal.
Will you be quiet?
It's a way for some of us
to get in and others to give back.
MARQUEZ: Hemocue 13.2.
I don't know what happened.
We were just walking our beat...
We came across this guy.
(groans)
He looked wrong.
Exit wound near the inferior scapula.
Grady, set up the thoraseal.
Um, right. It's in the cabinet.
Second line is in. On it.
He was trying to carjack some woman.
He had a gun to her and he was pulling her out of her car.
Belly's soft, non-distended.
Femoral pulses two plus.
They told us in training
if we ever saw someone with a gun...
...not to get involved.
Hanging another liter of NS.
But what were we gonna do?
Grady, the cabinet underneath the sink.
There could have been a kid inside.
Who knows? Other sink.
LOCKHART: Decreased breath sounds on the left.
OFFICER: W-What's that mean?
He probably has a collapsed lung.
GRADY: X ray's back.
Um...
lung's down, hemopneumo.
Chest tube tray.
Got it ready. I can... Can I put it in?
Yeah.
Sir, we need your arm
up here like that. Ow, ow.
All set-- seven and a half gloves.
Yeah, that tube's
not sterile. What?
You just contaminated the whole tray.
I'll get another one.
Right. Sorry.
LOCKHART: Just keep your gloves on.
Hey, Josh.
Come on, come on.
How's it going?
The Cubs are down two in the ninth.
Oh, yeah?
Columbia is enrolling patients into a minocycline study.
Yeah, did I tell you my mom's applying to medical school?
(chuckles)
Listen, I talked to the guys at Hopkins
and we're trying to get you into the IGF-1 trial.
IGF-1? What's that?
Insulin-like Growth Factor.
Yeah, it could, uh, protect the nerve cells
and slow down the progression of the disease.
When can he start?
Soon, I hope, I just...
have to get through some red tape.
I'm... working it out.
Oh, that's wonderful.
Yeah.
All right, I have to make my rounds.
You, uh, here, take this.
Keep your weight up, keep you off the vent.
Okay?
(groaning)
I'm in.
Is Goldstein okay?
Okay, widen the hole for the tube.
(groans)
She caught the worst of it
and she's only been out there for three months.
Okay.
Aim it up to the apex.
Second hemocue's 13.
(groaning)
It just goes in a few centimeters, then stops.
Let me see.
Okay, 'cause you're tracking under the muscle.
You want to get in between the ribs.
Oh!
It just doesn't want to go through.
It's all right, relax.
Use your finger to guide it in.
Why don't you just do it?
No, go ahead, keep trying, go.
Oh, he's killing me.
You did fine last time with Moretti.
Yeah, I know, it's just...
She makes me nervous.
Me?
Forget it.
I shouldn't have said anything.
Well, the inflammation of his pancreas
caused his calcium level to drop.
That's why his heart stopped?
But he'll get better?
Yeah, but pancreatitis is rare for someone his age.
It's often associated with excessive alcohol use.
I don't drink.
Well, does anybody in your family have gallstones?
Not that I've ever heard about.
Whoa.
Hey, wait... look at this.
See this area of black?
Looks like there's a cyst in the pancreas.
And it's big.
Should I take him for a formal scan?
No, he's too unstable, I don't want to risk
another bout of v-tach off the floor.
Page radiology to come do an ultrasound
and get surgery down here.
Good chest tube placement, but his sats are down,
he still has decreased breath sounds.
Something's not right.
What would you do, Grady? Me?
Maybe there's an occluding clot.
If we strip the tubing,
it might clear the obstruction.
Yeah, good. Do it.
I think he needs a second tube.
(coughs)
Sats are up to 96.
Looks like it was a clot.
MORRIS: Always a good thing to check, Abby.
(coughing)
Why am I coughing?
Uh, your lung's expanding.
That's good. So he's okay now?
Well, if there's not too much bleeding,
we can put the tube back in,
and, uh, his lung will heal.
Dr. Morris, can't get a BP here.
Okay, move him to Exam Two, repeat portable chest,
and set up for ultrasound.
(coughing)
Why didn't you mention tubing earlier?
Didn't think of it until Dr. Morris asked.
I told you, you make me nervous.
Well, we're gonna have to work together
without you getting brain freeze.
My brain works fine when you're not in the room.
Well, I'm going to be in the room,
so you're gonna have to figure out a way
to handle it. Will you stop yelling at me?
I'm not yelling at you,
I am trying to teach you. Your tone's not helping.
What do you want, to be breast-fed?
MORRIS: Abby, I need you in here!
You need to get on your game.
I'm trying. Try harder.
MORRIS: Get in here!
Got a flash. Saline's primed and ready.
Right upper quadrant is soft,
liver hematoma is not impressive.
Something else is going on.
Liver looks stable, spleen is good,
pelvic view is unremarkable.
Subclavian's in.
Hang a unit here.
DUBENKO: Could this be an allergic reaction?
MORRIS: No, she didn't get anything.
Uh, set up for intubation.
Eight oh tube?
Mind if I try?
LOCKHART: Don't start yet.
This is Sergeant O'Malley.
She runs the auxiliary program.
O'MALLEY: Lauren and Tim are
my trainees. You guys need an extra set of hands?
No, it's crowded enough already.
Bag her up, guys. Bag her up.
Is she gonna be okay?
She would be,
if you guys had given her a vest.
It's not in the budget.
They're neighborhood patrol.
They're just supposed to call in if anything looks suspicious.
Well, they didn't.
You put them out there with nothing.
You didn't back them.
You didn't support them.
Not her fault, Morris.
Of course it is.
Would you, would you send a soldier to war
without the right armor?
Oh, wait, we did that, too.
(voice breaking): You don't need to make me feel any worse.
These are like my kids.
Well, you didn't look out for them!
Nice work. Whoa.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What's happening?
What's going on?
Systolic's up to 130.
Hemoglobin steady at 12.9.
I guess your crashing patient isn't crashing.
She... she was completely unstable.
When did her BP drop? Ten minutes ago.
Mm-hmm. What were you doing?
Starting a second line.
It was all vagal.
Wha-what? My blood pressure dropped?
Yes.
Some people get low blood pressure
when they get stuck by a needle.
I fainted the last two times I gave blood.
Try taking a better history next time, Morris.
I prefer not to get stat-paged just because a patient swoons.
She was unconscious.
Hey, how's Neela?
Uh, she's drinking all my coffee.
Maybe I'll stop by and see her later.
He's got a large pseudocyst obstructing the duct.
It needs to be drained immediately. Okay.
Hey, Dawn, can you call surgery again?
Right away, Dr. Pratt. Thank you.
I'm having an operation?
Yeah, well, we need to get rid of that fluid.
Actually, Dr. Pratt, can I...?
Yeah. Excuse me.
Um... Yes.
These can be drained internally
with endoscopic ultrasound.
I'm between cases
and would be happy to do it.
Endoscopic ultrasound?
I never heard of that before. We did a study.
And the complication risk is lower
than an external drainage.
I see.
And how do I know that you're not just faking your data?
One point four percent
complication rate for endoscopic drainage
versus 18% if done externally.
You're gonna let me do this procedure or not?
Do your thing.
Dr. Pratt!
(groaning) 32-year-old male.
Single GSW to left thigh.
Get off of me!
Shut up already.
He shot the two auxiliary cops.
Please, get me out of here.
These two guys are gonna kill me.
What are his vitals?
Tachy to 118, BP 155 over 84.
Did he you give him any pain medicine?
Nobody gave me jack.
All right. Hey, Sam.
I need CBC, type and cross,
five of morphine, and bolus
a liter of NS, okay? Come on, let's go.
Dawn, will you jump on this?
You, come with me.
Hey, Morris.
This is for that consent.
Yeah.
We, uh... we sent Lauren to CT.
Make sure there's no internal bleeding.
Good, that's good.
Tim seems stable but,
you know, we need to observe him.
This shouldn't have happened.
Lauren just started.
Tim hasn't even been with us six months.
How long has the program been around?
A year.
I saw it work in New York, I thought it'd be good here.
Took Lauren under my wing,
Tim... phft!
I found him lying in the middle
of Halsted one night, crashing from meth.
Told him to go home, he didn't have one.
When I started the program, he wanted to join.
Who better to clean up the streets
than someone who knew them?
Well, hopefully, they'll pull through.
Lieu...
How they doing?
The mayor's office wants an update.
Well, when Lauren comes back down from CT,
we'll want to monitor her closely.
We're gonna admit her for observation.
For how long?
A couple of days, maybe...
LOCKHART: Hey, get out of the way!
Dr. Morris, expanding liver hematoma
and her pressure dropped again.
You sure it's not vagal again?
No procedures, no new needlesticks.
Okay, uh... get me the ultrasound.
Dropped her crit to nine.
From 13?
FRANK: This is the girl's father.
Oh my God, Lauren, baby. Run in two units.
Larry, get Dubenko back down here.
How did this happen? She was on patrol, sir.
There was a carjacking nearby-- Patrol?
What do you mean "patrol"?
Your daughter is a volunteer cop.
What the hell is that?
She's a college student.
Well, she works for us part-time. Hey, hey, what are you doing?
What are you doing? Hanging the blood.
She never told me that. You opened your line to the saline,
not to the patient-- here!
Not getting any of it.
I'll fix it.
(equipment clanging) Come on!
Uh, Dr. Lockhart, I think...
Why don't you just fix the blood and go outside and work
on your charts... No, he can stay. He'll learn.
Surgery's on their way. Is my daughter okay?
MORRIS: Uh, the hematoma
doesn't explain the big drop in crit. Yeah, I agree.
Dr. Lockhart, I swear... But the spleen is intact...
Is my daughter gonna be okay? Tachy at 120.
Dr. Morris, you know what?
Somebody answer me, damn it!
We don't know, now move back!
Okay, come on! Please,
Sir. Shh!
Morris, look, she's oozing
from her old I.V. sites.
Coagulopathy!
I've been trying to tell you that.
Okay, send off platelets
and a DIC screen.
You gotta be bold in the trauma room.
You have something to say, speak up.
Dr. Morris, we got the shooter
in the other room.
Dr. Pratt is asking for another set
of hands. I'll go.
No, I'll take it.
I think you guys got this under control.
See, this is why I don't like to date cops--
because you never know when they're getting
in a shootout with some scumbag.
I never shot anyone before.
Yeah, well, you should have killed that guy
for what he did to those volunteers.
Yeah, well, it's not that easy, Sam,
pulling the trigger...
even if it is the right thing.
Yeah, I know.
I know it's not.
Yeah, they're gonna take my gun away,
make me talk to some shrink.
That's just protocol.
You are gonna be back on the streets in a week.
Yeah, you're right.
Oh.
Sorry.
What's up?
We, uh, you have an emphasemic
on bi-pap coming up to the unit?
Oh, yeah, I, uh, I got the chart.
Uh, you know what?
I'll be right back with you.
Were you just sucking face with Barney Fife?
No.
For information about the shooting,
you need to contact our media relations office.
Here's the emphasemic.
Thanks.
Hey, uh, your kid's 14, right?
Yeah.
I have a hypothetical for you.
Say, say he ran away, right,
across state line, to a friend's house.
Um, do you know how much trouble
that friend would be in?
Hypothetically?
Yeah, just for instance. Oh, good.
'Cause for a second I thought maybe Sarah ran away
from her grandparents and she's at your house.
Damn, all right, we'll talk about this later.
Tony, send her home.
Dr. Dubenko,
uh, I heard that you did your, uh,
trauma fellowship at Hopkins, right?
Not a good time, Dr. Gates, I'm really busy.
You know Dillon Subrin in neurology?
Look, we got two wounded cops, we got a shooter
in the other room, Gates. Yeah, listen,
your friend's the head of an IGF-1 trial.
And they closed enrollment,
I have this kid up in ICU,
nice kid, single mom--
What happened?
This time it's for real.
LOCKHART: Dropped her pressure and her crit.
Okay, call upstairs and tell them to get an O.R. ready.
Uh, there's another problem.
MORRIS: DIC.
She needs fresh frozen plasma before you cut into her.
I'll give FFP in surgery. Hold on,
the PT and PTT are normal.
That's not really consistent with DIC,
now, is it? Could be a dilutional coagulopathy.
Or a platelet problem?
No, her count's over 300,000.
She's got plenty, but they might be bad platelets.
Maybe they can't clump and clot. Hey, you know what?
We don't have time for a lecture on hematology, Gates.
I'll cover all the bases-- give her FFP,
give her platelets in the O.R.
GATES: That's not gonna help
if it's von Willebrand's disease,
She's lacking the factor for platelet adhesion.
Are you doing a bleeding time? Yeah,
I've seen a lot of coagulopathy up in the ICU.
If it's over ten minutes, then we have the diagnosis,
and we can treat her without surgery.
That's all it takes. Ten minutes.
Pressure's up after the second unit.
Okay, hang another two. You got ten minutes, Gates.
(groaning) All right.
Please, just kill me.
Don't worry.
If our guys die, I will.
Did you hear that? He's threatening me.
I didn't hear anything.
Hold still, I can't find the dorsalis pulse.
Come on, Officer,
please move back! Hey,
I'm not moving anywhere. Benny, give 'em some room.
Shut the hell up, okay? Here's the Doppler.
This guy gets two ativan, another five of MS. How do you think
our guys feel with their chests blown open,
and blood everywhere? Stop it!
Distal flow's decreased. Huh?
If you die, they're gonna fill
Move back! a hall for you?
Please, get him out of here!
You're making my job harder!
I'm not gonna ask you again.
Who had to jack someone for ten dollars.
Want me to call vascular?
And radiology. He needs angio.
You jack somebody for ten?! All, right, look...
Back off, Benny.
Come on, man.
Come on, man, come on, come on.
Get him the hell out of here!
That's enough! Stop!
Stop.
(groans)
Whoa, hey, hey!
(shouting)
(equipment clanging and clattering)
Let me at him!
Come on, guy.
(crying)
Oh...
Okay, okay.
Are you hungry?
(crying)
Mmm, yum, yum, yum.
Mm, Joe... (crying continues)
Come on.
Please, please, please, please, come on.
Okay, all right.
Okay, we'll put it away. We'll put it away.
We won't have it.
Lovely. (crying resumes)
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
(crying continues)
There you go.
(crying continues)
Okay. Okay, one second.
One second, should we fold this?
Should we fold this? Look.
This dirty, dirty nappy.
Oh...
OR's ready.
All right, let's go. It's been over 15 minutes.
Hold on, the DDAVP
will increase the von Willebrand factor.
The bleeding will stop, trust me.
Times up, Dr. Gates. Move her out, Lucien.
Wait, just give me a few more minutes. Gates, give it up already.
Look... look at the abdominal wound-- see that?
Look. Stopped bleeding.
That means we have hemostasis. Same with the liver.
We've given her the ability to clot.
WESTON: So she doesn't need surgery?
No, probably not.
We'll admit and monitor closely.
Good pickup, Dr. Gates.
Well, someone tell Moretti.
Maybe he'll let me back down here.
It wasn't that good.
How's my daughter? Out of the woods.
You can go in now. Thank you.
Thank you. Mm-hmm.
Very smooth, Gates.
Well, I've learned a thing or two upstairs.
No point tenderness around the orbit.
Ice it three times a day.
How did you get that?
By being bold.
I was bold.
I'd, uh, dial back on the boldness
if I were you. Excuse me.
Hey. Hey.
Well, your GSW is in room three.
They're prepping his groin now.
Thank you.
So how'd it go in here?
Pseudocyst is drained, his pressure is up,
and, as promised, no complications.
Nice. Told you it'd work.
Hey, Finn, how're you feeling, man?
He's still a little snowed.
Oh, his repeat calcium is up.
That's good.
How does a kid get pancreatitis?
Who knows?
But he'll do a lot better after the anesthesia.
Look at this.
MORRIS: Second chest tube is in, oh, silk.
BP's still 40. LOCKHART: Bag him.
No more bleeding from the chest.
Maybe there's nothing left to drain.
MORRIS: I need ultrasound, let's check his pericardium again.
I thought he was stable.
We were just talking. Sometimes this happens.
Blood in the pericardium.
With no diastolic filling.
Barely has a BP.
Pulse thready.
Come on, Tim.
Uh, pericardiocentesis needle.
What about a thoracotomy tray?
SAM: Do you want to do that?
We're not going to get the clots with a needle.
Prep fast and wide, Grady.
No. No, Grady, no. Heart rate's in the 30s.
Atropine, now.
(sighs)
He's like a son. I can't lose him.
Wait, he's got a rhythm and a pulse.
We can still try a pericardiocentesis.
Penetrating trauma, pre-arrest.
Perfect indication for a thoracotomy, Morris.
Lost his pulse.
Come on.
Okay! Okay.
Come on, Morris, hurry up.
Abby, take it.
What?
You do it.
(crying) Neela's here, come on.
(singing in Hindi)
Come on, Joe, I don't break out my Hindi for anyone, you know.
Come on, who's at the stair?
Who's at the door? Who's at the door?
Look.
Lucien, what are you doing here?
Hi, guys. I bought you some wheat grass
to help build your immune system.
I thought we might do a few yoga postures
for your post-op stiffness.
Do you have anything for crying babies?
I don't know, do I? (crying continues)
Here. Hi, little man.
Here, little man.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
You like planes?
Oh, how about a 747?
(crying)
Oh, where's my copilot?
(cell phone ringing)
There you go.
Oh, it's okay.
It's okay. This is Lucien.
Oh, Dr. Subrin, yeah, thanks for calling me back.
I need a favor.
County has a 13-year-old patient with Fazio-Londe Syndrome.
Yeah, I know Dr. Gates has tried to contact you about the case.
It's okay, buddy. It's okay. Great.
SAM: Unit five and six are up.
We have a pulse with CPR?
Uh, yeah. Good carotid.
Hold compressions.
Looks like asystole now.
Please keep going.
Might be fine v-fib.
Internal paddles. SAM: Charging to 30.
Clear.
Come on, Tim.
No change. Another milligram of epi.
He's already had three milligrams. Then make it four.
Archie.
No, no, don't stop.
Don't stop. Start compressions again.
Do you think we could...
Concentrate on your compressions. Epi's in.
Shock one more time.
Again? One more time.
Clear.
Asystole for sure.
Come on, Tim.
Morris, I think we're done.
Continue compressions.
We repaired the cardiac wound, he just needs more volume.
The heart is full. What about more pressors?
Yes, good idea.
Pressors should have worked by now.
He might still respond to, uh...
Morris, he's been down too long, it's over.
Please, no.
No, no, no, no, no.
Morris, we're done.
(stifled sob)
Hey.
(heavy sigh)
How're you feeling?
Ready for wrestling practice.
I just need to check a few things out first.
Go "Ah."
Ah.
All good?
Actually...
No. No, it's not.
You're bulimic.
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about the calluses on your fingers,
your eroded tooth enamel,
your vomiting caused the pancreatitis.
I had a buddy in high school, he was a wrestler like you.
He had the same problem.
He was always trying to make weight.
Your vomiting caused an electrolyte imbalance
that stopped your heart.
That's nuts.
You could have died.
I didn't.
Not this time.
Dude, it's all good, okay?
I have college scouts looking at me.
So there's some things I have to do.
Everyone that's good has to sacrifice.
But this isn't a sacrifice.
This is a problem.
Nothing I can't handle.
You call this handling it?
You're never going to get into college if you keep this up.
Is that what you really want?
I want to win.
All right, then we'll get you some counseling.
We'll talk to your parents, because if you
stay along this path...
you're gonna lose.
Trust me.
Hi. Hey, good news.
You know the IGF-1 trial at Hopkins?
He's in. When can we start?
Soon, next week.
No.
I'm not going.
Say "thank you," Joshua.
For letting me be a guinea pig on some unapproved drug?
Hey, you're a Cubs fan, come on.
You've got to be an optimist.
I'm a cautious optimist.
Look, honey...
you want to go back to school, don't you?
Finish your thesis?
Well, sometimes you have to do things you don't want to do,
so you get what you want in the end.
You think they have Wi-Fi in Baltimore?
I bet they do.
Fine.
Thank you.
Thank you, Tony.
Hello? This is about me.
(chuckles)
Come on, this is gonna be good, I promise.
All right?
Hey.
Hey.
You talk to him?
Yeah, but I need to call Psych.
Look, about this morning.
(quiet laugh)
You never struck me as someone with self-esteem issues.
I'm not.
Oh. Well, you think it's okay for a man
to get what he wants and you get nothing?
Look, you know,
I've jumped through a lot of hoops for you.
I've asked you out the way you wanted me to ask you out.
I call you when you want me to call you,
but I'm not a mind reader.
Now, if we're going to do this,
we're going to have to do this together.
Next time I will tell you if I don't.
Well, that would help.
Hell, you speak up about everything else.
Guess you're right.
So, dinner... tonight?
Sounds good.
You mean that, or are you just faking?
Oh.
(laughs)
(chuckles)
You believe me now?
Oh.
(chuckles)
(clears throat)
Is there any family I can call?
No.
I'm all he's got.
(sniffles)
Well, he's going to be here for a little while longer,
but then we're going to have to move him, but...
you can stay until we do.
What about the jerk who did this?
Is he going to make it?
He's upstairs right now,
but, uh, tomorrow he'll be transferred to the jail ward.
You know, I see kids die a lot.
Way more than I should.
Just this year, we have had more young people get shot
than God knows when.
But he...
After everything that happened to him
when he was a kid, he was trying to help.
Do you think he died in pain?
No.
Good.
He'd been through enough.
(cries)
DUBENKO: Breathe in...
(Rasgotra inhales)
And out.
(Rasgotra exhales)
And in... and out.
(inhaling and exhaling)
(inhaling)
(exhales)
Wow.
I do feel better.
(clears throat) Yeah?
There's so much healing yoga can do.
Western medicine isn't everything.
You know, when I get better, I might take a class.
Well, they have them in the morning
in the anesthesia conference rooms, Mondays and Wednesdays.
Thanks.
Hey, um, Neela,
about what happened at the wedding...
Oh, Lucien, we were both drunk.
Let me just finish.
I... I may have gotten my fondness
and... respect for you
confused with something else.
And I hope you can forgive
my, uh... inappropriateness.
Oh, my God.
(sighs) Did I do it again?
Where's Joe?
RAGOSTRA: Oh...
He's walking.
(babbles)
Abby will be so...
Pissed off.
She missed it.
Hey.
What are you doing out here?
I figured you'd be home soon, and we'd get something to eat.
All right. What do you want?
Chinese. Chinese it is.
Can we go to the movies after?
No. After we have Chinese food,
I'm going to take you back to Wisconsin.
What?
You changed your mind, didn't you?
You don't want custody of me.
Yes, I do. Come on.
Sarah, sometimes...
Sometimes you have to do things you don't want to do
so you can get what you want in the end.
What is that supposed to mean?
Well, I'm trying to make it so we live together forever,
but if you keep running away, that's not going to happen.
You got to work with me here.
I guess we should probably call them.
I already did.
Chinese?
Yeah.
I'll race you. Come on.
Grady, wait up!
(sighs)
15,000 people die every day.
He was not supposed to be one of them.
It wasn't your fault.
I should have been thinking tamponade.
No, you shouldn't.
The trajectory was nowhere near the heart,
and the first scan showed a normal pericardium.
I should have monitored him.
We were monitoring him.
I just want to go home.
No, you just need to relax in there, okay?
And pay attention to the details.
If the ER feels too overwhelming,
don't worry about it, it's going to get better.
I want to go out with you.
Ever since I mistook you for an intern,
I've been thinking about it.
How about dinner?
A movie, a drink at Ike Ryan's?
I'm married.
You're what?
It's a ring.
Husband. I'm married.
Oh, God, I am such a rube.
It's the details, Grady.
It could save somebody's life.
Maybe get you a date.
Go home.
Jim's getting full honors.
Well, at least there's that.
What happened to you in there?
My dad died.
What?!
Yeah.
I got the call this morning before those cops came in.
Well, why didn't you say something?
We could have covered for you.
What was there to say?
My-My cousin called.
He said...
my dad was in the hospital for a week and keeled over.
You didn't know he was sick?
You mean, does my family talk?
Did my dad say,
"Call my son,
I want him by my side."?
No. No.
That's not the way the Morris family does things.
You know, everything I ever did
was to prove him wrong.
Everything.
He-He said, uh, he was wasting his money on medical school
because he thought I'd never pass, but I did.
He said I'd never find a job at a good hospital,
and I did that.
You know, I had this plan...
(crying): ...to-to pass the boards in a few weeks and...
...and go tell him and say, "Look, I did it...
"you big dummy!
I'm a specialist!"
(sighs)
But it's too late.
Yeah.
He's still laughing at me.
Oh, Morris, I'm sure he was proud.
I mean, maybe he just... didn't know how to say it.
No.
No, he's laughing.
I can still hear him.
He's laughing.
