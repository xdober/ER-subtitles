Previously on ER:
Too much has happened.
I have to move out.
Betina is pushing you away
because she's afraid to depend on you.
If you don't see that, you're an idiot.
I can't reach the Zofran.
I don't know, Sam. What if someone sees us?
They might get the wrong idea.
You've got 14 candidates
going for one attending slot. It'll be gone
before you get a chance to reschedule.
I want to be an attending here
and I think I would be a good one,
so, I was wondering if maybe you could squeeze me in
like tomorrow or the next day
or... I have a few minutes right now.
*
Watch out!
Come on, Marquez. Talk to me!
MARQUEZ: Got the fiber-optic.
There's too much blood and swelling.
Bag him. Was the driver drunk?
Who knows? It was a hit-and-run.
80 systolic.
How about a central line?
Maybe I can try it?
This is not a teaching case.
Yeah, but Dr. Brenner will show his techniques to you.
MARQUEZ: Sats are up. All right, suction
on high.
Well, Laverne, I'm prepping with antibacterial soap.
Don't want any nasty bacteria into the bloodstream
where it could cause a serious infection.
Hi, it's Dr. Gates.
Where's the chopper?
15 minutes?
That's cool. We can wait.
So we got some time to kill.
Uh-huh.
Hi. Hi.
Um...
Luka asked me to pick him up.
Where is he? In the car?
At the park.
He's not downstairs?
I'm supposed to meet him there.
He said you knew. I did know about the park.
I just didn't know he was going to send a courier.
That's all.
He wanted to make sure you packed Joe's pajamas.
They're in there.
Come here, sweetie.
Oh, here we go.
Um, can you just have him, uh...
...drop him off at the hospital tomorrow. Sure.
Okay.
Or, uh, you can do it.
Or whoever.
I'm sorry, Abby.
It's all right.
You ready for crash intubation?
Well, you know me.
I'm always ready.
Oh, God. What?
I already know.
Get over yourselves.
Rebecca Smith, front seat
passenger with PSI.
Tachy at 120.
Systolic up to 110 with a liter.
Pulse ox 95.
Hey, welcome to County.
MORRIS: How's your breathing? It hurts.
Her boyfriend Daniel. The driver. Why isn't he
on a backboard? Refused it. He's got an arm lac.
I'm okay. All right, get a wheelchair.
GATES: Grab a wheelchair.
Come on. No, man.
I'm fine.
I see.
Oh, Abby. Good.
Look, we got a lacrosse ball versus chest waiting on films.
We got a six-year-old kid who ate a live frog.
Chewed or swallowed whole?
Your guess is as good as mine.
And we got a guy who turned blue
from drinking colloidal silver.
Argyria?
I once saw a photographer
who tried to poison himself by drinking...
Wow, wow, Brenner, that's... that's really great.
And I'm pretty sure
that Larry and Laverne would love to hear all about it.
What's the rush, Dr. Pratt?
There's a personal appointment.
Well, how much is she?
Ha, ha, ha.
Luckily your mom gives me a discount.
(chuckles)
Better watch it.
That's Anspaugh's sister you're talking about.
You got a minute? Yeah, but you got to make it quick.
Dr. Pratt, paramedics Yeah?
bring in a 20-year-old, hit-and-run?
Yeah, he's on the second floor in surgery.
Two from the chopper.
One abdomen with guarding.
Call surgery. Upper extremity lacs.
Abby, we need you.
I'm in the middle of something
right now. Uh,
Brenner! Your genius is required.
Thanks, Abby.
Okay. Laverne, Larry,
let's go learn together.
So, what's the word?
What do you hear from upstairs?
Well, you're still in limbo land.
Well, what are they doing?
Well, they're cutting down the list.
Started out with 14.
Now they're down to five,
but you're still standing.
Do you think it looks good?
Yeah, it looks good.
But I wouldn't put all my eggs in one basket.
Well, what does that mean? Do you know something?
Abby, I don't know anything.
But nothing will make them focus on you
like getting another offer.
See you.
MORRIS: Breath sounds clear.
Sats are borderline. She needs a chest tube.
Let's look at the film first.
But with the mechanism and the right-sided...
She's stable. She may not need it.
Need what?
They're trying to decide if you have a collapsed lung.
Yeah, but our X ray vision isn't working.
You were the front seat passenger?
(groans): Yeah.
Must have been going pretty fast.
We found out Daniel's mom might not make it through the night,
so we were trying to get there.
What do you want for labs? Trauma panel,
type and cross four, dip a urine.
What's his mom got?
Cancer.
Is he all right?
Uh, they're still working on him.
I'll go check.
I'll prep the chest just in case.
Fine, but don't cut.
I'll be a resident in two months. Wait for the films.
Come...
No sign of head trauma.
122/72.
Abdomen's non-tender.
Four-centimeter lac.
Neck's clear.
How's she doing?
We're waiting on some labs.
Can I wait with her?
Primary survey's benign.
TAGGART: Hemocue's 15.1.
You can visit as soon as we get a few stitches in you.
Simon, Gates, why don't you guys go clear some patients
off the board.
You sure? We're not done checking him.
I'll finish up here.
Laverne can suture.
Sam, I'm sure Gates could use an assistant.
How long have you and Rebecca been together?
Uh, six years.
People keep telling us to get married,
but who needs a ring, right?
We know how we feel about each other.
I hear that.
You have someone special?
I did, but she moved.
Come on, Doc.
You find the right person, you don't let them get away.
Yeah, well, maybe she wasn't the one.
4-0 nylon interrupted, single layer closure.
One percent with epi okay?
Yeah.
Sorry to hear about your mom.
Yeah.
Hey.
(knocking)
BETINA: It's open.
Hey.
What are you doing here?
My job
was horrible.
I mean the boss would yell, and then he'd be nice.
And then yell he'd yell,
"Jenkins! Jenkins! Get over here."
I mean if I wasn't sick with the flu,
my hair would fall off from stress.
So you started drinking silver?
Colloidal silver.
I mean it's like a natural antibiotic.
It's not a good idea.
Well, I-I thought my sinuses would clear up.
I mean, I had a date last week
and this woman actually thought I was a Blue Man.
Well, you kind of are.
No. I-I mean like, with the group.
You know, Blue Man Group.
Hey, Abby, lacrosse girl's ready to...
Wow. You see that?
I get a lot of "wow"s.
You look like that guy I saw on Oprah.
Is it-it...
Doc, isn't there something I can do?
Yeah, quit drinking it. Yeah.
The silver is deposited into your skin like a tattoo.
There's nothing that can help.
Dr. Morris?
Larry's doing a chest tube.
Give him Solaquin.
What-what is that?
Uh, fading cream. I think it's
what Michael Jackson used.
I told him to wait.
Larry is a free spirit.
(groaning)
All right, a little pain is normal as the tube passes.
(screaming) Wh-what's he doing?
I have the same question. I couldn't find you.
Where's the chest x-ray?
Not back yet. But her sats are down
and she lost breath sounds Okay, stop.
on the right. It could be a contusion.
Go take care of the house and see your mom.
I'm not going anywhere.
Another liter of saline and up the oxygen.
Please, I don't need you here.
I'm not... I'm not gonna leave you.
I'd never do that.
We don't... have...
(alarm beeping)
Yo. What's happening?
Her lung collapsed. Larry, push it!
All right.
Oh, God.
No, no, this is gonna help.
(gasping)
See? Much better.
(coughs) Pulse ox is trending up.
Th-thank you.
Are you all right, baby?
You all right?
Better.
Much better.
I'm not gonna leave. I'll be right back,
all right? Okay.
I'll be right back. Okay.
Hey, uh, I got to call my family
and let 'em know where we are.
Is there a phone or something I can use?
Yeah, front desk. I'll show you.
I asked you not to come.
And what did you expect me to do,
pretend this isn't happening?
You could have sent a card.
It's more your style.
You know why you didn't know I was sick?
Because you never dug deep.
That's not true.
If we weren't talking about who makes the best drinks,
we were talking about the Bulls game.
You never once asked about me.
Oh, come on.
We spent a lot of time together.
Doing what?
Avoiding opening up?
Avoiding getting personal?
Look, I don't... I don't think it was like that.
You're one of those guys
that likes someone on his arm,
but the moment they start opening up their heart,
you freeze.
All right, look, I...
I didn't come here to upset you.
No, you came out of obligation.
So do us both a favor
and get out.
Get out!
So, how's it going?
Oh, pretty good.
Considering Luka moved out.
He what?
Why?
I don't know. These past few months
between my stuff and his dad,
he just needs some time.
And space.
How much space? A lot of space.
I'm sorry.
I'm trying not to freak out about it.
Um, you know, I'm sure things will go back to normal soon.
Why don't we, uh, have dinner tomorrow night?
That would be nice.
Okay. Good. I'll call you, yeah? Okay.
Frank...
here's the chart for gymnast girl.
Did you forget where to put it?
No, I told you I was going to meet you,
but I need another car.
Just wait there.
I should be out of here in an hour.
Yeah, I'm fine. Thank you.
NEWS REPORTER (on TV): Well, Sandra, from the looks of this next story...
You know where I can get some coffee?
it seems Hollywood has come to Chicago. Jumbo Mart.
It's being described as a modern-day Bonnie and Clyde. (sighs)
What did Britney do now?
At about 11:00 this morning, Jumbo Mart's across the street.
a young couple ran into this jewelry store
and robbed the place at gunpoint.
This early stage, there's still a lot more questions
than there are answers right now. As you can see
this is a very active crime scene.
The police have put up the tape.
They're not letting us through...
RASGOTRA: You Americans and your guns.
FRANK: Scumbag kids. That's what too many
"time-outs" gets you.
...Sending the owner of this local favorite
to nearby St. Jude's hospital.
Police right now still are looking for the pair
who got away with an estimated $40,000 worth of diamonds.
FRANK: Sir.
If you wanted coffee, it's that way.
That's okay. I'm good.
Sonosite's ready. That was scary.
You okay?
Yeah, when, uh, when I made my call, the news was on.
Something happened downtown.
A jewelry store was robbed or something.
You saw it on the news?
MORRIS: Spleen looks okay. WESTON: The supermarket
down the street from me just got robbed; so did the gas station.
It's the economy.
People are desperate.
You guys live nearby? In Wheaton.
Wheaton? It's nice out there.
All those old houses.
Yeah, I worked my butt off for a two-bedroom.
Fixed up the kitchen.
He did the roof, too.
I couldn't put a shelf up from IKEA.
Yeah, I wasn't going to pay ten grand
for something I could do myself, you know?
Hey, you got a sec?
What do you need?
It's about an MVC.
MORRIS: Oh, the hit-and-run?
Yeah, the kid's still up in surgery.
Wanted to know if he got a license plate before he passed out.
Okay, uh, find Dr. Brenner.
He worked on him.
Thanks.
You guys all right?
Yeah...
Just thinking about my mom, you know?
I don't know where I should be.
I feel like I need to be here and there.
Get Surgery.
I just called; they're closing up.
Shouldn't be long.
Daniel, please go.
WESTON: Looks like a liver hematoma.
What's that?
Some bleeding around the liver,
usually heals without surgery.
All right. MORRIS: Listen,
Rebecca's going to be a while,
so maybe you should go.
I'm the only family that Rebecca's got.
She's, she's stable.
Take my cell number, okay?
Call me when you get to your mom's.
I'll give you a full update. Daniel...
listen to the doctor.
Dawn, take him out
for Rebecca's admit forms, and you call me.
Okay, I mean it.
Thanks, Doc.
Here. We need Rebecca's doctor's info.
Is this it?
I really got to go.
Yeah, just sign here and here.
Oh, Sam, uh, they ordered a splint
on your carpal tunnel lady in 2. Got it.
He wouldn't let me leave if she wasn't okay, right?
Don't worry.
Dr. Morris knows his stuff.
What're you looking at? None of your business.
Headhunters? What, are you leaving us?
Frank, can you get me the numbers
to Rush, Mercy and St. Joe's?
What, you want to find out who dumped the meth head in 3?
No, it's personal.
Oh, good. Then find the numbers yourself.
REPORTER (on TV): We have an update
on an earlier story. Maybe they caught these guys.
Police have now released a sketch of the wanted suspects
in the jewelry heist downtown.
They're asking if you have any information
to please call their hotline.
Again, the owner of the jewelry store...
Here, this is the hospital number
just in case you can't get a hold of Dr. Morris.
...stable condition; he is expected to survive.
Good luck.
RASGOTRA: What room? FRANK: Trauma 2.
You brought eight units? TAGGART: Whoa, who's bleeding out?
Woman in 2 took a bad turn.
I want four of FFP and a ten-pack of platelets
and hold an OR.
Fourth unit of "O"-neg is up.
Pressure down to 60.
Okay, let's look at the liver again.
Where are we? Rebecca?
Wait, why is the tube in her mouth?
She stopped breathing. Just got the page.
We're swamped up there.
MORRIS: We've got persistent hypotension.
Chest is clean. Whoa.
Oh, God.
What's wrong? What's happening?
Her belly's full of blood. Must've blown a clot.
I thought you said she was all right. She was.
DAWN: We lost the pulse, PEA.
Starting compressions. Thoracotomy tray.
What are you doing? She can't generate a pulse.
We need to open the chest
and clamp the aorta at the diaphragm.
RASGOTRA: If that works, the bleeding stops.
I can take her to the OR
and repair the abdominal injuries.
Sterile drapes. Ten blade.
Come on, baby. Come on.
Really spread them. Like this?
Okay, don't let me close them.
That's the ulnar nerve. Very cool.
I got a kid who fell off a unicycle.
Excuse me. I'm teaching. Can you find a resident?
Hey. What's up, Mommy Dearest?
Unicycle boy, a few leg lacs and a probable fracture.
Pretty uncomfortable.
I see what the problem is.
Your bicycle's missing a wheel.
Very funny.
It hurts. This is Dr. Gates.
All right, can you feel this?
Wiggle your toes. (groans)
Why do you ride that thing anyway?
I'm into all types of weird stuff.
So is she.
All right, I need a tib fib and an ankle, okay?
We're gonna call your parents and get you out of here.
Nah, don't bother him.
My dad's probably snaking a toilet somewhere.
In order to give you an X-ray and meds, we need consent.
I'm consenting.
Where do I sign?
It's the law.
In the meantime, we'll keep you in a splint, okay?
I'll be right back. All right.
$40,000 worth of diamonds.
You know where I'd be with that kind of dough?
Home, with a big bag of chips
watching a ginormous flat-screen?
Bingo.
What else can you do?
Come on. There's got to be something else you can do.
We're going to try, Daniel.
Her aorta's been clamped for 45 minutes.
She's been given a massive blood transfusion.
If she hasn't responded by now, I don't think we can save her.
She was fine an hour ago.
You said I could go.
We, we could explore the right chest.
She's bleeding in the belly.
Then operate on the belly.
What about it?
I can't send a woman without a pulse to the OR.
She's young and healthy.
Yeah, listen to him. Come on!
You don't know Rebecca.
(gloves snapping) Sorry.
No, don't... don't say you're sorry. Keep working!
Neela, Neela.
The guy's mother is dying.
Can we at least give it a try?
RASGOTRA: We've already done everything.
We really have.
No, you haven't.
Whatever's wrong with her,
you're going to fix it.
And-and you're going to fix it now.
Close those blinds.
MORRIS: Daniel, what are you doing?
You! Close those blinds.
MORRIS: Daniel, I'll get it.
You stay there!
Get that.
What about these?
Why are you doing this?
What about these windows? Cover them.
MORRIS: Come on, man.
This doesn't need to happen, Daniel.
You don't need to do this.
Let's just talk for a minute, all right?
Get this one. Come on. Up here, let's go.
There's nothing to... Just do it before I use this!
Use the sheet!
Get up there!
MORRIS: Daniel, look at me. Come here.
Come here, just for a second, please!
You, come here. Help her.
Okay! Okay! Okay!
Daniel, look at me. I think you misunderstood me.
Listen, I need you to operate. Okay, okay.
I want you to do it now.
I am. Now!
Okay.
Here!
Ladies, come on.
You've got to hurry up.
Quickly.
Got it. I've got it.
Let's go. Get down. Operate.
I haven't got the right supplies.
Then get what you need!
Whoa, what are you doing?
What are you doing?!
I'm calling the OR for... No, no, no phones.
Well, then you have to come upstairs with me.
I'm not leaving this room!
She has to.
We don't have a choice!
Fine. Dial.
You do something stupid,
I'm going to use this.
Hello, this is Dr. Rasgotra...
What happened?
Whatever is going on, we can work it out,
I promise you. No, we can't, man.
Yes, we can. We can!
RASGOTRA: I need it right now!
Dawn, prep the belly.
I know you love this woman.
Okay, I know you do,
but if you want to help Rebecca, we need
to take her to the OR! You have to let us
to the OR! Did you hear me?!
I'm not leaving this room!
I'm on the news. They know who I am, all right?
Morris, I need you to assist.
Please, doc, don't push me.
All right.
Listen... what did you do?
Did you, did you hurt someone?
Did you rob someone?
Let me help.
You're the guys from the jewelry store? Oh, my God.
Shut up.
Shut up! Everyone needs to focus on Rebecca!
We're going to do that. We're going to focus on Rebecca,
but I need you to settle down, please.
We're out of masks.
I'll go get some from next door.
No, stop! Where are you going?
Where are you going? Get back here!
Okay! Okay!
We have to have masks.
We have to have them.
I said forget it. All right.
You got to save her.
You got to save her right here.
Right now or no one's leaving.
Okay.
I don't understand why you're even in Chicago.
Oleg Popov was speaking at the Art Institute.
Morphine's on board.
Who's Popov? A clown?
You missed your mathlete competition for a clown?
TAGGART: Five-oh nylon?
Yeah, go for it. You're willing to give up
nationals for a Russian clown?
Dad. Mathlete?
Sounds serious, huh?
MIT's already got their eye on this kid.
Dad, Popov never comes to Chicago.
I thought you were finished with this.
Didn't tightrope-walking across the football field
teach you anything?
You did not.
It was so cool.
All right, I'm going to get a few stitches in here.
Sam, can you check to see if his X-rays are ready?
Sure, I'll check.
Down to the symphysis pubis. Okay.
Okay, let's drop an NG to decompress the stomach.
Why aren't you operating?
Well, we don't have what we need.
It's okay, all right? We're prepping for surgery.
What's going on?
Thank you, Jacy.
Are you guys actually going to...? Yes, we are.
Do you need some help?
Just leave the tray.
Does Crenshaw know about this?
Yes, he does! Now go.
(cars passing)
(murmurs)
How you feeling?
(sighs)
It didn't go exactly as planned.
I had polyps in the distal sigmoid colon.
They couldn't do a simple anastomosis.
So that means a colostomy?
Mm.
No, you can't call it a colostomy.
They removed my entire colon.
I have a loop ileostomy.
Well, that's not that bad.
It's only temporary.
Won't last forever.
It's disgusting.
Well, you know, we could put a little Gucci bag around it,
make it a little bit more vogue.
He said you sat there
and waited through the whole thing.
Yeah, well... you know me.
Sometimes I'm hardheaded.
You know what you said to me earlier?
(winces)
Yeah, let's talk about it later.
You were right.
I don't go there.
I never have.
I kind of...
used what I learned for patients in my personal life.
Don't get too involved. Don't... get too attached.
But I don't want that anymore.
Remember that day we went to see that condo?
I was thinking, "Why the hell am I buying a condo?
"Pretty soon Betina and I, we...
we could be getting a house."
You never told me that.
I know.
I ignored it,
but that little voice in my head--
it wouldn't go away.
So I'm here,
and not out of obligation,
but because I'm...
because I'm in love.
Okay?
I'm in love with you.
(sighs)
RASGOTRA: Metz.
Elevate the peritoneum.
Like this? Mm-hmm.
Does he know what he's doing?
He's doing fine.
I don't want a student operating on her.
I need an assistant.
Well, then, you do it.
You're more senior. No problem, no problem.
Go, come on. Switch it up. All right, okay, okay.
I need, uh... I got it.
...exposure on the right upper quadrant.
Bovie.
We were this close.
Everything was going to be done.
Looks like a bad
hepatic laceration.
You know, we get this house.
Friend gets us a loan.
Two years later, the payments double.
Stellate, chromic... Came home and found a...
...on a liver needle.
...foreclosure notice on my door.
I don't know.
But, Doc, hey, we never meant to hurt that old guy.
We just wanted to get the rocks, sell them off, keep the house.
Guys, look at this.
What?
Cardiac activity.
Is she better?
The heart is beating on its own.
See, I knew it.
You were right.
He was right.
Now, all you guys need to do
is, is finish operating on her
so Rebecca and I can get out of here.
All right?
Come on.
We'll, uh...
w-we'll get a helicopter or something.
Something to take us somewhere.
You know? All we did was open her up.
We haven't repaired anything yet.
No, no, come on. It's working,
Right, Doc? It's working.
It's working, right?
Yep.
Yep, it's working.
If we c... if we can fix the liver, we have a chance.
Then keep going.
'Cause she's going to make it.
Come on. Keep going.
Pickups and needle driver.
More lap pads.
You broke both your bones in your lower leg:
your tibia and fibula.
Shoot, I was going to take pantomime class next week.
I'm gonna take him into Trauma
and do a reduction under fluoro.
(stammering): A what?
Oh, that's when we put the bones back in place
using X ray guidance.
Does it hurt? Don't worry.
We'll put some good stuff in your IV, buddy.
How about some etomidate? 12 migs.
I'll see you in a few minutes.
I'm gonna call Charlie and tell him
I need the rest of the day off.
My dad doesn't get me.
I'd give my left testicle
to go to clown college in Florida.
All the greats study there.
Well... he's just looking out for you.
He doesn't like clowns. He doesn't like circuses.
I feel like he found me on a doorstep.
Every kid says that at some point in his life.
Well, I don't want to be one of those people
who sit around miserable all day
working for retirement.
You sound pretty insightful.
You must have given this a lot of thought, huh?
I pay attention. That's all.
All right.
Here's what we're going to do.
We're going to watch that monitor back there,
look at the X rays while I manipulate your leg.
Okay?
Impressive.
Hmm. You got a deck of cards?
Not on me.
I also don't have a tubular stockinette.
All right, I'll be right back.
Don't juggle any needles.
MORRIS: Another suture pack?
Cut. No, liver's oversewn.
MORRIS: Another lap pad. What are you guys doing?
Exploratory laparotomy.
Why are you guys doing this here?
Why aren't you in the OR?
It's too busy.
All right, let's check hemostasis
and unclamp the aorta.
WESTON: Okay...
there.
Whoa, whoa! Clamp it! Clamp it!
What happened? Did you mess up? More suction, lap pads.
DANIEL: I thought you fixed it.
MORRIS: We're trying, Daniel, okay?
We need more blood, another eight units.
No cardiac activity,
resuming compressions. Wh-What?
Did her heart stop again? It doesn't look good.
It's a retrohepatic injury.
She's torn the liver
right off the vena cava.
DANIEL: What, what does that mean?
Come on. Someone's got to spell that out for me.
We really need to isolate the liver.
RASGOTRA: Daniel, the main blood vessel
from the liver has been torn off,
and it connects to an even bigger vein,
and it's a very complicated procedure.
DANIEL You can do that. Come on, Doc. You can do that.
RASGOTRA: 20 silk
on an SH needle.
Come on, Doc.
Vascular clamp.
All right, gently... elevate the left lobe.
How's that?
I can't get a good bite.
Come on. Y-you did the other thing.
You can do this.
Come on. Come on. I'm trying. 50 Prolene.
Come on. Try harder.
MORRIS: Daniel, Daniel, Daniel, see this thread?
If we can sew the veins back together
and stop the leaks, she will have a...
(grunting)
Run, Neela!
(gunshot)
(panting)
You take another step, I'll shoot you.
You hear me?
I'll kill you all.
Okay, everyone, this way, this way.
What happened?
We'll explain everything when you get outside.
Please, through the doors.
You in charge? Yeah.
Sergeant Deturno.
Where are the people who got out?
Over here. Hey, are we going to get seen?
Okay, Sophie, can you help him out, please?
Yeah, yeah, follow me.
We have shuttle buses outside.
Frank, have you called County Dispatch?
Yes.
Yes, close us to trauma,
close us to all paramedic traffic
due to internal disaster.
Dawn was in there. So was our intern Larry.
I want you guys down the hall.
Make sure the patients are cleared.
Miss, please exit through that door. Tell me about the guy.
He's out of his mind.
He thinks his girlfriend is going to wake up.
Who's still in there? Neela, Morris, and Gates.
They're playing along.
Come on. Come through here, please,
and exit all the way out the doors to the street.
Have you seen my son?
Uh, he's probably outside.
N-N-No, I checked; he's not there.
What room was he in?
Trauma 1 with Gates.
Then he's still back there.
You left my son? Sir, sir!
Sir! Sir, sir, get back!
My kid is back there.
Sir, the police will get him.
Please... When? After this loony kills him?
He's got nothing to do with this! Sir!
Listen.
You're putting him in greater danger.
Now, let us do our job.
Okay? Come on.
I'll take you outside, okay?
RASGOTRA: Oh-chromic.
Where is everyone?
MORRIS: They're, they're evacuating the building.
What are they doing?
GATES: They probably have the place surrounded, man.
If you'd have minded your own business,
everything would have been okay, you know?
Daniel, Daniel, hey, this is about Rebecca, okay?
Don't do anything you're going to regret. Yeah,
a little late for that now, don't you think?
(clanking)
What was that?
GATES: That's my patient.
I got to get him upstairs.
No way, no way.
Look at his leg.
It's broke in four places.
Yeah, that's not my problem, is it?
The kid can't move.
He can't get blood to his foot; if I don't get him
to the operating room, he'll lose his leg.
You want that? No one is leaving
until Rebecca's fixed.
You understand me?
Damn it.
(sniffles)
(sighs)
Let me... let me take a look at that.
Cut short, right to the knot.
GATES: All right.
What are you doing?
Look, Gates is right.
You want him to be able to walk, right?
Don't put this on me, Doc.
I just want to get my girl help, all right? I know, I know, Daniel.
Daniel, he's a kid who's petrified.
You ever, ever been petrified?
(panting)
How's the repair coming, Dr. Rasgotra?
Not bad, I'm, uh, just tying off the bleeders.
Yeah, heart's filling well now that it's clamped.
See, we're doing okay.
Let's not get the kid into this.
BRENNER: All right, get her in there.
Out of the way! Out of the way!
We need these guys out of the way!
Sam, we need the criticals taken care of first.
TAGGART: Okay.
I'll be right back as soon as I can, okay?
Hey, Frank!
Can you help me with this?
FRANK: Yeah. Excuse me.
Coming through here, guys.
Give me that. Okay.
I'll take it. WOMAN: Were you guys inside?
Do you know what happened?
Excuse me. Can you move out of the way, please? Yeah, do you mind?
Have you guys seen Neela?
She's still inside.
What do you mean inside?
She's in there trying to repair
a retrohepatic caval injury.
In the trauma room?
She told me you knew. Yeah.
Why would I let her do something like that?
He had a gun on her.
What?
Will you fill him in?
All right, guys, packed away. Excuse me.
We need this area cleared. Excuse me...
Hey. Is there any news?
No, nothing at all.
You know, if I get him out of there alive,
he could unicycle Russia for all I care.
If I find out anything, you'll be the first to know.
Okay? Excuse me.
(commotion stirring)
Hey!
Excuse me.
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Excuse me, please.
Hey! You guys can't go
back there! This guy's good.
He's a doctor. Dad? Oh, my God. Got to get him
to the Ortho Clinic next door.
Thank you.
Hey.
You all right?
Yeah, I'm fine. Good.
I'm glad you're okay.
Let's go!
(phone ringing)
Talk.
Hello?
Uh, yes. Good. Okay.
The, uh, blood bank tech's in the hall.
DANIEL: No, no.
Tell him to go.
She needs it, Daniel.
She needs more transfusions.
We'll stay here. You go.
You get it.
Kick it.
Kick it down here. Is there anything else I can get you?
No, just give me the blood.
We want to work this out, Daniel.
This doesn't have to happen like this.
Just give me the damn blood!
Unclamp the aorta.
Okay... there.
Clamping again.
(phone ringing)
Hello.
Okay. Hold on.
They want to talk to you.
Hello.
Daniel?
Sergeant Deturno.
Yeah, what do you want?
We want to help you, Daniel.
If you want to help,
you figure out a way to get me and my girl out of here
as soon as she's better.
Then nobody gets hurt.
How about that?
Well, we can't get you anything
until you let me come in there and talk.
I don't want to talk to you.
Daniel, this is the hard way.
Let's make this easier, huh?
Yeah, yeah.
You want, you want to see hard, keep on your yap.
Daniel...
If we could wake her up, we would.
Shut up.
This sucks.
I know.
I know, losing someone...
We had plans.
We were gonna get our house back.
We're gonna put a patio
in the yard.
She wanted to plant a garden.
You should say good-bye to her, Daniel.
It's time to say good-bye.
Sooner you do this, the sooner she can let go.
Then you can go see your mom.
My mom?!
Yeah.
She died five years ago.
Pancreatic cancer.
I was with her when she took her final breath.
Okay, okay, so you've been through this before.
I get it.
Doc, I won't do it again.
You don't have a choice, Daniel.
Okay, because she is not waking up.
Okay, now, you have done everything.
Everything that a man would do for his family.
Even today.
You were trying to get the pieces of your life back.
I get it.
Anyone can understand that.
We never meant to hurt anybody.
I know, so why... why start now?
I mean...
even if we could get her back,
her brain has been deprived of so much oxygen,
she would be bedridden, unable to talk or function.
Don't say that.
It's true.
Don't say that. It's true.
Is that what you want?
Is that what she would want?
When I stop these compressions...
she's going to leave us.
And you'll do what's right.
(sighs)
(sobbing)
You remember when we met at the coffee shop that night?
That wasn't the first time I had seen you.
Day before I was walking down Hill Street,
and I noticed you going into the bookstore.
So I went in and hid behind a bookshelf,
and watched you work all day.
And when you were reading Goodnight Moon to some kids...
I thought how can I get a girl like that?
You know?
I'm so sorry.
I tried to fix it.
I tried to make it better.
It wasn't supposed to go like this.
(sobbing)
Daniel...
why don't you hand me the gun
and I can tell the police it's over.
(sighs)
I'm sorry for putting you guys through this.
You tried, Doc.
I know you tried.
It's okay.
Just pass it to me.
(crashing)
Daniel?
Daniel?
