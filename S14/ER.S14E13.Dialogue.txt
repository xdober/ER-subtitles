Previously on E.R.:
If we're gonna do this,
we're gonna have to do this together.
GATES: Remembering a dream I had last night.
Sam was in it. I don't beg.
In my dream you did.
This is Ortho. Yeah, I start today.
Dr. Rasgotra, I'd like you to meet
Drs. Ramsey, Craig... Hey.
Heard great things about you.
What position did you play? Center forward.
Love, trust, truth... higher power.
You can't have any of those without faith
Especially love.
So this is your office?
Mm-hmm. (buttons scatter)
Nice desk.
Oh! Imagine waking up here every morning.
Betina, I can't afford this.
Yes, you can. I did the math.
You did the math?
Mm-hmm. Time to move out of your med school apartment
and invest in something.
My apartment is fine.
So what do you think?
Oh, it's beautiful. Told you.
The sellers did a great job on the renovation.
The kitchen, the moldings,
these yummy floors.
Bamboo flown in from Brazil.
And there's a gym,
and a children's game room in the basement.
Do you two have kids?
No. No.
Listen, don't rush it.
When you're newlyweds and it's just
the two of you against the world...
Well, you can't beat it.
Okay.
It'll be gone by the end
of the week, so if you're at all interested,
make an offer.
No, thanks.
It's, uh,
the first place he's seen.
Think about it.
I'll call you tomorrow.
No. Don't, please.
I'm just looking.
GATES: Hey, Sam!
It wasn't just the battery.
Where did you get my keys?
You also had alternator issues. You stole
my keys and fixed my car? I think
the proper response would be, "Thank you, Tony."
Also, I tightened
the connections and got you all charged up.
SKYE: Ooh...
That sounds like fun.
I thought you were dating the chaplain.
It's my car. He's talking about my car.
Car.
She made a perfectly reasonable assumption about our relationship
and you practically had a seizure.
I wasn't feeling the realtor.
I just wanted to get out of there, that's all.
We're adults, Greg. The topic of commitment
shouldn't be off-limits. It's not off limits.
Really? You haven't looked me in the eye
since we left that place. Come on, it's not like that.
SKYE: Pratt!
Pratt, there's a kid and an old guy that have just been
pulled out of the lake. Take one with Grady.
All right, you got it.
Look, let's just talk about this later.
At least you're admitting there's something to talk about.
Hey, Chaz, how are you doing?
Fine. Thanks. What up?
Robert Truman, 68.
Jumped in after a kid who fell into the lake.
Thought I could get him, but I was too cold.
Heart rate's 68, pulse ox good.
Temp was 90 when we pulled him out.
My lungs froze up, couldn't swim.
Does anything hurt, sir?
I'm fine. Take care of the boy.
Barely moving air. Too cold, can't get a sat.
"24 gauge PIV." That's it?
He needs central access.
Mama's here, it's okay.
This is your fault! You made this happen!
No, he needed my help. I thought that I...
Why won't you leave us alone? Ma'am, is he allergic
to any medication? No, I'm sorry I tried to come...
Stay away from my son!
SAM: He's hypoventilating.
SKYE: We need to bag him.
Doctor, please take care of that child.
Sir, we're going to concentrate on you right now.
No, if you want to help me, you need to help that boy.
Mr. Truman, please. Save him!
Save him or I'm going to hell.
RASGOTRA: The O.R. charge nurse wants to bump
our meniscus repair until tomorrow.
Tell her to kiss your ass.
Maybe mine. She's kind of cute.
What's up, Ortho girl?
Morris, what are you doing here?
I'm a surgeon for the day. What?
Yep-- it's the E.R.'s new trauma exchange program.
I never heard anything about this.
E.R. staff can spend a day on the surgical service
following trauma patients to the O.R.
Are you going to scrub in on cases?
Hope so. Be good and, uh,
Harold might let you hold his retractor.
Definitely! (chuckles)
Dude, I gotta go-- there's, like, a hundred doctors here.
After you.
No, after you.
Rasgotra, you're up.
Silas is our "snowmobile versus brick wall."
Post op day one... She's so cute, isn't she?
Day one from laparotomy...
With her little accent.
Hemoglobin's stable, slept well overnight.
Got a chest X-ray for a low-grade temp.
No infiltrates, mild atelectasis
bilaterally. Okay.
That means little areas of collapsed alveoli.
We know what atelectasis is.
It's probably nothing,
but I can repeat the film this afternoon.
Okay. Hey, what's the definition
of a double blind study?
Two Ortho docs looking at a chest film.
Ho! Zing!
(Trauma doctors snickering)
Don't pretend that's not funny, huh?
You taught me that joke. Oh, my God.
I love this girl.
(laughing)
WOMAN: He was collecting
samples from the lake for a science project.
Something about algae in winter.
Core temp's 74.3.
More suction, please.
And then that man just appears out of nowhere again.
SKYE: Tube. He's been coming
to the store trying to talk to me while I was at work.
I thought he was just some lonely, old guy.
And yesterday, I saw him outside of my house.
And when he saw me looking, he just walked away.
And then, today at the lake.
I went over there to tell him to stay away.
I told him I was gonna to call the police.
I'm in.
Gabriel must have slipped in
while my back was turned. I have no idea
how long he was there before I realized...
And that man jumped in after him?
He said, "Call 911," and then he just jumped.
Sam, call respiratory
for a vent and set up for bilateral chest tubes.
Got it.
And have Central bring a circulating water blanket.
He'll do better with a Bair Hugger.
They both work.
Bair Hugger's better.
Show me the data.
You kids work it out.
You guys all right in here? Yeah, his core temp's up to 94,
but his EKG shows ischemic changes.
Could've been caused by the strain of the cold swim.
Hey! These flattened
T waves, I've had those for years.
It's definitely not an MI.
I'm a doctor, retired six years.
But I can still read an EKG. Okay, well, let us
check your troponins, just in case.
Knock yourself out.
Where'd you practice?
Stateville, 12 years.
Stateville Penitentiary?
Yes. Bet that was intense.
Well, you guys seem fine.
I'm going back in with the kid.
How is he?
I can't talk about his treatment.
Of course.
Hey, fun rounding with you guys this morning.
Hi, Archie.
Want some advice? No.
You need to work on your presentation style.
Excuse me? Yeah, you're too serious.
Have a little fun.
Take some joy in your work. I'm fun.
No, you're English. I get it. I get it.
It's hard to let your hair down, but you are in America now.
You know, I don't know what you're basing this on...
You know how hard it was to find a jersey that small?
Hockey? See? I'm fun.
We're going to finish rounds, then head to the rink.
Oh, Neela, this is so hot.
Can you do a triple axel?
Dude, that's figure skating.
Oh... You're friends with that guy?
Sort of. Oh, tell the truth. We slept together!
She gave me a rash!
(chuckles)
Hey. Oh, hey.
Sorry about the last few days.
I've been working 11:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m.
It's like I've fallen off the planet, you know?
No, it's okay. I've been slammed, too.
I'm leading a seminar at the CAHC tomorrow
and I'm way behind.
What's CAHC?
Complimentary Alternative Health Conference.
I told you all about it. No, you didn't.
Well, you may have been in a postcoital stupor.
But I am presenting data
on the effects of prayer on healing.
They actually have data on that? Yes.
In fact, several studies have shown that patients who have
people praying for them get well faster than those who don't.
Ooh, spooky.
Shut up. The results are cool.
Hey, listen, when you get a minute,
I got a guy for you in Trauma.
No, no, not another consult.
I-I have to get this talk together or I'm screwed.
Listen, he saved a kid from drowning in a lake.
The kid's not doing so well right now,
and he's a little freaked out.
Come on now.
Okay, I have a baby-naming ceremony in the NICU,
and then I am meeting with a statistician
to go over the slides for the talk.
I'll come back after that.
Thank you.
Chest X-ray on Robert Truman.
Good.
You're kidding me.
Ugly, right?
Yeesh! Who's that?
Old lake guy.
All right, order a chest CT
and I'll get an official read on that.
Tell me you don't need a radiologist
to see this film is abnormal.
Diffuse lung nodules; I know.
Lung mets.
The reason I called you down was to get your take
on the differential before I go in there and tell the man
he had metastatic cancer.
Couldn't it be... miliary TB
or cocci or sarcoid or something?
Yeah, but in a 68-year-old guy,
odds are it's gonna be mets.
Great.
So, anything else?
Um, I guess not.
Thanks for the consult.
Dr. Truman...
Robert. Please.
In your days as a, uh, prison doc,
did you ever get tested positive for TB?
No. I had a PPD every four months.
Any coughing, fevers, night sweats?
Huh... the chest X-ray.
Metastatic prostate cancer.
It spread to my lungs and my bones
before I even knew I had it.
I'm sorry.
Well... I guess it's my retribution.
Excuse me?
When men try to do God's work,
bad things happen.
I wish I realized this before I killed that boy's father.
Another run of v-tach.
200 of bretylium and start an infusion.
Core temp's down to 71.
He's getting colder?
Sometimes the cold blood in his extremities
rushes up to his heart and drops the core temp.
Looks like your Bair Hugger worked a little too well, huh?
His heart can't beat normally at this temperature.
Sam, call the ECMO tech.
Don't you think that's jumping the gun?
What about peritoneal lavage?
What's, what's ECMO?
Cardiac bypass.
It's the only thing that's going to warm the core
fast enough. Its too dangerous.
It should be a last resort.
His temperature's 71; he's having runs of v-tach.
I think we're there.
Bleeding, infection... He knows the risks.
Thank you. But I'm with Sam on this.
Gabriel's still got a pulse
and a decent BP. Let's exhaust all
other options before jumping to ECMO.
I'll go get the stuff. We're going to put
a tube in Gabriel's belly and flush in warm fluids
to see if we can raise his core temp... Sam.
Hey.
Sam, what's with you today?
Nothing. Then why do you have
to "Plan B" me all the time? "Plan B" you?!
Seems like whatever I say, you have a better idea.
That's not true. Uh, yes, Sam, it is true.
Bair Hugger
versus water blanket; morphine versus fentanyl.
Oh, okay, come on-- you sound crazy. No. Whatever I want,
you give me that look and then you want something different.
What look? Look, that one right there.
Tony, I don't blindly accept orders from someone
just because they come from a doctor or a man.
I've been doing this a lot longer than you have
and I can think for myself.
If you don't like that, that's too bad.
Back at Stateville,
my job was to give lethal injections
to death row inmates.
Wow.
That's heavy. Yes.
People could watch through a window.
And I remember, I remember her,
trying to be brave for the baby
as I injected the thiopental...
the pavulon...
potassium.
Gabriel was only two.
He never knew his dad.
Dr. Truman...
you don't really have to talk about this now
if you don't want to. No.
Back then, I thought it was the right thing.
I thought there were criminals who deserved to die
and lethal injection was the most humane way.
As time went on, my thinking's changed.
About the death penalty?
Who lives and dies...
should be decided by God, not a jury.
I've spent the last five years
tracking the loved ones of the men I've killed.
Tried to make amends with those families.
How do you make amends?
Financial aid, mostly.
It's all I have to offer.
I paid a mortgage, bought a...
bought a car, sent a child to college.
Some people told me to get lost.
Others took what I could offer.
Well, that's really brave.
And generous.
No.
They're all acts of contrition.
Small things.
Nothing'll ever bring back
a husband, or son,
father.
Saving a kid's life isn't a small thing.
I'm just trying to tell God
how sorry I am for what I've done.
Please.
I need that boy to live.
Tell that freak in there to stop staring at me.
Give him a break.
Not many people would jump in a frozen lake for a stranger.
He's not a stranger, he's a stalker.
V-tach, lost the pulse. All right,
starting compressions. Oh, my God.
What's happening?
His heart has stopped beating effectively
because of the cold; we can't shock it back
into a natural rhythm until he's warmer.
This looks like the right room.
SKYE: Who called for ECMO?
I knew the conservative route wouldn't work,
so I give Teddy the heads up.
SKYE: Go ahead, let's put him on.
This is a cardiopulmonary bypass machine.
It will function as Gabriel's heart
and lungs and warm his blood.
Sam, you should've listened to me.
Let's hope it works.
Celia, do you have any family we need to call?
Or Gabriel's dad?
His dad's been dead a couple years.
How about your family?
My father's out of the picture,
I haven't talked to my mother in years.
Anspaugh's on his way down
to cannulate. We can do it here.
Surgery has to; it's protocol.
The chief of staff is coming down for a central line?
They're a little short-staffed today.
All up at a big conference or something.
(shouting)
(cheering)
Rasgotra, isn't this fun?
Uh, especially
the part where I get to see my attending in a jock strap.
(chuckling): Okay, go:
I'm streaking the blue line in the dump and chase,
what do you do?
Dump in the far corner and head to the net.
Exactly right. Okay, everybody,
listen up!
Smart!
Aggressive!
No mercy!
MEN (chanting): Smart! Aggressive! No mercy!
Smart! Aggressive! No mercy! Smart...
The machine is doing the work for his heart
and lungs, so we're going to take out the breathing tube.
I see.
When his temp's up, his own heart will kick back in.
Well, that's the hope.
What, what do you mean "that's the the hope"?
Well, I'm sure Dr. Gates has explained that...
Gabriel's tissues may be permanently damaged
because of the cold. Yeah, I explained that to her,
but we're trying to think positive here, right? Okay.
Right.
Look,
we all hope that this brings him back.
But he's down for a long time.
Has had over an hour of CPR.
Celia, call someone.
A friend, family, it doesn't matter.
You just need some support.
You don't know what I need.
I'm a single mom.
I know asking for help feels like cheating sometimes.
Jimmy, Gabriel's dad...
he was one of those guys
who couldn't stay out of trouble.
Running drugs...
stealing cars...
I was an idiot; I thought he'd change.
That's human.
And I told my mom
Jimmy and I were going to raise the baby together,
and she kicked me out of the house.
She said,
"You may be lost but I am not going to have a guy like that
around the rest of my kids."
Looking back, she was probably right.
Celia, there's
a very good chance
that Gabriel's heart won't start up again.
No, please, please don't say that.
This is gonna work!
(sobbing)
Guys, I need another liter of NS and an ABG kit.
Okay. Yeah, I got it.
GATES: And, uh, check an ionized calcium
while you're at it-- the last one was low, okay?
555...
0172.
That's my mom.
Could you call her?
Right away.
Yeah!
Game on!
Who are we playing?
Pedes, I think.
I saw the pathologists practicing
in the parking lot.
ANNOUNCER (over P.A.): And now...
the starting lineup
of County General's very own...
unstoppable, irrepressible...
the Mighty Docs!
Playing right wing, Lucien Dubenko!
They are such drama queens.
We're playing
the Trauma surgeons?!
We beat them in the last five seconds
of the finals last year-- right, boys?
Left wing, Dusty Crenshaw!
(laughing): Oh, my God.
On defense, Harold Zelinsky!
And playing center...
Archie Morris!
Oh, no way!
Way! Oh, this explains everything.
Your weird behavior, the Trauma exchange program...
An elaborate ruse to play on this team and kick your ass.
He's a ringer!
Yeah, baby. Huh?
I had a 26-year-old kid on the table,
convicted of killing a cop.
See his family pleading, praying.
I injected the drugs
and he didn't die.
He lay there, awake, quivering.
Lethal doses of three different agents
and he was alive.
Parents were crying, claiming a miracle.
What happened?
The I.V. infiltrated.
The drugs pooled in his soft tissues,
instead of going into his bloodstream.
So I placed another I.V.,
drew up another round of meds and pushed.
And this time...
it took him 90 seconds to die.
(sighs)
Seven months later, a police officer came forward.
The boy was framed for the murder.
Hmm?
He didn't do it.
You couldn't have known that.
God tried to stop me
from killing an innocent man and I ignored the sign.
How can I even hope for forgiveness?
I think...
sometimes it's easier
to feel guilty than forgiven.
Which means what?
That maybe your guilt over these deaths
has become your reason for living.
Maybe you need a new reason to go on.
I-I-I... I don't want to go on.
Can't you see I'm old,
I have cancer-- I've had enough.
The only thing that is holding me back is that I am afraid.
I'm afraid of what comes next.
And what do you think that is?
Oh, you tell me.
Is atonement even possible?
What does God want from me?
I think it's up to each one of us
to interpret what God wants.
So people can do anything?
They can rape, they can murder,
they can steal, all in the name of God
and it's okay? No, that's not what I'm saying.
Well, what are you saying?
Because all I'm hearing is some New Age,
God-is-love, one-size-fits-all crap!
Hey, Dr. Truman...
(coughing): No, I don't have time for this now!
Greg, it's okay.
Look, I understand...
No, you don't understand!
You don't understand!
How could you possibly say that?
No, you listen to me.
I want a real chaplain
who believes in a real God and a real hell.
I hear that you're frustrated
but you need to ask yourself...
No, I don't need to ask myself!
I need answers.
And all your questions
and your uncertainty are only making things worse.
I... I know you're upset...
Oh, God...
I need someone who will look me in the eye and tell me
how to find forgiveness,
because I am running out of time!
I'm trying to help. Well, don't!
Just get out!
Get out!
Get out!
Hey, Julia.
Julia, come on.
Listen, come on.
Come on. The guy's just freaking out. He didn't mean
what he said.
Yeah, he did.
He absolutely did.
MORRIS: Okay, don't choke, Neela.
Don't cough it up. It'd be real embarrassing
if you lost that puck to me.
Neela! Yes! Stay down!
Yes! (whistle blows)
ALL THREE: Get up!
Oh, let's see.
Your eye-- crap.
Concentration-- crap.
Coordination-- crap. (taps stick)
How do we let this girl operate?
(whooping, cheering)
Hit me. Come on, hit me.
You know you want to.
I don't.
Come on, hit me! Lucien!
Everybody wants to take a shot at their mentor, don't they?
(Rasgotra grunts)
(whistle blows)
Ha!
Come on, Neela.
Untie the piano.
You'll skate faster, huh?
Hup-ah! Oh, no!
Wha...?
(players yelling)
Oh, yeah!
(hooting)
Yeah!
I got... I got it.
I got it.
(grunting)
Ooh! Ooh!
(Morris grunts)
Neela, you're dead!
(whooping)
(cheering)
Hey, Gates, hold on.
You've seen Julia around?
No, not since this morning.
She's not answering her pager.
She usually turns it off when she's with patients.
(sighs)
This guy in One... it's... it's a mess.
Do you have any questions for us, Mrs. Davies?
No. Celia explained it all.
She always had a head for science.
Gabriel does, too.
He wants to be a marine biologist.
TEDDY: ACT is 224.
All right, let's keep the heparin where it's at.
You sure you want to do that? I would try...
What are you doing here?
I wanted to let you know...
You can't be here.
Please. I want to say that I'm...
Get out! Please, just go.
Sir, maybe you should just go back to bed.
Hold on, Sam, hold on.
Look, ma'am, he tried to save your son's life.
Just give him a chance to say what he came to say.
And afterwards,
you'll give this family their privacy, right?
Yes.
Sorry.
I'm sorry for all the trouble I've caused.
I-I'm praying for your boy.
Sir, thank you for your bravery.
I'm very grateful. So is my daughter.
Right, Celia?
Celia, tell him.
Tell this man thank you.
Thank you.
FLORA: Like you mean it.
I am not three years old anymore.
I-I have to call work.
That's... That's all.
Come on, let me get you back on the monitor.
Lucien, five hole or top shelf?
I don't care. Just make it count.
Oh!
(whistle blows)
Ow!
We need a goalie here!
(wailing)
Hey, you guys ever seen Neela drunk?
Yeah, you should have seen her at the E.R. Christmas party.
She gave Anspaugh a lap dance! Ow!
Could've blocked that with a wad of toilet paper, Morris.
I hear she still sleeps with a blankie.
She calls it her nubbie.
What the hell
are you talking about?
(whooping, cheering)
Nice! That's right.
(players hooting, whooping)
Hey, your career as a goalie doesn't pan out,
you can always go back to working at the Jumbo Mart.
You guys know she used to work at Jumbo Mart, right?
(Morris and others laughing)
(whooping)
Ow!
PRATT: Hey, Skye...
have you seen Julia around?
No.
She had trouble with one of my patients and went AWOL.
What happened?
Are you ready for this one?
My guy in One gave a lethal injection to the father
of your boy in Two.
What? He was a prison doctor.
He used to push the drugs into the guys on death row.
Now, I guess, he's had a change of heart.
Excuse me one second. Hey, Chaz.
Hey! Hey, man.
Hey, Celia.
Everything all right?
Yeah.
Yeah, it's just work, you know?
I guess she wants a commitment, but I don't know.
Maybe I'm not that kind of guy.
So why don't you just tell her that?
Betina's great, man.
It's not like I'm looking for something better.
You guys been together for a while now.
Yeah, nine months.
Hmm! Must be a record for you. (laughs)
I like her, all right, so that's not the issue.
Well, why don't you just give it a try and see what happens?
You know, it's easy for you to say.
You're 20 years old, still playing the field.
(laughs)
Uh, Greg, I've been with the same guy for almost a year now.
Really? Yeah.
Why didn't you tell me that before?
You never asked.
All right, well, I should take these.
All right, cool.
Thanks for the coffee. Oh, anytime.
Hey, what's his name? Andrew.
All right, well, I'd like to meet him sometime.
We can all go to a drag club or something.
(screams): Ha!
Just kidding, man.
That'd be cool. What you got?
Mass cas at the ice rink: "Ortho versus Trauma." What?
CRENSHAW: You! Yeah.
You were a complete goon out there! Yeah.
I hit you on the numbers, 'cause you elbowed me in the head!
Headhunter!
Octopus! Slasher!
(all yelling at once)
I saved your ass so many times!
Saved my ass? What are you, high?
What's wrong with you guys? Stay out of it!
RASGOTRA: Shut up, Harold! You just stuck your finger...
Maybe I wouldn't have to if you weren't such a goon!
Maybe you should practice a little more!
Well, I'm sure you've had plenty
of practice swinging your stick!
Huh? Huh? Oh, could you lay down?
I don't recognize you standing up!
No!
(clamoring)
Get off of him, you...!
(shouting)
ECMO tech needs you in T-2 right away.
That kid's awake. RASGOTRA: ...a piece of you!
Oh, shut up, Harold!
Cripes!
What's going on?
Sometimes we see this after a few hours on the machine.
They just wake up.
SAM: Sat's okay on room air.
Mommy, what happened?
Oh, baby.
Hi, baby. Hi.
You're okay.
That a boy, Gabriel. FLORA: Oh, thank God.
Oh, he's okay. He's gonna be okay. I know, baby.
TEDDY: Core temp's up
to 94.
FLORA: This family will never forget
what you did here today.
Just doing our job.
Well, I don't care what you say.
It's a miracle.
GATES: Sam, Teddy, what do you say
we take this kid off the machine?
TEDDY: Sounds good.
TAGGART: Size eight gloves okay?
Looks like good news in there.
This doesn't absolve you.
Don't think it does.
I don't forgive you.
I will never forgive you.
You have to live with what you've done.
(shuddering)
Oh, man.
(sighs)
Julia.
Well, the lake kid is doing great.
But our guy... he needs you in there.
I can't.
All right, well, I need you in there.
(sniffles)
He's asking me all kind of questions
that I don't know how to answer.
You know, doubt--
it's... uncomfortable.
But certainty--
I don't think it's real.
I mean, I-I... I went to seminary.
I studied Buddhism, I spent time in an ashram,
(groans)
Who really knows anything with absolute certainty?
Not me, that's for sure.
That's why I thought an inclusive approach
to spirituality would work well in a place like this.
It does. It does.
The patients-- they appreciate what you do.
People in crisis want rules, they want structure,
something to lean on.
I get that.
But it's not me.
You know, we all wonder what we're doing here sometimes.
That guy needs help.
So, come on,
(sniffles) come back in there with me.
Let's go talk to him.
I don't think so. (sniffles)
(sighs heavily)
All right.
Ramsey, what, did you trip over the blue line?
Yeah, fell on me.
Morris, what, did you hurt yourself doing a triple axel?
So, who won?
It was a mutual forfeit.
Didn't know you had it in you, Mayday.
Me either.
X-ray's negative-- home with splint.
All right, who's next?
MORRIS: Hey, Neela, how's your boo-boo?
CRENSHAW (British accent): Oh, it's my dominant hand.
If I can't operate, you're dead.
Wuss. You hack! Bee-yotch!
Who are you yelling at, Harold?
I don't really know.
No tenderness, bearing weight.
Hey, how's my team?
I think they all need ibuprofen,
a hot tub and a glass of wine.
I like the way you think.
Okay, listen up, everyone, fun's over.
Orthopods are rounding on the hall in ten.
Trauma to the ICU.
MORRIS: Whoa, whoa, what about me?
There's an ingrown toenail in Exam Three with your name on it.
Sam!
What's up, buddy?
You sick of us down here?
No, I-I like it.
You like it? You're a weird kid, you know that?
He likes the Jell-O.
Thanks again, Doctor.
You're welcome.
You take care of your mom, okay?
Sam, any beds open up?
Well, I had to threaten the charge nurse
with physical violence, but something opened up.
Right. Hey, we're going to Ike Ryan's.
You should come.
Should I? Yeah.
As long as if I order you a beer
you don't change it to a vodka gimlet or something.
Well, I don't know.
I have to report upstairs, then I've got to do
a bunch of stuff down here.
How often do we get an outcome like this?
A pulseless ice cube turned into
a Jell-O loving 11-year-old in the same shift.
That doesn't happen every day.
That's for sure.
Well?
Well...
I'll see if I can make it.
I have sinned against Heaven...
...and in your sight
are no more worthy.
Gracious God...
...my mortal sins...
I accept.
Stop!
What the hell are you doing?
I am in hell... do you understand?
I am in hell already, I might as well go.
Listen to me.
You saved a little boy's life.
No, it is not enough.
I can't change my destiny.
There isn't time.
Did it ever occur to you that maybe your destiny
was for you to be on that pier this morning?
That maybe your life's path,
and all the choices that you made,
led you right there, so you could save that kid? Why? Why?
Why would God do that?
Why would he have me kill 17 people to save one?
You may not understand it,
but that little boy is alive because you were there.
Now, whatever you need that to count for-- it counts.
(crying)
It doesn't make sense.
It doesn't have to make sense.
(crying)
That's why it's called faith.
(crying)
(sighs)
(sobbing)
(sighs)
(moaning)
TAGGART: Hey, guys.
Hey, Sam, great job today.
Thank you. You, too.
Hey, Gabriel all tucked in?
Yes. The ICU nurses are fawning all over him.
All right. Okay.
My turn to win some money.
All right. All right.
So, what are you drinking?
Actually, I can't stay. I got...
Oh, so you came here to tell me that you can't come here?
Yeah.
Really? Have you heard of the cell phone?
All right, you know what?
You're right, it was dumb.
I shouldn't have come here. I wasn't thinking.
Wow, she admits that she wasn't thinking.
Alert the media.
Screw you, Gates.
Come on, just stay here.
She'll have... will you get her a beer, please?
BARTENDER: Sure.
Vodka gimlet, with a twist.
Definitely the most insane shift
I've worked since I started here.
Ah, you said the exact same thing yesterday.
(laughs): I did not.
(groans)
So... (sighs)
you going to Ike's after this?
No. I'm not much of a group person.
I need my alone time at the end of the day.
Is that why you're not married?
No.
Then why isn't a hot,
smart woman such as yourself
shacked up by now?
And I'm not hitting on you.
Just wondering
if some people aren't cut out for commitment.
Nobody is cut out for commitment.
It fights our DNA.
You don't believe in monogamy?
No, I believe in monogamy.
I just don't believe in the concept of... forever.
People force the issue
and then act surprised when it doesn't work out.
Well, you know, some people might say that your theory
is a cover for a fear of commitment.
Well, it takes a lot of courage to reject
the widely embraced social construct of marriage.
Most people assume you've got some kind of problem.
Well, seems like you've got it all figured out.
Some days.
(groans)
G'night, Skye.
Good night.
(moans)
How did you hurt your shoulder?
Checked by Grossman after the face-off.
But I hurt him worse later.
Ever seen bonobos at the zoo?
What's a bonobo?
Pygmy chimp.
Famous in the primate world
for their social- sexual behavior.
Well, fascinating.
In bonobo communities,
sex is a way to say hello.
Oh, really? Mm-hmm.
Hello.
This is so awesome.
RASGOTRA: I didn't know these were here.
GROSSMAN: Hot tubs are for therapy
during the day, but at night,
they belong to the hockey team.
Lucien, Skye, how's the water?
Hot. Very hot.
(sighs)
Guys?
This job rocks.
I'm not sure what the point of that would be
other than to make him feel guilty
(knocking on door) on top of everything else.
Uh... I gotta go.
Okay. Bye.
Hey.
Hey.
What's up?
We need to talk.
I'm sorry about this morning. Okay?
You had the right to be mad.
Apology accepted.
Look...
this is all new to me, okay?
I haven't been down this path before.
But I really...
really want this to work.
Do you know if you stare at an X-ray for more than 38 seconds
you start to see things that aren't there?
Because that's what this is, Greg.
We've stared at this thing
too long and tricked ourselves
into seeing something that isn't there.
You're not listening, okay?
I want to do this.
This morning you seemed totally unsure.
Who's sure about anything?
This shouldn't have to be this hard.
Eventually, you know,
we would end up right back in the same place,
and frankly,
I don't have the time.
Thank you for waiting with me.
No problem.
Oh!
ECMO was a good call with that kid.
We probably should've done it sooner.
It's annoying, but you were right.
Thank you.
And, Sam...
I do like working with you.
Other than the relentless interrogation
and second-guessing and...
you constantly blowing me off Shut up.
when I gave you orders...
I hate you.
I hate you, too.
