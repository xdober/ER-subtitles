Previously on ER:
Are you sending me to live with Grandma and Grandpa?
GATES: You fought to keep her.
You're the one who wanted it like this.
The child's not happy here.
I'll be coming to Chicago soon,
so you be ready.
This shouldn't have to be this hard.
Eventually, you know we would end up right back
in the same place, and frankly, I don't have the time.
Julie's in Nepal. Well, good. Then we can
have some time to get it out of our system.
What good is success when you have no one to share it with?
You really want to mentor this kid?
Give me a month.
Hey, Sam, have you seen Gates?
Uh, who?
Gates? Is he working today?
How would I know?
Open tib/fib is next up in the OR.
Oh, and meniscus guy needs crutches,
and hip lady can go to the floor.
You look different.
Discharge Curtain 3, give him a Vicodin for the road.
Yeah, I'm with Sam.
Something's going on with you.
Well, I kicked ass in my overnight.
What can I say?
Hey, I need you to look at my bike crash guy in Exam 2.
Call Ortho.
I'm looking at Ortho. Not anymore.
I'm officially done with my rotation.
The next time you see me, I will be back
with General Surgery.
Big plans for your day off?
Well, it is a big day.
Is it?
What are you doing?
Oh, I'm not sure.
Nothing comes up, it'll be my couch,
moo goo gai pan and Project Runway, which is good enough.
You're not caught up?
Oh, it's awesome.
No, don't tell me.
I'm gonna watch the repeats today.
Cable guy should be arriving in two to six hours.
You don't have cable?
It went out three weeks ago.
You look nice.
So do you. We still on for lunch?
It's switch day. You're supposed to take me out.
Oh, right.
Off to Pedes surgery.
Well, actually, that's what I wanted to talk to you about.
I promise we'll do it soon.
* Ain't nothing gonna break my stride *
* Nobody's gonna slow me down
* Oh, no
* I got to keep on moving...
DUBENKO: Neela?
Neela?
Are you decent?
I'm coming in.
Neela?
What is it?
Well, there was a little mix-up.
Your shift in General Surgery started 15 minutes ago.
Please, not today.
Come on. Dry off and put some clothes on.
We've got a nun versus waffle iron waiting for us in the ER.
Aah! Six-two.
You're getting beat by an old codger.
Hank, that's your granddaughter!
It's okay, Grandma. I'm about to...
Goal!
Oh! I gave you that one. Hank, calm down!
I swear, he acts like a child sometimes.
Keeps him young.
Ah. Sarah seems very happy.
Yeah, she's with her old group of friends again,
doing well in school.
Even in math, which is
almost a miracle.
You've done a good job, Tony.
But wait till she's 16,
starts dating, ignores everything you say.
Oh, I'm already looking into boarding schools.
Aha!
Oh! Game over!
Beat by your grand... pa.
Come on.
Best two out of three.
Grandpa?
MAN: White meat is better!
MAN 2: Says who? FDA.
Ever heard of them?
Jump in, Dr. Pratt.
Start with a cleansing breath.
(inhales and exhales)
All right, look, let's just try to relax, okay?
Names, Dr. Pratt. Use names.
All right. Look, Ted, Jim, let's just figure out a way...
My name's not Jim.
Don't call me Jim. He's Jack Sprat.
He eats no fat.
That's the exercise.
Help Mr. Sprat
reframe his position using "I" statements.
"I" statements?
Mm-hmm. I prefer white meat because it's healthier.
I prefer dark meat because it tastes better.
Okay, look, Mr. Spratt...
I think I should be Mr. Sprat.
No way. I've committed to this role.
Really? Sounds like you're phoning it in. Oh, excuse me,
Mr. De Niro.
This isn't working.
Are you talking to me?
You talkin' to me?
Of course I'm talking to you!
FRANK: What's your problem?
Oop! I warned you! (gasps)
No food in the patient care area.
Hostile work environment! Hostile work environment!
Oh, guys, stop it. I can't even hear myself think.
Did you see what he just did?
It's a JCAHO violation to have food in the desk area.
Come on, Pratt. Help a brother out.
Okay, show me a brother.
Hey, how was Chief Camp?
Chief Camp?
Oh, did you get a medal, wear a badge?
No, Frank, it was a management seminar.
Thank you, Morris. Ooh.
Mr. Yanai got kicked out of his band,
because he said his blood pressure medication
is making him tone-deaf.
You ever hear of that?
No. He should discuss it with his cardiologist. Oh.
And I accessed the port for a breast cancer patient.
A line is impossible to flush.
Yeah. Have Interventional Radiology take a look.
Okay. You want a chest X ray first?
No, have IR deal with it.
They're the ones who put it in.
That's easy. Oh, Frank!
You shouldn't have.
No. They're for Sam.
What?
"What a beautiful..."
Excuse me!
Sam, you little... little minx.
Who are they from?
Um, uh, the, uh, lady with the kid
who had that fistful of splinters.
Red roses from a woman?
You're lying. She's lying.
County General. Go ahead.
Spill it. Who are the flowers from?
I'm never telling you. Okay.
I tell you things about my love life.
Okay, we'll be ready. Margo.
Sounded like a howler monkey in bed. Got it.
Uh, we got a trauma coming in.
Why don't you make yourself useful?
It's bed sores guy from last week, isn't it?
I saw him giving you that toothy grin.
Hey! I thought you were leaving.
Scheduling mix-up. So much for my big day off.
Hey, pretty flowers.
Oh, th-thank you.
New boyfriend?
No.
Hey, Frank, what's the date today?
April 17. Already?
Did you pay your taxes,
or are you exempt because you're from
(British accent): across the pond?
Don't do that. Is this from Abby?
Yeah, I kept bugging her for a picture.
Oh, my God, he's getting so big.
You should get one of those.
A husband or a baby? Yeah.
MORRIS: Neela, over here.
What you got?
You're still here?
Yeah. Don't remind me.
Sheryl Hawkins, restrained driver,
high-speed MVC. Car rolled three times.
Tachy to 120s, sat 98.
Got five of MS en route.
Positive seat belt sign.
Does this mean we can have lunch?
Hi, Sheryl. I'm Dr. Rasgotra.
Do we need to call anyone for you?
My husband. He'll have to pick up our kids after school.
Phone number's in my notes.
It's meatloaf day at the cafeteria.
Call her husband and meet us back in there. Go.
118/72.
Got a small forehead lac.
How long you been on the 42s?
Uh, it'll be a year in May.
Hey, is Lou Honeycutt still there?
Tony, let him do his job.
Nah.
What is this? EKG leads, sir.
No, I don't need that.
Hank, we got to monitor your heart
on the way to the hospital.
I'm not going to the hospital.
You fainted, Grandpa.
I lost my balance.
Sir, you could have a serious condition
that could lead to your heart completely shutting down.
I skipped breakfast.
All I need is some food.
Well, he's got a strong pulse.
Blood pressure's good, normal neuro exam.
Are we going in or not?
You ever send a woman roses?
Only if it's serious.
Is it serious?
No.
Well, either he's trying to get you into bed, or...
Uh...
He already got you into bed,
and he thinks you need the reassurance
that it wasn't just a one-night stand.
Okay. That's what I thought.
(chuckles)
Hold up. I'll be right back.
Hey!
Hey.
I've been calling you.
Yeah, I'm sorry. Things have been a little crazy.
I left you a bunch of messages.
Is everything all right? Mm, just work.
Look, I'm running late, and I'm, uh, guessing you should
be inside saving lives.
I'm waiting on a paramedic run.
There you go.
Hey, look, you want to grab some coffee later, or...?
I'm sorry. I have to go.
(sighs)
I was running late for my art history class at UIC
when this guy cut me off.
You're a professor?
(laughs) Freshman.
(laughs)
College is a little difficult
when you're pregnant right out of high school.
(groans)
Four kids, 23 years later...
(laughs)
...here... Ugh!... Here I am.
Your children must be proud.
(laughs)
Yeah.
(groans softly)
My son Chris is a sophomore.
He loves the fact
that his mother's... fresh...
Sheryl, everything okay? ...man.
A little woozy.
What's wrong?
She's tachy with a dropping crit,
and we're standing around chatting.
HAROLD: 112. It's not that bad.
Well, it's too fast, considering she's so calm.
I did that five minutes ago.
Ultrasound was fine.
The aorta seems
a little wide, doesn't it?
You're hallucinating.
See for yourself.
Where?
Okay, you were up
all night, you start imagining things.
Uh, it's subtle, but it's there.
(sighs)
With an aortic rupture, she'd be dead already,
but if it's a dissection
with a slow leak... Dead?
Uh, don't listen to her.
Sorry. I didn't mean to...
Morris, they need you in 2.
(sighs)
Okay, she's stable.
Lily will stay and monitor her.
Oh, you, grab a cup of coffee
or a nap or something.
Abdominal CT with a contrast right now.
If they make you wait more than a half an hour,
bring her straight to the OR.
Hey, are you okay?
Something's not right.
What the hell?
Oh, I read a study in where smelling one's breath
you can tell what's missing in their diet.
Well, stop it.
Make sure they're getting serial crits on her.
And then maybe we can go get
a coffee? Why so persistent?
No reason. Neela?
We need you for a trauma consult in here.
And check coags, too.
And... stop hitting on me.
I don't need any oxygen.
MORRIS: It's just a precaution.
Hank, for God's sake.
Hank, you're making this harder on everyone.
RASGOTRA: Tony, I thought you were off?
This is Sarah's grandfather.
We're spending the day together.
Pulse ox 98.
Fix her. Sometimes you can't
fix people if they're...
Shut up! Go away!
Why are you even here?
We don't want you here!
She doesn't want you here!
We don't want you!
Hello, sir. I'm Dr. Rasgotra from Surgery.
HANK: Ow. TAGGART: I'm sorry. It's the last one.
Looks like A fib at 130.
Okay, there's an electrical problem in the heart.
Causing a fast, irregular pulse.
You said his pulse was normal.
It's possible to go in and out of A fib.
We'll give medicine to slow down the heart,
and we'll thin the blood to reduce the risk of stroke.
TAGGART: 20 of Dilt? Yeah.
Neela, pressure's dropping in here.
Go.
The head trauma was minor.
All the problems seem to be cardiac.
Thank you for your help, dear.
HANK: Once you give me the medicine,
I can go home? Well, in a day or two.
We've got to make sure you didn't have a heart attack.
Sarah...
Look, this is very common.
There are some good treatments that'll fix him right up.
My friend Cathy's uncle died from a heart attack.
I know this looks scary,
but we're going to be extra careful, okay?
Okay? Okay.
6,000 heparin. MORRIS: Start a drip
at 1,400 an hour. Heart rate's at 80.
Pressure's good. You feeling better, Hank? I guess so.
I'm going to order a tele bed, all right?
X rays for Martin Senula.
This is Hank Riley.
Sorry.
I got it.
Troponin's cooking. Thanks, Sam.
You get a special delivery?
No. Uh, yes.
Thank you.
PRATT: You want to go ahead
and open your mouth for me?
Okay, good.
Now close.
Plain films. You can go ahead and open your eyes.
No film.
I have a digital camera.
His head CT was normal.
Come on. Let's go check and see if those labs are back.
Sit tight, Mr. Senula.
SENULA: I'd rather lie down.
You think he's got a bad concussion?
Fractured radius and ulna.
Humeral head, too.
Yeah, look at this.
And compression fractures of T-12, L-4 and 5,
all in different stages of healing.
That's never good.
(sighs)
Your signature, please.
What is this?
I'm filing a grievance
against Dr. Morris and his aftershave.
What's with you two?
TAGGART: I think it's love.
Have you smelled him?
He's like a violation of the Clean Air Act.
People in glass houses, Frank.
Hey, did you get my labs back on Exam 2?
The Chem 20 machine is down for an hour.
The Radiology attending wants you to call
about the MRI in 3.
Betina? Some guy named Cohen.
Your squeeze isn't working today.
I saw her walk in.
And don't say "squeeze," Frank.
Fine, so shoot the messenger.
Oh, and that kid's been loitering for a good hour.
The son of your broken bone guy.
Thanks. I got it.
Oh, and another thing-- the Golden Boy called.
His connecting flight was cancelled.
He won't be in until tonight.
Brenner? I thought he was at a conference in South Bend.
Oh, yeah, if by conference, you mean "fashion show,"
and by "South Bend," you mean Milan.
I'm Dr. Pratt.
Nick. How's my dad?
Well, he's got multiple fractures and a broken back.
That's pretty bad.
Is your mom around?
No, it's just the two of us.
Okay, well, do you have any relatives that live nearby?
My aunt. Do you mind if we give her a call?
Um, I don't have her number on me, so...
Can you get it?
Come on. We'll walk you over.
Do you know of anyone who might
want to hurt your dad?
Um, no.
He ever talk about anybody bothering him?
Like at work maybe?
He lost his job about a month ago.
What about drugs?
What?
Well, his injuries are consistent with violence.
Like somebody's been hitting him.
If he owed somebody some money, it...
My dad's not like that.
Can I see him now?
We're trying to help you.
Yeah, I'm sure you are.
Do you know who called 911?
I don't know. I was at school.
So everything was fine this morning before you left?
Yeah, fine.
He was fine and now his arms are all busted.
Okay, I-I don't get it either.
Go right in. He's in there.
We never said anything
about his dad's arms being broken.
TIFFANY: Dr. Gates.
(Hank vomits) I hung a second liter.
I need an order for reglan.
GATES: All right, start with ten. Oh, God. Oh, my God.
Take it easy, Hank.
Belly pain? All over.
Okay, open up the saline.
He needs an abdominal CT with contrast.
What's going on? It's possible that your grandfather...
Dr. Morris, what's happening?
Well, with A fib, you can get a blood clot in the heart.
Now, a piece can break off and travel
down to the belly, blocking the blood supply to his intestines.
(groans)
HANK: I need something. Four of morphine.
No, we should start with two. Pressure's borderline.
Once we open up the fluids...
Tony, listen to the doctor. Get him on a portable monitor.
I want him in the scanner in five minutes. Let's go!
Don't worry, sweetie. Mommy's going to be fine.
I'll see you when I wake up.
Bye. I love you.
Thank you.
I really needed to hear their voices.
Lucy, my five-year-old, is very worried.
You also have a five-year-old?
She was a surprise.
A great surprise, but a surprise.
Well, Lucy has nothing to worry about.
You're getting the best surgeon County has to offer.
Someone thinks very highly of herself.
I was referring to you.
Scrub in. You're first assistant.
I've been awake for over 30 hours.
I'll let you do the aortic repair yourself.
How many residents get that opportunity?
None. Neela, you have to do it.
Sweet!
What a great way to spend our last case together.
You're going to Pedes surgery.
I'll still see you.
Actually, I'm going to Pedes ICU.
What?
You're doing a non-surgical rotation?
Yeah, that's something I wanted to talk...
You're going to spend the whole month dialing dopamine
and weighing diapers. You're letting him do this?
It's his call.
Well, that's crap. You had to sign off.
Neela, I... You only have five years here.
You need to make every month count.
You know I'm right.
Okay, let's talk about this later.
We'll see you inside.
(continues scrubbing)
Have you seen my case of Groovitas?
I don't know. Ask Frank.
No, that's exactly what he wants me to do.
Morris, I thought we agreed.
No food on the floor.
No, Groovitas is not food.
It's a... liquid life force.
I have my first can at the start of my shift.
The second one midway through my shift.
(sighing)
I can't do this.
I can't. I can't work under these conditions.
That's it. This is war.
(chuckles)
And what great war wasn't fought with tape?
Look, I don't know, all right? Maybe you misdialed. I called
twice and both times it was wrong.
So do you have an aunt or not?
Look, all you're doing...
okay, all you're doing is asking stupid questions.
So fix him up and let us go home!
That's not going to happen anytime soon.
His X rays show that he's been repeatedly beaten.
We need to figure out who's doing this to him. You don't know what
you're talking about, do you?! When you fight with your dad,
does it get physical? Sam...
Do you lose your temper? Sometimes throw punches? No, we don't fight.
Come on now. It's you that's hurting your dad,
isn't it?
Stupid bitch!
Hey! What the hell was that?
I'm just doing my job.
By berating the kid in the middle of the ER?
Well, obviously, something's going on.
I'm trying to figure out what the real story is.
Sam, you do not get to storm
into the hallway making accusations.
If you have a problem, you discuss it calmly.
Or better yet, just run it by me first.
Well, somebody has to take the initiative.
And what's that supposed to mean?
That means while you've moved on to the next patient,
I'm the one who's in the trenches.
I have to deal with the family.
I have to follow up for us
to make sure we didn't miss anything.
And right now, I'm the only one
who's trying to figure out what's wrong with this guy.
You learn that in Chief Camp?
Might want to ask for your money back.
All right, everybody, back to work.
Mind if I sit down?
First of all,
Nurse Taggart-- she had no right to accuse you.
She overstepped her bounds, and I'm sorry.
But some of what you told us just doesn't add up.
Look, the last thing any of us want
is for your dad to come back here in a month
with more broken bones.
Now, if you know of anyone who could have done this...
Look, no one hit him.
And you know that for a fact?
Yeah.
He fell in the kitchen.
All right, I-I'm the one who called 911.
Paramedics said it was an anonymous call.
Yeah, well, I disguised my voice.
Tried to sound older.
Why would you do that?
Okay, about two years ago, my dad was in a car accident,
and they made me stay with a foster family.
I'm not going through that again.
So there's no aunt?
I was hoping if you thought I had someone to stay with,
you'd just leave me alone.
And you say your dad was just standing there and then he fell?
Yeah.
Come on, man. You got to give me something more.
Look, I don't know, all right?
I guess he has been acting kind of weird lately.
He's fallen a couple times.
Today was definitely the worst.
Like, he was just,
he was making a sandwich in the kitchen.
I hear a thud.
I look over and... he's on the floor.
Just let me run a few more tests
and see what I can come up with.
Hey, wait a second.
You're not going to snitch me out to Social Services, are you?
Let's just see what I can figure out
about your dad first, okay?
You had to tube him?
He dropped his sats in Radiology.
What are you talking about-- "tubed"?
We're helping your husband breathe, ma'am.
They read the scan?
Big clot in the SMA.
Hank... Hank.
No, we had to sedate him for the CT.
The, uh, the scan shows
a large clot blocking the main artery to his intestines.
So what do you need to do?
Well, we need to open up that artery. Dr. Morris?
Well, we need to restore blood flow to his bowels,
and that means surgery.
Surgery? Today?
No, no, not necessarily.
What about TPA?
No, I don't, I don't think that's the best option here.
What's TPA?
It's a clot- busting medicine
that could help.
But if it doesn't, we've delayed
an inevitable operation.
Yeah, that could cause a stroke or MI.
Surgery is the best option here.
If that's what you think.
Page Neela. All right, I want a hematology consult, too.
You are wasting time.
Not if it prevents an intracar...
Stop it. Just stop.
I want coags, serial crits, and neurovascular checks q hour.
Got it.
And stay on top of the vent.
Acidosis is the last thing she needs right now.
Got it.
Why the neurovascular checks?
To make sure she's perfusing her extremities
distal to the graft.
I still haven't forgotten what you said about pedes.
I'll talk to Lucien as soon as he gets back.
Look, that's really not necessary. He can't exile you
to the pedes ward.
What's he trying to do-- sabotage your career?
He's not trying to sa... You need ten months of surgical electives.
There isn't time to fool around in the PICU. It's okay.
No, it's not.
You know, you won't graduate on time
and then when you're looking for jobs
you'll be behind the pack and...
I'm not taking it as an elective.
I'm switching specialties.
What are you talking about?
I don't want to be a surgeon.
What did he say to you?
Actually, Dr. Dubenko's been very supportive about this.
Unbelievable.
You know, I told him I would work with you,
I told him I would mentor you,
and for what? So he could eventually squeeze you out?
(beeper beeping) Damn, it's the ER.
Look, stay here and call me with Sheryl's next crit.
And don't worry.
I'll handle this. I'm not worried, Neela.
Harold Zelinsky,
you will be a great surgeon.
This is what you're supposed to be doing.
I'm not going to let one person get in the way of that.
Is that for Hank?
Yeah.
His K's 3.2, so Morris wants 40 in the bag.
You okay?
Yeah, it just he's not the best surgical candidate,
but I can't get Becky to listen to me.
Hmm.
Well, you know what your problem is.
You don't know how to talk to women.
Yeah, that's my problem.
Mm-hmm.
Well, I'll teach you, but...
(clicks tongue)
...it's going to take a really long time.
I better get this up.
Onset of pain was an hour ago.
(grunts)
He's infarcting everything
from the jejunum to the transverse colon.
We have to correct this.
With surgery? Well, we were discussing TPA
as an alternative.
I'm talking about local TPA.
Well, it's a good idea in theory, but...
It might not work?
And we would lose valuable time.
Mrs. Riley, if, uh,
we get Radiology down here, you can get another opinion,
and if they have a good track record with TPA with catheter,
then it might be worth considering.
But if we wait too long
and his bowel dies, he's at risk for sepsis.
What's sepsis?
It's an infection.
I just want to do what's best for Hank.
Why don't we at least talk to Radiology?
Enough! Why won't you listen?!
Surgery is not necessarily the best option.
You'll never change, will you?
You can't ever let someone else be right.
Let's do a liter of saline an hour
for two hours.
Hey, Dr. Pratt.
Hey. Any news?
Yeah, his hormones causing too much calcium in his blood.
So that's what made his bones break?
His bones are very brittle;
it doesn't take much to cause a fracture.
Then this is just going to keep happening or what?
No.
He can have surgery to remove some of the parathyroid glands
and his bones will become strong again.
So how long is he going to be in the hospital for?
About a week.
(sighs)
I... really don't want to stay with a foster family.
All right, tell me something.
How do you get to school in the morning?
Uh, my friend's mom-- she picks me up.
And what do you do after school?
Bus tables at a diner near my house.
Get home around 7:00.
What if I told you you could take care of yourself
while your dad is in the hospital?
Seriously?
What about the social worker?
Well, as long as you come in every day and visit your dad
and check in with me,
I'll take care of the social worker.
Thanks, Dr. Pratt.
No problem.
Hey, what's going on
with Sarah's granddad?
Eh, could be better.
All right, well, keep me posted.
I hope you're right about this.
Me, too.
I was sorry to hear about Julia.
Oh, thanks.
I'm fine.
Seems that way.
Julia's plane hasn't even landed in Bangkok
and you've already moved on to Sam.
Actually, she went to Nepal.
Eh, whatever.
What, are you jealous? Please.
You don't see anything wrong with the fact
that you go from relationship to relationship?
Doesn't work out, I move on.
Yeah, well, it wouldn't kill you
to think about someone other than yourself.
What does that mean?
Sarah, maybe?
You really want to go there?
You would rather be with the wrong person
than be on your own,
and in the wake of all these failed relationships
sits a girl in desperate need of stability. I give her stability.
I help with her homework. I cook her dinner.
She can talk to me about anything.
Like how there's a different woman in your bed every month?
Mrs. Riley,
the surgical consent forms.
Before you sign anything, please read it carefully
and understand, um, all the risks involved
with Hank's surgery.
I, uh, I'm not sure.
Well, there are always potential complications.
This says "brain damage, death."
I thought you said... Well, right now the benefits
of surgery outweigh the risks.
But he could die.
This says he could die.
No, no, there's got to be a better way.
Tony, this is not how we were supposed
to spend the day.
We were supposed to be out with our granddaughter...
...not stuck in this godforsaken hospital.
I know it's a lot to absorb.
Tony, maybe you were right. Do the TPA thing.
Then he won't need surgery.
Hank should have the surgery.
But you said it wasn't necessary; you, you said...
Becky, Dr. Rasgotra is an excellent surgeon,
and if she and Dr. Morris recommend this,
then I'd say we go for it, trust them,
and we'll all do everything we can
to make sure this turns out right.
Okay?
DUBENKO: More traction on the pancreas.
Where do we access the SMA?
Neela?
Neela, the course of the artery?
Neela.
Inferior to the uncinate process,
superior to the duodenum.
Exactly.
Vessel loops,
help me get distal control.
Oh, crap.
Lap pad.
Suction. Systolic down to 90.
Hang another unit.
I-I can't see a damn thing in here.
Did we nick the IVC?
I think we sheared off some venous tributaries.
Start with hemoclips,
50 prolene on a C-1 needle in case we're into the vessel wall.
Let's go.
Was I acting crazy?
(chuckles)
Well, that was the calcium talking, but no worries.
So when I get home, Nicky has to wait on me hand and foot, right?
Yeah, well, it couldn't hurt.
Just to be on the safe side.
Yeah, sure.
(Pratt chuckles)
So I'll see you tomorrow.
Yeah, right after school.
I just got to be at work by 4:00.
All right.
Thanks again. You got it.
Never have I been so happy to be wrong.
Yeah, well, sometimes you go with your gut;
other times you got to force yourself to be objective.
Yeah, I should have slowed down.
Yeah, and I could have taken a few cleansing breaths.
I'm taking this new management course.
How's that going for you?
Well, I'm working on conflict resolution.
So you got a few weeks to go, huh?
(laughs)
(exhales loudly)
Stop breathing so loud!
Stop tapping your pen!
Mouth breather.
Pen-tapping garden gnome.
Garden gnome?
All right, guys, guys. Come on now! What...?
(sighs) All right, wait, look.
Archie, Frank, just-just tell me what's wrong.
Frank is a hypocrite! Morris is an idiot!
No, no. Come on, one at a time.
Frank's a hypocrite.
Okay, look,
starting your sentences with "I feel."
I feel...
like Frank...
is a big, fat hypocrite.
That's not what I meant. I feel...
hurt because Archie had a party,
and he invited everyone but me.
See, that's good. That's very good, Frank.
Can I... Can I go again?
(clears throat)
I feel...
...like Frank is hypocritical
because he told me he hated sushi and karaoke.
I didn't think... I didn't think you'd want to go.
I could have grabbed a burger on the way over there.
What about the karaoke?
I don't want to do it.
I don't mind watching you make an ass out of yourself.
I'm... I'm sorry.
I'm s... Come here. Come here, you big lug.
I'm sorry.
Oh!
Can I buy you a cup of coffee?
Yeah. Yeah.
(chuckles) Wow.
RASGOTRA: Keep his fluids at 125,
and, uh, CBC in an hour.
Hey.
Surgery is over, Hank.
We got the clot out.
Neela, can we talk?
All right, all right, I'll buy you lunch.
I'll meet you in Recovery.
Wherever you want.
(coins jingling) I have...
52 cents. I'm sorry.
And I haven't spoken to Lucien yet, either, but I will...
It was my decision to leave.
Lucien had nothing to do with it. What?
I'm not cut out for surgery.
Of course you are. You're...
No, listen. I'm not.
I see how much you've given up to become a surgeon,
and I admire that, but I want to have a life.
Harold.
I don't want to end up alone.
No offense.
Oh, come on. You're young.
By the time I finish my residency, I'll be 26.
If I want to do a fellowship, I won't be done until I'm 29.
29, Neela! You might as well just put a bullet in my head.
You're overstressed.
You just need a break.
Neela, it's over.
Was I not a good teacher?
Did we not spend enough time together?
We both did our best to make this work.
Well, was it something I said or didn't say?
It's not you, Neela.
It's me.
BETINA: So you think they can do the pullthrough at the same time?
MAN: With familial polyposis, they do everything they can...
Just give me one more minute.
...to avoid a colostomy,
but it's a real possibility.
I see.
Hey. Hi, Greg.
What are you doing here?
I didn't know you were on today.
I'm not.
I'm just going over a case here with Grant.
You two know each other, right?
Grant Hayward, Oncology.
Yeah, I've seen you around.
Hi.
So, what were you talking about,
that Wilms kid that we scanned yesterday?
No.
Wow. It was a crazy adrenal tumor.
Took up the whole abdominal cavity.
We're talking about me, Greg.
You're not allergic to roses, are you?
No. These are really beautiful,
but kind of embarrassing.
Well, I had a good time with you.
I just wanted to let you know.
Yeah, well, I heard that the other night loud and clear.
(laughs) Oh.
Well, no. I-I...
You know, I like you. I...
You know, it's not just about...
Keeping a full dance card?
Right. It's not just about that.
Uh-huh. Shoot!
I was gonna use you and abuse you,
and then throw you out.
Now, why would you do that?
'Cause doctors have been doing that to nurses for years now.
It's a little karmic retribution.
You want me to play nurse?
I'll try anything once.
(laughs) I have a...
Hey, Archie. Hi, Archie.
Sam, I figured it out.
You're sending them to yourself, right?
(sighs)
You got me.
Ha! Good night, guys.
Hmm. Ooh.
No!
Hey.
Everything okay?
Last weekend,
my college roommate had a baby shower
for her third kid.
Who does that?
Oh, I don't know.
Somebody desperate for attention?
Maybe Sheryl had it right.
I should have popped out four kids,
and then gone to med school.
Four kids? You want four kids?
Oh! I don't even know if I want kids,
but if I did, I couldn't have them now.
I don't have time to do laundry,
much less have sex.
Wait. Meet someone. Then have sex.
You could meet someone.
Yeah, I turned down a date last week so I could sleep.
The closest thing I have to a personal relationship
is Harold Zelinsky,
a 19-year-old intern,
and he just dumped me.
Well, you-you have a personal relationship with me, right?
We're-We're friends.
You know what? Go home.
You're tired.
I'm 31 today.
It's your birthday?
Oh, Neela, I'm sorry.
I didn't realize.
Oh, don't worry.
Nobody did.
(sighs)
Here.
Happy birthday.
I'm sorry I don't have a candle.
(laughs)
Thank you.
No, don't eat it. That's disgust...
Oh, that's disgusting.
It's been out since this morning.
Spit that out.
(sighs)
I can't do this.
(sniffles)
You know, I fell asleep
in the shower this morning, and...
Well, it doesn't... it doesn't matter.
But I realized,
I'm going through life as if everything's okay.
But it's... it's not.
Come on.
What are you doing?
Pity party's over.
Here. What do you see?
A happy family who came...
I see a mom
who was this close to dying from a torn aorta.
You made a critical diagnosis and performed a flawless
anastamosis of a bifemoral Y graft.
And in there,
I see a grandfather who could have died from ischemic bowel,
but thanks to you, he'll be eating filet mignon soon.
Yeah, but...
I don't care how many babies people have or how many dates
you miss.
Very few people could have done what you did today.
Hey, you have a gift, Neela.
You have a gift.
The minute you start comparing yourself to others
is the minute that you forget
you're doing exactly what you are meant to do.
Your shift ended 15 minutes ago.
You should go home.
You look like hell.
(sighs)
Will he be able to walk his horses?
Uh, for shorter distances to start with, but yes.
Good.
He loves that.
Maybe, uh, lay off the air hockey
for a little while.
(laughs)
He kept beating me anyway.
Thanks, Neela.
Sure thing.
BETINA: Every year I get a colonoscopy, and every year it's fine.
I guess I was starting to believe
that it wasn't going to happen, which is ridiculous, because,
in my family, it's not a question of if, but when.
Yeah, but if you get the surgery, you'll have no chance
of getting colon cancer, so you'll be okay.
Everything will be fine, right?
Until I develop a post-op desmoid
or hepatoblastoma or thyroid cancer.
Oh, come on. You don't know that.
I was born with a defective tumor suppressor gene.
Colon cancer is just the beginning.
Why didn't you tell me?
You showed your hand.
I knew you weren't cut out for this.
I can handle it.
Really? You want to change my colostomy bag?
That's touching, but I don't think so.
All right, look, maybe in the past, I...
You weren't 100% committed when things were easy,
so don't try to tell me now,
all of a sudden, that you can handle it.
I don't need your pity.
It's not pity.
You shouldn't have to go through this alone.
It was my choice to end our relationship.
You don't have to call.
You don't have to check up on me.
This is not your problem, Greg.
Betina.
I'm letting you off the hook.
Hey, I got you some food.
I figured you and Sarah must be pretty hungry for dinner, huh?
Oh, thank you.
Listen, Hank is, um...
He's going to be here for a week.
Uh, so until then, I think Sarah would love it
if you would stay with us.
Thank you. That's very generous.
I'm sorry for how I treated you.
It's been a stressful day.
Not just today.
I remember the first time I met you.
You were this messed-up vet back from the war
running around with my daughter.
Yes, I was.
Meg used to say you changed, that you grew up,
but I didn't believe it, not really.
Until today.
Thank you.
How's he doing? Very well.
When we restored the blood supply
to his intestines, they pinked up right away.
That's a good sign.
Thank you, Dr. Rasgotra.
Well, I'm about to go off duty.
I will check on him first thing.
I'll be there.
Listen, about what you said,
me dating Sam...
Yeah, um, about that.
I-I said some awful things, and... I'm sorry.
Uh, to say I'm sleep-deprived
would be a massive understatement,
so I would just like to blame it on the, uh...
the frontal lobe malfunction and call it a day.
It's okay with you? Sure.
Hey, Mayday.
Happy birthday.
Thank you.
(phone ringing)
Neela Rasgotra.
Oh, I-I know. I'm-I'm sorry.
Um, I was stuck at work.
Well, can they come tomorrow?
Well, how hard is it to hook up cable?
Three weeks?!
Well, I'll leave a key under the mat.
Yes, I'm serious.
Look, I'm a doctor, and I'm single.
All I have is Project Runway. Hello? Hello?
