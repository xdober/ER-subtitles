Previously on ER:
How would you feel about an Ortho rotation?
You have a surgical elective requirement, so now...
you're all mine.
I'm Jaspreet, Neela's cousin.
My pleasure. Uh, wait.
Excuse me.
Wait. But...
I'm your friend. Are you really about
to lecture me on love with your track record?
Don't.... Because I'm thinking right now
Ray is really wishing he didn't meet you.
I need to go somewhere.
A facility with professionals.
So take Joe, go to Croatia for your father,
while I do that.
MAN: Your full reinstatement, Dr. Lockhart, is yet
to be determined.
You'll be allowed to work shifts on a probationary status
until several contingencies are met.
LOCKHART: Okay.
WOMAN: A minimum of two
two weekly physician diversion group meetings,
plus at least three AA meetings a week.
LOCKHART: Okay. Understood.
(construction roaring)
MAN: Under normal circumstances
this committee would require you to attend another
30 meetings in 30 days
before allowing you back on the schedule
in addition to the 30 you've already attended.
but, because you were so forthcoming
and volunteered to check yourself
into a domestic
detox facility, we've decided to make an exception.
Dr. Pratt also asked us to make some concessions
on your behalf.
So, effective immediately, you are cleared to return to work.
Oh.
Uh... thank you.
Thank you,
but I need a little more time.
Um... My husband, Dr. Kovac, and our son
are in Croatia.
They've been there...
I, I just need to spend some time with them,
and I think I would be better for it when I come back to work.
We have no problem with that.
Dr. Pratt?
It's fine by me.
I can always adjust the schedule.
How much time do you think you need?
A couple of weeks, maybe.
Since we won't be able to monitor you in Europe,
you understand, we'll have to ask you to start all over again
when you return.
60 meetings. 60 days.
Diversion group.
Random urine tests.
Absolutely. Agreed.
Thank you.
Jaspreet, I gotta pee.
Jaspreet!
I heard you got in late last night.
(shower running)
Where'd you end up going?
Where'd you end up going?!
Some club called The Passage.
DJ was wicked.
What are you doing?
I have to pay
for hot water, you know.
Okay. No pronator drift.
Mrs. Smalls. Hi, I'm Dr. Gates.
Oh, another cute doctor.
Must be my lucky day.
She's been having trouble sleeping.
No past medical history.
Exam was normal. I haven't had
a good night in weeks.
Have you had any belly or chest pains?
This is all Marty's fault.
He's my husband.
Mmm. He's the one that keeps waking me up.
I hear him calling me in the middle of the night.
So, I don't quite follow. He, he wakes you up
while you're sleeping?
Yes, every night.
Have you considered telling him to stop?
Waking you up.
It doesn't help. Then I just dream about him.
Well, is he here? Maybe we can talk to him.
He's been dead for six years.
Now, you don't worry, Mrs. Smalls.
We're gonna take good care of you,
and I'm gonna get to the bottom of this.
Psych consult?
Yeah. Check the CBC, chem panel, and UA
in case she has hypercalcemia, okay?
And, uh, call Julie Dupree.
The chaplain?
She's pretty hot for a chaplain.
She's pretty hot, period.
How's that working out?
I'm gonna go order these labs.
Sam, you seen any attendings?
(vomiting)
My God.
Please make it stop.
What the hell happened to you?
Bad baba ganoush.
Oh...
I need you to sign off on our CHF'r,
and the board's getting pretty full.
And I need one, too.
Why don't you go home?
You look like ass. Thank you.
I was home until Skye got sick with the flu.
Morris, are you sick?
No, Frank, I got this IV
because I'm feeling a little parched.
I can't get sick. I got a date this weekend.
It's food poisoning. You can't catch that.
(speaking Spanish)
Loco me dice se todo.
Gates, GYN has a bed,
but they can't take your PID for two hours.
That's what they said four hours ago.
Don't get uppity. I just work here, honey.
Sam, what's with my chemo lady in 4?
Still waiting for Oncology.
Are we the only department working today?
I need a coffee.
Uh... Dr. Pratt and Abby need some privacy
for a few minutes.
Abby's back?
I thought she was in Croatia.
Well, what are they doing in there? What's so private?
Well, I suppose if they had wanted you to know,
they would have invited you.
And where am I gonna get my coffee?
Jumbo Mart. In fact,
you should get us all one.
Ooh, yeah. I'll take a large latte.
Mm. Black. Regular. Hold the cream.
Gimme a hot tea, will ya?
FRANK: Large, no foam
percent latte Americana.
What the hell is that, Frank?
Just tell Bheru to fix Frank's regular.
I don't drink coffee.
All right, if anyone needs me,
I'll be at the Jumbo Mart.
Freeloaders.
(door bangs)
Somebody help!
Hold on. What happened? What happened?
I heard some guy beating on her.
I-I broke in.
I fought him off. All right.
All right. I need a gurney here!
What's her name? Sally.
Sally. Okay, Sally. Can you hear me?
He hurt her bad this time.
I-I think her arm is broken.
ABBY: Okay.
What are people saying?
Well, they think you've been in Croatia since Christmas.
That's it?
I was sure the rumor train would be running.
Thank you.
Well, you know how it is.
One minute it's Thanksgiving.
Then all of a sudden it's next year.
People do their own thing.
Mmm.
Listen, thank you very much for your discretion
and, um...
and I'm sorry I had to burden you with this stuff.
It's not a burden, Abby. It's management.
You know, the only reason I know the whole story
is because I'm your supervisor.
I gotta say it.
I thought we were friends.
Of course we're friends, Greg.
Then why wouldn't you come to me for help?
You know, it didn't have to go like this.
Well, it turns out...
I'm not so great at asking for help.
(laughs)
Well.
Well, I'm here.
Okay?
You do know that, right?
(sighs)
Chuny and the nurses sent a condolence card for Luka's dad
and I told them I'd call when I got back
and I just... I hate this.
(sighs)
I'm so embarrassed and ashamed.
Oh, you shouldn't be.
Really?
I was a bad friend.
I was a bad doctor.
I was a bad wife.
I was a bad mother...
No.
We see bad mothers come through here all the time,
and you do not qualify.
We all have flaws, Abby, but how many of us actually
work to fix it?
(knocking)
Sorry to interrupt.
Victims from a building fire are en route.
All right, go ahead and prep the trauma rooms.
I'll be right there.
(sighs)
Damn.
It's a terrible day for multiples.
(groans)
What's up?
We're short-staffed.
Hey, I could work for a couple of hours.
Really. I'm cool.
My flight's not till tomorrow.
Might even feel good.
Wow.
Your cousin, Neela, is truly gifted.
Do I look taller?
I-I feel taller.
Yeah. My advice is cut and run.
Are you insane?
Cut and run? I'm putting this on my blog.
Oh, God, that's just wrong.
If that's wrong, I don't want to be right.
Uh-oh. The surgeons are here.
Hey, what's up, party people?! Hi, guys.
Hey, Neela, how's Jaspreet doing? She hasn't called me
in a few days. Oh, Jaspreet?
She's doing just fine, buddy.
Trust me.
Somebody call for a doctor?
Hey, you. Welcome back.
How was Croatia?
Uh, you know. European.
Sorry for your loss. Thanks.
Harms, what it look like?
Dexter Jackson, 11,
apartment building fire, burns to hands and chest.
Crush injuries from falling debris.
Tachy to 160. BP: 100. All right, Dex.
Don't worry: we're gonna
get you fixed up. Morris, take him to Trauma 1.
Grady, you go with him.
What we got here? Kayla Weeks, seven.
Smoke inhalation, minor injuries, some wheezing.
Sat's 92.
Having trouble breathing, sweetie?
Firefighter behind us is pretty bad. Okay.
Abby, get her set up on nebs and check a baseline chest.
Chuny, come with me. Yup!
Zades, talk to me.
Jay Gleason, 28. Floor gave way in a fire.
15-foot fall.
Burns to hands and face.
Possible spine injury.
Jake, where you hurting at, man?
Back mostly.
Sat's 91. All right. Come on.
Let's get him in Trauma 2.
Hey, do me a favor. Wiggle those toes for me, all right?
Like that?
I'm sorry. I know it's last-minute,
but they surprised me.
Well, that was nice, right?
Yes, I guess, from a certain point of view
one's big brother and his wife
showing up unannounced is nice, yes.
Not nice?
No. Yes. It's very nice.
It's just that...
usually by dessert they're telling me how worried they are
because, you know, I'm wasting my life away as a chaplain.
Well, if the shoe fits...
Kidding. What, are they not religious?
Hardcore Catholic.
And he's a hedge fund millionaire,
so it doesn't help that I'm a $35,000-a-year chaplain.
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
Are you scared to meet my family?
Who, me?
No, I would love to meet your family.
It's just that, uh...
You know, I just don't know
what time I'm gonna be done here, and..
Well, if you can,
I could really use some backup.
All right. I'll... I'll let you know.
How's she doing?
Out cold.
Sally?
Sally?
(moaning weakly)
Oh, got a little ETOH going here, huh?
Yeah, don't light a match.
And, uh, it's not just alcohol.
All right, we still need a head scan.
Did the plain films come in yet?
Uh-huh. And the CT will be ready for her in a few minutes.
And I already paged Ortho.
Okay.
She gonna be okay?
I think so.
They always fighting over there, man.
The guy, the guy-- he's a real prick.
It's a good thing you were close.
C-spine's clear.
How's her arm?
Well, it's, uh... it's broken pretty bad, but it's fixable.
(Sally moans quietly)
Can you get the finger traps ready
when they take her to CT?
Should I wait here?
That's fine.
Oh, your head's bleeding.
Hey, don't worry about it.
Well, we should look at it.
It's okay. We won't bite.
All right, let me take a look.
Want to sit down here?
That doesn't look too bad.
We could fix that up with a couple staples here.
Sam...
Car accident.
Head-on with a drunk driver.
I used to be a grade school music teacher.
Now I do courses online.
Kind of hard to scare the students that way, isn't it?
Wait, wait. This is Ortho.
Yeah. I start today.
Oh, no, I thought that was next week.
Dubenko hates me!
Well, Dubenko's not on. Crenshaw is.
Yeah, great. He hates me more.
Neela...
(screams) Ooh!
(mocking groans, laughter)
Just a bit outside. Ow.
Look at you. You're early.
Well, you know, first impressions.
Dr. Rasgotra, I'd like you to meet Drs. Ramsey...
Hey.
...Craig... How's it going?
...and Pavlich. Hey, what's up?
RAMSEY: Heard great things about you.
What's that?
Oh, uh, this is Dr. Zelinsky, surgical intern.
You okay, man? You need a glass of water or something?
You look a little dry.
No, I'm good.
Yeah, Harold was just leaving.
Good luck.
Hockey-- I used to play a little at school.
Field, not ice.
Take a shot.
Oh, I couldn't. It's been years.
Come on. Take a shot.
Yes!
Girl power! Come on!
Aah! Yes!
First albuterol is done. You want continuous?
Uh, no, sats are up to 97 and the wheezing's better.
Repeat treatment in half an hour.
Is that your brother in there?
No, he's not my real brother, but he's nice to me so far.
Are you guys foster kids?
Yeah.
Okay, well, you sit tight.
I'm going to go check on him.
My name is Abby. This is Malik.
Let us know if you need anything.
GRADY: BP's up a little to 85.
How's he doing?
MORRIS: Not great. Still taching away.
Blood in the belly?
No free blood, but look at the liver.
LOCKHART: Subscapular hematoma.
Films are back.
How's Luka holding up?
Um... you know, it's hard.
My dad died when I was 19.
Well, at least you're back in the States.
Always nice to come home after a long trip, huh?
C-spine looks clear.
Uh, nothing on the chest or pelvis.
FRANK: Kid's foster mom is here.
Hi, I'm Dr. Lockhart.
We were in the laundry room when the fire broke out.
Are they okay?
Um, uh, Kayla has some smoke inhalation,
but she's gonna be fine.
Dexter's a little more serious.
He's got some bleeding around his liver.
It's probably Stupid's fault.
You leave the oven on again?
Keisha, I told you, stop calling her that.
Y'all got a phone I could use, please?
I need to get somebody to cover my shift.
Right there. Dial 9 first.
Pratt could use a hand in here.
I'll go.
Solumedrol, 2.4 grams over 15 minutes,
then infuse at 430 milligrams per hour.
Somebody page Neurosurge.
Can you get a central line going?
Yeah. Good.
MARQUEZ: Nice to have you back.
We missed you. How's Luka?
He's good.
Sterile sixes, please.
Neurosurgery's on the way.
Good.
Well, if you're going to have a funeral,
Croatia's a good place to do it.
How is he? Fracture at T-11.
T-11. What's that mean?
Looks like we got a fractured vertebra,
with bruises of the spinal cord.
Will it get better?
I'm not gonna be paralyzed, am I?
Uh, it's just a little too early to tell right now.
Those kids I saved-- are they okay?
So far, so good.
That little girl hadn't broken that window and screamed,
we would've never known they were in there.
(alarms blaring) MORRIS: Damn it!
All right, go. Just go, go.
Okay, uh, prep and drape, I'll be right back.
All right.
MORRIS: Another 600 cc bolus!
Hemoglobin's down to 12.4. BP: 70.
Type and cross two more units.
See what you did, Stupid? Keisha...
I didn't leave the oven on! Liar.
Okay, just stop! Stop!
Dexter's gonna die and it's all your fault!
I hate you!
Kayla, wait!
Kayla...
Ooh!
Oh, my gosh... are you okay, honey?
Ow... Come here, sweetie. You okay?
It's not my fault.
I didn't leave the oven on. I didn't.
How many fingers am I holding up?
Um... three?
Okay, what about here?
No, sorry-- two.
Can you follow my finger?
Okay.
How long have your eyes been like that?
I don't know. Forever.
Yeah? You ever seen a doctor for it?
No. I keep it a secret so people won't hate me.
Sweetheart, nobody hates you.
All my foster families do.
That's why I keep getting moved.
Listen to me: grownups can be really weird sometimes.
And it may seem like they don't like you,
but that's probably just because they're really...
busy, or they're sad or they're mad,
but I guarantee you it's not about you.
You understand?
And for what it's worth, I like you.
I left the oven on once,
but I turned it off all the way this time.
I know I did.
Ortho's here.
GATES: Hey, Mayday. RASGOTRA: Hey.
Hey, since when are you Ortho? Since this morning.
GROSSMAN: You guys mind if maybe we catch up later?
I can see some films?
TAGGART: Here you go.
Who are these guys?
GATES: Orthopedic specialists. They're here to look at her arm.
Okay, what ligaments are disrupted
in a perilunate dislocation?
RASGOTRA: The scapholunate and the lunotriquetral
interosseous ligament. And?
Back from X-ray?
No, never went. Sats are dropping. Down to 91.
All right, we'll have to tube him before he goes to CT.
Grady, you're up. YOLANDA: Is he okay?
LOCKHART: He might have some smoke damage to his lungs.
We're gonna help him breathe for a little while.
MORRIS: Suction, please.
Do you know anything about Kayla's vision problems?
Vision problems?!
No. Cricoid pressure.
She's only been with me for a couple of weeks.
That explains a lot. She's clumsy.
MORRIS: See the cords?
Yep.
Now, why would they send me a disabled kid?
They should know better than... I can't handle that.
I'm a single foster mom, and I got five of 'em.
I'm in.
I don't think they knew.
I think she's been keeping this to herself.
MARQUEZ: Sats are coming up. 96. But I'd like to run
a few more tests, if that's okay with you.
Surgery's here.
What do you need us to fix this time?
MORRIS: 25% body surface area burns.
Crush injury with liver hematoma on FAST scan.
Pressure's down again. What's happening?
GRADY: Following the Parkland formula?
Four cc's per kilo per... Yes, thanks. We know.
Hematoma could be expanding. Let's take a quick look.
I'll throw in a central line. I want his BP up before CT!
Intraosseous is faster.
No, I can get more fluids with a central line!
(tool whirring) Wait, wait, wait, wait!
Oh, and I am in before you even gloved up.
CRENSHAW: All right, let's get him up to CT.
LOCKHART: Okay, squeeze in another few liters.
And you should go with them. Let's just follow them.
I hate surgeons. It seems like it's mutual.
How you feeling? Like hell.
Morris, have you ever heard of a genetic disorder called LCA?
No, but it's just food poisoning.
Not you. Little girl from the fire.
Leber's congenital amaurosis.
It causes center field vision loss in kids.
And she had a normal fundoscopic exam,
and nystagmus, which are indicators.
Well, I've never heard of it. Send her to Ophtho.
Let them sort it out.
Can somebody please give me a shot?
I'm dying here.
What is it, compazine?
Yeah, I been puking my brains out.
What are you doing?
I'll do the arm. No butts.
Well, it hurts way more in the arm.
No. Here.
Come on! Be a professional!
All right, Abby, make it quick.
(groans)
Right cheek or left?
Okay, exaggerate the deformity slightly...
then pull.
Ow!
Not bad. Splint.
You want a sugar tong extended to the end of the phalanges?
Thanks, hon.
Or Sam.
Post-reduction films and get her on the surgery list.
Stabilize the wrist.
Think I can go home soon?
Uh, no. You know what? I want to get
a tetanus shot for that head lac first, okay?
How long is that gonna take? I should go.
Just hang out. We'll take care of you soon, okay?
Wow. What happened to that guy?
Car accident.
You did great.
RASGOTRA: I did?
TAGGART: Hey, stranger. We heard you were back.
Hi. Hi.
GATES: What's up?
Nothing. Hi.
Hi.
TAGGART: How are you? I'm good.
GATES: Yeah? You were gone a long time.
We didn't know if you were coming back. Yeah.
Where were you?
I was taking some private time to... uh, personal time.
I'm sorry. Who are you?
Barry Grossman. Orthopedics. Hi.
Abby Lockhart. So you're up in Ortho.
Uh, yeah.
That's great.
TAGGART: How was Croatia? I hear it's gorgeous.
Yeah. Uh, well, yeah. I'm going tomorrow.
Oh, you mean you didn't go?
No. Joe and Luka are there.
But I had some stuff I had to take care of, so...
Okay.
Sorry to break up the little reunion, but we gotta...
Hey, I'm gonna call you tonight, okay?
Okay.
I'm gonna go work on that splint.
GATES: Cool. I'll meet you there.
Good to see you. You, too.
Welcome back. Thanks.
ROSEMARY: Then the rabbi says to the priest,
"I'm sorry, sir, I didn't know you were sitting here."
(laughing) That's hilarious!
I've never heard that one before.
Hi. Looks like you guys are having fun.
She's delightful.
Well, your labs came back normal, which is good,
so there's gonna be another doctor
to come down here and talk to you soon, okay?
Take your time. I got nowhere to be.
You mind if I borrow her for a second?
(whispers): Go ahead. I'll be right back.
Thanks for coming down.
I thought maybe a little God talk would do her good.
Oh, she's actually an atheist.
But did you know she was a Rockette back in the '50s?
That's how she met her husband.
He came to the show one night,
and he hung out at the stage entrance afterwards,
just so he could meet her.
He said of the whole line of beautiful girls,
she was the only one he saw.
So... no prayers, no meditation?
Just shooting the breeze?
She's alone and grieving.
And no matter what you believe in,
even if it's nothing, grief is something I'm good with.
Dinner is at Gibson's, by the way,
if that sweetens the deal.
Doesn't hurt.
I'll see you later. Okay.
Hey, Frank, can you page Psych for me again?
What you do you mean, she wasn't in Croatia?
Luka and Joe went without her.
What was that all about?
Yeah, where's she been the past few weeks?
Said she had some personal stuff.
Sounds like divorce talk to me.
No, you think? Really?
I knew it all along.
Just a matter of time.
Guys...
Everything okay?
Yeah, it's all good.
You bet.
Ophtho returned your call.
Thanks, Frank.
PRATT: Watch his IV. HALEH: Trauma One's ready.
HALEH: It's flowing.
PRATT: Hang packed cells now!
What happened?
CRENSHAW: Crashed before we could scan him.
What he mean, "crashed"?
HALEH: Rapid infuser's primed.
LOCKHART: Uh, he's bleeding internally.
CRENSHAW: He needs an ex-lap.
He probably opened up his hematoma.
BP's 82/58. We need more access.
Hold on. Maybe it's a pelvic fracture.
You said you didn't see one.
Yeah, but it's a tough call in kids.
And look, the symphysis looks wide.
There's a separation and some SI diastasis.
We don't have time to argue
about a questionable finding.
He could be crashing because he's bleeding in his pelvis.
Liver's the most likely source.
You open his belly
and it's a pelvic fracture, he'll bleed out.
So what, we just screw around till he exsanguinates?
No, just keep looking.
Show me free fluid. You could do your ex-lap.
T-pod him, infuse two units.
We need to take him up now.
All right, just give her two minutes.
You know how this goes if you're wrong?
(alarm beeping) This should tampen out any pelvic bleeders.
The liver hematoma's enlarging. This kid needs the OR.
No, it's not that impressive.
Abby, your two minutes are up.
How much blood has he had?
That's 20 per kilo.
Okay, let's get this show on the road.
(beeping stops) Wait! Hold on!
Pressure's good: 100/60.
Hemoglobin's up to 14.
You see any free fluid in the belly?
I suppose surgery can wait a bit.
What's going on?!
We stopped the bleeding.
Okay, stable. Take him up to CT.
GATES: Hey, what are you doing out here?
What's the deal with my tetanus shot?
No one's come for that yet?
Oh, man, I'm sorry. We're really slammed.
You know what? Why don't you go lay down
on one of the beds? You'll be more comfortable.
She's been mumbling.
I thought she might wake up.
I'm definitely not the first thing that she wants to see.
GATES: Oh, I'm guessing she won't mind.
You saved her life, man.
One night... I found her in the hall,
passed out and drunk.
So I went ahead and I fished the keys out of her purse.
I couldn't just leave her there.
But when I brought her inside,
she woke up and she freaked out.
Yeah. Good times.
I'll go check on your tetanus, all right?
Hang in there.
Hey, man, listen very carefully, all right?
I don't care how backed up you are. Just fix it.
Thank you. I'm glad somebody
finally gave it to Radiology.
No, Frank, I was on the phone with my landlord.
My toilet's been running for weeks now.
Dr. Gates, the daughter of your patient in 2
returned your call.
All right, Psych come down
for her yet? Not that I know of.
All right. Can you check on my tetanus guy, please?
Oh, for sure.
Oh, my God, girl, pinch me, I'm dreaming.
Yes, gentlemen, may I help you?
We're looking for Dr. Pratt.
Yeah, that's me.
You guys must be
here for Jake Gleason. He all right?
I think he's still in surgery, but come on.
I'll take you guys up.
I can do that, Dr. Pratt.
Yeah, thanks, Javier, but I got this.
Come on, fellas.
(scoffs)
We need to do a test called
an "electroretinogram," which tells us
if the cells in the retina respond to light.
If it is this LCA thing, what then?
Well, we'll know what we're dealing with, for one,
and there are some new therapies
that could help.
You just need to sign here for consent.
Okay.
And they can actually take her today if you want.
Um, Dexter's up in surgery.
Shouldn't I be up there?
Okay. How about this?
On the way up, we drop you off at the OR and I go with Kayla
for her test?
You okay with that?
Yeah, she can come with me.
God, where the hell's the rest of my stuff?!
Sally, get back in bed.
Who are you?
I'm Dr. Gates, and you have a very serious fracture.
Whatever. You need surgery.
Shut up! Will you just take this off so I can go home?!
Who stole my other shoe, huh?!
If you don't keep this immobilized,
it's not gonna heal right.
Take if off!
You want to sign out against medical advice?
Damn right. I'm not letting you touch me.
Fine by me.
I'll get the paperwork.
You know what? You walk out that door,
you're gonna lose the use of your hand. You want that?
What?
Just get back in bed, okay, and let us do our job.
Do you even know what happened to you?
No. Do you remember? You got beat up.
And your neighbor Eddie intervened.
You mean the freak?
He should mind his own business.
Oh, yeah? Well, he saved your ass, okay?
And he's got a pretty nasty cut on his head to prove it.
How long's this gonna take, anyway, huh?
Does the posterior technique have a name?
The Kocher approach.
And who was Kocher?
A 19th century Swiss surgeon,
perhaps the most famous in his day.
Published Kocher's Operative Surgery 1892,
Won the Nobel Prize for medicine
in 1909.
She Nobel-prized you, bro.
It's not funny.
Oh, come on. Give it up.
She's money. You're money. Ignore him.
Dude, give her some.
I need some, too.
Oh, no. What?
Wendy can't play next week. Out-of-town baby shower.
(sighs)
What position did you play?
Sorry?
Field hockey? What position?
Center forward.
So we're all squared away with your tetanus.
We'll get you signed out
and you can split, okay?
Did she finally wake up?
Yeah, just a little bit ago.
And her CT was clear, so she's gonna be fine.
She say anything about what happened?
No, but, um, you know, she was...
Dr. Gates.
Not now, Grady, I'm busy.
It's important.
Like urgent important.
I'm sorry. I'll be right back.
Stay.
What?
It's Mrs. Smalls in 2.
Psych not come down yet?
No, that's not really a problem now.
I found her pulseless and apnic. She's got
rigor mortis and lividity.
She must have died, like, an hour ago.
Didn't anyone come and check on her?
They were waiting for Psych.
You doing okay, kiddo?
Yeah.
You know, if it is LCA,
might be worth a write-up.
We could co-author.
That's okay. It's all you.
Doesn't hurt at all.
See? Told you.
All right, now move your forehead right up
to the dome and touch it.
Good. Right there.
It'll just take a minute to calibrate.
Hey, what do you want to be when you grow up?
A doctor and a singer.
Wow, both, huh?
Well, I can't help you with the singing.
I'm really bad.
I'm pretty good.
Why don't you sing me a song?
* I am beautiful
* No matter what they say
* Words can't bring me down
* I am beautiful in every single way *
* Yes, words can't bring me down, oh, no *
* So don't you bring me down today. *
Gates, heard you killed another happy customer today.
That's nice, Frank, great.
Uh, Psych just came down to see her.
Said they'd meet you in Sutures.
Somebody's got a lot of 'splaining to do!
Pratt, can you sign off on our GI bleeder?
Yeah, and I need one for my chemo lady.
All right.
Hey, how are you? I'm good.
Uh, I just wanted to say if you need to talk or anything,
I'm totally here.
I just want to make sure that everything's okay.
It's good. I'm good. Thanks.
JULIA: The bone fragment was removed from the spine.
Surgery was successful.
He's already started moving his legs.
It's all good.
Thank you for everything, Miss Dupree.
My pleasure.
You know what?
I'll make sure the chapel stays open for you guys all night.
Oh, hey, excuse me.
Hi, I'm Dr. Lockhart. I worked on Jake.
That's really good news about him.
Thank you, Doc.
We appreciate everything you people did.
You're very welcome.
Listen, do you by any chance know
how that fire got started?
Mrs. Rosemary Smalls. What happened to her?
We don't know.
All righty, then. Love the easy ones.
Have a good night.
Okay, great. Thanks.
Good news.
Dexter's surgery went very well.
He's in recovery right now.
Thank God.
Emily can take you up there as soon as we're done here.
So, there's no treatment for this LAC thing?
LCA. Leber's congenital amaurosis.
Sorry. This day's just... it's been a lot.
I know.
Well, there may be some gene-replacement therapies
or clinical studies we can enroll her in.
You know, this is manageable.
There is hope.
There's no reason why she can't be
a perfectly happy kid with a full life.
And you can do all those tests right here?
Well, no, there's an organization in Iowa...
Iowa? Yeah, but we'd just have to send them
a tube of her blood, and all the tests are free of charge.
Okay, baby girl, let's go ahead and do this.
Oh, and, um...
I talked to the fireman,
and he told me there was an electrical problem on the second floor
that started the fire
so it had nothing do with your oven.
So... she didn't do it?
You got something to say?
Keisha.
(sighs)
I'm sorry.
But don't call me Stupid anymore, okay?
Don't worry, baby. She won't.
Kayla...
It was really great to meet you.
You take care, okay?
Okay.
How long will I have to stay here, huh?
Surgeons will answer all your questions when you get upstairs.
What, a day, two days, a week...?
GATES: We don't know, Sally.
I got a life, you know?
Could have fooled me.
What did you say?
You...
Excuse me, Dr. Gates, how do I get out of this place?
This place is like a maze.
Just take those doors back there.
Hey, it's you.
Hi.
What, you can't look at me?
Take off your hood.
Oh, thank you...
for what you did.
You're welcome.
Well, see you around.
You can just go out through those doors.
Thank you.
Take care, huh?
Bye, Eddie.
Poor guy.
Yeah, it must be tough.
Hey, Alex is in town.
We're going to go see a movie.
If you and Sarah want to come... Can we go another time?
I have this thing I have to do.
Yeah, anytime.
Okay.
Sure? Mm-hmm.
Go! (shouting encouragement)
Go! Go! Go! Go!
Go! Go! Go!
Go! Go!
What are you doing here?
I came to say good-bye.
What's with the skates?
Oh, long story.
Where are you going?
I'm going to go see Cousin Maya in San Francisco.
My father's apparently coming to Chicago
so I need to skip town for the weekend.
And what do you want me to tell him?
Tell him I've completely disappeared
and you have no idea where I went.
Okay, I'll call him.
But I need you to do me a really big favor.
Rasgotra, practice is Wednesday at 6:00.
Game's Thursday at 7:00.
We'll be at Ike's if you want to join us.
Hey, congratulations.
Night.
Congratulations?
Did you win something?
No, I think I just got recruited.
So what's this big favor?
All right, lastly, starting tomorrow
docs will not be permitted to ask a nurse or clerk
to call a consultant.
It has to be a written order.
More work for Frank. Me, too.
GATES: Why do we have to do that?
What if we're in the middle of a trauma?
Calm down. It's just for a month.
We have to present real data to admin
if we want to eliminate delays.
Unless anyone has anything else to say,
come on, let's get back to work.
Uh, hey, can I have a minute?
With everybody?
Um, I know some of you have been wondering--
and I appreciate the concern.
I wasn't in Croatia
for the last few weeks.
After Luka's father died, they left without me.
And I was in a residential detox facility.
I'm an alcoholic.
S...
I just wanted to set the record straight and tell the truth
because I have way too much respect for all of you
to keep lying
and I'm very, very sorry
because I know
what I did didn't only affect me.
It affected all of you, too.
And I just hope I haven't done any irreparable damage
to any of the relationships here.
But I'm sober now
and I'm going to stay that way.
So you were in rehab the whole time?
Yeah.
Were you ever drunk at work?
Okay, come on, guys. Let's get signed out
get back out on the floor.
We still got a lot of patients out there.
Thanks.
Wow, girl.
Mmm.
GATES: I told her daughter she was fine.
I worked her up. Everything seemed normal.
Did you do everything you were supposed to?
Proper history, labs?
I could have done an EKG,
no, cardiac monitor.
Maybe I missed an MI, arrhythmia.
Well, I'd be worried about you
if you weren't upset about Mrs. Smalls,
but I think it's pretty obvious
what the cause of death was.
She missed her husband
and she wanted to be with him.
You're kidding me, right?
No, I think she was a pretty lucky lady.
Julia, she died.
She had a beautiful daughter.
She had a full life filled with happiness
and she found true love.
Some people live their whole lives and never get that.
I mean, how else do you explain her husband calling her
from the other side?
You really believe that?
Yeah, I do.
That's because I have faith.
Faith?
Yes.
Look, we all end up like Rosemary Smalls.
Who knows when?
Who knows how?
But love, trust,
truth, a higher power,
the things that really matter--
you can't have any of those without faith.
Especially love.
Now we are losing precious pre-dinner drink time,
and I need at least
two martinis to deal with my brother.
So, come on.
Come on, come on.
Some meeting,
huh?
Yeah, some meeting.
Let's admit to Med-Surg for IV antibiotics.
And where are her diverticula most likely to be?
The narrowest portion of the colon
with the highest intrasegmental pressures
is the sigmoid colon.
Excellent work, Harold. All right, you,
you, come here.
All right, so, uh, here's the deal.
Jaspreet's gone and she's not coming back.
Where'd she go?
Well, I could tell you that,
but then I'd have to kill you.
She asked me to relay the following:
"Archie, thank you for a wonderful night.
"It was great, but please stop calling,
and don't ever call again.
Ever." "Harold,
"thank you for a wonderful night.
"It was great, but please stop calling,
and don't ever call again. Ever."
So, there you go.
I'd very much appreciate it
if we never speak of this again.
Ever.
You?
You?
Abby.
Hi.
Hey.
How was your first day back?
Good.
How was Ortho?
Great.
I heard about the staff meeting.
Yeah, that was fun.
It's good you said all that.
Listen, I owe you an apology.
No, you don't.
I-I do.
Because you tried to help me and I just pushed you away,
and you don't deserve that.
I'm still here if you need help, you know.
Thank you.
(sighs)
Gosh.
You had me so worried. I know.
I'm sorry.
It's so great to have you back.
Yep.
Just in time to leave again.
When do you go?
Tomorrow morning.
I can't wait.
I miss Joe and Luka like crazy.
Well, give them my best.
Travel safe.
Thanks.
Okay. All right.
Bye. Bye.
See ya. Bye.
