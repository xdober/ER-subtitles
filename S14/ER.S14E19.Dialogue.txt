Previously on ER:
I'm actually here for a job interview.
Why in Sam Hill would you want to work here?
Finish up. The hard stuff's done. Lucien...
We both know you should never have left that room this morning.
None of this should be news to you. This is the job.
So I heard you made the short list for chief.
I'm in love with you.
Luka moved out.
He what? Why?
Wait a minute. Honey, wait. No, I gotta go.
Abby... What are you doing?!
Don't-Don't. All right. Sorry.
There, you got us. Gates is my boyfriend.
Okay...
When I was four... All right.
I wrote a letter to Ernie
inviting him to take a bath with me.
That's very forward of you.
Did he go for it?
No. He was very busy with Sesame Street.
You do realize that's code
for "I'm living with my boyfriend."
No. Actually, he never even mentioned Bert.
Yeah.
And he wrote me, like, 20 letters.
Really? Kind of led me on.
Turned out that it was my mom.
That's the first nice thing you've said about your mom.
Yeah, well, she had her moment.
Oh, crap.
What?
We missed our stop.
(both laughing)
Oh...
You know we're getting into trouble here.
It's Pratt-- he won't care.
(sighs): Hi, guys.
Hey, I missed you guys.
I missed you.
How was your weekend with Daddy?
Ah, pretty good.
He'd only eat frozen waffles and strawberry yogurt.
It's probably the new environment.
It's okay-- strawberry's almost a vegetable, right?
Hey, how are you, buddy?
Huh?
Do you want a cup of coffee?
Uh, no, no, I'm off caffeine.
Really?
Wow. Good for you.
What happened to his knee?
Uh, he fell, I think. You think?
Yeah, I left him with Marnie for a couple of hours...
It's your first weekend alone with your son
and you left him with a babysitter?
Just for two hours, Abby. Come on.
(knocking on door)
MARNIE: Hello.
Sorry I'm late.
It's okay. We just got here.
Oh...
I have to go.
I have to go to work.
Um, here you go.
I have to take the el.
Oh, car still in the shop?
Yeah, I'm waiting on them to get some kind of electrical...
thing in stock or something.
Do you need a ride?
Yeah, sure, Gates, never heard that one before.
Hey, Archie.
Hey, how'd it go?
Well; very well.
I rocked it.
You rocked it? Rocked what?
His chief interview.
Had Anspaugh eating out of my hand.
How long did it last?
45 minutes.
Really? Mine was longer.
Well, part of it was him showing me the family scrapbook.
Gates called-- he and Sam are gonna be late.
They had "train trouble."
Oh, and we're supposed to give them a free pass
because they're an item?
They're just so adorable?
Is that what they think?
Yeah, they did mention something about that.
I've had it with the giddy new couple thing.
Greg doesn't get all hoo-hooey about Betina at work.
Oh, hey, that reminds me, Frank...
About that guy? About the thing?
That's today, right?
Yeah, I'm on it, boss.
All right.
So, you two still shacking up?
Yes, I'm staying with her.
Can't you see I don't want to hear that right now?
Well, you asked. Well, I shouldn't have.
I'm down on love. You and me both.
What, you, the Internet dating star?
You've only been online for a month
and you're number four in all-time "winks."
Don't waste your time.
Online dating blows.
I'm totally over it. Totally.
Join my monastery, Laverne.
Sign me up.
So you haven't been out with any of them?
MAN: Just let me go, you jerks!
Here's one for you, Neela. You don't want me here.
I'm like a shark-- I gotta keep moving,
or I'm dead, all right?
Look, you're gonna get me killed.
Sir... And her.
And anybody that's around me.
OFFICER: Look, if you don't settle down, You, too.
I'm gonna have to cuff you.
They showed up at my mother's funeral,
don't you understand that? PRATT: Hey, what the hell is this?
Found him staggering down on Halstead.
Come on, guys, what are you doing?
We do not have enough room in here
to dry out every drunk in Chicago.
You think you're safe in here?
Better think again.
NEWKIRK: Whoa, hey, sir. Okay, listen up, everybody.
I'm the last guy you want in your ER.
You can say that again.
Make sure they check the, uh, brake pads.
Right.
Listen, I got you this.
The paper?
It's what you're supposed to get for the first anniversary.
Okay, um, thanks for the ride.
FRANK: Yeah, I appreciate it, Lenny.
Now, what's the guy's number?
Yeah, go ahead.
Who you talking to? Is that our guy?
All right, all right.
Keep up the good work, Frank.
So, what's up with our guy?
You getting him out of here, or what?
There's something weird going on.
Weird how?
They sent his name out on the wire,
and now my lieu says to keep him here till further notice.
Great.
Well, guess I'll go make sure that the king of crime
gets all the resources that County can muster.
(Pratt sighs)
Nice suit.
Where's the funeral?
Strazynski Manor Chapel, on South Pulaski.
My mom.
Oh... Oh, sorry to hear that.
Oh, you know what they say, you can't go home again.
You from out of town?
Rapid City... where God left his shoes.
I run a scrap metal yard for a bunch of hayseed farmers.
I look like Eddie Albert to you?
I really couldn't say.
There's only one place worse than South Dakota--
North Dakota.
I had to go and move my whole family there--
my wife, two kids-- and they hate me for it.
I hate me for it.
So, why did you leave then?
I could tell you that, but then I'd have to kill you.
All systems are go. He'll be by later.
All right, take it easy, will you, huh?
Keep it on the low.
My trap is shut.
Guess we both got a secret, huh?
Get a PCA for our fireman and pull the drain on the empyema.
Must be fun having her at your beck and call.
Is it possible for you to have an interaction
without some kind of annoying innuendo-y quip?
I need a little time to prep for the M and M.
I hate those little teaching things.
Bunch of doctors who like to hear themselves talk.
Yeah, you should check one out some time.
Yeah, you might learn something.
Dolt.
MORRIS: Excuse me.
Any medications?
Prednisone and Plaquenil.
She has lupus.
Has she been using any drugs or alcohol?
We were at a christening.
Abby, you're with us. Trauma One.
TAGGART: He's had half a liter
but he really doesn't want to be here.
Yeah, well, the feeling's mutual. I gotta go, all right?
Listen, do you have a cell phone I could use?
I need a cell phone.
Just shoot me already, all right?
Don't tempt me, man.
Cupcake, can you get this coconut sack,
or whatever you call it, off me.
Banana bag.
And let them arrest me already.
Just get me the hell outta here.
Calm down. It's not that simple.
People want me dead, okay? Dead.
A little Haldol?
Ah, he doesn't need Haldol.
Listen to me.
You look like a regular girl.
I'm sorry. Calm down.
Anything happens to me,
will you tell my wife there's an account in the Bahamas.
Okay.
And will you tell her I'm sorry that I screwed it all up.
CHUNY: Sats only 82.
LOCKHART: Load with a gram of Dilantin.
CHUNY: I'll go mix it.
If we can't stop this soon,
we might have to put a breathing tube in.
What do you mean if you can't stop this?
You guys need help in here?
No, we're good. MORRIS: Not really.
Lupus, huh? Hi, I'm Simon Brenner.
Maybe it'd be better if we transferred her
to another hospital.
I have money. I can pay.
Don't worry, they're more competent than they seem.
See? The meds are kicking in.
Thank God. Head CT,
metabolic panel, tox screen, EEG and neuro consult.
Don't you think that's a bit excessive?
No. The seizure goes along with lupus.
First-time seizure still warrants a workup.
Okay, don't want to put your mum
through all that now, do you?
Do what you want.
I don't want you to miss anything.
Hey, I just saw Moretti at the desk.
Moretti? Mm-hmm.
What's he doing here?
CHUNY: I don't know. Visiting, I guess.
Dr. Moretti, our old nemesis.
Dr. Gates. Hello.
Hello, Sam.
Couldn't stay away, huh?
No, no. Had to tie up a few loose ends.
How's your son doing?
Oh, uh, he's in a group home.
He's doing okay.
TAGGART: That's good to hear. Thanks.
Can we help you?
I'm looking for Art Masterson.
You his parole officer?
Brother-in-law.
He's over there. Hope you brought a lawyer.
GATES: Hey, Kevin, does that mean you're coming back?
MORETTI: Uh, no.
His mother and I have decided to stay close to him, so...
TAGGART: Yeah, I can definitely understand that.
MORETTI: Don't look so relieved, Gates.
Excuse me.
GATES: Hey, no one misses you like I do, Kev.
MORETTI: Yeah, I'm sure that's the case.
(low grunting)
Hey!
Hey! Get off him!
What the hell are you doing?! Son of a bitch!
Get off him! You're dead!
Get the hell off him!
Get off!
(gagging)
Hey!
(gagging)
You should never have come back, Arnie!
FRANK: Get him outta here!
MAN: You should've stayed where they put you!
All right.
(coughing and gasping)
(sighs)
You okay?
Do you believe me now, smart guy?
We'll be back to check on you a little later, Mr. Masterson.
When you're rested. You can call me Arnie.
I thought you said your name was Art.
All right, man, look alive now.
What was that?
Well, the guy's got enemies it's not hard to see that.
I know, I know,
I'll keep somebody on him at all times.
Hey, that's a great idea.
Why does it seem like
someone's always getting punched in this place?
I gave as good as I got.
I would expect nothing less.
They find a new chief yet?
Soon enough.
You...?
Why, is that so crazy?
I'm just pleased they finally recognized your talent, Greg.
Congratulations. Thanks.
Appreciate it. Okay.
Frank, is Dr. Lockhart on today?
She's in with a patient.
Okay, thanks.
Your electrolytes look good
and the drug test came back negative.
Yeah, Mom gave up the crack years ago.
Shh, Christine. Let them do their job.
MORRIS: Cat scan was normal,
no bleed, no abscess.
That's a good sign, right? Very.
CHUNY: Systolic won't go up over 80.
LOCKHART: And she's got crackles at the bases.
I think we should get an echo.
I should have had more children, Deep breath.
so that be such a bother to you.
Shh. You're not a burden.
My daughter takes care of me
all day, then works at night
in a doctor's office.
Just physical therapy,
sports injuries and stuff.
Skip the echo, get a spiral CT.
Really?
Yeah, lupus patients are susceptible to PE.
What?
LOCKHART: It's just that CHF
is much more likely. Why don't we just get the echo
and rule it out-- Abby, get the CT.
Let me pull rank on you while I still can.
Yes, sir.
What's wrong?
I tried to block my mother's fall
when the seizure started.
I must have tweaked something.
Why don't I take a look?
Chuny?
We removed the infected graft and proceeded with the wash-out.
Did you redose
the antibiotics before opening the abdomen?
No, she was already on triples.
Well, still, it's standard practice
to add a dose halfway through a case.
Did you and your attending
make a conscious decision not to do this?
Donald, I-I don't see how your question is relevant,
given that the acinetobacter
did not originate... It is relevant
because it is a teaching point
that applies to abdominal surgeries
in general, and this is
a teaching conference.
Carry on, Dr. Rasgotra.
PRATT: Excuse me.
OFFICER: And you got no idea why this guy was trying to off you?
MASTERSON: I want to make a phone call.
I get one phone call, don't I?
You're not under arrest. Well, then arrest me.
I'm not talking to you.
And I want to make a damn phone call!
All right, why don't you just back off for a little while.
Let him calm down.
(gasping): I don't feel so good.
My chest is tight.
I think I'm having one of my anxiety things.
Yeah, I can't imagine why.
Look, there's a reason I left Chicago.
Let me guess: people were trying to kill you.
Look, you saved my life.
I can trust you, right?
No, I'd rather you didn't.
Oh, son of a bitch.
Art?
I hear you got yourself in a little trouble.
Rick. Who the hell are you?
I'm sorry, Rick. The cops let you in?
Rick, it was my mother. You got to understand.
Buff him up, we'll get him out of your hair.
I'm sorry, it's not that easy.
I'm not going back there, Rick. I can take care of myself.
Oh, is that what you've been doing these past few days?
Sir, you really need to step outside.
Geez...
What's happening? I'm dyin'.
(alarms sounding) You're agitating him.
He's right. You are.
Damn it!
(Masterson groaning)
What do we got? He's in v-tach.
Charging to 360.
Here's the order for the spiral CT. Okay.
Um, could you tell Cards we might want an echo, too.
Yeah. Thanks.
Okay.
Hi.
Hi.
Can we talk for a minute? Let's not.
Look, Abby, I've been trying to call you.
I know, but it's-- this is just not really-- not a good time,
because I'm totally slammed.
Well, then why are you walking out?
Because I don't want to do this.
Can I talk to you for five minutes? No.
Look, my marriage is over, okay?
Can you just leave me alone?
Five minutes.
Abby, I didn't know about you and Luka.
I'm sorry. Me, too.
Look, I just wanted to talk to you
just for a sec, about the way that I left.
It doesn't matter.
Well...
Look, my kid was really sick.
Okay?
And-And I lost my footing for awhile.
I, yes, I know how that feels.
Trust me. Yeah.
He was in a... a psych ward for eight weeks.
Told me he wanted to die.
Well, I'm very sorry to hear that.
I am sorry. But... Thanks.
Anyway, in the middle of it, his mother and I, you know,
we started talking-- really talking-- and by the time
he got out of the hospital, we were a family again.
Well, that's great for you. It's really, really great.
Look, all I'm trying to say is that every couple
goes through some awful and messed-up stuff.
Kevin, are you're feeling guilty or responsible?
Because you... 'cause you're not.
You don't have to.
I just wanted to tell you I'm sorry...
You don't have to be sorry. All you did was help me
ruin my life a little bit faster, that's it.
I have to go back to work.
(man speaking Hebrew)
"Man is like a breath.
His days are as a fleeting shadow."
(speaking Hebrew)
"In the morning he flourishes and grows up like grass.
In the evening, he is cut down and withers."
(speaking Hebrew)
(door creaking)
Walter?
Walter?
Walter!
What? What is it?
Is the...is the kitchen on fire again?
Wha...
What?
What's the matter with you?
Why are you you looking at me like that?
I'm not dead yet, you lanky bastard.
(laughs)
Pancakes.
I feel like pancakes.
From the good place,
not that greasy spoon hole in the wall.
I don't think I can take you out today.
Then go get me some.
And-And one scrambled egg.
Maybe on my break, I will.
Someone's coming to see me, you know.
No, I didn't.
My nephew. My brother's son.
Lives in Philadelphia--
a second-rate town if ever there was one.
People say it's not a bad city.
People lie.
He's a good kid.
He got a sweet wife,
and, uh, two little girls.
Kids are great.
Yeah.
My wife and I never had any.
I regret that.
Sometimes I think if we had, maybe...
she might have hung around longer.
How's that?
Well, being a parent,
gives a strength you didn't know you had.
Places in yourself.
Reserves.
And they can keep you going, they can, they can, uh,
drive you, make you fight harder,
soldier on.
Uh, keep rowing upriver.
Even though everything else turns to crud.
At least, I've heard that's so.
TAGGART: Epi's in. PRATT: All right, clear!
Back in sinus.
Oh. Look at the ST segments.
Damn. All right, let's get aspirin, O2,
five of lopressor and a 12 lead.
What the hell?
We think you're having a heart attack.
Holy crap! Is he okay?
I'm having a friggin' heart attack, Rick!
Maybe you can back off, huh?
Do you realize how complicated this is getting?
I'm sorry, I didn't plan on having a heart attack today!
You gotta settle down, okay?
Sir, you need to leave the patient care area.
What a mess. What happens now?
I'm not talking to you about this case. Privacy issues.
Listen... Just wait outside.
I'll talk to you in a minute.
BP's good, 105/76.
All right, good.
Call the cath lab, tell them we're on the way.
All right, thanks, guys.
We'll get this from here.
What-What are you doing?
What-What's going on here?
I-I can't tell you that.
It's privacy issues.
Who the hell are you?
Let's not waste any more time talking, all right?
Just do the cath thing so we can get him outta here.
All right, let me tell you something.
You're in my ER, and that's my patient,
you do not get to dictate how this goes.
Actually, I do.
U.S. Marshals Service.
And every minute my guy sits in this hospital
is putting him and everyone else here in jeopardy.
TAGGART: So, the king of crime is up in the cath lab?
Yeah.
Hey, so nobody gets in without double-checking I.D., right?
When in doubt, keep 'em out.
Anything else I should know?
No, not right now.
Just keep your eyes open.
These are all yours.
Curtain Three and Exam Four?
Actually, the other way around.
Oh.
You good?
Yeah. You? Yeah.
I'm fine.
All right, see you later.
So, how are things on the home front?
Well, Sarah's well, thanks for asking.
I was talking about Sam.
Oh, that.
Well, you know, we're just having fun right now.
Both kind of busy.
Unclaimed baggage and whatnot, you know.
So, you're worried if things don't work out,
it'll turn into a big mess.
Something like that. I'm here to tell you,
Tony, you're right, it will.
Come on now. What?
What, a hothead Casanova like him
and a feisty little spitfire like Sam?
You think they have a snowball's chance in hell?
Hey, Morris, your shoulder lady's ready in sutures.
Thank you.
Love is hard, boys, be hard on love.
Seriously, I've been where you are.
It can work out; it does work out.
Just take the plunge.
Hey, Pratt. Yeah?
Did you ever hear of Arnie Markowitz?
No, why?
What kind of people can make cops just disappear like that?
I'll tell you who: the Feds.
That got me thinking. Yeah, you see,
now that was your first mistake. No.
I wasn't on the force all that time for nothing.
Read this.
Arnie Markowitz-- busted in '05
for working with the Turkish Deep State.
Whatever that is. Here.
That is the Mob.
This guy made a deal,
he testified against the Turks, then he disappeared,
probably into Witsec.
Witsec? What's Witsec?
Witsec is the witness security program.
Next page.
So what are you saying, that my patient Art
Masterson is really this guy Arnie Markowitz?
Don't say that out loud.
They are everywhere.
Mom's been sick a long time.
We've got the whole setup at home.
Any tenderness here?
No, it's fine.
I could never live at home.
I mean, my dad's dead now,
but I got out of there as fast as I could.
Mmm.
I lived alone for awhile,
but I was never any good at it.
"Good at it"? Yeah.
It got boring. I'm not much of a dater.
You know, I'm not into playing the game.
Oh, I hear that.
Plus my work makes it difficult
to have a normal social life.
Me, too. I guess that's what we get
for pursuing careers in medicine, huh?
I'm an escort.
Um...
Could-could I, could I, uh, could you...
raise your arm up in the air?
Now try to resist my pressure.
I thought you said... Yeah. I was...
I was trying to finish college
when Mom got sick.
No insurance.
She needed money,
but she also wanted me home
with her during the day, and... (groans)
Somebody told me about an agency
where I could work five to ten hours a week--
nights-- and, uh,
make $10,000 to $15,000.
You'd be amazed
how much men are willing to pay for the illusion
of a submissive Asian concubine.
It just sounded really easy.
DAWN: Dr. Morris?
It's Mrs. Barcenilla. We lost her pulse.
Oh, my God.
Page Abby 911.
You might want to wait outside. No way.
Her sats suddenly dropped into the 60s,
and she went into P.E.A.
Oh, my God.
Mig of epi, mac three and seven-oh.
Mom, please don't do this!
MORRIS: Get ready to intubate.
Sorry, we can't let anybody by.
Hey, you want to get him out of here, right?
Then you better let me in there.
It's okay.
Cromley cleared him.
Well, Arnie, there are no tele beds,
so we're shipping you back to the ER.
I can't go back, can't move forward.
I messed up, man.
I did some things I got in trouble for.
Yeah, you know, I'm starting to get that idea.
I wasn't much of a lawyer,
but I knew how to make things work.
My firm had some clients that needed special help--
Money laundering, visas, imports,
that type of thing.
Mm-hmm.
Well, when I got snagged, the Feds came to me and said,
"Do the right thing, and we'll protect you,
protect your family," so...
You did the right thing.
Did I?
End up trapped between two worlds,
like ET or something.
Can't be honest with anybody.
Got to hide who you are,
who you were.
I had to teach
my own kid his new name, drill it into him.
I kept thinking,
this is the price of being good--
teaching your kid to lie.
He'll understand one day.
Well, he's 12.
He sure doesn't understand now.
Hey!
Yeah?
Who are you?
I'm Anthony.
I'm restocking the cart.
Where's your I.D.?
I'm new.
So?
They gave me a temp.
Yeah, I must have left it in my locker.
What the hell you think you're doing, man?
ANTHONY: Hey, relax, man.
No, you relax. Where's the I.D.?
I just started last week!
Then how the hell did you get in here?
Dr. Pratt, he's one of our new techs-- take it easy!
Welcome to my life.
I debrided the area and attempted a primary closure.
Attempted?
Executed. I executed a primary repair.
KRANE: Did you consider resection?
RASGOTRA: Yes, but I thought the best possible,
um, option was primary closure.
KRANE: And Dr. Dubenko was in agreement?
DUBENKO: Oh, come on! Once again,
I remind you that this patient died
of pan-resistant bacterial sepsis, which had
nothing to do with Neela's repair.
CRENSHAW: No, a concomitant infection with bowel flora
could have overwhelmed her immune system.
What are you talking about? Show me the data.
CRENSHAW: Her post-op course could have been influenced by...
You know what? Reign yourself in, Dusty.
It's getting embarrassing. Excuse me?
Yeah, you're the junior attending.
She's the only person that you can dump on.
CRENSHAW: I'm not dumping.
ANSPAUGH: Sit down, Lucien. You're out of line.
No, I won't sit down, and I'm not out of line.
I'm not out of line at all.
That's a joke. You want to know
what's out of line?
I'll tell you what's out of line.
A system so pathetically underfunded
that we have a single trauma attending
to cover the entire hospital
at night-- that's out of line.
Letting a patient bleed out in the ICU because of
a stupid rule-- that's out of line.
And you want to know what else? Want to know what else?
Sitting by and watching
my resident try and hide the fact
that I left her alone in the O.R.
That's out of line.
It's all out of line.
Radiology read the scan.
Massive embolus in the left main pulmonary.
That's what you thought, right?
Right. Well, fix it. Can't you fix it?
She's acidotic, seven point oh-two.
Hold compressions.
Asystole.
CHUNY: Another epi?
She's on round six.
Resume.
We're running out of options here.
No. Don't say that.
We've given multiple rounds of drugs to restart her heart,
but her body has been deprived of oxygen for too long.
There's always another option.
That's what you said.
Christine?
Do you want to say good-bye?
Mom, I...
I can't.
Everybody out.
Right now. Please go.
(flatline tone sounding)
(sobbing)
(crying)
(crying)
Hi. Dr. Kovac, I heard you were working here,
and I wondered if I might be able to talk to you...
Oh, you really have the balls to show up here,
and ask for anything.
Look, I've had a very difficult time in my life--
Really? Me, too.
I know that, and I'm sorry
for any part that I've played in it.
But I just wanted to tell you that,
you know, whatever happened with me and Abby was...
just the misguided, messed-up flailings
of two people; two very troubled people.
That's beautiful.
Look, she loves you.
Anybody can see that.
And as somebody
who has squandered that kind of thing before in his own life,
I want to implore you not to make the same mistake.
So, that's...
You done?
Yes, I think... Yeah, I think so.
Guess I had that coming, huh?
Thanks for stopping by.
Now, how fast can he be ready to go?
Well, he's not stable. He had an MI.
I'm not going anywhere.
Art, you did this to yourself.
I'm trying to fix it.
Whatever I do, I'm dead.
Dead on the street, or dead on the inside.
What's the damn difference?
I don't want any of my other people in here, all right?
Got enough people in harm's way.
I'll be right back.
Hey, sorry to pull you out.
No, that's all good. You all right?
You need something? No, no, no, everything is good.
Uh, I just wanted to let you know,
we're having a family dinner,
and it would be great if you came.
Okay, yeah. What's the occasion?
What's this?
(laughs)
You got in!
Yeah! No way!
Congratulations, man.
That's good stuff.
Ooh! Thank you! That's good!
A couple months from now,
I'll be a first-year med student.
Wow. It's all thanks to you, Greg.
No, man. No, no, no, no, no, that's real.
Dad really wants you to come, and I'm bringing my guy.
I want you to meet him.
Oh, yeah? What's Charlie got to say about that?
He's mellowing out in his old age,
wanting all the kids around him.
All right, well, I'll come by as soon as I'm done here.
Thank you.
Good stuff, baby.
Great job.
See you in a minute. All right.
Now, we've never lost a protected witness
who followed protocol,
and we're not ending our streak with you.
I'm done with testifying.
Okay... then, Art,
you know, I leave now, and you're out forever.
You ready for that? On your own?
Well, you ready to do that to your family?
'Cause you're not in this alone, you know.
They're in it with you.
All right, look, Arnie, this is the deal, man.
I'm gonna make sure that you get fixed up,
but staying here isn't helping you,
and, in fact...
you're putting other people in danger, man-- my people.
Look, you did the right thing once.
Just do it again.
(sighs)
(knocks)
WALTER: Hey!
You... You've got my food?
What's going on?
What, this? It's SOP for leaving.
Wh-What did you do, step on it?
It's all smashed up.
Whoa. What do you mean, leaving? Oh.
Hospice policy.
There's a six-month limit.
My nephew's taking me to Philly.
They're kicking you out because you didn't die soon enough?
It's pretty discouraging, isn't it?
Why didn't you say something?
I didn't want to depress you.
You're depressive enough as it is.
I don't want to see you bawl.
(quiet laugh)
I'm-I'm s-sorry
I never got to meet your family.
Next time, I...
guess.
Yeah, next time.
Hey... he's taking me fishing.
He says if I row us out, he'll row us in.
(laughs)
Hey.
Walter.
Don't worry, kid.
You'll figure it out.
I got faith in you.
All right, come on. Let's hurry up with this thing.
Absolutely, absolutely.
Now, when it comes to an investment like this,
you have to be concerned about the four "Cs."
You got your carats,
your color, your clarity
and your cut.
Now, do you want white gold or do you platinum?
I don't know. Platinum-- it's the only way to go.
It-it's the gold standard.
Now, I brought this especially
with you in mind.
It's a three-stone
platinum setting with a two-carat
princess cut in the center.
Top of the line, a real sweetie.
Here, take a look at that.
Yeah, let me look at that. Oh, boy.
Uh, it's a little on the pricey side,
but for you, there will be a discount.
Because I understand that you're a member of the tribe.
What?
I told him you were part Semite.
Oh. Who called in the bling man?
Pratt. Oh, here we go.
What? Frank!
Oh, Betina's a lucky girl.
Look, everybody just calm down, all right? I'm only browsing.
(Pratt sings happily)
Hey, Abby!
It's a beautiful spring day,
the Cubs are playing at Wrigley Field
and we live in America.
I think I solved the case of the missing lexapro.
Sorry, I was looking for some undepressed person
that I could be happy around and, uh...
You chose me?
Must be slim pickings.
What's the good news?
Eh, you know, things are just falling into place.
Well, that's great. You deserve that.
Yeah, you sound thrilled.
I am.
Really.
So what's up with Luka?
I don't know, it's been a month.
Eh, he'll come around. I know him.
And I know you, too.
Hope you're right.
Just come find me later.
I'll buy you a coffee.
Ah, there he is, my old mentor.
How you been, man?
What you been up to? Oh, just keeping busy.
It's like an Egyptian market out here.
Chickens, guys are selling diamonds at the desk...
Diamonds, really?
Wow, that's weird.
(heavy sigh)
Well, keep it real.
She's in there.
CROMLEY: It's not a request.
It's not optional. Unhook him.
Not without doctor's orders. Somebody call me?
Keeping him here isn't helping anybody.
All right, Sam, give us a minute, okay?
All right, so what's the plan?
Well, we've got a facility secured
where he can get medical care until we regroup.
And I'm gonna have a tech come over
and expunge the medical record from your system.
All right.
Hey, Arnie.
How we doing?
Ready to roll.
Good. So, you got everything you need in the rig?
You don't really care what happens to him?
PRATT: Sam.
I got this.
My job is to keep him alive.
That's what I promised
when he came into the program.
I guess now, my only
concern is him coding on the way.
Well, we got a paramedic with us.
Well, why don't you let me ride along just in case.
No.
Look, if anything, I'll go.
Greg, I have transport training.
Yeah, well, I'm his doctor.
We need you on the floor.
No, Morris can cover.
Aw, are you two fighting over me?
Look, neither one of you are coming, okay?
I've got room enough in the rig for one real
paramedic team and two of my guys, that's it.
And as soon as we roll out
the door, this never happened.
This patient was never here. Get it?
This is crazy.
Don't.
You're the one person who might actually talk me out of it.
So you're going to walk away after one bad outcome?
Now, Neela, it's a million little things.
It isn't like you to give up.
What am I giving up? What am I giving up?
A dumpy O.R.?
Overnight call? Below-market pay?
Lucien, you can't abandon me in the middle of my training.
You're not my responsibility.
This is not what you want.
Don't pretend to know what I want.
Hi.
Hey.
Are you all right?
What do you care?
Well, that was a pretty tough, little teaching thing.
Oh, you're worried about me?
Well, you can hold your own, but yeah.
See, I'm not a heartless beast.
I never said "beast."
You know what?
I'm not trying to win a popularity contest here,
but that doesn't mean I enjoy being treated
like I've crashed someone's party.
You're the product of flagrant nepotism
and you're a tosser.
Nobody really wants you here.
Wow!
Uh, don't sugarcoat it, babe.
Don't call me "babe."
You know what your problem is?
No, but you'd be the first person
I'd go to if I really wanted to hear it.
You need to get a life.
You need to get out, which is my polite way
of saying you need to get laid.
Oh, is that right?
Yeah, I'm pretty certain of it.
KOVAC: I was thinking about that night.
That first night that we kissed
up in the ambulance bay.
You mean the night I totally geeked out
and kissed you out of nowhere?
I remember feeling
you were someone who was so full of hope.
I needed someone to teach me that again.
I think that part was mutual.
Did we lose that?
Did we turn into some other people?
I hope not.
I realized today
I have this idea of us.
Of you and me and Joe,
as something static, you know, concrete.
But it's not.
It's more like we're out there on the lake,
on... on choppy water.
Like, uh...
In a rowboat.
Yeah, in a rowboat,
trying to get across.
But when you told me what happened,
I felt like something died.
I was mourning. I couldn't see
that what we have is always changing.
It's moving.
So, for better or for worse,
as long as we keep rowing,
we're gonna be okay.
So let's just get past it.
You know? Let's just go someplace new,
somewhere nobody knows us.
You know, I know we have good friends here in Chicago.
I know you've got this great job you've always...
Do you know that I love you more than I could ever explain?
Let's get out of here.
Nice bumper sticker, Bardelli.
Isn't that against regs? It's not my rig.
Mechanic said something's wrong with my alternator.
So what if you lose his pulse, huh? What if he goes
into v-tach? I'm good now.
You done enough, Doc.
More than that, actually.
CROMLEY: You my guy?
BARDELLI: Yep. Let's roll.
If he goes south en route, it's gonna come back on us.
Look, we're on your side, Cromley.
Let us do our job.
Okay, then, we got room
for one more-- who's it gonna be?
