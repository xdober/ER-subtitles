Previously on ER:
Pupils are equal and reactive.
What year is it, hon? Oh-seven.
Good. Let's go to Trauma One.
Quick and concise-- how is she?
Hypotensive, anemic with abdominal pain,
extensive crush injuries. Neela...
You've been great.
I think your day might have been
a whole lot better if you never met me.
Oh, not so sure about that.
Hope I see you around. Yeah.
You can check yourself in the ICU.
What?
There are lots of good lessons for a guy like you up there.
Trust me, I should know. You're kidding, right?
No, I'm not kidding you.
Luka's not the chief anymore.
Moretti's the man now.
Well, someone should talk to Anspaugh.
All right, good luck, Mr. Stoll.
(sighs)
Hey, Dr. Anspaugh.
You know, you're one busy guy.
I've been calling your office all week
trying to schedule an appointment.
Oh, I'm sure my assistant can fit you in as soon as possible.
But do you have a few minutes right now?
Because I really need to talk to you.
I need to get to a hospital council meeting,
and if there is a God, I can beat this cross-town traffic.
All right, it's about Dr. Moretti.
He's all wrong for the ER.
He doesn't understand how it works.
Kevin is a brilliant and dedicated physician,
board certified in emergency medicine.
Yeah, the guy is smart, I'll give him that,
but he's in way over his head, and...
And what?
I think you should replace him
with someone who knows how to do the job-- me.
(chuckles): Well, I admire your chutzpah.
Well, you can call it what you want, but I'm serious.
Look, change is always hard.
I'm sure he's going to settle in.
Dr. Anspaugh, I can do this.
Ask me in another year or two.
(sighs)
WOMAN (on TV): And next, go from trash to treasure...
Hi. Hey.
...when we learn how to make lamps out of egg cartons.
Won't that be fun? Brought you some magazines.
MAN: Sounds egg-cellent, Tina.
And your favorite, Gummi worms. Thank you.
(TV audio continues)
And, um, and Brad Pitt, he's outside.
He's over Angelina and the whole adoption thing
and he wants you. (shuts off TV)
Are you okay?
(sighs)
I think I'm addicted to Mornings With Phil and Tina.
Oh, well, hang in there, you'll be home tomorrow.
Correction-- today. My staples came out
and my creatinine's down to point nine.
Worm? No thank you.
Who sent these flowers?
The ER nurses.
I think they went a little bit over board. No.
Everyone's just happy you're doing so well.
Yeah. Any luck with Joe's passport?
Oh, it's so crazy.
I mean, there's all these new travel rules,
so even with an expedited passport,
it takes, like, four weeks.
What time you getting out of here?
Oh, they're not sure.
Lucien wants me to stay home for a week
before I go back to work.
Mm, lucky you.
Yeah, but what am I going to do sitting at home?
Um, relax, recuperate,
try and kick your Phil and Tina addiction.
(pager beeping)
Okay. I'm late. See you later.
Okay, bye.
TINA: Now pull the light cord through the base of your egg...
And that means no more boarding admitted patients
in the ER hallways.
If there aren't enough beds,
they can wait in the hallways upstairs.
MAN: Oh, Lord, it's me,
your servant, Bernie.
I'm dying Lord. I'm dying.
Do the nurses upstairs know about this?
Sam, your hair is brown. (moaning)
And from now on, I want all patients
to have full physical examinations.
BERNIE: Take me, Lord!
It's my time.
PRATT: You're kidding me, right?
No. Clothes off.
No more of these half-assed exams.
I've made my peace, Lord. And we need to have more consistent
treatment protocols in line I'm ready to join you.
with evidence-based guidelines. Here I come!
Should we go help that guy?
Mr. Zucker?
Comes in here every week with a hangover, claims he dying. (moaning)
Yeah, once he offered to put me in his will
if I gave him a sponge bath.
These are standard order sets
for acute coronary syndrome, stroke,
sepsis, alcohol withdrawal and procedural sedation.
I expect you all to make use of them.
I'm coming home, Lord, I'm coming home.
Get to work.
So now we're doing cookbook medicine?
Why don't they just hire trained monkeys to work the ER?
Hey, Morris, do you have any known relatives in Bulgaria?
What?
Frank's new hobby is genealogy.
He discovered I'm a descendent of Spanish royalty.
Then I found this "Archibald Morrisnov" in Plovdiv.
No, I don't think we're related.
But, uh, check Venezuela.
I may have a cousin who runs a kidnapping ring.
(moaning) Crime is just the desperate cry of the poor, Archie.
Gates, I thought we got rid of you.
I think I left
my otoscope down here. Yeah, I was about
to auction it on eBay.
Oh, stop pretending. You know you miss me, Frank.
Hey, Abby, you see Neela today?
Yeah, I was just there. She's going home.
Oh, that's great. Yeah, so...
this is your last chance to visit her.
I already visited her a bunch of times.
When she was unconscious, yeah. Today I'm been busy
and I'm starting my first shift in ICU...
Tony, go see her.
I... It's a little...
Yeah, weird. I know.
Stuff happened, but you just gotta get over it.
You know what? This is Sarah. I gotta take this.
Hey, Sarah, what's up?
Here I go, here I go.
MORETTI: Dr. Lockhart.
(moaning)
So nice of you to take time
out of your busy schedule to join us.
Yeah, I was visiting a friend of mine...
Fascinating.
I'm instituting a new system and need a volunteer-- you.
Today you'll be working your shift in the Waiting Area.
Lord, it's me again, Bernie. You mean triage?
No, Waiting. Here I come!
It's a chance to intervene at the earliest stage. I'm letting go.
Yeah, do you really think that this is the best use...
This is it, Lord. Open your eyes, Abby.
This is the end. Take a fresh look.
Just say the word!
Excuse me.
Bernie,
this is God.
Hurry it up already.
(indistinct conversations)
(woman coughing)
Yeah, uh, your toe is infected, ma'am.
And we're gonna have to remove the nail.
Is there anything you're allergic to?
I don't like cheese.
Okay.
Uh, someone will be here shortly
to take you back and then we'll see about some shoes.
Oh, I like Jimmy Choos. Right.
Hey, how much longer
do I have to wait around this place?
Sir, you have to sit down.
Don't you know who I am? Sit down.
(people coughing, groaning)
Carlos Vega. WOMAN: Yes.
Hi, I'm Dr. Lockhart.
What seems to be the problem?
Well, he threw up all night,
and we thought it might have been something he ate,
but he's getting worse.
Maybe... you can give me something...
for my stomach...
and then we can go.
Yeah, I think you have a fever.
It's probably not food poisoning.
Oh, no.
He played with our baby
all day yesterday. Honey, Tyler's fine.
Doctor, I gotta get to work.
How long do we have to wait?
Um...
You know, why don't we just take you back right now?
Okay? Oh, thank you.
You all right?
All right, let's do this.
You know, I was thinking about
going down to Baton Rouge and visit Ray.
Yeah, we'll go together.
Three of us could, uh, catch a Saints game.
Sounds good. We should do that.
(chuckles)
Seaweed scalp mist.
(laughing)
Ray was a little hair obsessed, but I gotta say,
the man's lid always looked good.
(laughs)
Oh, boy.
Are these a, these a size nine?
Don't even go there, Morris.
What's he gonna do with them?
I mean...
Sir, back away from the shoes, all right?
GRADY: Guys, is that locker available?
What?
I haven't been assigned one yet.
Stop.
No one's using this locker. It's retired.
(chuckles): You can't retire an ER locker.
Can you?
You can use one of those lockers over there.
Yeah, this one's off limits.
Hey, so what can we bring to dinner tonight at Chez Pratt?
Ah, it's really not necessary,
but maybe some red wine.
Vino, it is.
Hey, thanks again for the invite.
Well, it was Betina's idea to do this double date thing.
She really likes you, man.
Hey, Pratt. Mazel Tov.
You having a stroke, Frank?
Did you know that your great-great-great-grandmother
on your mother's side was an Ethiopian Jew?
Wow, Black and Jewish.
You're like County's own Sammy Davis Jr.
Get out of here.
* Who can take a rainbow *
* Wrap it in the sky? * Archie...
* The Pratt-man can.
Come on, Sam, you said you wanted to get out there again.
Oh, I don't know.
You and your fabulous new hair
needs to come out with us tonight.
Where you gals going?
Speed dating at Ike's.
What the heck is speed dating?
It's a way for losers to meet other losers-- fast.
No, you get six minutes,
you sit at a table and you talk to a bunch of guys.
And how the heck are you
supposed to get know somebody like that?
Chemistry. Seems more like desperation.
So, Sam, are you in or not?
Oh, it sounds like fun, but I'm...
Maybe she doesn't want to
because she has her eye on someone else.
What? Who?
Officer Litchman.
Oh, he is cute.
I thought I noticed a spark between you two.
Yeah? I mean, no. I mean, yes, I think he's cute.
But I would never date a cop.
PRATT: Frank, you got it wrong, man.
My grandfather was Steven with a "V."
MVC, second victim behind me.
16-year-old unrestrained driver ejected from vehicle.
What's your name? Joanna... where's Joanna.
Casey Barnes.
Blunt head trauma, awake but altered.
Hang on, Casey. CBC, chem panel,
type and cross four units.
25-year-old, restrained passenger.
No LOC, vitals stable.
How's Casey? Is he all right?
Let's worry about you first.
All right, CBC, type and screen, UA.
Airway's patent, spontaneous resps.
Damn it, IV blew.
Regular rhythm, carotid pulses thready.
Casey, look at me.
Do you know where you are?
(slurring speech) Whoa, whoa, easy.
Sam, he's tachy--
get that bolus up.
I'm trying, but I can't get a flash,
his pressure's too low. We need access, Sam.
I'll go central. Cordis and sterile 7s please.
Hope, when a trauma rolls in
you're supposed to jump on.
Sorry, thought you could handle it.
I'm handling it fine.
Need to help Joa...
Agitation could be sign of ICH.
I'll call for a head CT.
Pupils equal but sluggish.
Sorry about earlier.
I just can't stop thinking about the mosquito thing.
Oh, right, mosquitoes love redheads.
We'll talk about it later tonight, okay?
Can somebody hand me the introducer?
I'm sterile.
Not sterile enough.
No drape, no gown, no mask.
Do you know, in the ICU we prophylactically remove
all ER lines 'cause your rate of infection is so high?
It's my fault. Kid was crashing,
and I asked her to jump in. That's not true,
I just... Spare me. Just do it right.
(Casey slurring speech)
All right, pupils equal and reactive.
Guarding a little.
How's she doing?
Airway's good, GCS 15.
I am Dr. Moretti. How you feeling?
I've been better.
She's tachy, you got a pressure?
126 over 76.
Please, is Casey okay?
Doctors are working on him. Oh, God.
All right, her pelvis is stable,
we got superficial abrasions to the right thigh.
This whole thing is my fault.
I should've never let him drive. Is he your brother?
No, my student. I teach math at Edgewater.
I was, uh... tutoring him before school.
In the car?
He just got his license, begged me to go driving.
Chest film's back. Okay.
My son was in the National Math Olympiad in high school.
Now he's squandering his talents
as a comp lit major at Brown.
Go figure. What do you see?
Is that a little pneumo? Yep.
Let's put her on high flow
oh-two and set up for a chest tube.
GRADY: Sweet. Whoa, whoa. Overkill.
She's got a 20% pneumothorax on the left.
What does that mean? Is that bad?
It means part of your lung has collapsed
and we need to reinflate it.
Okay, Dr. Dr. Pratt. Your patient.
All right. Lido and ten-blade to me.
Okay, why don't you take off your shirt?
No, that's okay.
I need to examine your abdomen.
Do you really need to make a big deal about this?
My boss is a real pain.
He won't like that I'm late.
Well, it won't take long.
And my boss is a real pain, and he won't like it
if I don't do a thorough exam.
What's that?
Oh, he got hurt at work.
It's nothing. I was stupid.
Elena helped me clean it out.
Hold still. I need to check it out.
No, you don't...
(crying out in pain)
How did this happen again?
Funny. This doesn't look like the waiting area.
So, sir, how did you manage to get yourself shot?
It was a drive-by, and I got hit.
When did this happen?
Three nights ago.
Why didn't he go to the hospital?
Well, he doesn't like doctors.
That's all right.
I don't take that personally.
It's not what it looks like.
Right. I'll be right back.
Start with a plain film, find out where the bullet is?
Yeah, and notify the police.
Morning, Neela.
Morning. What happened to you?
Field hockey. Your LFTs look good.
You should be able to go home in an hour or two.
That's what they said four hours ago.
CRENSHAW: Any trouble voiding?
No. My Foley is out.
Are you still passing gas?
Would you stop, Dusty?
I think she's been through enough already.
No going home until Neela makes poo-poo.
You know, my post-op ileus has resolved.
(pager beeps) That's the ER. Let's go, Dusty.
It's good to see you up and around.
Okay. 13-year-old.
Pneumonia, dysphagia, normal CT.
Chang, what crucial historical detail
did Dr. Udesky omit?
Weight loss? Night sweats?
No, no, I'm talking about the one thing
we must know to narrow down this vast differential here.
MRI results?
Come on, guys, you're breaking my heart.
Excuse me. Duration of symptoms.
Sudden onset-- we're thinking stroke, infection, trauma.
Slow onset-- we're thinking tumor, metabolic... yes? Excuse me.
Dr. Shuster, I'm Dr. Gates, Moretti sent me up here.
Yet you still you show up 20 minutes late.
I was doing a follow-up on a patient.
This is the critical care unit, people are dying.
I don't have time to potty train ER rejects.
Get me an MRI, call neuro.
I want a diagnosis before lunch.
Looks like the boss lady ripped you a new one.
Oh, you're too young to know what flirting looks like.
See what's taking so long in CT.
You don't even speak Spanish. I'll learn.
Sat's down to 82.
Okay, get him on a non-rebreather
and Hope, get ready to tube him.
This is the kid's mom. (Casey moans)
Baby, it's mom.
Honey, I'm right here.
Right here.
Your son's been in a car crash.
He's lost a lot of blood. Run a ten.
Casey, come on, throw me the bag.
Ma'am, I'm Dr. Morris. We're gonna put a tube
in to breathe for him.
I don't understand. What happened?
He was driving, he hit a guardrail.
He was ejected about 20 feet.
Driving? Casey doesn't have a car.
He came in with her.
Do you know that woman?
Yeah. Darn, bulb's out.
I need a new scope, Mac 2.
Casey, honey, wake up, wake up.
Talk to me. I'll get it.
HOPE: He's in V tach, lost the pulse.
Charge the paddles,
starting compressions.
Is Casey okay?
He's pretty sick.
MORETTI: How are we doing?
She's got a hemothorax.
Good thing we put in a chest tube.
It was the right call.
Systolic's only 85.
All right, Dawn, let CT know
that we're coming for a chest and abdomen.
I wouldn't do that. Why not?
She's pregnant.
What?
Right there, that's a fetal heartbeat.
Didn't you order an ICON?
Yeah, he did. The lab's backed up.
I'm pregnant?
Looks like you weren't the only one in the dark.
Small caliber bullet in the T-12 vertebral body.
He's febrile, probably infected.
He needs the OR for debridement.
Abby, the detectives are here.
You called the police?
We're obligated to report gun shot wounds.
Get a CT, make sure there's nothing
in the spinal canal or abdomen. Right.
Mr. Vega,
we heard you were a victim of a drive-by.
Yeah. Can you tell us when and where?
Three nights ago on my block, I was walking home.
That would be 3027 Pierce?
Right. We don't have a report of that.
There was a shooting at a deli
on Leavitt three nights ago.
Owner was shot, but not before he returned fire.
Carlos had nothing to do with that.
Elena, why don't you call your mom.
Have her take Tyler home.
It's all right. Three Latino suspects got away,
but witnesses say one of them was wounded.
It wasn't me.
Ask the store owner. He's in a coma.
As long as your bullet isn't a match
for his gun, you don't have a problem.
Gross hematuria.
All right, we're taking her to the scanner right now.
Is that okay? She's in the first trimester.
No, too much radiation.
Please don't hurt my baby.
Joanna, we need to focus on you now, okay?
Please, someone go see how Casey's doing.
I need to know. I'll check.
What, what? You can't do a CT, she'll never consent.
She's in shock. She's not competent.
Let's follow with a formal ultrasound.
We'll get a good look at the kidneys
with a fraction of the radiation.
We cannot do the formal ultrasound that fast.
Why, you're a resourceful guy.
You expect a radiologist
to be at my beck and call Q-15 minutes?
Yeah, I do.
They don't have enough machines or techs available...
DAWN: Hey, guys, they need help in here.
What's wrong with Casey?
Make it happen, Dr. Pratt.
Charged to 360. Clear!
Still no pulse, v fib.
Resume CPR. SAM: Epi's in.
How many rounds of meds has he got?
It's the fifth. Yes. Amiodarone?
No.
You're coding a patient in here
and nobody bothered to come and get me?
I'm on top of it.
Really?
You're blasting the myocardium with drugs
and you're hoping for a miracle.
Please, you've got to save him.
Sam, give the amio.
Did you hear what I just said?
He's a kid. I am aware of that.
Mom, come here.
We've been trying to restart his heart
for over a half hour now.
You have to keep going.
His injuries are too severe.
He's lost too much blood.
No.
No, this isn't happening.
I'm going to stop CPR now, which means...
No!
Oh, no, no, no!
Please don't stop.
He's just a boy.
He's my baby.
(sobbing)
(crying)
Casey...
(sobbing continues)
So where's your mom?
She's at work.
She'll be here later.
Dr. Schuster was obnoxious,
no question, but...
you could've been a little more contrite.
You know, played the game.
Oh, believe me, I'm trying.
How about an eight? Does an eight work here?
No, and I'm not talking about Sudoku.
The game, life.
Playing well with others.
You seem to have a problem with that.
How about a six? Would a six work here?
Your evasiveness tells me I'm on to something.
(chuckles)
Did your dad hit you when you were a kid? What?
Parental abuse.
It's a common root
of authority and ego problems in adulthood.
Thank you, Dr. Freud.
I'm more of a Jungian.
You have no idea what I'm talking about.
I never watched Star Trek.
And, um, you're starting to freaking me out, kid.
Yeah, I have that affect on people.
I'm in college now at U of C
and I raise my hand to ask a question,
the whole class stares.
That must be weird, huh?
Yeah, I kind of stick out at frat parties.
Yeah, well... I'm, uh, having trouble
these days trying to figure out where I fit in.
And, uh... you were right about me and my dad.
If you want to impress those stuck up ICU types, three words.
Fazio-Londe disease.
It's very rare.
Who knows how long it'll take them to figure it out.
Is that what you think you have?
Not think.
Know.
Well, when you were admitted,
why didn't your mother tell them?
She doesn't know.
I haven't told her.
No, that's not good enough, I need an ultrasound now,
not in 45 minutes.
Pratt, your alter cocker in Three
is kvetching about his kishka. What?
It's the language of your people.
Hey, Abby, you want to get in on a detached retina?
I have to go back to Waiting.
Mussolini was not happy to see me out of my cage.
Doctor, can I talk to you? Sure.
Um, Carlos doesn't want to have the operation.
Why not?
Well, um, he was at the deli that night.
Oh, I don't need to hear this. Please, doctor.
I don't want to hear it. He was just there to buy milk.
Please, please, you have to listen.
Please.
Okay.
That night in the deli,
two guys came in and they started making trouble
and they pulled out guns.
Carlos told you this.
He tried to stop them, okay,
but they just started shooting
and he ran so fast he didn't even realize
he was hurt until he got home.
Yeah, but why didn't you call the police
when you saw he was shot?
Well, Carlos wanted to,
but I didn't let him. Why?
The guys who did this, they are from our neighborhood, okay?
They know who we are, they know where we live.
Well, that bullet is lodged in his spine
and surgery really is the only... He won't do it.
Small fluid in Morrison's,
but no hematoma, renal anatomy's intact.
What do you make of the fact that she's still peeing blood?
Probably just parenchymal contusions.
If the urine doesn't clear in an hour,
we'll do an IVP like Dr. Moretti suggested.
She's good.
Be back in 15 minutes to repeat the scan.
Dr. Pratt, I knew you'd find a way.
He was 16! A child!
Hey, hey, hey! Don't do this.
I have your e-mails, the photos.
You're going to jail!
Ma'am, I know this is hard,
but you just can't...
She molested my son!
You've got to leave.
This is your fault. He's dead because of you.
What?!
You saw the blood.
He was rushing me here.
That's why we crashed. Oh, God. Oh, no.
You're gonna have to stop hating me.
I am having his baby.
Okay. Come on.
What?
You have to leave. I'm sorry.
If they take out the bullet, the cops will place me at the scene.
Well, just tell them what really happened.
They won't believe me-- all they see
is another spic from the hood.
Hopefully, the store owner
will come out of his coma and he can back up your story.
And if he doesn't,
then Carlos will go to jail.
I got a good job and Elena, the baby.
I don't want to lose them.
Okay, look, just get a lawyer...
The legal system doesn't work for guys like me.
Do you understand that you could be paralyzed?
I'll take my chances.
I talked to Carlos for over an hour
and now they want to speak to the surgeon in charge.
And he still won't consent to the debridement?
He's convinced he's screwed if they find the bullet.
He understands the risks?
Well, then it's his right to refuse. Detectives.
The DA just got off the phone with a judge
who's issuing an emergency court order
compelling Carlos Vega to have surgery.
What? It'll be here within the hour.
The state can't dictate treatment of a patient.
Well, it just did.
The bullet will tell us if he's guilty or not.
Well, it doesn't matter if he's guilty or not.
This patient has rights, and we're not going to do it.
Well, it's not up to you. Really?
Well, what's next? Forced sterilizations?
Mandated amputations? I mean, this is...
Abby, Abby, Abby. Maybe it's for the best.
Carlos needs the surgery,
and these guys are only trying to do their job.
We'll get an OR ready.
Thanks, doc.
You're kidding me, right? I don't like it, but it's done.
Yeah, he has the right to refuse.
You just said so two minutes ago! You know what?
If we leave the bullet in,
he ends up in a wheelchair anyway.
Not definitely, and not immediately.
We can start him on IV antibiotics
and then talk to Legal, alert the media.
High-minded, Abby, very high-minded, but naive.
If we refuse to perform the surgery,
they'll get some other hospital to do.
You don't know that.
Yes, yes, as a matter of fact I do.
And since a tricky spinal procedure is inevitable,
I'd rather I do it than someone else who's not as good.
Oh, really? How did this become about you?
Let it go, Abby, let it go.
I can't believe you're not even going to try to...
You know what, as Head of Surgery,
I'm telling you, this case is no longer your concern.
Type and cross four units and send him up.
It's called Fazio-Londe syndrome.
That's incredibly rare.
Yeah, only 30-something cases in the literature.
It's a progressive motor disorder.
The aspiration pneumonia is from decreased function
of the ninth and tenth cranial nerves.
I did an EMG, MRI. It all fits.
You need to confirm this with a muscle biopsy.
Well, Neuro's on it this afternoon.
Way to be proactive, Dr. Gates.
We round again at 3:00.
All right.
So it worked.
Yeah, it worked.
What I want to know is-- how did you figure this out?
At first, it felt like a lump in my throat.
Then it got to where solid food made me throw up.
You didn't go to a doctor?
I convinced a grad student in Neurophysiology
to do a muscle biopsy
on the D.L.
Confirmed what I already knew.
But your mom... You-You didn't tell your mother?
Well, what's the use in telling her
before she absolutely has to know?
Because she's your mother.
She-She-She wants to help you.
She wants to take care of you.
This news is pretty much going to ruin her life.
She'll spend everything she has
trying to keep me alive, which is silly,
'cause this disease is invariably fatal.
Well, there must be some sort of experimental treatments, right?
Trials?
(quietly): No.
Well, know, you-you... you have to tell her.
You have to tell her.
You know that, right?
Would you like me to be there?
It's okay.
I'll tell her tonight.
(overlapping crowd chatter)
Okay, what happened here?
Killer bit me.
What kind of dog is Killer?
He's not a dog. He's a gerbil.
Wow, that's a good name for him.
Uh, let's just clean him up and give him some antibiotics.
And, ma'am, what brings you here today?
I'm here for the air.
County air is very therapeutic.
Okay, so, um, you didn't want to see a doctor or anything?
You're just here to...
Breathe. Right.
Knock yourself out.
Uh, Chuny, the guy in the sunglasses has been
in the same position for, like, all day.
Another drunk sleeping it off.
Hey, sir?
Sir?
Sir?!
Oh, please don't be dead. Sir?
Hey! Oh!
I need a gurney over here, now!
So the drunk with the sunglasses isn't drunk.
He's bleeding into his head.
Yeah, we know that, thank you.
Systolic's 182.
All right, bolus 50 of mannitol,
20 per kilo, Dilantin. Tube.
It's a classic example of availability bias.
I have no idea what that means,
but I'm sure you're about to tell us.
Yeah. The waiting area is full
of drunk, sleeping, homeless people,
so that's what Chuny saw when she looked at him.
I feel bad enough, all right?
All right, I'm in.
Toss me the bag, call Respiratory for a vent.
MORETTI: Nice pick-up, anyway. Stabilize him
and get back into the waiting room.
Clearly, we need you out there.
Call CT, let 'em know we're on our way
and get Neurosurge down here.
There-There's no ozone in the tropics.
Our-Our skin will melt off.
Okay, enough.
You don't want to go.
I'll go without you.
Wait. Without me?
It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, Archie.
But I'll worry, and-and I'll miss you,
and I want us to be together.
It's only for six months.
Hope, w...
Morris!
Did you know your gal Hope there
descends from a tribe of gypsy whores?
Wow, Frank.
You obviously don't have enough work to do around here.
Has anyone seen Sam?
Yeah. She's still in with the MVC mom.
We're going to Ike's early
to premedicate before speed dating.
Wow. That sounds good. I could use a drink.
Hey, I'll bring some extra Manischewitz tonight.
Yeah, we know how your tribe loves the fruit of the vine.
All right, will you knock it off already?
You guys can be a real pain in the tuchis?
Hey. Any news yet?
No.
It's been over two hours.
Well, Carlos is going to be all right.
They shouldn't have forced him to have an operation.
I mean, it isn't right.
Yeah.
I know you tried to fight this.
Thank you.
Hey. The surgery went well.
Oh, thank God.
Yeah, he has full function of his lower extremities.
Well, that's good.
I can take you to him if you'd like.
Yes, please. Abby, come walk with us.
ELENA: Did you get the bullet out?
DUBENKO: You know, the strangest thing happened.
I removed the bullet, uh, placed it on a mayo stand.
Then there was a bleeder, things got a little hectic,
stand got knocked over,
and the bullet somehow went missing.
Went missing?
Yeah, the cop's been looking for it for over an hour.
I don't know-- it just sort of vanished.
Oh.
Well, can I go in?
Yeah, absolutely.
Thank you.
Vanished?
Yeah. Weird, right?
Your kidneys look good,
and the blood is clearing from your urine.
So, I don't need surgery?
Doesn't look that way.
And the baby's going to be okay?
No CT, no radiation.
Everything should be fine.
Thank you, doctors. So much.
We'll get you upstairs as soon as the bed's ready.
Hey, uh, Dr. Moretti?
Kevin.
All right, um, I just wanted to say
that the ultrasound was a good idea,
and it's a good thing that we did it, so, you know...
You're welcome. All right.
Maybe next time you'll think twice
before selling me out to Anspaugh
and trying to steal my job.
Wait. I wasn't trying to steal... Don't lie.
It belittles us both.
(sighs)
Um, we're going to get an ETA on your bed.
You think I'm some kind of terrible person, don't you?
(sighs)
He was a kid, you were his teacher.
I'm only nine years older.
A few years from now, no one would care.
But now they do.
(teary): I just can't believe he's gone.
Ma'am...
you need some help.
His mom showed up at my house this morning.
Told me to stay away from her son.
You can't really blame her.
Things got heated, we had a fight.
I hit my head, and she ran off.
That's when I called
Casey.
If only she had left us alone.
(sighs)
We were going through a rough time.
He'd shut himself off,
stayed in his room...
But things were getting better.
He was starting to talk to me again.
(quietly exhales)
I just don't understand why it's taking so long.
I thought my case for custody was as strong as...
Because that's what you said.
Well, that's not good enough.
(sighs): I'm sorry.
I know you filed the papers,
you're doing all you can.
I gotta go. Thanks.
You didn't have to do that.
Oh, yes, I did. Hi, Dr. Gates.
I know.
Joshua's been raving about you.
I'm Serena, his mom.
He's a great kid.
Yep. A handful.
He made me go to the library
to pick up some books he'd put on hold.
So, has he talked to you about what's going on?
Yeah.
It sounds pretty straightforward.
Straightforward?
I don't mean to sound cavalier about pneumonia,
but he's so much better today than he was yesterday.
I'm really relieved.
Excuse me, I have to fill out some
insurance thing for the clerk.
Okay. Nice to meet you.
Mm, and, uh,
don't let my kid run the place.
He's got that kind of personality.
All right, I'll try to keep him in check.
You didn't tell her.
I started to, but... couldn't.
Joshua...
she has to know.
So when she comes back later,
you and I will tell her together, okay?
I can't see the look on her face
when she realizes I'm gonna die.
You do it?
You know what, you guys?
I'm not really sure I'm in the mood for this tonight.
You're just nervous.
No, it's not that.
Come on, Sam, shake it off.
This is gonna be fun.
Come on.
Oh, I knew this.
Just let me say that we are the hottest girls up in this place.
Wow, a lot of people signed up for this.
It's a numbers game, Sam.
And I like the odds.
DAWN: Wouldn't it be great if tonight we all met our soul mates?
Three cosmos, please.
I would just be happy to meet a nice guy
and go on a nice date.
We're happy you came with us tonight.
It's about time.
I know, I know, I got to get out there.
Life is too damn short.
Yes, it is.
Yeah, I will drink to that.
Toast.
To falling in love.
To sex without batteries.
(all laugh)
(horn blares)
Oh, come on, come on, come on.
That's it.
I'm gonna go get me some.
I was thinking
maybe you should stay at our place,
till you get better.
Oh, no, I can't do that.
Well, at least while Luka's out of town.
I don't want to impose.
Ooh, hey, hold that elevator.
Going down.
And I wouldn't want you to think
you had to wait on me hand and foot.
Believe me, that'll never happen.
Come on.
It'll be fun-- you, me and Joe.
You know, you already have a lot on your plate.
Neela, your taxi's out front.
Take care of yourself. Thanks, Frank.
Yeah, but it's so quiet with Luka away.
And besides, I could use some free baby-sitting.
I guess Joe needs to get to know his Auntie Neela.
Yeah. But isn't Luka coming home soon?
I hope so, but I don't know.
His trip is taking longer than we thought.
Oh, it's got to be hard for him
without you and Joe. Yeah.
I mean, he misses us,
but you know, on some level,
I think he's really happy in Croatia, you know?
He's comfortable there.
I can hear it in his voice.
What do you think?
Thank you. I'd love to stay.
Okay, great. Okay.
Uh, Joe's nanny will let you in,
and there's leftover Thai food in the fridge
and I'll be home in a little while.
All right, brilliant. I'll see you then. Okay.
Bye. Bye.
That waiting room looks like a ghost town in there.
It's a great job today.
Thank you.
And it was such a pleasure.
Oh, I'm so glad you enjoyed it
because you'll be doing it again tomorrow.
Good night, Abby.
Dr. Lockhart,
got a minute?
It's an all-day bridge tournament.
You'll be bored out of your mind.
Teach me to play.
I already have a partner.
Yeah, but who's better looking?
I'd say a toss up.
He is 78, very distinguished
and he knows what a shallot is.
What do you call that thing? (doorbell chimes)
It's an onion. (laughs)
Aren't they the same?
No.
Morris!
Hey, look, now, now I can "challa"
at you all through dinner.
Get it? Challa? Ha, ha.
Hi.
Where's, uh, Hope?
Oh, uh, she's not coming.
She's, she's sick.
Oh, that's too bad.
(sighs)
Sick of me.
What?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Maybe I, maybe I should go.
I don't want to burden you with this.
Oh, no, no, no, don't be silly. Stay. Okay.
But I completely lost my appetite, though.
I built a time machine in my garage.
(horn blares)
I really plan on sticking with women this time.
(horn blares)
What's the oldest guy you've ever balled?
(horn blares)
I hear you'd never date a cop.
How did...
I am going to kill Chuny and Dawn.
(chuckling): I like the new look.
Thanks.
Um...
So what's your beef?
We're Chicago's finest.
Uh, just in my line of work I see you guys get hurt.
Shot and killed.
So you'd worry about me?
Yeah, I guess I would.
And I'd worry about you, too.
Really?
I see the people that come into County.
Drunks, the drug seekers.
It's a pretty dangerous place.
On second thought, maybe I shouldn't date a nurse.
(laughs)
(horn blares)
You like Italian food?
I love it.
I know this great place over on State.
My buddy owns it.
Hey, you're holding everybody up.
Time to go.
Yes, it is.
(horn blares)
I think it's great that she wants to go do
a medical mission in Caracas.
I-I-I really do.
But, but, I have a job, okay?
I-I have a life here.
You have any more of this cake left?
She'll be back before you know it.
I just can't help but think that this trip
is just an elaborate excuse to break up.
Have you ever considered the possibility
that it's not about you?
I mean, the long distance thing
never ends well, does it?
Morris, you're not listening.
This isn't about your relationship.
It's about Hope and doing something
that's important to her.
I mean, you gotta respect that. I do.
I do, but living in a tent city
without running water
or a toilet is not my idea of fun.
All right, I get it, it's not your thing.
That's okay. I know, but...
Look, just, just give her some breathing room.
Hope is smart and independent
and that's the reason why you like her
in the first place, right?
But what if she meets somebody else,
some hunky humanitarian type?
You're just gonna have to trust her.
Hey, Lucien, hey.
Um...
The police found a large sum of money and a gun
in Carlos and Elena's apartment.
Well, a lot of people have guns.
Yeah, $1,830.
The exact amount stolen from the mini-mart.
You think after years of doing this
you start to get a handle on people.
The reality is, everybody lies
and manipulates to get what they want.
I believed them, too.
Everybody.
It's sad.
Okay, I'll call the police,
let them know somebody found their bullet.
Hey, Lucien...
It was lodged into a crevice in the anesthesia cart.
Strangest thing.
Night, Abby.
Good night.
He looks like a little boy when he sleeps.
He's a cool kid.
The antibiotics seem to be working.
You think he'll be coming home soon?
(sighs)
Serena, there's something I need to tell you.
What?
Joshua has a...
a neuromuscular disease.
What?
It affects the nerves in the brain
which allow him to breathe and swallow...
