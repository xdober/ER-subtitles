Previously on ER:
Until further notice, the acting chief of the ER will be
Dr. Wexler. What?
You'll get your shot. Really?
How long do I have to wait?
You seen Skye? I need to take a leave of absence.
I figured she's the one to talk to.
Someday, you're going to meet the right girl,
you're going to fall in love, and your first time
is going to be special.
Ethan McInerney, and you are?
Sam Taggart.
I'm feeling real invisible around here.
Be proactive.
Show Anspaugh and the administration
you can make their lives easier.
So we've got Bulls games to go to,
and deep dish pizza to eat at Arnie's.
Hey, they've got some cool band playing at Climax Lounge, too.
How about the hospital lounge?
I have to go to work today.
Oh, well, I can come with you.
And we can hit the streets after that.
Listen, Jaspreet, that sounds fun,
but I don't party when I'm working.
What about last night?
Last night was an exception.
Yeah. Well, there's going to be plenty of those
because, while I'm here, we're going to be partying.
And how long is that anyway?
Just until my parents give up on the idea
of me marrying Chemmel Narayan.
Who's that?
Some creepy doctor that my dad
actually wants me to procreate with.
Honestly, he's got a bigger muffin top than Humpty Dumpty,
and every time I even think about shagging him,
I get throw-up in my mouth.
Your dad wants you to have an arranged marriage?
I thought he was cool.
He's a bloody wanker!
He tries to act like the family man,
but the truth is he has
some chick half his age living in Notting Hill.
Jaspreet, your parents don't know you're here, do they?
I'm sure American Express will tell them.
Hey, come on, everybody! Keep it going!
We're almost there. Keep it going.
Come on, Sam. You're doing good.
Come on.
I was at mile five.
This is a little too much.
You got to run on your toes.
You're landing on the side of your feet.
Are you seeing stars yet?
No. I'm seeing a bench.
A bench with a pillow!
Great job, everybody. Same drill tomorrow,
5:00 a.m. Next week, we add the bicycle.
No. No on the bicycle.
This is triathlon training, Sam.
Bike, swim, run.
How about shower, drink, nap?
That's more my speed.
Sam, you okay?
I need a gurney.
All right. I'll tell them to send one out for you.
And some O2!
Don't hold back.
Tell them everything you ever implemented--
document compliance, medication reconciliation.
Think I should mention when I went to Africa?
Of course. And make sure you tell them how good you are in bed, too.
I should have worn that other suit.
This one's fine.
These pants wrinkly?
All right, I'm wigging out.
I don't know why I'm wigging out.
You are going to rock this. I know it.
Hey Pratt, can you give me a hand?
Nope. I got a meeting with Anspaugh.
Get Skye.
This is Beth Ackerman, 22.
Fell down the escalator at Bloomingdale's.
It was 50% off suede boots.
I'm Dr. Gates. You in any pain?
Yeah. My ankle's killing me.
Deformity and point tenderness
over the distal tib fib.
She said her stomach hurts, too.
We'll take a look at that.
She took a pretty good fall.
I didn't break that glass vase for my mom, did I?
Sam, you're running a little late here.
I'll be ready in a minute.
You okay? Oh, she's fine.
Yeah? You're fine, right?
Shut up.
And the truth is, I'm not some Ivy League import.
I trained here as a med student and a resident,
and I know that ER better than any other candidate.
I've been nominated for a med school teaching award.
I'm efficient, and I understand the need
to balance teaching with productivity.
And I'm the fastest attending on the floor,
and I have the records to prove it.
What else would you want in a chief?
Experience.
Come on. You've hired experience,
and all you got out of it was a mental breakdown,
and another guy who didn't last three months.
I love your chutzpah.
I've told you this,
but I don't see it.
You don't see what?
Some people are leaders, Dr. Pratt.
Some people aren't.
Dr. Anspaugh, with all due respect, I've been here...
I've talked with your supervisors.
Yes, Kovac told you to go to Africa, and you did it.
Kovac also told you what to change in the ER.
You did that, too.
But, without prompting, what have you done here?
In order for me to overlook all
these other candidates, I would have to see
that you are an undeniable choice,
and I'm not convinced.
Then maybe I shouldn't be here at all.
Dr. Pratt. No. I've been busting
my butt. Now, if you don't see that,
why should I waste my time here?
So you're going to give up if you don't get this?
No. I'm going to go somewhere I'm respected,
and my efforts aren't in vain.
Consider this my two weeks' notice.
I think you're overreacting.
They're so hung up on sticking to the status quo.
Why spend another day here?
This is your family.
No. My Aunt Ellen's family.
This is business.
Look, Morris, I love you guys,
I really do, but this isn't right.
What happened?
Your people getting oppressed again?
Shut up, Frank.
They didn't say you'll never get it.
They just said not now.
You not still thinking
Anspaugh's going to make you chief?
If I leave now, and jam at another hospital,
he'll change his mind.
And then what? You'll come back?
Hell, no. Fight the power!
Shut up, Frank.
Dr. Pratt, can you jump on this? Yeah.
Eight-year-old, head lac. Seems altered.
And you are?
Teacher's aide. He fell in gym class.
Did he pass out?
I wasn't there.
They just told me to bring him in.
Hey, little man, I'm Dr. Pratt.
What's your name?
My head hurts. We're going to get you
checked out. Exam three. Come on.
What labs do you want?
CBC for a baseline.
We were leaving the store when she fell.
She wanted me to take her home,
but she was in too much pain.
Where do you live?
In Harvey. Jack got us
a weekend special at the Marriott.
We saw Jersey Boys last night,
capped it off with a couple of martinis.
Six, to be exact.
Sounds like fun. Special occasion?
Beth, can you take a deep breath for me?
She got back from a tour in Iraq two weeks ago.
How long were you there?
13 months. Going back in six weeks.
You military, too?
Marines. After 9/11, I wanted to go to Iraq,
but they sent me to Guam.
What's happening in Guam?
Not enough.
Any allergies?
Walnuts. That's about it.
Okay, a little stick here.
You're looking better than the last time I saw you.
I was a little winded.
Winded? You were sucking air like a dry guppy.
Ooh!
She has some tenderness in the left lower quadrant.
Follow serial exams, and make sure Trauma takes a look.
Okay.
I need you to go to Admit
and fill out some paperwork for registration.
No problem. Honey, I'll be right back, okay?
I'm not going anywhere.
The ICON's positive.
What does that mean?
You're pregnant.
One, two, supermodel!
Oh, that's fabulous!
Neela's, like, my hero.
She moved to America,
and she took it by the balls and worked it.
Oh, she does have a way.
I mean, the rest of our family,
they have a stick up their bottoms,
but Neela said bollocks to tradition, and she moved to the States.
She's, like, our very own Mick Jagger.
Oh, I don't know.
I think of her as more of a backup singer.
You know, like a Pip--
I being Gladys, she being a Pip.
Hi. Sorry.
Radiology wanted me to stay
in CT with our diverticulitis guy.
Uh-huh.
We don't handhold here, Harold.
Next time, let Radiology do their own job.
Harold, uh, I'd like you to meet my cousin Jaspreet.
Hi...
I'm, uh...
Harold. You're Harold.
Right, Harold.
Hey, some people call me Jazz.
I love jazz.
Uh, Miles Davis, Dizzy Gillespie.
Gillespie.
Green Mill's the place for that here.
Oh, well, we should go sometime.
Really?
(wheezing): So, you and...
(wheezing): and me...
(wheezing)
What's wrong with this guy?
He's having an asthma attack.
Somebody get this kid an inhaler!
You're gonna feel a little bit of a sting here.
Ow!
This is the numbing shot for your stitches.
It hurts.
It'll get easier after this.
Where do you think you'll go?
Call Northwestern.
They wanted me once.
Maybe they'll want me again.
Feel that?
Feel what?
Good.
I'll start stitching you up now, okay?
How many will I get?
About five.
Can you make it six?
I want to have one more than my friend Lucas.
All right, I'll see what I can do.
CT's backed up.
They said to call back in a half hour.
This place needs a second scanner.
Carlos, you remember how this happened?
I don't know.
I was playing kickball and fell.
Were you feeling sick today?
No.
Are you taking any medicine?
Epzicom, didanosine and Kaletra.
Those medicines are for HIV.
How long has your asthma been acting up anyway?
I think it happened because of my psychosexual stress.
Psychosexual what?
It's rare. They don't teach it in med school.
So, she's single? She ran away from an arranged marriage.
Sweet. Harold.
She's not for you. She's a sex-crazed maniac.
Okay, come on, enough with the babying.
Neela and I have a rectal abscess,
an infected picc line,
and a woman versus escalator calling our names.
Let's go. Can I do the I and D?
No. No. Sure.
Neela and I are gonna cover the ER today.
I got a lot of consults piling up and just
want to keep the team lean and mean. Well, what should I do?
You can deflate your little balloon
and then take Bollywood out there for a tour.
(sighs)
Okay, this is the uterus,
and there's the baby.
Are you sure?
Mm-hmm, look, there's the heartbeat right there.
Hey,
I called your sister and told her everything's gonna be okay.
What's up? What are they doing?
An ultrasound.
Why? What's going on?
I'm pregnant.
You're what?
Oh, my God!
We're pregnant!
Yeah, okay.
Adorable baby, I can tell already. Oh.
What, are these the... are these the arms right there?
Yeah, there's the fingers, and toes are starting to form
so it's about
eight weeks old.
Eight weeks? Mm-hmm.
At least.
The OB will do a formal ultrasound,
give you a more accurate estimate.
Trauma's here.
Is the escalator fall Beth Ackerman?
Hello, I'm Dr. Rasgotra from Surgery.
Does anything hurt?
DEJESUS: Sounds like he wants you to be
more proactive with your own ideas.
Yeah, well, I'll take my ideas to another hospital,
thank you very much.
You know, I never liked Anspaugh.
If you need help looking, I can make some calls.
You know, if I can't find a job fast enough,
I might need a sugar mama to take care of me.
Maybe we can work something out.
I can cook and clean.
I'll take that into consideration.
Hey, Dawn, did Carlos Moore's mom get here yet?
I left a message.
Her phone keeps going to voice mail.
Try it again.
She needs to know her kid is here. Just because
a boy steps to me doesn't mean I'm gonna tell him my status.
That is not right.
What would you do, Sydney?
You got to be upfront. Tell him what's up.
Because he asked for your number?
This is about being honest.
Well, damn, if that's the case,
I'll be telling people all day that I'm HIV-positive.
(chuckling)
You know, the truth is, you're both right.
It is important to be honest.
But every guy you meet doesn't need to know your status.
However, men you plan to be intimate with
do need to know.
Even if he just wants to kiss you?
Jeanie, it's Carlos.
What? They just called.
He's at County.
Ladies, I need to cut this short.
Miss Boulet, is there anything we can do?
No, thanks, sweetie.
I left Sydney's prescription on my desk.
No problem, I got it.
We got a 52-year-old diabetic
with a non-healing ulcer on the foot.
What's his glucose?
89. Last insulin was two hours ago. Excuse me.
Is triage still in here?
Yeah, check in at the desk.
Excuse me, my kid was brought in about an hour ago.
You have to sign in. His name's Carlos Moore. He fell during gym.
I just need to know what room he's in.
Have a seat. I'll be with you in a few minutes.
This guy needs a foot series and a CBC.
Please just look it up for me.
Hey.
Hey, get back...!
Put him in sutures.
What room is Carlos Moore in?
Carlos Moore...
Uh, ma'am, you need to sign in.
Jeanie? Hey, Chuny.
What are you doing here?
It's Carlos. He fell during gym.
You know her? Yeah, she used to work here.
How are you? I'm good. I'm good.
Will you help me find him? Yeah.
Exam 3. He's Dr. Pratt's case.
Come on, I'll show you.
The ER has changed a bit.
How have you been? I've been good.
You look the same.
Oh, you look great, too.
Hey, there you are.
Hey.
You okay?
Were you spacing out during kickball again?
I guess, it's so boring.
Yeah, I know.
Doesn't look too bad.
Jeanie Boulet.
She's Carlos' mom.
She was a PA on staff.
Oh, good, I'm Dr. Pratt.
We're about to take him up to get a head CT right now.
Really, he needs a CT? Blunt head trauma,
possible loss of consciousness. Possible?
Doesn't the school know?
Well, the aide wasn't sure.
And I want to play it safe and get the scan anyway.
Is Dr. Weaver here?
I know her.
No, she doesn't work here anymore.
Carlos is a bit more complicated than other kids.
Yeah, I know, he told me about the HIV.
No offense, but I'd feel better
with the most senior person taking care of him.
He hit his head.
And I have a lot of experience managing head trauma.
I'm not trying to be disrespectful,
but would it be possible for me to speak to your attending?
Ma'am, I am the attending.
Hemoglobin's stable at 15.2.
I'm not getting anything here.
Beth, your fractured bones
are blocking the blood flow to your foot.
I'm gonna need to try and realign them now, okay?
Whatever.
I just don't get it.
Jack, we'll talk about this
when it's over.
Propofol is kicking in.
Good sats. All right, let's stabilize posteriorly.
Okay, ready?
On three.
One...
two...
three. Whoa!
Whoa, what's going on, Dr. Rasgotra?
Displaced tib fib.
You may be my favorite trauma surgeon,
but I don't recall you having any orthopedic training. Well, no.
Typically, the ER waits for the ortho team
before reducing unstable fractures.
She had no choice.
We lost the dorsalis pulse.
And now it's back.
Really?
Wow, you must have some set of hands, girl.
All right, call us when you got post-reduction film.
Let's go. We got a femur in 2. I would really
prefer an MRI.
A CT will give us the information we need.
Maybe, but it involves radiation.
He doesn't need that right now.
An MRI takes much longer,
and it's not as good for finding a traumatic bleed.
It's gonna be okay.
I know, honey.
I just want to do the right thing. This is the right thing.
We can do the CT
quickly and without sedation.
And if you want to stay in the room, you have to wear
one of these lead aprons.
If not, you can wait in the control room.
I'm not going anywhere.
This isn't gonna hurt.
I know.
You ready, Carlos?
I'll be right here.
It'll be over before you know it.
That reduction was impressive.
Let's not congratulate ourselves until we see the film.
(murmurs): Is it over?
Your bones are back in place.
We need to wrap your splint and repeat the X-ray.
How do you feel?
I'm okay.
Who is he?
It's not what you think.
Was it someone in your squad?
Was he an officer?
Was it a journalist?
The guy you wrote me about?
Now's really not the time for this, man. No, Jack.
Explain to me how you've been home for two weeks
and you're two months pregnant!
Because I was raped.
(sobbing)
Kyle...
Kyle Peterson raped me.
Your sergeant?
You were laughing with him
when you got off the plane, I saw you.
He did it, Jack.
You're lying.
It's true.
You need to stay still. You're covering
because you screwed somebody.
You know what? Why don't you go outside.
Hey, get off of me!
(screams)
Jack!
I'd wait a year or so.
Jobs are tight out there.
No, the housing market's tight.
People always need doctors.
Hey, I'd pimp my dog if it'll get you to stay.
Why don't you pimp a few charts and clear the board.
We're packed.
You should put Abby back on the schedule.
She's taking some personal time.
Still? It's been weeks now.
So what? She'll come back when she's back.
I saw your nephrotic syndrome patient.
Consult's on the chart. Thank you, Dr. Daniels.
Oh, hey. Hey, hey.
How'd he do?
He handled it like a champ.
Oh, good. Well, I'll come find you
as soon as I get the results.
Pratt, it's Michael Grant from Northwestern, line 2.
Hey. Whoa, whoa.
You called already?
You snooze, you lose.
Hello?
I'll take the neck in Trauma.
You talk some sense into him.
ZELINSKY: Oh, and this is the desk.
It's kind of like the epicenter where...
Where...
senior attendings like myself create the action.
More like the chaos. Hi.
Hi.
I'm Jaspreet, Neela's cousin.
Oh. I'm Archie Morris, Neela's friend.
Not to be confused with "boyfriend"
because we never dated if you know what I'm saying.
Why wouldn't I know what you're saying? Okay,
Dr. Morris, Jaspreet and I need to go finish the tour.
Oh, uh, tour?
Tour, well, where has young Henry taken you?
It's Harold. Whatever.
Well, we went to the OR
and saw this guy carrying a heart in an ice chest.
It was so cool. And then we saw
this awesome MRI scan
and saw pictures of this chick's brain.
Then we went
to the morgue and saw this dead body.
And this thing was dead.
As in dead-dead. Wow.
Did he take you to the trauma room?
Where senior attendings like myself save lives?
No.
But I'd love to see that.
Would you?
My pleasure.
Wait. Excuse me.
Wait. But...
But, uh...
I haven't even taken you to the pathology lab yet.
I must've been asleep about two hours when he came in.
First I thought we were being attacked.
(sobs): That's why he was there, but...
Then he got on top of me and
put his hand over my mouth
and told me to be quiet.
And I froze.
Did you tell anyone?
The next day we were out on patrol
looking for insurgents.
What was I supposed to do, file a complaint?
I needed those guys to have my back.
Still, they should be punished.
It's too late.
I pretended like it didn't happen.
Just like Jack said, I was laughing with him.
Doesn't matter.
I've been through it.
Holding it in gives you nothing
but nightmares and panic attacks.
I heard Jeanie Boulet was in the house.
Hi. Hi. Look at you.
You look great. Oh, you do, too.
Thanks. You remember Carlos?
You were this small when we met.
How you feeling? Okay.
I got a CT.
About 45 minutes ago.
Wonder if they processed the films yet.
Who was helping you?
Dr. Pratt.
Let's go find out if the radiologist has them.
Okay, I'll go with you.
You all right?
Be back in a few minutes.
So what's going on?
Are you still running the same clinic?
Two now-- one on the South Side, one on the North.
How's Reggie? Did he finally make detective?
Yeah, he sure did.
We separated two years ago.
No, don't tell me that.
He just... it was too much for him.
I'm at the clinic 24/7.
So you're still close?
Joint custody.
It's good for all of us.
Have you heard from Doug and Carol?
Oh, they are still loving Seattle.
Dr. Ross sent a picture of the twins.
They just started third grade. Wow.
I keep saying I'm gonna visit.
And how's Carter?
Is he still in Africa?
I heard he might be coming home for a visit in the spring.
You know what? I should have everybody over
for gumbo and etouffee. Do that.
We'll get together like the good old days.
Has anyone seen Dr. Pratt?
He's at the Jumbo Mart having coffee.
I was just hoping I could get my son's CT results
and get him home.
I'll give them a call.
Name's Carlos Moore.
Line's busy. They've been slow all day.
I'll go upstairs and see what's
taking so long.
Thanks a lot.
DANIELS: I started making up the schedule myself.
Before I knew it, I was arranging teaching conferences,
reorganizing the appointment grids.
Yeah, well, that's just great.
But Anspaugh doesn't believe in me.
You heard it yourself.
It's not about Anspaugh.
It's about you.
Make it so they can't deny you this.
Look, there's some physician leadership programs over
at U of C coming up in about a month.
They might give you some ideas.
And why would I have to jump through hoops
when Northwestern already said
they'd die to have someone like me?
You think you're just gonna
walk in there and run the place?
The head of the department is looking
for someone to mentor to replace him.
He wants to meet tomorrow.
You know, Dr. Pratt,
when a fighter gets knocked down,
in the first round,
he doesn't throw in the towel.
I'm not throwing in the towel.
I'm getting into another ring.
(cell phone ringing)
Excuse me.
Dr. Pratt.
Yeah.
Why is she up there?
No.
Yeah. Okay, thanks.
Hey, I gotta take care of this.
Dr. Pratt, think about what I said.
Having you run this department--
that would be phenomenal.
Have you seen our soldier's boyfriend?
The guy who body-slammed me?
I'm not sending a search party out for him.
Yeah, you need to toughen up.
Maybe you should come running with us in the mornings.
I lift weights, Sam.
I'm not into torture.
So why are you doing all this anyway?
I don't know. I'm trying to get out there a little bit more.
I'm taking wine tasting, too.
(chuckles)
What's funny, Gates?
Oh, I don't know. Just
remembering a dream I had last night.
Sam was in it.
I was?
What was I doing?
Hey, Sam, have you seen Dr. Wexler?
Not in a while.
Hey, what was I doing, Gates?
Hey! Hey!
Are those my films?
Yeah. I went to light a fire under their butts.
Yeah, you should have paged me first.
I was trying to help. Well, that wasn't
the way to do it. Miss Boulet?
Dr. Pratt, we should talk first. Yeah, later.
But, Dr. Pratt...
What is it?
Uh...
Do you mind if we go talk in the doctors lounge?
No, I-I've waited long enough.
Just give me the results.
There's a lesion by the frontal horn of the left ventricle.
From the fall?
It's contrast-enhancing with surrounding edema.
No, it's not from a head injury.
Then what is it?
There are a few possibilities.
It could be toxoplasmosis.
CNS lymphoma, histoplasmosis.
Meaning AIDS.
My son has AIDS.
I never would have told her like that
had you not gone up there.
You're blaming this on me?
You went behind my back.
You're acting like I slept with your girlfriend.
I was helping you out.
I don't need your help.
Had I gotten the results myself,
I would have pulled into the family room.
Or if you had taken a second to talk to me first...
Because of you, what should have been a private conversation
happened out here on the floor.
You know what, Dr. Pratt?
You don't get it.
What don't I get?
That you're a micromanager in complete denial?
This should be a team.
We shouldn't be working autonomously.
Please, give me a break, okay? I came up
on this team.
Now, the next time you're bored
and you need something to do,
try treating a patient-- your own...
Chief.
He'd done so well for so long.
Then, over the last year, his CD4 counts dropped.
They've changed his retrovirals twice...
(door opens)
...because the virus became resistant.
HALEH: Let's just see what the doctors have planned.
There are all types of new treatments now.
Haleh's right.
Even if it means Carlos has AIDS,
survival has improved over the last decade.
Please don't lecture me.
I'm HIV-positive. I know all about it.
But it's different when it's your own kid.
I know that.
It's so surreal happening here.
It's where I met Carlos.
We decided to adopt him.
We don't even know what
this brain lesion is.
If it's toxoplasmosis,
he'll get better with antibiotics.
And if it's a lymphoma?
Then there's chemo.
You know that doesn't work.
If it's a lymphoma, he's got months.
Why don't we just find out what it is first?
How will we do that?
There is no simple way.
The only way to know for sure
is to do a biopsy.
Cut into his brain.
The neurosurgeon
can do it stereotactically, with a needle
under CT guidance.
I don't know.
It's the best way.
DAWN: Miss Boulet?
A Reggie Moore is here to see you.
That's Carlos's father.
I got to go.
Bam! You're out.
Harold, what are you doing?
Playing four square.
Whoa! Hey!
Oh! Okay! All right!
Let's keep it moving, people.
Go inside, guys!
Game's over.
What? They're not patients?
I pulled them from the waiting room.
You whip that thing at them one more time,
I'll be sewing up their head lacs.
Get in.
What?
The box. Get in.
Get in.
What is your problem?
Why are you so agitated?
Morris stole my girl.
Your girl?
Jaspreet?
Two guys have taken my women in the past two months,
and I'm sick of it.
(sighs) MORRIS: Across the way,
we have the Jumbo Mart.
Down the street is Ike's,
a very fine establishment, and there's the El,
which can take you anywhere in the city.
JASPREET: That's so cool.
Hey, Neela! Jaspreet and I were gonna
grab some drinks after work.
You down?
Well, actually, I was...
Yeah. We're in.
Uh... double date.
Be there.
Howard, come on. Let's go.
Come on.
How are we gonna tell him?
Let's just talk about the mass.
What about the AIDS?
You want to tell him
about that?
We should take it...
just one step at a time.
You want to start lying to him now?
It's not lying. Miss Boulet,
with all due respect... I know what I'm doing.
Right. Right. You're the specialist.
You have all the answers. Do you think
this is easy for me? Patients have
the right to know. He's my kid.
He's mine, too.
You don't think he reads the pamphlets?
You don't think he listens to your calls?
Carlos knows what an AIDS-defining illness is.
Just give her a minute.
Yeah.
She's stubborn.
It's either her way or no way.
Hey, Sam.
Did Ortho see the post-reduction film
on the pregnant soldier?
They signed off on it.
Good.
I'm sorry to hear about what you've been through.
Uh... Yeah. Well.
I appreciate that.
But, FYI, I don't think it's appropriate
to share that type of personal stuff with the patients.
Excuse me?
They're dealing with their own crisis.
They don't need to listen to ours.
Hey.
Hey, Doc.
I thought you split.
How's Beth?
How do you think?
I don't believe her.
Well, you think she's telling the truth?
Yeah, I do.
Doesn't matter what I think.
You know, I was always afraid of her stepping on an IED
or getting killed by a sniper, but...
Something like this?
You know, we shouldn't have to worry about our own guys.
We're all supposed to be over there defending our country.
You're right about that, but...
start by defending her.
What kind of spot?
Well, we're not sure.
It could be caused by some germs.
Or it could be something else.
Can you take it out?
It's not that easy.
We have to do some more tests first.
What kind of tests?
Well, what we want to do is just take a little piece out
and look at it under a microscope.
You mean I have a tumor?
Remember I told you,
God helps us through the good times...
and the bad.
We have to have faith.
He's gonna hold our hands through this.
All of us together, buddy.
Carlos.
Hey, Carlos.
Carlos.
What's happening?
All right, push two of lorazepam right now.
The second two didn't touch him.
He's maxed out on lorazepam.
What next?
Pentobarb.
You wanna go straight to pentobarb?
Yeah, we have to stop this.
Pulse is up to 165.
Oh, God. BOULET: Try Depakote.
No, it takes too long.
Get Pedes neuro down here. Ugh. Why?
He's got elevated ICP and he's failed first-line drugs.
It's a no-brainer.
I'd like to get a neuro consult
before you induce a coma in this kid.
A coma? No. No way.
We should avoid intubation. He's going to need
general anesthesia for the biopsy anyway.
HALEH: Sat's dropping, 87.
All right, call Respiratory, prep a 6-0 ET tube.
I think that's excessive, Greg.
He needs an anticonvulsant.
Pentobarbital 300 milligrams IV.
Haleh, now.
All right, I'm in.
Bag him up. What about an EEG?
Nope, they'll do it in the OR. Pentobarb drip at 30 migs
per hour and... Does he need steroids?
I was ordering six of Decadron.
What's that for? It's to reduce the swelling around the lesion.
Are you staying while he's in surgery?
Yeah, I'm not going anywhere.
Well done, Greg.
They're ready for him in OR.
TAGGART: Hey.
What's up?
I guess Beth's boyfriend never made it back, huh?
I saw him outside. I tried to talk to him,
but I guess I wasn't that persuasive.
You not persuasive?
Come on. I thought you were a sweet-talker.
I guess even this situation was beyond me.
Guess again.
Hmm, he came back.
Well, I knew he would.
I just wanted to make sure
that you knew that I knew that, you know...
How you doing?
I'm better now.
How's the ankle?
The splint's really helping.
TAGGART: Got to keep it elevated at home, okay? Okay.
Speaking of which, when can we get her out of here?
GATES: Soon. I just want to talk to you
about the pregnancy options.
I can make a call to the gynecologist
and you could have a D&C done as early as tomorrow.
I'm not getting an abortion.
You want to have this baby?
Beth, I don't understand.
Let me call a counselor down here to talk to you.
I'm gonna keep it.
Pregnant soldiers don't get sent back.
I love Earth and, and Veer-Zaara.
They're epic.
NEELA: Since when did you follow Bollywood movies?
Since he went on the Internet 20 minutes ago.
Truth is I don't really watch Indian films.
Well, surely, when you go home to the motherland
you've caught a few.
I've never actually been to India.
You know, not every Indian person's been to India, Morris.
It's like assuming every African-American
has been to Africa.
Yeah, well, I just assumed arranged marriages-India, hello.
You assumed wrong, butthead!
Bite me!
Rasgotra, you buying?
Dr. Grossman.
Be right back.
Um, I hope you're cool about earlier.
What, about how you stole our case?
I was trying to be proactive.
That's what my girlfriend said when she moved out.
I'm joking, Rasgotra.
Sorry.
I love proactivity.
In fact, how would you feel about an ortho rotation?
Really? Mm-hmm.
Um, well, I'm flattered,
but I have to talk to Dr. Dubenko first.
Yeah, I already did that.
You have a surgical elective requirement,
so now you're all mine.
Really? Mm-hmm.
And he's gonna just let me out that easily?
You're gonna be with the cool kids next week.
Be ready.
I'm pretty tough.
Having the baby's not the answer.
Right, Beth, there are other ways to handle this.
I'm not going back over there.
I don't believe in it anymore.
All right, so report him.
I can't prove anything.
What if he's hurting other people, too?
Think about that.
Yeah, he's right.
I know it's scary, but you can do it.
I love you
and I support you,
and the last thing
I'm gonna do is let anything else bad happen to you...
including going back over there.
I promise.
(sobbing)
Okay.
(laughing)
What are you looking at?
You fools.
Neela's crazy cousin took these.
We are the most idiotic, dysfunctional family ever.
(laughing)
Frank, if anybody's looking for me, I'll be upstairs.
Yeah, okay.
Hey.
They're still working on him.
I was gonna go get some coffee.
You okay?
That's our boy.
She can sit there and watch it. I can't.
I know it's tough seeing your kid in there like that.
You would think her getting HIV would have crippled her,
but she turned it into a mission:
the clinics, the patients.
If she's not mentoring someone,
she's following up with a teenager,
make sure they're taking their medicine.
She seems pretty committed.
Yeah, she sure is.
If you have any questions or you need anything,
don't hesitate to page me.
Aren't you supposed to tell me everything's gonna be all right?
Hang in there, my friend.
Ice is all you can do.
Are you sure you can't give me
some more tips over dinner? (snickers)
What? I thought it was pretty good
when we were hanging out before Christmas.
It was, but, uh...
Don't tell me. You hooked up with an elf?
No, I was kind bummed you didn't call, that's all.
I went home to DC for the holidays.
Got tied up with the family.
But look, this weekend, we could catch a movie,
get some drinks.
Hmm, sounds good.
What happened to the cop?
I thought he was your new lover.
We're dating. We're not married.
So this is a modern thing,
juggle more than one guy?
Men do it all the time.
Want to hear about my dream?
Not particularly.
Earlier, you were begging for it.
I don't beg.
In my dream you did.
Ew! Was is it sexual?
Ew! No, it wasn't.
You were begging to do my laundry.
Bye, Tony.
You washed one load eight times.
You're insane.
What do you think that means?
You think you're like a clean freak or something?
The biopsy's going well.
They localized the lesion and they're getting tissue.
His vitals are great.
He hasn't had
any more seizure activity.
Jeanie, that's good news.
It's just the beginning.
He'll fight.
He's a tough kid.
When I tested positive
12 years ago...
people were so freaked by it.
Some of the doctors didn't think
I should work here anymore.
The nurses had problems with it, too.
Even my family.
I would go home for Christmas and...
I'd hear my aunts talking.
"Well, at least she doesn't have AIDS, girl.
I have to sit her in the other room to eat."
I don't want Carlos to go through that.
He doesn't deserve it.
You'll make sure that doesn't happen.
You know what scares me about all this?
What if everything I've been fighting for
is a bunch of bull?
It's not.
I tell my patients they won't end up here,
but they do.
My ex, Al, died two years ago.
He was 78 pounds.
Didn't even recognize me.
My friend Paulette
was the first person I met
in support group. Miss Boulet...
If I lose him...
I'm done with it.
Don't say that.
It's true. I won't do it anymore.
You have to.
Do it for Carlos.
Do it for yourself.
But whatever you decide, you keep doing it.
Because you are exactly what we need.
You're not so bad, Dr. Pratt.
I know.
(chuckles)
It usually takes people a while, but...
I eventually win 'em over.
I'm going to say a prayer for him.
Say one for us both.
All right.
(sighs)
Dr. Daniels.
Yeah, it's Dr. Pratt.
I was thinking about what you said earlier, and...
yeah.
I'm gonna stick around for round two.
Good. I'll be right up.
