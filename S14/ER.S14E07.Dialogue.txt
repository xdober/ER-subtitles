Previously on E.R.--
Why the hell are you working the night before your Boards?
It was supposed to be Morris's shift,
but he's taking them, too.
You get stuck on the test, squeeze this,
the answer will come.
That was so cool, defending us from Moretti like that.
Well, we were just discussing different teaching philosophies.
Well, yours is better, which is why there's no way
I'm going to present to him.
My girlfriend Lacy-- her homecoming dance is coming up.
Help me. I'm-I'm a virgin.
I'm not a nun.
I'm a woman who happens
to be a chaplain.
You've been going to meetings?
Yes.
It's like I'm actually trying
to screw things up.
(baby Joe fussing)
(fussing stops)
(Joe fussing slightly)
(Lockhart sniffling)
Soon they'll be blaming this on global warming.
Yeah. All those years of plastic cups
and Styrofoam are coming home to roost.
So, because I've used spray can deodorant my whole life,
now I'm supposed to feel guilty
about the resurgence of malaria in Kenya?
You speak so crazy, Frank.
I read it in the paper.
I read that cow farts are going to be the death of all of us.
Cow farts?
Yeah, we eat too much livestock,
which release gases into the atmosphere,
killing the ozone.
Thank you, Al Gore.
I would rather drop dead right now over a bone-in rib eye
than live forever on organic spinach.
The truth is very inconvenient.
Well, I don't know about the rest of you,
but I have gotten smart.
Hooked myself up with a tight little sex machine,
energy efficient to the tune of 40-plus miles per gallon
and draws babes to Archie like bees to honey.
Ew! That made me throw up in my mouth a little.
Me, too. LOCKHART: What about Hope?
Didn't you take an oath of fidelity or something?
Yeah. What, she's saving starving kids in Venezuela,
and you're out here cruising for chicks?
Hope? Hope, Hope...
Oh, oh, that Hope.
Yeah. Uh, we broke up.
TAGGART: No, you didn't.
You did?
I'm sorry.
No. No big deal.
It was very... It was very mutual.
That's good.
Except it was all her idea, and I begged her not to do it.
But I'm fine with it now. It's all good.
Lady for you on three, chief.
Hope she chokes on a mojito.
Says she's your ex-wife. Something about your son.
Oh. All right.
I'll take it, uh, in there.
He was married? Poor woman.
RASGOTRA: Ah, the very person
we're looking for.
(imitates engine revving)
What's he doing?
Oh, don't forget the clutch, dummy.
Well, you said I could teach him to drive your car today.
I did? Yeah, you did.
No, no, no, no, no.
That was before I hooked up my new wheels.
You have new wheels? Cool.
No. No, not cool.
I'm not going to let some prepubescent intern
ding up my chick magnet.
Is it? For reals?
MORRIS: This car
makes a statement,
and the statement is, "I am bringing sexy back."
Sweet! Um, hello?
Look, he's got his homecoming soon.
He wants to be able to drive his date.
Give the kid a break.
(engine starting) Oh! I had to pull strings to get this.
You can't even buy one of these babies yet.
Well, I'll get you the number of that new PACU nurse.
The one from Nashville?
I heard she was in the circus.
She does look flexible.
All right.
Okay. Fine.
Now. Now, let's see.
What are you doing?
Doing a walk-around.
I want to make sure it comes back in the same condition.
God, you're so anal.
Pristine, beautiful, unblemished.
Thank you, Dr. Morris.
Now, let's run down a few things here.
Wait...
Harold, the brake! Hey!
Wait! Wait! Harold?
Harold, be... Be careful, Harold!
Stay aware of your surroundings!
It's all about peripheral vi...
(grunting)
(distant voices)
GATES: What we're talking about here is pain.
Proactively treating it
right here in triage with you guys, all right?
Most of you know how to use
the Wong-Baker Scale.
(baby crying)
GATES: Any kid coming in, we assess the pain
from zero to ten.
Any score above zero, we give them analgesia at the desk.
Put it on your charts. The docs will be checking.
Someone's been Morettisized.
Mm-hmm, Gates drank the Kool-Aid.
GATES: How old? Three months.
She's been like this for hours.
Okay. Fussy, crying.
It's probably the heat.
Chuny, can you take her back?
I got this. Follow me.
It's never been this bad before.
All right, here, check this out.
MORRIS: Come on, guys, stop goofing around!
Victim of auto versus pedestrian.
Possible blunt head trauma.
The car didn't hit me. I walked into it.
I told them that. What's with the backboard?
Patient resisted treatment, so we took all precautions.
I do not meet trauma center criteria.
What do we have here? He was combative on scene.
No, I wasn't! A little bit, a little bit.
Because I don't need any of this.
Might need a head CT.
Definite possibility, Dr. Gates. What?!
No. No! I don't need spinal immobilization.
No, no, no, no. No, you might need an X-ray, sir,
before you take this off.
No, the hell you do, and stop calling me sir!
Oh, could be a distracting injury.
Distracting... I'm going to distract your face with my foot!
Look! Huh? Huh? I'm fine.
All this wasted energy
is seriously inflating my carbon footprint.
So, are you refusing medical care, sir?
Yes. Yes, I am.
So you're going to sign a form indicating that
you're leaving this ER against medical advice?
Screw you guys.
You're wasting valuable time and resources on this
silly little comedy routine.
Ooh! Aah!
Stupid doors.
(snickering)
Next time that happens, give him a Foley in the field.
(Pratt snickers)
JULIA: Make sure your grandma
follows up with the clinic visits, okay, Jeffrey?
Refuah shleima, Beatrice.
Toda raba, Ms. Dupree.
And a happy shana tovah to you.
Oh, nice try.
Jewish New Year was two months ago.
Oh, I got you your musicians.
My what?
Well, you said you wanted some help brightening up the place,
alleviating the misery, so,
Ken and Willow Monterey, this is Dr. Gates.
Oh, hello! Thanks for having us.
This is our first time in the ER.
We're super-excited.
We mostly perform in Pedes.
Love bringing joy to the little people.
But this gives us a chance to dig a bit deeper
into the old set list.
Oh, good.
All right, well, uh, make yourself at home.
BOTH: Namaste.
Nama...
(Julia sighs)
Where'd you find them, God Camp? (scoffs)
Oh, man, I almost forgot.
Is it...? It is.
Today's the day.
What day? Uh, D-day.
Or Independence Day.
Starting to sound like Stupid Day.
Don't push me, Sam.
It's hot, and I don't know where my Smart Car is.
Greg and I get our Board results back today.
I'm worried about him.
I'm not sure he hit the books hard enough.
Hey, Vin Diesel, where's my car?
It's parked around the corner. I've got to go to a laparotomy.
Zelinsky, did you damage that vehicle?
Oh, no, sir, not that I know of... well, uh,
yeah, a little.
What?! RASGOTRA: A little ding to the fender.
Miniscule. Gives it character.
Personality. You'll hardly notice it.
I got to go.
Air conditioner broke down
at the nursing home.
Multiple victims with hyperthermia and dehydration.
Another five coming in the van.
Yeah, they turned our place into Kentucky Fried Old Folks!
How you doing, sir?
Hey, I did not survive a pogrom, a gulag and bris in a back alley
just so that I could be baked like a strudel!
DUMAR: This is J.J. Perkins, 80 years old, ALOC,
history of hypertension, previous MI.
Temp high of 104.
Mr. Perkins?
PERKINS: Thirsty.
Positive O sign. Not good.
Is he okay? We're roommates!
Hey, Grady, get some more wheelchairs.
Power shortage, my ass.
The engineers are selling off the energy
to the highest bidder, just like they did in California.
You know who's getting it all? The Pakis!
WILLOW: * Say hip hop...
Hey! Where'd they put my buddy?
WILLOW: * ...to the hip hip hop
* You don't stop a rockin'
* To the bang bang boogie, say up jumped the boogie *
* To the rhythm to the boogie, the beat *
(baby crying) * Skiddly bee-bop, a-bee-bop, a scooby doo *
* And guess what, guy?
* We love you
* Now what you hear is not a test *
* I'm rappin' to the beat
WOMAN: Do you think our apartment's too hot for her?
I can't say yet.
(baby crying)
Any vomiting or diarrhea?
No, none of that.
* To the black, to the white, the red and the brown *
Does anything help to calm her down?
Car rides or noise machines?
She doesn't like any noise really.
Even music.
Well, I can't say I blame her for that right now.
WOMAN: Our doctor thought it was reflux,
so she ordered this scope test.
Uh-huh. And?
Everything was normal.
Do you think it could it be colic?
Well, we have to rule out some other stuff first.
How are you guys holding up?
Mm...
it's been kind of hard.
MAN: This heat and the brownouts.
She just seems so unhappy all the time.
It gets easier.
It does.
I'm going to run this by my supervisor. I'll be back.
* And on and on and on and on... *
Now, the next time that the power goes out,
don't go using jumper cables to juice up the AC, okay?
Where I went wrong was, I had the wide screen
and the massage chair hooked up to the same battery.
* First I was afraid, I was petrified * (sighs)
* Kept thinking I could never live *
* Without you by my side
* And I spent so many nights... *
Three-month-old,
intermittent crying spells times three months.
The kid's whole life, huh?
If it's been going on that long, it's not an emergency.
Well, seems to be okay-- afebrile, alert.
Fontanelle's flat, no signs of injury, exam's benign.
Of course it is.
Exam's always normal in babies like this.
* I've got all my life to live, I've got all my love to give *
Okay, I'll check it out soon.
First, I got to put a stop to this.
Where the hell is Gates?
More importantly, where are our Board results?
Oh, they're not in yet.
But the Vegas odds are ten-to-one you both failed.
PRATT: Look, just tell Gates to get rid
of the Captain and Tenille.
We're supposed to be healing people here,
not driving them to suicide.
You nervous? About the results? No. Are you?
No.
You got those old folks all fixed up?
Yeah, Moretti ordered evaporative cooling.
I got Javier babysitting.
All right, let me know if you need any help.
* Do you really want to hurt me? *
* Do you really want to make me cry? *
Patient was in his usual state
of excellent health until 1:00 p.m. today,
when he got up from the living room sofa...
Okay, stop-- I'm bored and lost.
You're going to put him to sleep.
But that's the history.
Yes, yes, presented in the most obtuse way possible.
What do you think is wrong with this guy?
Dehydration.
Okay, spit it out up front, so Mussolini doesn't eat you alive.
And can you please shoot me or shoot them?
I really don't care which.
How's it going?
It's weird, this music seems to be soothing her.
That is weird.
My supervisor's on his way over.
Okay, Grady, one more time.
65-year-old man, syncopal episode
after skipping breakfast and lunch.
Okay, now I know what you're thinking.
No chest pains, palpitation, weakness, headache.
That's what I'm talking about.
Please, Gates, make them go away!
Yeah, I'm with her.
I pushed them in the back. What do you want me to do?
OTHERS: Get rid of them!
Guy, what they're doing is a nice thing, okay?
And some people actually like it.
Oh, yeah? What people?
(Frank singing along) Frank's not people.
I'll see what I can do. * I want to be sedated...
MORETTI: Grady?
Break room-- it's time to present. Come on.
Say, here's an update, folks.
Green line is down, there's scattered looting
on the West Side, we got two X-ray machines out,
the temperature
in the O.R. is 84 degrees, and, uh,
oh, oh, oh, that's right, boys, the, uh, test scores are in.
What?! What?!
Why didn't you say something?
Stop playing games. Hey, man.
Hey... you got us waiting like this.
FRANK: So, did the Medical Board
make another deadly error in judgment?
Yes, they have, Frank, I passed.
(cheering and laughter) Hey!
Congratulations.
Morris?
Come on, baby.
Yeah... it's good.
It's all good. Yes, they passed!
My man. Morris and Pratt passed!
All right, after work, drinks on me and Morris.
All right.
WILLOW & KEN: * Nothing to do, nowhere to go
* I wanna be sedated.
MAN (on TV): You stole her, didn't you?
MAN 2: What?! She's mine.
Says who? Says me.
Yeah, well, she came to me.
Damn power.
I'm telling you, it's the Pakis.
Oh, that's not nice, honey.
Chuny, how's Mrs. Lidner?
Down to 99, she's perking up.
Chest X-ray clear, no hypernatremia.
Hey, you should see this, J.J.
It's very good.
What's it called again?
Grumpy Old Men.
How's Mr. Perkins doing?
He's fine, hey, he's better, leave him alone.
Minimally responsive,
tachy to 130, having some ectopy on the monitor.
Hey, we were hot and thirsty.
We don't need any more witchy medicine.
Shh. Temp?
The cooling blanket
didn't help, he's still 103.
Mr. Perkins? (mumbles) Hey,
don't do that. What are you doing to him?
His neck's stiff. Are we missing meningitis?
GRADY: He's stiff all over.
Increased muscle tone.
Let's go-- Trauma Two.
Blood cultures, two milligrams ceftriaxone.
Let's get a head CT.
Stop it, you, you're not a real doctor.
I want a real doctor.
You're some stuffed-up quack!
JAVIER: Calm down.
He's going to be all right, right?
Sure.
Relax.
(Matthau and Lemmon grunting and shouting on TV)
DUBENKO: Worse when I press... or let go?
The same. CT?
White count is 11.2.
Mildly inflamed appendix that doesn't fill
with oral contrast.
Looks like early appendicitis.
WANG: Oh, geez, I need surgery?
If we take it out laparoscopically,
you'll be back home tomorrow.
HAROLD: Might we be jumping the gun here?
There is an alternate diagnosis to consider.
It could be epiploic appendagitis.
Rather unlikely, Doctor.
So, in terms of the laparoscopic procedure...
He hasn't been vomiting, he's got a normal white count.
No single sign, symptom, or test
confirms the diagnosis of appendicitis.
Okay?
So as I was saying...
Just hold the phone a minute.
The CT isn't that impressive... Dr. Zelinsky.
Harold. If I'm on to something,
then he'll get better with rest and nonsteroidals. Dr. Zelinsky.
He won't need surgery.
So I don't need surgery?
That's not what we're saying.
His CT lacks all
of the predictable findings
to support your theory, okay?
I don't want an unnecessary operation.
Are you sure?
I'm very sure. Dr. Rasgotra
will be back to consent for surgery.
I'll see you in the O.R. Okay.
Thanks, Mary.
Uh, Dr. Dubenko, I'm interested in why you think...
Harold. ...that the CT shows no signs of an ovoid pericolic lesion.
Shut up now.
(Willow & Ken singing "Killing Me Softly")
Go round.
Drinks at Ike's on Morris and Pratt.
They passed their Boards.
Wow, great. Uh-huh.
Um, I'd like to discuss
Zelinsky's progress with you.
Yeah, about that...
Tomorrow, not now. Tomorrow?
I don't want to say anything too cruel,
which I am at risk of doing
if we discuss it at this moment, so...
we'll talk about Dr. Rain Man tomorrow.
WILLOW & KEN: * With his words...
Can you help me out here, please, a little?
You want me to fire the volunteers?
Yes, in a nice way.
Look, they love them in Pedes, they're a hit in oncology.
Why do you ER types have to be such snobs?
Just do what God would do-- cast these people out.
Nice.
The mocking use of religious imagery always works with me.
Well, I'm just trying to speak to you
in a language you understand, that's all.
Bye. * Da, da, da
* Da...
* La...
Still having ectopy.
300 amiodarone I.V.
So chest pain in three should have had an EKG and troponin,
but the resident cancelled the orders.
He's breathing. Sat's OK.
Dawn, bring them in.
What resident?
Lockhart. Did you sign off on it?
Uh, must have been Pratt.
I'm sure there was a good reason.
What are you doing to J.J.?
Shh.
Mr. Leftkowitz,
did Mr. Perkins have any new pills at the home?
They're always giving us pills.
If you can't poop, they give you a pill.
If you complain about the government,
you get a pill.
Can you be more specific?
Try to get people to vote for Obama--
they got a pill for that, too.
Papi, listen, did they give J.J. anything today?
He got feisty because it was so hot in there.
Does this look familiar?
How about this?
Maybe this-- it was yellow.
Bingo. Haloperidol.
I bet he's got neuroleptic malignant syndrome.
Interesting theory. Dantrolene
100 milligrams I.V.
(crying) I'm pretty sure what we have here
is a beautiful, healthy little girl with a bad case of colic.
That's what the pediatrician said.
There's nothing we can do,
like no medicines you can give her?
No, you just have to wait it out.
But it's too hot to keep her all wrapped up like that.
We read a book that said to do that when she gets fussy.
No, not in this weather. Now, if you feel the blanket,
you'll see she sweated right through it.
That's normal, she gets all worked up when she feeds.
All right, well, just hang in there.
PRATT: A nurse will be back with your discharge paperwork.
Abby.
Hey, do me a favor.
See if you can get some kind of referral
for some new parenting group or something.
That's it? You don't want to do any more of a workup?
For colic?
No, why?
There's no need, it's classic.
Well, it's not classic, actually.
When I worked in OB,
we did a lot of anticipatory guidance about this
and colic doesn't usually start until six weeks of life.
This baby's been fussy since birth.
It hasn't killed her yet.
Yeah, but the sweating when she feeds
could be an indication... It's a million degrees outside.
Her parents keep her wrapped up like a burrito.
I have a feeling...
Look, this is a long-term pre-existing condition
with no signs of abuse.
Just let them follow up with the pediatrician.
And Abby, relax, okay?
You are now talking
to a board-certified emergency medicine attending, thank you.
You still have to take the oral boards.
Nothing but a mere technicality.
See you at Ike's?
(chuckles)
So we done with them?
The Burke baby.
Um... yeah.
Hey, wait, no.
Sorry.
Hold on, I just want to check one more thing.
Hey, you coming out tonight?
It's Brownout Thursday at Ike's.
Drinks half-price if you bring a candle.
I thought Pratt and Morris were buying.
Only a round-- cheap bastards.
Come on, let loose for a night.
I'll think about it.
Your AC is putting out air at 77 degrees through this duct.
You mean it's working.
Yeah, but it's 62 degrees at the compressor.
That's a lot of waste.
Hey, Frank, what's going on?
Oh, the green Nazis are here.
Oh, you must be the energy manager.
Ethan McInerney.
And you are...? Sam Taggart, the charge nurse.
I spoke to your office.
We, uh, made sure to change out the incandescents
for compact fluorescents.
We're down to 30 foot-candles.
That's very green of you.
Just doing our part.
Maybe you can show me
where the utility access is around here.
Sure, uh, come with me.
I'm going out back and burn some tires with kerosene.
You good with that?
I'm leaving these for Sam.
You're out of here already?
What about the party?
God, it's like junior high around here.
Hi.
Bye. Shift over already?
Uh, Pratt's up to speed on my stuff.
Your intern presented to me.
Did he forget to kiss the ring?
No, in fact, Grady was letter-perfect,
which I'm sure had absolutely nothing to do with you.
Absolutely nothing.
MORETTI: Doctor.
(groans quietly)
Doctor. Yeah?
I understand you've been canceling
my preemptive orders.
(sighs)
In selected cases, I have, yes.
On what criteria?
Well, a 20-year-old with epigastric pain from ibuprofen
doesn't need a CBC, chem panel, and a UA.
He needs to be sent home with some antacid.
But that's an exception.
I mean, the system is the system
and the system is working.
Yeah, not for me.
I didn't go to med school to check boxes and push paper.
When are you going to stop with the end-runs, huh?
Huh?
I mean, what is it?
You just feel more comfortable with Dr. Pratt
because you've worked with him longer or...
or is this just, like, the path of least resistance?
Or is it simply that you just don't like me?
What?
You know what? It doesn't matter.
What doesn't matter?
If I "like" you or not?
No, forget it, forget it.
No, I don't like you. You know what?
You do whatever the hell you want, okay?
And I hope it all works out for you.
Folks, local power grid might be going down,
but don't worry, we're prepared.
Is somebody going to make a toast or something?
No, no, no, nobody's saying anything
until my partner in crime gets here.
Oh, and by the way, I know I'm still on,
so this is a Seven and Seven minus one of the Sevens.
(laughs) Can you guess which one?
Hey, here he is!
(all cheering and applauding)
Can't stay long, somebody's got to mind the store.
Well, then, allow me.
We are going to talk later.
I saw what you did to my car. It takes
a lot of years of training... Is he mad at me?
to become a doctor... No. Shh...
He is. ...and a lot of successes,
a fair amount of failures
as well, but I think
it's important that we all reflect
and appreciate the milestones,
so I would like to be the first
to congratulate Dr. Pratt and Dr. Morris,
who will become newly-minted,
soon-to-be Board-certified...
ALL: ...attending emergency physicians.
(all cheering) Salut!
This chaplain thing, it's really more of a hobby.
(grunts)
My true passion...
is hustling pool.
I see.
You know, I got to tell you, to be honest,
you don't really strike me as the chaplain type.
Mm! And why is that?
I don't know-- 'cause you don't look the part.
I mean, the way you dress,
your vibe, your... tat.
Oh, I have lots of tats.
Oh, yeah?
Uh-huh.
What is, what is that one?
It's a labyrinth.
It's a pretty common symbol, actually,
in the Native American cultures, in the Vedas.
The Minoans use it, too.
Hmm.
It represents life's real journey--
the spiritual journey to the inner self.
Reminds me every day that I have to constantly
be seeking.
And how easy it is to get lost.
Have you been lost?
Haven't you?
So what other tats you got?
You know Harold was just trying to impress you.
I thought we weren't going to talk about this now.
Well, I don't understand why you don't like him.
He's unshaped, he's immature. Smart.
That's not enough.
Well, he's a little rough around the edges, sure,
but instead of getting
hung up about the presentation,
maybe we should start commending him on the insight.
And by "we," I of course mean "you."
He's not ready to be a surgeon on my team, Neela.
Lucien, he wants to be here so badly.
I believe he can do it.
You really want to mentor this kid?
Well, if you'll agree not to kick him out.
Give me a month.
It's not just about turning him into a doctor, Neela.
It's about turning him into an adult.
Do you understand that?
ZELINKSKY: Oh, hey, guys.
Looks like I'm getting kicked out.
Check you on the flipside!
Okay, you've got a month.
It's weird to think of Morris and Pratt
as the top of the heap.
I still remember when Mark Greene
and Doug Ross were running the place.
Who? Who?
ETHAN: Hey, Sam.
Hey! I came over soon as I was done with my evaluation.
Um, this is Chuny.
Hi. And Dawn.
Hey.
Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you.
Anybody need anything from the bar?
Nothing. No, I'm good.
Apple martini.
Coming up.
Hello?
What?
What's up with the fine brother?
He wanted to see if I wanted to have a drink after work,
so I just... What about your hunky beat cop?
You sly dog. No, no, no.
It's not like that.
It's just, um...
Okay, you know that time in your life
when you're in your teens or your early 20s?
You know, when you get to look around
and see what you like and what you don't like?
You mean, like positions?
(all laughing)
No, it's like...
Well, I never had that.
And I think I should.
So, now is my chance.
You know what I mean?
Oh, yeah,
we know what you mean. Mm-hmm, the boy in blue
wasn't hitting that buzzer.
(all laughing)
That's not true.
Apple martini.
I miss something?
Let's hope you don't.
LOCKHART: Excuse me.
Hey, hey, hey, is this where the party is?
Hey, Abby! What's up?
Hey. Hey.
Abby, what's happening?
Hey. It does not look very festive in here.
(laughing)
That's better. Oh, no, no, no.
Better. Do I have to?
Frank? Frank.
I love Frank.
(laughing)
Frank never misses a party.
Where have you been?
Nowhere.
Sam, you look fantastic. Yes?
I do? You look so hot.
(giggling)
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
You're getting some, aren't you?
You are.
Hi.
Hey.
Who's he? Who are you?
Ethan. Ethan McInerney.
I work for the County
as an Energy... (growls)
Look at his eyes.
He's very sincere.
Hey... (horn blares)
Congratulations.
All right, come on, let's get some coffee.
Oh, no, thank you.
No, thank you, boss.
It's a night to celebrate, right? Right?
Tonight is a night to celebrate, right?
Am I right, Chuny? You are right.
What... what is Chuny short for, anyway?
Nothing, just Chuny.
Actually my real name is Ethel.
Get out! No, I'm serious.
Frank, put that hat back on!
NEELA: Abby.
Hi. Hi.
Uh-oh, surgeons are here.
You guys better be careful,
because you are outnumbered.
And if there's a throwdown, we will kick your ass.
Oh, is there going to be a throwdown?
You never know, Lucien, you never know.
Heads up.
Um, who wants a drink?
No, we're good. Anybody?
What's up? It's a party.
Cheer up.
Is she all right?
Yeah, she's just letting off some steam.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Oops.
Hi.
Hi.
I didn't expect to see you here.
Oh, well, yeah, I, um...
I had a babysitter, so I just figured, you know, what the hell.
Yeah.
(banging)
Can I get something, please?
Hey, look, about before...
You shouldn't do that, you know.
What?
What you've been doing.
What have I been doing?
Playing the tyrant and then flirting.
Flirting?
Yeah.
You should stop that.
Okay. I was not aware that I was flirting...
I'm not stupid, you know.
No, I know... I never said you were stupid.
I never said that.
Okay? Good, 'cause I get it.
You come in here on your
white horse and you just figure...
What? What?
What do I figure?
Nothing. You just "figure." PRATT: Abby.
Hey! Hey.
I just got paged back on the Burke baby.
She's been screaming for an hour and the parents
are threatening to sign out AMA. Who?
The baby we saw.
Oh, yes.
Sorry. That's her prerogative.
Their prerogative. Their prerogative.
You were supposed to discharge them before you left.
Now instead, they're waiting on studies that someone ordered
without my permission, studies that
this kid doesn't need.
Now, do you have any idea who could have done that?
Was it me?
You know what?
Let's take this outside.
Okay.
Okay, if I ordered tests,
I'm sure I had a very good reason, Greg.
Even if you don't remember it?
I remember it.
What's the big deal?
A chest film shouldn't take this long.
It does when half the X-ray machines in the hospital are down.
Oh... You know, totally disregarded my instructions
to send these people home. Okay, power trip, what do you want?
I'll go over there. I'll discharge them.
What? No, no, no, you can't be serious right now.
Well, I don't know. It's your party.
Cry if you want to, I'll just take care of it.
No, no, no, no. You're not going anywhere
near the ER like this. Like what?
Hey! Like what? Huh, what?
You know what? What?
I don't know what your problem is,
but you should really take a cab home right now, really.
Whatever.
Both guests of honors are gone, this place is kind of dead.
I know a little blues place over by Northwestern.
Mm! I know where we can go.
There's a little place that has salsa nights on Thursdays.
(all agreeing)
DAWN: Hey, hey, Abby.
We're getting ready to go somewhere else.
You want to come?
No, um, I'm just going to finish this and get out of here.
GRADY: You sure? Yeah, but have fun.
Did you drive here?
No. Okay.
I got his attention.
(groans)
Thank you.
Everything okay?
Yes, work thing. Fixed it.
So where's your husband?
He's in...? Croatia.
Croatia. Mm-hmm.
How much longer is he going to be there?
You would have to ask him that,
'cause he was supposed to be home weeks ago.
Oh.
It's hard to, um... it's complicated to balance
the whole-- you know, the kids and the spouse...
You want to hear about a complicated life?
I will make you cry.
Really.
I'm not kidding.
Really? (chuckles)
I'm sorry.
Mm-hmm.
Look...
what you said before...
Yeah, forget about it. Listen to me.
I'm an asshole.
I know.
(chuckles)
Well... just forget about it. You're not. You're not.
Really, okay? All right, all right, all right, all right....
It's a good thing about Pratt and Morris, though. Yes.
That's good. Here's to Pratt and Morris.
Yep, Pratt and Morris.
Whoops.
Oh, sorry, sir. I'm sorry.
Sorry about that. No problem.
We ain't closing for no stinking blackout, either, all right?
Next round's on me.
(thud)
MAN: Damn.
(groans)
Power's back.
This family shouldn't even be here.
The plan was chest X-ray and EKG,
and then discharge if the studies are normal, right?
That was Abby's plan, not mine.
(baby crying) How's she doing?
She's been, uh, sweating and breathing really fast
ever since I fed her.
She's retracting. MORRIS: And really diaphoretic.
TIFFANY: No fever, her temp's normal.
You guys better check this out.
(crying continues)
MORRIS: Heart's big.
Yeah, and her lungs are wet, she's in failure.
HALEH: What's the sat? Uh... I don't know.
You don't know? I'll do one now.
So, all this started happening after she had a bottle?
MORRIS: Sweating with feeds is a sign of congenital heart disease.
What's going on?
I'm sorry, you're confusing us.
Someone tell us what's going on.
Her heart's not pumping strong enough
and the fluid's backing up into her lungs.
How come she doesn't have an I.V.?
I was told she was going home.
Get me an I.V. kit.
PRATT: And where's the EKG Abby ordered?
I haven't done it yet. MORRIS: We're moving to One, let's go.
Listen, I know you're new and I don't know your name yet...
It's Tiffany. ...but that EKG was ordered hours ago.
We didn't have neonatal leads down here.
I called central supply.
Central takes forever.
You can't wait for them on a day like this.
Run to the NICU. Run.
Get those leads and get back here.
Where did you find that one?
MORETTI: You sure you don't want to have a glass of water
or a cup of coffee or something?
I gotta go. Before you go?
(clears throat) Yeah. I gotta go.
What happened? How did I get here?
Well...
I mean...
Look, why don't you stay for a little bit.
Don't drive right now. It's late.
Oh, my God. I don't think you should go.
I gotta go. Wait, Abby, hold on.
Wait a minute. Honey, wait, wait. No, I gotta go.
Abby... What are you doing?!
Don't!
All right, sorry.
Dr. Morris?
Is she...?
You sure the leads aren't reversed?
I checked three times.
Look at the lateral leads.
Oh, damn.
All right, call Cards, we're on our way up.
The blood flow to your baby's heart has been compromised.
We're not sure how.
And the EKG shows the classic pattern of an acute MI.
An M... an MI? What's an MI?
Your daughter's having a heart attack.
Come on, let's go.
We're taking her up to the cath lab right now.
We're gonna do everything we can for her.
You told us to go home!
You said we should go home!
(sobbing): Why did you tell us to leave?
He told us to go home.
I don't know, Officer, I don't know.
(door closes)
Okay.
It's okay, she's home now.
Doris, I'm really sorry. I'm so sorry.
It's almost 3:00 in the morning.
I know, I'm really sorry, and you can go now.
But he, um, he slept the whole time, right?
He just slept?
Are you okay? What's the matter?
Here you go, just take that.
Take that and take that.
And you can go now. Take that.
Maybe I should stay-- you're worrying me.
No, I'm okay, honey. I'm fine.
I can call my mother, tell her I won't be home.
Oh, my God, please, get out of here.
(sniffles)
(softly): Hi.
(sniffles)
Hey, Joe.
Hey, buddy.
How you doing?
We're gonna go see your daddy, huh?
(crying) It's going to be okay.
All right, sweetie.
(Joe crying)
(exasperated sigh)
It's all right.
It's okay. It's okay, honey.
Shh, shh, it's okay.
(crying continues)
(Joe wailing)
Hey, taxi!
I'm going to O'Hare.
(Joe whimpering)
International.
Ow! Ah...
Lady! You can't hold the kid like that in here.
Yeah, it's okay, just go.
(Joe crying) Go!
Croatia, please.
Uh, Zagreb, Dubrovnik, whatever you got, just get me there.
Ma'am... Um, and do you guys go through
London or Frankfurt?
London, but... London it is then.
Ma'am, there are no flights going out tonight.
Yeah, but, you just need to get me a ticket, okay?
Because of the blackout, it's affected all our...
All right, but just give me a ticket.
It doesn't have to be for right now.
Okay, you need to calm down.
No, you need to do your job
and sell me a ticket, okay?
Ma'am, you need to relax a minute before we can do anything.
I don't understand what's so hard about this, I really don't.
I have a passport, and I have a credit card.
And I'm not a terrorist. Do I look like a terrorist?
I think she's been drinking.
Why do you have to be so bitchy?
Okay, you can't call me a bitch.
I didn't call you a bitch. There's no need for language.
I said you were bitchy. It's not the same thing.
Okay, here's how this is gonna go.
You won't be getting a ticket or boarding a flight to anywhere
as long as you keep behaving like this.
So I want you to go sit down over there,
get yourself together
so I don't have to call Security.
Got me?
(Joe crying)
(softly): Shh...
(Joe crying)
Shh...
Keep the urine alkaline
and recheck labs in another six hours.
I'll let the ICU know.
You'll have your roommate back tomorrow.
He doesn't trust lawyers, accountants,
anybody with a degree, but...
he appreciates what you did.
Uh...
As doctors go...
you seem to be a pretty decent one.
So... thanks.
Hey.
Just got back from the cath lab.
Baby was born with an anomalous left main coronary.
Blood was getting diverted into the GI tract.
The heart gets shafted, which explains the fussiness
after feeds-- she was having angina.
They can fix it?
Well, she's in the O.R. now.
Cards said the prognosis was good.
Guess we got lucky. Hell, yeah, we got lucky.
I don't remember any questions like this on the Boards.
Come on, coffee's on you.
Looks like we survived the blackout.
Yep. The news said Commonwealth Edison's
got it all under control.
(laughs softly)
I failed, Greg.
What?
Oh.
Why didn't you say something?
I was ashamed.
It happened so fast, everybody was so psyched for us.
Look, man, the only thing that this test measures
is how well you take the test.
Doesn't mean you can't keep working.
Just have to take it again, now, come on.
Wh...
In the meantime...
maybe we can keep this between us.
Not tell anybody.
Yeah, if that's what you want.
(laughs): Oh, man.
Especially Abby.
She coached me a little on the side,
when I had some family stuff a while back.
I kind of feel like I let her down.
Eh, well, I'm sure she wouldn't see it that way, but okay.
We won't tell anyone.
Thank God for Abby, huh?
She saved that kid's life.
Yeah.
Thank God for Abby.
(Joe crying)
(Lockhart sniffles)
(Joe crying)
(Joe fusses)
(softly): Shh...
(crying)
