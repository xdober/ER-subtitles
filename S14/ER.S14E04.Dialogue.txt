Previously on ER:
You did this, you selfish bitch,
so you live with that.
And I talked to the guys at Hopkins.
We're trying to get you into the IGF-1 trial.
IGF-1, what's that?
Insulin-like Growth Factor.
It could slow down the progression of the disease.
I'm applying for a part-time job, and it'd help
if you could write a letter or something.
What kind of work? An EMT.
In City Fire, you need someone on the inside
to help you move up, you know?
I'll help your brother out. No worries.
The guy's an alcoholic. Yeah, well, so am I.
Luka's father got sick. He had to fly back to Croatia.
The chemo could take, like, six months
and we have a life here.
It's crazy how much he loves that book.
Yeah, he must really miss Dr. Kovac.
Well, it won't be too much longer.
I hope not.
Don't want him to forget who his dad is.
Okay, Joe-Joe, here we go.
Try to get him to eat some kale today.
Uh-huh.
Alright, I'll see you guys at 5:00.
We'll be here. Have a good day.
Bye, sweetie. I love you.
Bye. Bye.
Mrs. Fratelli, that's really not necessary.
It's the least I can do.
You people are saints.
Well, I appreciate the thought.
Nurse Taggart, you know, my little Paulie, my angel,
he's my only child.
So if it weren't for you and the other doctors,
I mean, you know, he wouldn't be here right now.
Look, that's very kind, but we're just doing our jobs.
No, I insist! Come on. My salon, it's full service.
Manis, pedis, makeovers, massages,
whatever your staff wants, on the house all day!
Come on!
You people spend every day taking care of other people.
Let somebody take care of you for once.
Okay, I guess you can set up in the break room.
Great! You ever thought about going blond?
Might look great on you.
Hey, guys.
Hey. Hey.
Oh, my God, Dr. Lockhart, hi!
Hi. How are you?
Good. How are you?
I'm fabulous!
And, and Paulie's doing great.
He wanted to come, you know,
but he's got school.
Guess what? Free makeovers today.
We'll start with you first.
Thanks, I'm good.
No, no, no, I got some great, wonderful, natural treatments.
Come on. I think you would love it. No, really, I'm fine.
And I'm sorry, but but, but who are you?
Angie. I came in with my son Paulie.
Oh, look at those brown eyes.
Oh, my God. I can make these...
Sheila, did you see her eyes?!
PRATT: Alright, talk to me.
Willy Archibald, he's 59...
Ground-level fall, complains of hip pain.
Denies head trauma or LOC.
Good vitals. No meds or allergies.
How'd you fall, sir?
I must have tripped on something.
Before you fell, did you have any chest pain,
shortness of breath, palpitations?
No, nothing like that.
My hip's killing me, though.
Alright, let's get him four of morphine.
Let's get a full hip and pelvis series.
So, how you doing, man?
Oh, he's doing great.
I love breaking in rookies.
Have we met? Zach Flaherty.
Just transferred in from Rogers Park.
Must be nice. Wish I had a doctor
for a brother when I was coming up.
Please do what you can. He's a great kid.
He really deserves this.
Okay, I'll hold. Alright.
Hi, Mr. Rios. Yes, this is Dr. Tony Gates.
Right, yes, from County General.
Um, yeah, unfortunately, uh... it's true, it's terminal.
Yeah, his name is Josh Lipnicki,
and, um, well, he's leaving tomorrow
so I guess it would have to be today.
Yeah, I'm sorry. I know it's short notice, but...
Yeah. Oh, thank you, sir.
I really appreciate you trying to work this out.
Alright, thank you, sir. Thank you.
Free makeovers, huh?
Yeah. It's a good idea, Sam.
It'd be good for morale.
I can't take the credit for it.
I don't even remember treating that lady's kid.
What?
What "what"?
Like you remember every patient that comes through here.
Hey, Pratt, you guys got a hyponatremic for me?
Yep. She's altered
and her electrolytes are out of whack
after gastric bypass.
Curtain four. She's almost ready.
Dr. Morris, the broken leg kid is ready to go,
and the crackhead in two won't keep his gown on.
The broken leg kid can be discharged.
What about the crackhead?
I don't know. Avert your eyes.
What do you want from me?
Everybody, this is Javier. New desk clerk.
Hola.
Javier, this is... everybody.
SAM: Wow. MORRIS: Nice feather.
The next person
who says a word is dead meat.
(stifled laughter)
Mr. Grant has right flank pain times three days.
Did you fall, injure your back?
No, but I'm a building super.
I'm bent over all day fixing stuff.
Never bothered me before, though.
Any allergies or medical conditions?
Anything make the pain better or worse?
No, I just can't get comfortable, you know?
I have a little pain in my groin, too.
He had hematuria yesterday.
Any fever?
No.
Well, sounds like a kidney stone.
Oh, no, sweetcakes, our trip.
Our 20th anniversary's next week.
Well, you should be fine by then.
We'll give you something for the pain
while we do some tests to confirm.
GRANT: Okay. Be right back.
Thanks.
What's your plan? Morphine.
With an NSAID, prostaglandin inhibitors
block the ureteral spasm of renal colic.
Labs?
Uh, just UA to rule out infection.
CT KUB, no contrast.
Got it.
And by the way, I love what you've done with...
Shut up, Grady.
Two more.
Okay, go.
45-year-old male, renal colic
waiting for CT,
and our diarrhea and fever guy's better after hydration.
Ready to fly.
You get a stool culture? Yep.
C-diff? Yep.
You all set for the yearbook pictures later?
Bite me.
(laughs)
So, uh, how we feeling, Mr. Archibald?
Better, thanks.
Films are back.
Okay, good.
Well, you got no fracture, but you got
complete loss of joint space bilaterally.
Add a sed rate and a rheumatoid factor.
Copy that.
What's all that mean?
It means you got bad arthritis in your hip joints.
All your cartilage is gone.
Basically, you got bone grinding on bone.
Tell me something I don't already know.
Actually, I'm surprised you can still walk.
How the heck do you manage the pain?
Take little steps. Just tough it out, I guess.
Well, we can help you with that.
Plus I'm gonna refer you to the orthopedics clinic.
There's a good chance that you might need
a hip replacement.
Yeah, that's what they told me when I was up there last time.
Can't afford the insurance or the surgery.
How old did you say you were again?
59. Too young for Medicare.
Frank, can I help you with something, man?
Could I please have an autograph, Mr. Archibald?
My pleasure.
Been years since anyone asked me for one of these.
I used to be from Cleveland.
The only reason I became a Miami fan
is 'cause you got traded down there.
I appreciate that.
Who's this to?
Frank. F-R-A-N-K.
Uh-huh.
What, you never heard of Wild Man Willy Archibald?
He was great. Ate quarterbacks alive.
Run it up the middle, you can forget that.
You played pro ball, huh?
Ten years.
They don't make 'em like you anymore.
Thanks a lot.
No, no, thank you.
Holy mother of God, is that what I think it is?
Super Bowl Eight-- it was a long time ago.
You got three sacks in that game.
PRATT: Well, I'll let you two reminisce.
And I'll be back to talk to you some more
about that clinic referral.
FRANK: What was it like playing for Shula?
Oh, my God, my cousin used
to live in the Ninth Ward.
Get out of here!
I can't. I'm serious.
Dr. Pratt,
GYN has a bed
but they can't take your P.I.D. for two hours.
Two? She's been down here for six.
That was my old 'hood.
DAWN: Small world.
Telling you.
Dr. Pratt, can you hand me that chart?
What, your arms broken?
I just got my nails done.
Oh, don't worry, girl, I got it.
Those tips look fierce on you.
Thank you, baby.
You're welcome.
(both laugh)
Hey, Tony.
Hey. Hey, listen,
keep the NS running at 150 an hour till I get up there, okay?
You're back.
Yep, first day.
Every time I think I'm out,
they pull me back in.
Well, you look good. How you feel?
Ask me at the end of my shift.
Thanks for the flowers and the get well card.
Least I could do.
So how's, uh... how's Ray?
Oh, as far as I know, he's good, you know, all things considered.
He sent me a letter last week.
Send him my best, huh, Mayday?
Hey, are you ever gonna tell me why you call me that?
Mayday? She was my favorite Bond girl.
Grace Jones in A View To A Kill.
Started off as a bad guy,
then she saved the whole world.
Hey, you're lucky. Could have been Pussy Galore.
I'll see you later.
Yo, Gates.
Bards, what's up, man?
I haven't see you. Where you been?
Eh, stuck up in the ICU.
So, dude, what's up with your boy?
Pratt's brother Chaz.
Why, what'd he do?
You didn't hear?
Wow! Love the 'do, Sam-- looks good on you.
Thank you. Just a little somethin'.
Angie's good, huh? Yeah. I wish I would've known
about her when I went brunette-- I could've saved 200 bucks.
Find anybody who remembers her kid yet? No, not a soul.
She's taking me later-- I'm getting my pretty boy on
for my last night with Hope.
I ordered the works package-- I can't wait.
Gonna take more than the works to save that mug of yours.
Oh, my God, so mean!
That's his baseline-- you'll get used to it.
I hope not. Hey, guys.
Care package for Ray. Whatever you want me
to send, just put in here by the end of the day.
Oh, that's really thoughtful, Katey.
How is he? Oh, pretty incognito.
I think I'm gonna go see him in a couple of weeks.
Well, look who it is!
PRATT: Ah, welcome back.
Hey, stranger! RASGOTRA: Hi, guys.
How you feeling?
Oh, a little...
sore, you know?
Oh, my God.
Hi. I know.
Just don't. I'll explain later.
Okay. Uh, well, I have a few things left at your place,
so I'll just come and pick everything up
tomorrow. Okay.
Stop looking at me like that.
(chuckles): I can't help it.
MORRIS: I think it looks good!
No, I'm serious-- Farrah was my favorite.
Yeah, mine, too. Same here.
I used to love that poster-- you know
the one I'm talking about-- the one with the red bathing suit.
Yeah, with the Mexican- blanket-thing background.
FRANK: We had that up in the locker room
at the precinct house-- I used to look
at that every day. Oh, did I have
some boyhood fantasies about her!
God, she was hot! This is totally
creeping me out. You and me both.
I'll be in the ladies' room if anyone needs me. I'll walk with you.
Hey, Frank, would you please get the lab results for Mr. Archibald?
Hey, Pratt, can I talk to you a second?
What's up, Gates?
Uh, well, don't you think you should've told me about your brother?
I mean, not that it would've made a difference--
I still would've sponsored him--
but, uh, would've been nice if you said something.
What are you talking about now?
He's gay.
Yeah? So what?
Oh. You interested?
Come on, Greg. Come on, Greg, what?
Now, what exactly was I supposed to say?
I don't know, "My brother's gay"?
Okay, and then what would you have done?
Something, gave him some advice.
Really? Like what?
I don't know, you know,
but now his whole station's on to it, you know?
I could've done something before, made it easier on him.
I don't know, I'm just saying.
Just say your way back up to the ICU,
and mind your own damn business.
Lab results for Mr. Willie Archibald.
(groans quietly)
(sighs)
Mr. Archibald, listen to me.
I cannot help you unless you talk to me.
Now, what is it?
Percocet? Demerol?
Heroin?
Hell, no.
I don't mess with that stuff.
It's Vicodin.
(sighs)
Where'd you get the prescription?
My mom gets it for me.
She's on Medicare.
I can't afford that stuff on $7.50 an hour.
Mr. Archibald...
You don't know how I feel!
I can barely walk,
it hurts so much.
Got laid off 'cause I couldn't patrol a damn warehouse.
So I get a messenger job-- figure I can still drive, right?
Now I can barely do that.
How long have you been on the Vicodin?
(groans softly): Years.
I need three, four a day.
It used to knock me out, but it doesn't do that anymore.
Mr. Archibald, painkillers are very, very addictive.
What the hell you want me to do, Doc?
Soon my mom is gonna be driving me around.
She's 80, man.
Alright. I can get you on a surgery list here.
It's free of charge. I'm on the damn list.
It's a 18-month wait.
A private hospital would take you tomorrow
if you had the money.
Are you saying that you have absolutely no assets?
Just the house I bought my mom.
And I'm not selling that.
(exhales): Well, I can't allow you
to keep popping Vicodin like it's candy.
I'll, uh, see what I can do
to get get you bumped up on the county list.
(sighs)
Here.
It's worth a lot.
It's real diamonds and gold.
Maybe someone'll take it as a payment for the surgery.
Put it up on that eBay or something.
Mr. Archibald, I cannot...
Please, Doc...
I can't live with this pain any longer.
Please.
(sniffles)
(cell phone rings)
Hello?
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Wh-What happened?
Is he okay?
Where are you?
Alright, I'm on my way.
GRADY: Dr. Lockhart,
I really need...
Ask Pratt.
He told me to ask you.
Hey, Abby, what's up with your foot lac in two?
It's not gonna suture itself.
TANYA (sobbing): He... he...
He fell! He just... GRADY: You told me to be persistent
and that's what I'm trying to do Give him to me, give him to me.
Come on. Oh, God.
Get the door.
Get the door!
MARY: Excuse me, have you seen our doctor?
Ma'am someone'll be right with you. She said she'd be right back.
I got the pedes cuff. Oh, God, come on, baby, wake up, please.
Pupils are equal and reactive. How far did he fall?
From the bridge part of the jungle gym. How many feet?
I don't know, maybe six.
Spontaneous resps, but have that bag ready.
Did he just move? Morris, did you see that? He sure did.
Extremities look good. Okay.
Come on, Joe, come on, Joe, open your eyes.
He's gonna be Alright, isn't he? We don't know yet.
Got a BP-- 78/42.
Did he move or cry or anything?
No. Sats 98. Three-centimeter lac
in the forehead. I'll set up to irrigate.
Did he... did he fall on his head?
I don't know. I didn't see.
What do you mean, you didn't see?
Were you watching him? I mean, that's your job,
isn't it? I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's alright.
You should just go.
Oh, please, I want to stay.
I'll let you know how he is. Abby,
we're gonna do everything, okay?
He's gonna get the best that we got.
So, you sure you got everything?
Yeah. Let's get out of here.
Hey, not so fast, speedy-- we got a few things
to discuss before you leave.
It's Johns Hopkins.
Something went wrong, I didn't get in.
I anticipated this. Relax, I...
faxed your consent forms-- and I warned them about you, you little card shark.
I got a guy over there who's gonna win my money back.
Texas Hold 'Em isn't your game.
Alright, I got some news.
Good news, bad news-- what do you want first?
Bad. I like to end on an up.
Alright, well, the bad news is,
you can't go home and pack for Baltimore--
there's something you have to do.
And the good news is a surprise.
What is it?
Well, if I tell you, it'll kind of ruin
the whole surprise element, wouldn't it?
Don't worry, you're gonna love it.
Y-You're in on this, too? Alright, enough yakking.
Let's go, come on, we got stuff to do.
Look out! Clear out!
FRANK: It's too bad they don't take better care of the old guys.
You know, if it wasn't for guys like Willie Archibald
putting their bodies on the line,
there wouldn't be an NFL-- it's a damn shame.
It's a damn shame he didn't save some of that money.
Hey, a guy was lucky to make 35 G's a year back then,
not like these multimillion-dollar clowns today,
half of 'em crybabies and criminals.
May I hold it?
Yeah.
Wow.
You know, I heard Ditka himself
auctioned off his NFC Championship ring,
help out some of the old players.
This is priceless.
This is earned with sweat and blood
in the trenches of the gridiron.
You can't sell it.
Dr. Pratt, chemo-boy pulled his central line.
He's bleeding all over curtain four.
And there's a rig ten minutes out. Alright.
(sighs)
(sighs)
(distant crying)
Hey, how's Joe? You know, I can get somebody else
to take that rig that's coming in if you need me in there.
Woke up crying, purposeful movements.
Morris has got him.
(Joe crying loudly) Hey, I brought two gowns in case he throws up again.
Six-oh nylon... Luka, hi, it's me...
Um, Joe, uh, fell and, uh, hit his head in the park today.
But he's awake now, we're at the hospital.
(loud crying continues) He, um...
Um, could you just call me as soon as you get this message?
Bye. It's okay, Abby-- he'll call you back.
(crying continues)
Could you hold his head still?
Wait, wait, what are you doing, what are you doing?
Closing the lac. Shh. No. I'll do it.
He's an intern. Yeah, who knows how to Dermabond the laceration.
No, I know, I know, but what if it gets infected or he gets
a big, giant scar-- you want to be responsible for that?
Better me than you.
You sure about that?
He's right, Abby.
Alright, Chuny, call CT, let 'em know
we're on our way up. No. No CT.
We agreed we'd just observe.
Yeah, before he vomited.
Yeah, no, it's too much radiation-- no one knows
the long-term effects.
Morris,
we over-CT kids.
We've had this discussion a thousand times. Yeah, LOC,
vomiting-- you know he needs a scan.
His vitals are good, his mental status is fine,
the LOC was transient-- observation is enough.
It's not a head bleed-- the mechanism just isn't there.
Okay, if this was your patient and not your son, what would you do?
(crying continues)
Alright, no peeking. (laughs): I'm not.
You better not be. Okay, you ready?
I was ready a half hour ago.
Alright, take your hands down.
(laughs)
Look at this-- front row, third-base line,
right behind the on-deck circle.
You can't afford those tickets on your salary.
It's not how much you make, my young friend,
it's who you know.
We'll have him in and out as soon as we can.
I'll stay and give you an immediate read. Thanks.
No I.V.? He was doing so good, we didn't think we needed one.
We should get one in so we can get started.
Usually a little whiff of ketamine does the trick.
Yeah, um, I-I don't want to sedate him.
It's only gonna take a few seconds, right?
I've scanned a lot of toddlers-- trust me, you want the drugs.
I can do it in one needle stick, Abby, I promise.
No. Hypoventilation, drug allergies--
it's just not worth the risk. You know, we can't
get a good look unless he holds completely still.
(crying continues) Yeah. Can you, uh, pass me that? Shh.
Thank you.
I just... I just want to try something, okay?
Shh, shh. There you go.
And if it doesn't work, you can sedate him.
Just let me try, okay?
Okay. Hey, look. Look at this.
Yeah. And this one, too.
(crying stops) And what about this?
(gasps)
(whispers): Remember this book?
Daddy Takes a Trip.
Huh?
(gasps): "This is me
when I was your age, Joe."
What do you think? Do you...
(gasps): What's that?
"This is me and your Uncle Niko.
We love the beach."
Do you see them on the beach, right there?
(machine humming)
(gasps): Who's that? Who's that?
"This is me,
your dad, missing you, wishing you were here."
These seats are exceptional.
I've never sat this close before.
You're welcome. Man...
Excuse me. You Josh?
Stand up.
Yeah, this is Josh.
I'm Tony Gates. How you doing? Nice to meet you.
Josh Lipnicki. Hey, Josh.
His mom, Serena. Hi. Hi.
Derrek Lee.
This is for you, buddy.
The whole team signed it.
Thanks, Mr. Lee.
Good luck in Baltimore.
Mr. Lee...
Yeah?
You know, I got to tell you,
your opponents have a statistical tendency
to pitch you high and outside.
And the wind's blowing out today,
so if you lay off that stuff
you'll murder 'em.
Alright, I'll keep that in mind.
I don't know what to say.
That's a first.
Pretty cool, huh?
Yes, this definitely qualifies as cool.
Nice.
(murmuring)
No answer?
Well, by the time you reach him
all you're going to have is good news.
You know, I thought the NICU was tough.
At least both of us were there.
When he was brand new, I didn't even know him yet.
But now he's... he's Joe.
BETTINA: Okay, so Abby...
What?
There's no subdural, no epidural,
the grey-white junctions
and sulci look sharp, and there's no evidence
of diffuse axonal injury.
That's good, right?
But?
There is a subtle high-density irregularity
in the left parietal region.
It's small,
and it could be nothing,
but since it correlates with the location of his injury
I think we're obliged to check it out with an MRI.
So after all this, we have to sedate him anyway?
We need him still for at least 45 minutes.
I know. We'll take him
back down to the ER. We'll have Chuny start the I.V.
She's the best needle stick in town.
I want LMX cream.
TAGGART: Okay, I'll put it on now--
give it time to work.
He's got an 18 gauge in the right antecubital fossa,
got 40 of lasix en route.
Alright, we got it.
Make yourself useful and go refill the airway box, rookie.
Hey, come hit me later, we gotta talk.
BP 194/126.
So CHF exacerbation.
He already got lasix. What's next?
Afterload reduction? Nitro drip?
Hey! Hey, man, what the hell is this? You got something
you want to say to me? I thought you might like them.
You can wear them for your boyfriend.
Man, I swear to God, I'll beat your punk ass into next week!
I'm right here, rook, come on. Let's go, huh?
You alright? I'm fine.
Geez, I was just kidding around.
Greg, can you get out of here? What?
Get out of here, man. I'm fine.
(crying)
I always open up a second kit.
That way I'll never need it, you know?
Here 's your flush. Shh.
I hate this.
I'll make it quick.
Shh, shh.
Okay, ¿listo, Joe?
No pasa nada, mi amor. No pasa nada.
Come on, baby.
Oh, God, I don't think I can watch this.
You don't have to be in here, you know.
I know, but I don't want to desert him.
You won't be the first mom that can't watch, Abby, you know that.
We can go right next door. I'll sit with you, okay?
Listen, baby, I love you.
(crying continues)
(wailing)
(crying continues)
(sighs)
MARQUEZ: It's okay. It's okay, baby.
I remember when Alex was three...
We went to one of those bounce houses at the carnival.
And of course he's in there with a bunch
of five and six-year-old kids,
so he gets knocked down, right?
Every time he goes to get up he gets knocked down again.
And he's crying, "Mommy! Mommy!"
And the attendant won't let me in because
he thinks I'm some stupid teenager, right?
So, what'd you do?
I stood there and I cheered him on.
And every time he got knocked down
I told him, "I know you can get up."
But that's when it hit me.
They fall. (crying continues)
And all you can do is be there and hope they keep getting up.
(crying continues) MARQUEZ: Shh, shh.
(sighs)
Just keep some ice on it, okay?
You should be fine.
I was just breaking the kid's balls, you know?
It was a joke. Jokes are supposed to be funny.
Come back in a few days and I'll check your eye out again.
Hey, I got empty chairs in there.
Come on, who's up for some pampering?
It's not really my style.
End of my shift, I am there, Ange.
How about you, huh?
I could wax those brows-- make you look ten years younger.
You should do it.
It's like you've got two caterpillars over your eyes.
No, thank you.
Unlike the rest of you good-for-nothings
I'm not vain about my appearance.
Well, that must make it easier.
How'd you get this bum wing, Reggie?
Fell out of my desk.
He dozed off at school.
Fell out of his desk during math.
He hasn't been sleeping well at home.
He's afraid the boogeyman's going to get him. Baby!
Tommy. Does this hurt?
Boogeyman, huh?
You know there's no such thing, buddy.
I've seen him. You've seen him?
What does he look like?
He's green... big eyes, crazy hair.
Oh. Well, no point tenderness. He's got full range of motion.
I don't think it's broken. And why didn't you say
it was a green boogeyman in the first place?
I got something that will fix that right up.
Dr. Morris, kidney stone guy in Curtain 2 doesn't look so good.
Okay, I'll be right back, buddy.
What kidney stone guy? Abby's patient.
Gross hematuria, dropped his pressure, diaphoretic.
Where's my doctor?
BP 80/50.
MARY: What's wrong? He was fine.
Did he get narcotics?
Five milligrams of morphine three hours ago.
Bolus a liter of saline.
What are his labs?
They only sent a UA.
My back... Stat hemocue, chemistry and EKG.
Are those films?
Yeah, Abby didn't see them.
Dr. Lockhart said it was just a kidney stone and he'd be fine.
Uh, hello, ma'am, I'm Dr. Morris.
I'm afraid a kidney stone isn't the problem. What?
Get surgery down here right away.
Surgery? He needs surgery?
Your husband has a mass in the kidney.
A mass like a tumor?
Hemocue 8.1.
Too soon to say, but maybe.
Type and cross two units.
Oh, my God, she said he was okay.
(groaning)
(machine clanging)
Like I said, the program is free of charge.
It meets three times a week here at the hospital.
If you can commit to that, get weaned off the Vicodin
then we can do this.
I don't know, Doc.
What if the procedure don't work?
It will. Just promise me you'll lay off the pills.
Okay, deal.
What do I got to do?
I pulled some strings.
Ortho bumped you higher on the list for a hip replacement.
But for now we're going to put a needle
into your joint under X-ray guidance.
Come on, I'll help you.
Yeah, team docs used to stick us all the time.
This isn't quite the same.
What we're going to do is something called
an intra-articular injection.
We put in a long-acting anesthetic and steroid,
it kills the pain for a month.
Damn.
And if you don't get your surgery by then,
you come back in, we do it all over again.
Cool?
Thanks, Doc.
You're welcome.
Now I just need you to sign here to consent.
Alright. Now let's get you on your side so I can prep you.
Come on.
(groans)
I just got to let you know
that there's a very small chance of bleeding and infection.
But the benefits far outweigh the risks.
Is it going to hurt?
No, we numb the skin up first.
Hey. Hey there.
How many of these have you done before?
Oh, I'm not doing this, she is.
Hello, Mr. Archibald.
I'm Doctor DeJesus.
Well, in that case you may have to leave the room, Doc.
Pressure's 75/40.
Call for another two units.
No, no, sweetie... there's so much blood...
MORRIS: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Dawn, take her in the Family Room, please.
Is it blunt trauma?
No, renal mass eroding into the vessels.
Hemorrhaging around his kidney.
Yeah, we know. He needs surgery.
Central line kit, please.
Crit's dropping despite transfusions.
He doesn't need a central line, he needs the OR.
Wait. Hang a unit of FFP. If we keep sitting on him he's going to crash.
What's your plan, Neela? 5 French femoral sheath, please.
I'm going to inflate the angioplasty balloon in the renal artery.
If I cut off the blood supply to his kidney,
get his pressure up, he'll have a much better chance
of success in the OR.
Ballsy. Or stupid.
MORRIS: Okay, let's call
for a C-arm.
Neela, you're up.
(fans cheering)
Whoo!
(cheering)
You're a good luck charm.
RASGOTRA: The guide wire's in the femoral artery.
Excellent.
Advancing a six-millimeter balloon.
Last hemoglobin is 8.5.
Dropping, he's losing more blood.
Not for long. Morris, can you inflate the balloon, please?
Yeah.
Looks good.
Okay, fluoro off.
Could've done a nephrectomy by now.
Or he could've had an MI, or a stroke because he was too unstable for surgery.
DAWN: Pressure's up, 95 over 60.
Best it's been.
Rasgotra shoots and scores. Nice job.
Move him up to the OR, I'll be right up.
Have the blood bank
stay ahead four units.
You got lucky.
So this is about the patient,
is it?
You know...
when Ray got hurt, I was in a lot of shock.
We all were.
Poor you.
What happened to Ray had nothing to do with me.
He's the one that got piss drunk at Abby's wedding.
He's the one who stumbled in front of that truck, not me.
Even he says that.
You done?
You know, you can hate me as much as you like.
I couldn't care less. But I will not take the blame
for what happened to Ray, have you got that?
So how's he doing?
He's just coming out of it.
How about you?
I've been better.
(sniffles)
Talk to Luka yet?
You know, it's totally different when it's your kid on the table.
And it would be a lot easier if I wasn't doing this alone.
Baby Joe's gonna be just fine.
And you are not alone.
(door opens)
TAGGART: I just got this from Betina.
She apologized for not coming down.
Normal parenchymal tissue.
No blood or edema.
Okay.
PRATT: What'd I tell you? (chuckles)
God!
No, really, I feel much better.
I just... I have to be there when he wakes up.
I understand.
Oh, God, what if it's malignant?
One thing at a time.
Let's get him through the operation first.
I'll take you upstairs.
The surgeons will answer all your questions.
We missed a six-centimeter mass?
You can't catch everything.
Dr. Morris, that thing was gigantic.
Was that my kidney stone patient's wife?
Uh... yeah. Yeah, I think so.
I've got some charts I should go finish.
Where is he?
Who?
Oh, uh, well, he needed surgery.
What?
No, it's nothing. We caught it.
Morris! Don't worry about it.
What, you don't have enough on your plate today?
Morris, what is it? Come on.
Probable renal cell carcinoma.
Oh, my God.
Abby, Abby, that guy's tumor was not your fault.
Okay? We're not even sure if it's malignant.
I told him he was gonna be fine.
Well, we handled it!
We're a team.
We back each other up.
Now go home, get some rest.
Take care of your boy.
Don't beat yourself up over this.
See you later.
Bye. Thanks for everything.
Bye, sweetie.
Thank you.
20 minutes and I will be in the capable hands of Angie,
upgraded to the premium package.
What are you doing?
Oh, it's for a kid I got who can't sleep.
Chronic boogeyman problem.
MARQUEZ: So you're giving him candy? No.
Well, yes, but he doesn't know that it's candy.
I'm gonna tell him it's boogeyman repellant.
Genius, right? It's a lie.
Sam, let me tell you about a little thing that we like to call
the placebo effect.
They look like M&Ms.
Yeah, yeah, they do that
to cover up the taste.
The methyl chloride anti-noxazine
is very bitter in pure form. Ech!
It tastes like M&Ms, too.
Cool, huh?
Whoa, whoa. No, never take more than two,
right before you brush your teeth.
Okay, there's a three-week supply there,
so make 'em last.
Thanks, Dr. Morris.
You bet.
Just hang for a little while longer.
We'll get you guys moving out as soon as we can.
Hi, uh, it's me again.
(sighs) Um...
I still don't know where you are.
Maybe you're at the hospital.
Uh, I hope everything's okay.
But Joe is fine.
The MRI was clear,
so you can just ignore all my other panicked messages.
Um, we're on our way home.
We'll be there in about 20 minutes, so call us. Bye.
(horn honks, tires screech)
MAN: You stupid bitch!
What's the matter with you?!
You could have killed us!
(Joe crying)
Hey, guys.
Hey, Pratt. Excuse me.
What's going on?
Excuse me, Dr. Pratt. Yep?
Is your brother single?
You're gonna have to check with him.
(both chuckle)
Good night.
Good night.
And I will.
MORRIS: See you tomorrow, buddy.
Morris?
Yeah.
What are you doing back there?
I'm getting my treatments.
You should really stay and have something done.
No, I'm good. You take it easy.
Suit yourself.
Oh, hey, Dr. Moretti, welcome back.
How was the conference?
Oh, you know, the EM Research Symposium
is no mere conference, Dr. Pratt.
It is a magical week where some
of the greatest research minds in the country get together
to exchange ideas and knowledge and...
Big waste of time, huh?
Yeah.
Oh, hey...
your boy Gates picked up
Von Willebrands on a trauma patient.
ICU must be doing him some good.
Always a pleasure talking to you.
(sighs)
Hey.
So where's your partner?
Lunch.
Chaz, why you ignore me, man?
You really don't know?
You made me look like a bitch, Greg.
What?
I don't need you to fight my battles.
I can take care of myself.
Come on, man, it wasn't even like that.
How you gonna sit there and try to tell me what it's like?
Do they call you faggot here?
Do they, do they
whistle at you in the shower, too?
Listen, I just reacted, man.
I saw my little brother getting pushed around
and a switch flipped.
Come on, man, you know what I'm saying. You're my family.
I know you probably thought you were helping,
and I appreciate it,
but if my big brother the doctor comes to the rescue,
then they're gonna respect you.
If I stand up for myself, then they're gonna respect me.
You're right.
Whatever you need, man.
I got you.
Hey...
Dr. Morris, the asthmatic in Exam Two dropped his sats.
I think he needs a tube.
Coming!
(man panting)
It's okay, sir. The doctor's coming.
Start continuous albuterol, solumedrol 125.
It's ready.
Sats down to 89.
.1 milligram epi I.V., then infuse a milligram over an hour.
(screaming) You don't want to tube him?
Reg!
It's okay! Reg!
What's the matter, buddy?
You e-mail me from Baltimore.
Let me know how it goes, alright?
Yeah, I'm sure a lot of needle sticks
and a huge supply of tests.
You'll be fine.
Fly safe.
Yeah, I hope they let me on the plane
with a week's worth of urine samples.
(chuckles)
Go on and pack, sweetie.
We leave early.
Hey, thanks for today, Tony.
I had a great time.
My pleasure, buddy.
I don't know how to thank you.
I haven't see him that happy in so long.
It was nothing.
No, it was most definitely something.
I'll probably be up packing all night.
I better go home.
I have an early shift tomorrow.
Will you keep me posted?
Yeah, I will.
Good night, Tony.
(loud clattering)
(beeps)
Hi, Abby, this is Sally in Dr. Murphy's office.
Just a reminder that you have an appointment
with the hygienist Friday at 9:00 a.m.
(phone rings)
Hello?
No, no, yeah.
No, I'm not interested.
(hangs up)
(wine pouring)
