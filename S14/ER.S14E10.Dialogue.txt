Previously on ER:
Would it be okay if I stopped by the apartment?
Yeah, sure, uh, I think you've
got some stuff left in the hall closet.
KOVAC: Where have you been?
I was worried.
TAGGART: I wanted to say thanks
for suggesting I look into the transport program.
I'm going for it.
You're one of those smart girls, aren't you?
You've only just noticed?
LOCKHART: Why do you do that? KOVAC: Do what?
Drink in front of me. I mean, you never once asked me
was that okay with me or did that bother me or was that...
You used to have a problem. You're much better now.
My father died.
Luka!
Is the stroller in the car?
No, it's down here in the living room.
Can we carry it on the plane?
Uh, no, we're going to have to check it at the gate.
KOVAC: "And all through the house not a creature was stirring,
not even a mouse."
(speaking Croatian)
Mouse, huh?
Okay.
Okay, the flight is at 10:00 tonight, right?
I'm just gonna run
a couple errands-- dry cleaners, the bank.
It shouldn't take very long.
No, no, sweetheart, you stay here with Daddy, okay?
Let Daddy finish the book. Joe, let's go
look at the tree, huh?
Help me count how many Santas we got here.
You okay?
Yeah, are you?
Yeah.
I'll be back. I'll be back in an hour or two.
Okay? Bye.
I saw Frosty The Snowman on TV last night.
It's December 6. Yeah, I know.
You know, by the time the Yuletide actually gets here,
you're already sick of it. We work for the County
which means they all got to get equal time.
Christmas, Hanukkah, Kwanzaa.
Why can't people agree on one date and be done with it?
Damn, what a messed-up board! Messed-up floor.
It's like Calcutta around here.
Calcutta on a bad day.
We signed 142 on the night shift.
That's a new record. Must be proud.
I'm too tired to go home.
I'm gonna sleep in the call room.
Poor kid's a zombie.
142, huh?
Wait, we keep this thing cranking,
we could hit 300. Yeah, right.
Yeah, that'd be quite a milestone. Forget it.
We've never had over 250 in a 24-hour period.
Dare to dream big, Frank.
We'd have to sign in, what?
14 patients an hour for the next 12 hours.
It's never gonna happen. I bet you 300 bucks
we hit that mark by the end of this shift.
Too rich for me. No, no, no.
You guys could split it.
Yeah, put up a hundred each against my three.
I'm in. Oh, Lord, when is he gonna learn?
Looks like I'm gonna be able to get the wife
that newfangled toaster she's been hinting for.
Frank, you romantic fool. Mm-hmm.
Admin sent this down.
Oh, put that by Trauma.
New portable CT scanner.
That's the holiday gift for the ER.
In lieu of the lovely T-shirts we normally get.
Oh, too bad. I love those shirts.
Hey, guys. Everybody see my memo?
Oh, I saw your memo.
What memo? What memo?
I'm going around to all the departments
and I'm doing blessing ceremonies and memorials.
And today is the ER's turn.
Well, you know, that sounds nice and very, uh... cleansing,
but no, we're going to be pretty busy.
No, it's not really our thing.
Why don't you try Oncology?
They love all that touchy-feely crap.
Come on, guys, this could be cool.
Enlightening, gratifying.
Don't shoot the kid down.
How open-minded of you, Dr. Gates.
Thank you. I do my best, Miss Dupree.
Good. So I'll see you all later.
Are you and her, uh...?
Wait a second.
Are you banging the chaplain?
TAGGART: Pratt, hey, Pratt?
Yeah? Melissa Tanner, 61,
restrained driver of moderate velocity,
TC and respiratory distress.
Look at you. You're on the chopper today, huh?
Logging hours, part of my transpo training.
She's getting unresponsive.
What's this scar on her chest? Looks like she had
a thoracotomy; stats are dropping.
All right, here we go. Hundred percent non-rebreather,
and portable chest, here you go.
Morris? MORRIS: What do we got here?
That's her son, Lowell.
Down's Syndrome, facial lacs, a few contusions.
Found walking on the scene.
Is Mommy okay? Yeah, we're helping her now, Lowell.
Need me, Morris? No, I got this. Push some charts.
Harold?
Who you supposed to be, Merlin?
I need a ladder, out in the bay.
You need a ladder for what?
Holy cow, is that what I think it is?
It's not a cow, no.
What's going on?
RASGOTRA: We had a dress rehearsal for a hospital holiday pageant.
DUBENKO: Surgery drew the Nativity scene.
Congratulations.
And this, uh, camel they got from somewhere
bit Lucien on the leg.
Well, why the hell did you bring it here?
Oh, we were just down the street.
Well, we need to take a culture.
You need a shave.
There might be an exotic organism
that needs targeted therapy, so...
All right, let's give this a shot.
Here, my dad raised horses.
Allow me.
Okay, buddy.
This won't hurt.
Just a little bit.
No, this'll be easy, come on.
Whoa.
Whoa, I'll get it. I'll get it.
Ho!
Hey, just...
She's not a cooperative animal.
All right.
Just... all right.
Come here. All right.
You know what? I'm staring to think this is not such
a good idea. We've got to get a swab, Tony.
(sighs): All right.
Easy there, big fella.
(phone rings)
Oh, Harold, can you grab my phone from my back pocket?
Sure thing.
DUBENKO: We'll still have noon conference, Neela.
I made need you to make that fat
embolus presentation without me.
You have it on your laptop, right?
"Missed call: Abby."
Yeah, but I left it at home. Okay, well, you'll go home
after morning rounds and get it.
Sorry about this.
Hey, Neela, I left a message on your cell.
Um, I was just wondering if you were home right now.
Um, Luka's father died and we're flying to Croatia tonight.
And I left a few things in the closet,
so I thought I'd just come by and pick 'em up.
All right, talk to you later.
Thanks for helping sell those guys on the ceremony.
Oh, I'll proselytize for you any day.
Nice to know I have an acolyte.
Pulse ox down to 84.
No pneumothorax. Any rib fractures?
I don't think so. Intubation tray.
TAGGART: Do you mind if I try?
Come on, I need ten supervised for my training.
No, no, Sam, this isn't a good teaching case.
Patent airway, it shouldn't be that tricky.
She's had thoracic surgery with lousy reserve.
Once we paralyze, every second counts.
Aw, come on, give Sam a try.
Here.
Suction.
20 of entomidate, hundred of sux.
MORRIS: Oh, guys, this is cool.
Hey, what's up with her kid?
Oh, just a few scratches.
Whoa, non-contrast scan in 15 seconds.
She's out.
Go, go.
How about we fire this baby up?
PRATT: Quiet, Morris!
Got it. Nice.
We're not radiating every patient
just because we got a new toy.
Good breath sounds.
HALEH: End tidal is yellow. All right, good,
let's call for a vent.
Hey, Morris, see if you can get
the history from her son.
Kid doesn't say much.
I talked to him on the chopper.
Call for a portable chest.
Okay, 151, 152, 153.
What are you doing? Just tracking the census.
Sam, how's my mommy?
She's doing better, Lowell.
We're helping her breathe right now.
Do you know if your mom takes any medicine?
Lots of pills.
She's sick.
Do you remember when she had an operation?
How about the name of her doctor?
It's okay.
The husband's number was in her wallet, so I'll call him.
Going to call my dad?
Mm-hmm.
Continuous NG, recheck lights in two hours,
write the order, then go get your PowerPoint file.
I will do. I'm going to be upstairs in my office
while my anti-camel drip kicks in.
Frank, I'm running home for a bit.
I should be about half an hour.
Dr. Zelinsky will start with any consult orders you might need.
You mean Harold. Mm-hmm.
Please hurry back. The husband of the woman
we choppered in is on his way here. Okay.
Hey, Sam.
You coming to my s√©ance?
Oh, I'm off shift; I'm pretty beat.
That's too bad.
Yeah, plus, to be honest,
my relationship with religion is kind of complicated.
So is mine.
But, you know, it's not exactly a "religious" ceremony.
Yeah, well, I was raised in a pretty strict household.
A lot of talk about "sin" and "damnation,"
And it never did that much for me.
Do you believe in God?
Some days, it's tough.
And other days?
And other days, I thank him for showing up.
Or her or whatever.
Well, if you change your mind
about our get-together, we'll be here.
Sam, I hear you've been riding rigs all over town.
You never asked me.
I go where they tell me, Zades.
Sure wish I could get
into that paramedic conference today.
What? Sternback's case review?
Yeah, I hear it's pretty interesting.
He goes through every tough ambulance run.
Yeah, you can learn a lot.
So, you coming or not?
Can you get me in?
I got connections. Let's go.
Yeah!
Hi.
Abby.
I didn't know you were coming over.
Yeah, I left you a couple messages. Oh.
No problem, I just need to pick up my computer.
You're watching TV?
Oh, yeah, I was just checking the weather.
What's going on?
I was running a few errands,
and I remembered there was a coat I left here
that I wanted to pick up.
And I had a drink.
You had a drink?
Yeah.
What are you doing?
Oh, geez...
You know what, just forget it.
I'm going to go. Abby.
Yeah, I'm just going to go, okay?
Is this what's been going on these last few weeks?
What? Is what?
What's been going on the past couple of weeks?
The way you've been acting, that night at Ike's,
how far away you've seemed? I mean, that time you asked to come over here...
You know what, Neela? Sometimes you are such a child.
Stop it. I'm trying to help you.
Well, I don't need it, really.
You've got to stop this.
Think about Joe, think about Luka-- you have to...
And I really don't expect you
to even begin to understand this.
Well, if you love them, you'll do something...
"If I love them"?!
Please.
I'm your friend.
Are you really about to lecture me on love
with your track record?
Don't... Because I'm thinking right now
Ray is really wishing he didn't meet you.
You don't... live here anymore.
Get out!
(door slamming)
She has end-stage emphysema.
Used to smoke three packs a day.
She still tries to sneak one every now and then.
Yeah, we noticed the scar on her chest.
Yeah, she had, um, lung reduction surgery
about ten years ago.
It worked, I mean, it worked for a while.
But she's been on home oxygen 24/7 for almost a year now.
PRATT: We didn't realize.
We thought maybe her lungs were bruised in the collision.
No. She shouldn't have been driving.
She knows that.
I offered to hire a driver.
Well, the ventilator is helping her to breathe.
No, no, she's a DNR.
She does not want to be kept alive by a machine.
PRATT: Well, we can take off the support,
if that's what you and your son decide.
He didn't say anything about it.
My what?
Your son-- Lowell.
He's right there in the next room.
I-I don't know who that is.
ZADRO: So, you thinking of making a change?
Maybe.
Had enough, huh?
I don't know.
I was a traveler for a long time before I got to Chicago.
I've been a nurse at County for over four years now.
Kind of weird for me.
I used to be wired for change.
Whoa! Hold on!
SAM: Watch it!
(train rumbling)
(panting)
Hey, you okay, Sam?
Yeah. You?
I banged up my knee.
You all right?
I... think...
there's a kid...
Hey, Zadro!
Stay in the car.
WOMAN: Evie!
Hey, I'm a nurse. My name is Sam.
I'm going to help you, okay? Evie!
ZADRO: Hey, honey, what's your name? Oh, God!
Oh, God! Evie.
Evie. Where do you hurt, Evie?
Evie... Down there.
No obvious head trauma.
Did that car hit her?
I'm all right, Mom.
Where's Nina?
Who's Nina?
My dog. MOTHER: Is she okay?
She might have a broken bone in her pelvis,
but everything else seems good.
What about her neck?
ZADRO: She must have bruised it on the way down.
You breathing okay?
Yeah. ZADRO: Sats are good.
BP 118 over 76.
Hey! Stay there, sir!
MAN: Is that brother drunk?
I bet his dumb ass he's drunk.
WOMAN: Evie... MAN: Ain't nothing but liquor stores
and churches around here!
Hey, Sam, go check him. I'll call for backup.
Excuse me, coming through.
Hey, asshole.
You hit a kid, man. You been drinking?
Hey, come on, back off, okay?
You hit a little girl!
What is your name, sir?
Uh... Del.
Uh, Del, do you remember anything?
You know what happened?
When?
Here you go.
Oh, thank you.
Mind if I, uh...
No, no.
Thanks.
(sighs)
What's his name?
His name is Lowell.
Lowell.
Look, I'm sorry you had to find out this way.
That your wife had a kid with someone else.
Oh, no, no.
No, that wasn't it.
Melissa and I were... we were in our forties.
We thought we were past our...
having children time.
Then she got pregnant.
That was in 1983.
I knew something was wrong right away.
I could tell by the... the looks on the doctors' faces.
They told us about Down's syndrome.
We realized how hard it would be.
We weren't ready for it.
I convinced her
that it would be better...
that it would be... better for all of us.
What would?
Giving him up?
Do you know why he was in the car with her?
Hey, Pratt.
You seen Skye?
You should ask him.
Yeah.
Huh? What?
LOCKHART: She's not in her office.
She's not on today. What's up?
Uh, Luka's father passed away.
What? Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
Yeah. So, we're, uh, we're leaving for Croatia tonight.
I need to take a leave of absence,
I figured she's the one to talk to, right?
Hey, you okay? Yeah.
You sure? Yeah, I'm sure.
I mean, his father just died.
Give me a break. (sighs)
All right, well... fill out the paperwork.
And... I'll tell Skye about it.
Thanks.
A little oxygen in your nose.
Okay.
I think the girl stopped moving.
I saw her get hit; it was bad.
Think she could die? No.
You should go help with the girl.
Paramedics are with her. This jerk's so wrecked,
he feeling no pain.
He's concussed, he's not drunk.
Come on, that girl needs you more.
Hey! Why don't you back off
and let me do my work, okay?
Okay.
Give her some room.
Yeah. Thank you. We're cool. We're cool.
Hey! Oh! Oh, man!
Hey! Little drunk bitch!
SAM: Hey! Whoa!
Hey, Zadro!
Oh!
MAN: Whoa!
Frank, I need two more charts.
You're pathetic.
No, it's the funniest thing.
As I was getting my coffee,
I noticed that Conchita has carpal tunnel
from working the register.
Ay! Si me duele mucho.
Yeah, and Bheru, here, has a bad back from lifting heavy boxes.
I'm thinking... I slipped a disk.
Bring it on, Morris.
We haven't even hit 200.
Are you serious?
Give me your card and PIN number.
I'll save you a trip to the ATM.
It's not over till it's over, Frank.
A fool and his money are soon parted, Morris!
Labs are back, vitals are stable.
Well, everything... everything looks good.
No serious injuries, Lowell.
Mommy was taking me to a new place to live.
You know, your mom's not doing well.
She needs air.
She's getting sicker.
Mommy comes every Thursday.
But she's too sick now.
Is my dad here?
I-I heard he's coming.
Which one is he?
I can find out,
and I'll, I'll bring you to him.
No.
Oh, you... you don't want to meet him?
He didn't want me when I was a baby.
Uh, you know, dads can change their minds.
Really?
Really.
Yeah, my dad was kind of like your dad.
Did he change his mind?
I like to think he did.
Oh, hi, Abby.
Hi.
Sorry. Do you mind?
I have to... Yeah.
What are you doing?
You haven't heard?
We're doing a memorial and blessing ceremony.
Oh.
Who's bringing the Kool-Aid?
It's nothing scary, don't worry.
You should come, check it out.
Uh, no, I-I don't think so.
Oh, everyone could use a blessing now and then.
Or a memorial.
Abby, do I piss you off?
Excuse me?
I was wondering...
No, you don't piss me off.
I-I don't know... know you really.
Because if there was ever anything
you needed to talk about...
Why would I need that?
It's kind of why I'm here.
Okay.
You know, there's this story...
I know, I know.
Bear with me.
It's about this little boy who asks his mother,
"Do you think I can pick up that big rock over there?"
And she says, "Yes,
I'm certain you can lift it if you use all your strength."
So, he goes over and he tries to lift the rock.
He tries a bunch of times,
until finally, he says, "I couldn't do it."
So, she goes over there,
and together, they lift the rock.
Wow, that's great.
And she explains to him
that, sometimes, using all your strength means asking for help.
HALEH: The floor is under control; we got no incoming traumas.
MARQUEZ: Want us to round up the troops?
JULIA: Yeah. Let's get while the getting's good.
Ooh!
Sorry. Sorry.
Sorry, Neela. No, it's my fault.
My mind was somewhere else.
Ah, me too.
Um, I heard about your father.
I'm sorry. Thanks.
Yeah, just when I thought
he was out of the woods for awhile...
Have you seen Abby today?
Something the matter?
No. She was supposed to be home a while ago.
She must have gotten caught up with something here.
(siren whoops)
Yeah, maybe she got caught up with some work.
The names of those who passed on
while under our care.
We take time from our busy day to pay respect
to the mothers and fathers,
husbands and wives,
sisters and brothers,
sons and daughters,
who are no longer with us.
Think of one patient who's changed you in some way.
Hold them in your memory.
Were they inspiring?
Funny?
Courageous?
Did they challenge you?
Teach you something about yourself?
Were they searching for something?
Was their heart...
...filled with love?
As you hold them in your mind...
ask yourself which of their qualities
can become part of my life?
Sorry. Multiple trauma rolling in.
I waited as long as I could.
We'll finish this another time.
FRANK: I'll call the blood bank.
(all talking at once)
Blunt trauma, auto versus ped.
You said you'd be back an hour ago.
I didn't know where you were.
Well, here I am.
MORRIS: No way. Anatomy's distorted.
I thought her breathing was okay.
It was. Someone grab the fiber-optic scope.
I'll bag her up. Is there a problem?
MOTHER: What are you doing-- tell me.
Joyce... Maybe you should wait outside for now.
No, no, no, I need to be here.
Just give us a few minutes, okay?
You said it was a scratch.
There's more swelling in her throat.
So she can't breathe?
We're helping her.
Would you like to sit down?
Oh, my God... Oh, my God.
(sobbing): Oh, my God.
(crying)
My baby.
Oh, my God.
My baby's hurt.
You're Lowell's dad?
Yeah.
Have the balls to go in there.
LOCKHART: I don't know what to tell you.
Start with what's going on. Nothing!
If you don't want to come back
to Croatia with me, then say that.
No, that's not it. Then what?
It's just a lot to deal with, that's all.
Since I got back, you haven't seemed happy.
You avoid me; we've hardly touched each other.
Do you think I'm blind? Don't be ridiculous.
Am I?
Look, you were just gone... forever.
It was a lot of stress.
taking care of Joe and supporting us.
Supporting us...
Yeah, you weren't working, Luka.
There were bills to pay.
All we had was my resident's hours.
So you're mad I wasn't working?
No, that's not it-- no.
It's just hard for me to just turn it back on.
Turn what back on?
When... when did it turn off?
I know you.
I know when something's wrong.
Do you still love me?
Oh, my God! Of course I still love you.
Why would you even ask me that?
Why the hell do you think?
Just talk to me-- hey!
Look, I have to go and finish my leave request,
and then we'll go to Croatia
and then everything will be different.
Okay?
You can't just hide forever, you know.
You can't.
Hey. Wait.
I'll see you at home.
All I can see are arytenoid folds.
Sats are way down.
Okay, let's do a surgical airway.
She's too young to crike.
You want a formal trake? Prep the neck.
An open trake'll take too long. 20 minutes.
She doesn't have 20 minutes.
What about, uh, jet ventillation?
That requires a regulator. And a release valve.
By the time you get that from Central, she'll be traked.
I can do it with a nasal cannula.
Get out of here. It'll take me 30 seconds.
Fine. You have till we're gloved and gowned. Lost the pulse.
PEA. I'm starting compressions.
You're sure he-he, uh, wants to meet me?
He was asking the same question.
Will, uh...
Will you come in with me?
It's not a problem.
Someone's here to see you.
Hello.
My name is Pierce.
My name is Lowell.
Lowell.
Lowell...
I'm your father.
Nice to meet you.
SAM: Okay, Morris, steady the hub.
Nasal cannula at 15.
DUBENKO: Okay. Ten blade.
Suction.
When I cover the open prong,
she's gonna get a blast of oxygen.
Hold CPR.
That's hot.
SAM: One second on, four off.
Where'd you learn this?
Transport training.
Got a pulse.
Gates needs a surgeon now.
Yeah, I got it.
BP 10/60.
Big epidural.
She blew a pupil.
Heart rate's dropping.
Atropine. Two amps didn't touch him.
He needs O.R.
He'll never make it to the O.R. 70/50.
Dopamine. Hey, what about
a burr hole? We need a drill from upstairs.
Hold on-- he got kicked in the head with the toe of a boot.
Show me the bone windows. All right.
He's seizing. All right, four of Atavan.
You know it looks like a circular skull fracture.
RASGOTRA: Oh, brilliant. Prep for a cut-down.
Sorry your thing got interrupted.
Oh.
Life in the ER, I guess.
We'll finish later.
Why did you tell me that story before?
I like it.
And I thought you might, too.
Hey, Frank, did that fax come in yet for Melissa Tanner?
Greg, thanks for taking care of this thing with Skye for me.
Oh... let Luka know we're thinking about him.
Thanks.
Fax is right here on the chart.
That the DNR?
Yep.
No intubation, no CPR.
Is the husband comfortable honoring her wishes?
Yeah.
So, I guess we extubate.
And she's going to die in a few hours.
Lowell needs to understand that.
Doesn't seem right.
The kid's never had a real family.
And on the same day that they finally get together,
he's going to lose his mom.
Makes me want to call my folks.
(sighs)
You okay?
My mom died when I was a kid.
Breast cancer.
We were close...
and I lost her pretty early.
I don't even know why I'm even talking about this.
Must be that time of year, you know?
I'll go talk to them.
JARVIK: Heart rate's down 20.
(alarms blaring) All right, start pacing him.
You know he's going to arrest soon.
Elevating the fragment. Suction.
What the hell is all this?
Draining an epidural bleed.
You did a burr hole?
We didn't have to. Heart rate's 80. Bounding pulse.
(alarms quiet) Oh, mayday hits a three-pointer at the buzzer.
You people are crazy.
I'm going to go and help Dubenko with the trake.
I'll be right there.
Heard you were a seasoned pro out there today.
Oh, you would think that. I hit somebody.
How is that? How are you?
Uh, yeah, I've had worse.
Harold, what's next?
Chuny, I got this.
ZELINSKY: Uh, vertical incision
through the third and fourth.
You bitch!
Remember that girl you were so worried about?
Well, we're trying to save her now, jerk-off.
Yeah, well, they got plenty of doctors here.
You messed me up pretty good!
Hey, this is a sterile procedure, sir. Hey!
I need you to step back! Hey! Hey!
Get off me!
Get off me! Stay down!
Don't move!
Get off me! Don't move!
Not so tough now, are you?
Lowell, a long time ago,
your mom decided she didn't want
to be put on a breathing machine.
She wants to die?
Not exactly, no.
Son, living on the machine, she wouldn't...
she wouldn't be able to do things that she loved.
She... she wouldn't be able to visit you.
She's be stuck in the bed,
unable to walk or talk or eat.
She'd just get sicker and sicker.
Mommy...
...are you sure you don't want the machine?
She doesn't want it.
That means, in a little while,
we're going to pull out that tube.
Okay.
And she'll probably die not too long
after that.
(voice breaking): Could she get better?
I don't think so, Lowell.
But she might?
PIERCE: Well...
Lowell, we'll pray for that.
We'll pray for that.
Mommy...
you don't have to die today.
KOVAC: So, we're gonna go on the airplane.
Can you say airplane, huh?
(speaking Croatian)
Hey. Hey.
Huh? It's...
(speaking Croatian)
With the propeller, huh?
Yeah, put it here and go...
(imitates airplane engine)
Hmm?
Huh?
(speaking Croatian)
Where's Niko?
Uh, he went to buy a present for his wife.
Huh?
(speaking quietly, gently)
And are we ready to fly now?
Ready to fly... We're going to fly.
Where are we going to put Joe in the airplane?
Want a window seat? Huh?
Joe...
(kisses)
(kissing)
(sighs)
Luka, I need help.
(rain pattering outside)
I started drinking again.
When?
The night Joe got hurt.
And I...
I can't stop.
I thought when I came back,
we just needed to get used to being married again.
And then things didn't get better, and I thought...
So what do we do?
I need to fix it.
(sighs)
I need to go somewhere--
a facility with professionals--
and get better.
And I need to believe it this time,
and I need you to believe it.
And I need you to help me.
So...
So, take Joe...
go to Croatia for your father,
while... I do that.
You want us to go without you?
Yeah, I just... You're his mother.
I know that. I know that.
But I haven't been a very good one...
and I honestly don't think I can be
until I deal with this.
Can't we do this together?
This is how we do it together.
You have to help me do it... alone.
That's it?
Is there anything else?
What do you mean?
That you want to tell me.
(sighs): You know, I just...
I was out of control, I got...
out of control, and I...
I did some things.
What kind of things?
Things that I'm ashamed of.
Okay, just tell me everything.
Luka...
After all this, after everything,
you don't want to tell me?
Not tonight.
(sighs, groans)
It's my fault, isn't it?
No, don't.
Please don't.
I... I should have come home earlier.
I shouldn't have left you alone.
No, I should have been able to handle this.
I broke my promise.
Don't do that, okay? Don't.
I screwed up.
I screwed up because I couldn't keep it together.
This is my fault. I'm sorry.
It's me. I'm so sorry.
And please, don't, don't-- just don't.
I'm sorry.
(sighs)
Hey. Hey.
Neurosurgery finished with the driver from your MVC.
He's waking up.
Oh, that's good to know.
Nice move in there. You okay?
Oh, yeah, I'm fine.
You know, I did a little cage fighting
back in medical school, so...
It showed.
Good thing Harold was in there to save your ass.
Is that what happened?
Harold.
Seriously...
Thank you.
And I don't care what anybody says, Gates--
I think you're a half-decent guy.
Sam! Is that a new patient?
No. Damn.
With 15 minutes to go, the patient count is 263.
I need another two nurses here.
Food poisoning at the Christmas potluck.
(men coughing, retching)
Hallelujah!
All right, now take a deep breath in...
and blow it out.
Good, good.
(coughing) Good.
Hi, Mommy.
Hi, baby.
I love you.
I love you, too.
I couldn't forget him.
I never knew how to tell you.
Don't worry about anything now.
He's our son.
I'll take care of him.
Ah...!
Ladies and gentlemen,
the official census for the past 24 hours
stands at... 299.
Triage is empty...
which means we will each be
$100 richer in...
ten... nine...
eight...
seven... six...
five...
four... three... two...
Aah! Son of a bitch!
(laughing): Lily, make a chart for Frank.
You have a serious gambling problem, you know that?
Three-view hand X-ray, ibuprofen and an ice pack.
Three hundred! Yes!
Guys. Julia's ready. We moved to Trauma Two.
Water is the source of all life.
It's used in healing rituals all over the world,
in almost every faith.
Water is an element of cleansing and purification.
Today, we use sterile saline.
It's what we work with,
and water doesn't get much cleaner than that.
Earlier, we talked about what our patients do for us,
how they affect us, stay with us.
Now we'll honor
what we do for them,
and pay thanks for the abilities we've been given,
hoping that we may continue to use them
to serve our community.
So let's each dip our hands in the water.
May we all have the strength, dexterity,
and sensitivity to carry out the mission of healing,
and may our hands be blessed.
(train rumbling past)
(engine starts)
JULIA: We have our dead,
and we have let them go.
Now let's turn our attention back
to the work of the living.
