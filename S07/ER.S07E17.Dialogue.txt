Previously on E.R.:
I haven't had a contraction in two weeks, you know.
You still need to take it easy.
You have taken on several additional responsibilities
during my absence. Romano told me to keep this place running.
I don't usually do this--
bring somebody home. Trust me, I don't either.
I appointed you associate chief so that I'd have a lieutenant
on the front lines that I could count on.
If you want to be barefoot and pregnant in the kitchen
you have my blessing.
Go forth and multiply.
How old are you?
Twenty.
In September?
She's a teenager.
Carter! I didn't know.
I like you a lot, Rena.
I just...
You wish I was older.
MRS. HOWARD: You can't keep me here.
I need to go!
You've got to let me go.
My kids are coming home from school.
I meet them at the bus stop at 3:30 every day.
Relax, it's only 10:00 in the morning.
My ice box is empty.
I've got nothing to cook for dinner.
You're in the hospital, ma'am.
We're going to take care of you.
I could get some ground chuck, but they want 69 cents a pound.
Peter.
Have you heard of such a thing?
I remember paying 29 cents a pound.
Where have you been?
And don't even think about T-bone.
Had to put a Swan in upstairs.
My husband would have to get some promotion
This the consult? before we could eat steak.
Mrs. Howard. What's the problem?
I could fix a tuna casserole Nursing home sent her in
because she's not eating. but my son James won't eat it.
Doesn't sound surgical. Won't even touch it.
Could be. You took out her gall bladder last month.
But there's macaroni and cheese...
Hello, Mrs. Howard.
Oh, so nice to see you.
I'm Dr. Benton.
I know.
I never forget a handsome face.
CARTER: Simon?
( breathing hard )
Simon?
Simon!
Simon!
Whoop!
Who are you?
CARTER: Simon?
Are you Simon?
No?
Yosh, have you seen a little guy running through here by himself?
Sorry.
ABBY: Hey, Carter.
You lose something?
Simon.
Where's his mom?
Mom went to the cafeteria to get some chocolate milk.
But Simon's not getting any treats
until he lets me draw his blood.
I don't want you to take my blood.
He's only going to take about this much.
If you sit still, this won't hurt.
I don't want a needle.
How about a papoose?
I think we're okay.
You sure? I'd hate for you to lose him again.
Can you just hold his arm still?
Okay.
Be brave and do not move.
There's a good one at the wrist.
Antecube looks better.
( screaming ): No!
You want to try an arm board?
Nope, let's take a break.
Abby, I need another nurse!
You okay here?
Go.
( patient yelling )
He kicked me in the face.
Hey, help me with the leathers.
We need some Haldol.
Careful, he bit a nurse's finger in Psych.
What's he doing down here?
He cut up his face.
You want some help? Yeah.
Ow!
( patient grunting )
PATIENT: Hey!
MALIK: What did you do that for?
It was an April Fools' joke.
April Fools'?
Was that Haldol?
The board is full, gurneys are lining the halls.
We've got another 30 in the rack.
We desperately need to clear out the rooms
and you're wasting time on
April Fools' pranks.
No more shenanigans for the rest of the day.
Have I made myself clear?
Uh, yes. Yes, ma'am. Uh-huh.
Dave!
Yeah.
How much did you give him?
Ten milligrams.
Okay, I want you to take a nap.
I'm fine.
What did I just say?
Go take a nap.
Before that.
Uh, no more fooling around.
That's right. Now get back to work.
Malucci!
It wasn't me, I swear.
( laughter )
What?
( chuckling ): Nothing.
What's the matter with him?
Ten of Haldol.
What?
Hey.
Dr. Carter.
You were supposed to get this after we took your blood.
I'm sorry. He was scared and thirsty.
I can get another one. No, that's okay.
You want another chocolate milk?
No, really... I don't mind.
Be a good boy, Simon.
I'll be right back.
You know, I didn't call you down here.
The nurses did.
They said you were having some trouble.
Not me.
Well, he's ready now.
Hey, Malik, can you give me a hand over here?
Yeah, sure. It's better if you don't hold onto him.
Yeah, we tried that once.
He ended up in the closet.
Trust me.
Uh, purple and a red top.
Okay, Simon...
are you ready?
You might want to give Simon here a, uh... friendly hug.
Keep blowing bubbles, Simon.
Blow right through the pain, okay?
Fine.
Good.
That's it.
Good boy.
MALIK: What do you want for the labs?
CBC, lytes, BUN, creatinine and glucose.
Okay.
We are... done.
You were very brave.
Let me hook you up with a band-aid
and you are good to go.
CARTER: Thank you.
RENA: No problem.
So how's your internship going?
It's good. Yeah?
Haven't seen you around lately.
Been busy?
RENA: Yeah.
I should probably get back upstairs.
Nice to see you again.
You, too.
Is this the trauma?
Eddie Palcynski, 32. Single gunshot wound to the belly.
Hypotensive initially.
I take it he's not an innocent victim.
They stole my purse. Tried to hold up a liquor store.
B.P. 90 in the field, 120 with two liters. It wasn't me.
That other dude had a knife. Shut up.
Any pain in the chest?
Just my stomach.
What happened to you?
Chased his partner over a fence.
Did you get him? Not exactly.
No, he actually would have had to run to catch him.
Heard you had a GSW.
Right upper quadrant. Can you get this?
No problem.
All right. Need a hand?
We just need a band-aid.
Yeah, over your mouth.
Officer?
Be good, Kenny, they'll give you a lollipop.
On my count.
One, two, three...
Where's my purse?! I've lost my purse!
Hey, who's got the screamer?
Dr. Finch. Benton cleared her belly.
Can we put her in a room?
If we had one.
Nurse, I need my wallet and my car keys!
Ooh, that's a nice outfit you got there, Randi.
Thanks, Dr. Carter.
You look nice, too.
So, are you Dr. Carter now or Mr. Hyde?
Oh, I'm sorry about that.
I guess I just needed a cup of coffee.
Uh-huh, and I suppose seeing Miss Bubbles had nothing to do
with your sudden mood change?
No.
No? Oh, come on.
You've been moping around here for days
and then the minute she shows up
you turn into Mr. Congeniality.
( chuckling ): I was just being friendly.
I was, okay?
Did somebody order a school bus?
Grace Linden. Stuart's having an asthma attack.
I'm Dr. Carter.
Let's get a gurney and a hand-held neb.
Do you use an inhaler?
Empty.
How long has he been bad?
About ten minutes.
There were fumes on the bus.
Exhaust fumes? No, it's something else.
A lot of the kids have headaches
and some are throwing up.
We can't bring them in.
It's a HazMat situation.
Until we can confirm there's no contamination
you're all going to have to wait outside.
In the cold?
A gram of Cefotetan
and repeat the CBC in pre-op.
What's this?
Oh, small caliber gunshot to the liver.
I want four units of type specific in the O.R.
I thought Benton was on.
Yeah. You need something?
How long is the case?
Couple of hepatic drains, couple of sutures
and we'll be done.
Hmm, sounds quick.
Should be.
I hope so.
Mm-hm.
( coughing )
Let's get him into a gown and bag his clothes.
Okay, can you hop up here?
Whoa.
Stu, Stu, Stuuuu-pid!
You broke your ass-- I can see the crack.
LINDEN: Hey! When the hand goes up, the mouth goes shut.
Arms up.
ABBY: You guys on a field trip?
Art Institute.
Oh, yeah? The Gauguin exhibit?
We never made it.
Hey, nice rack, Stu.
Make 'em bounce.
Okay, that's enough.
Hey, Doc, you do liposuction?
Toby, next time it is you, me, and the principal.
Come on, keep moving.
Don't even listen to them.
Anything else?
Some number one chromic on a liver needle.
Lizzie, I heard you're doing an ex lap on a GSW.
You heard correctly.
Oh.
You sure you can still reach the table?
At least I can see the table.
Oh-ho-ho-ho.
Well, I was going to offer
to assist after my AV shunt
but not if you're going to go prenatal on me.
Actually, if you really want to help
you can order me some pizza and ice cream.
You think you need it?
Was it razor wire?
More like a cyclone fence.
Yeah, it's pretty deep.
I need to use the toilet.
Okay, but we're going to move you to a quiet room.
I need to go right now. I need to go!
I need you to spread your fingers like this.
Dr. Weaver, we've got a status asthmaticus.
Chuny, can you help her with a bedpan, please?
He needs continuous nebs.
Where do you want to put him?
Just one second.
MALIK: Hey, your guy is seizing in two.
Good.
Cock your wrist back like this.
I'll do it by myself. How old are you, Stuart?
BENTON: I want to make sure
you didn't damage any nerves. Stand up.
MRS. HOWARD: You can let me go if I want to go...
I need you to hold your hands like this.
I'm not a prisoner. I'm not.
BENTON: I'm going to press down.
Just keep them up, all right?
Let me go. I don't need to be here.
Good.
Hey!
MRS. HOWARD: This is not right.
Drop the gun, ma'am.
You can't do this to me. Drop the gun, ma'am.
Drop it now!
Just leave me alone!
Everybody just calm down.
GRANT: Put the gun down now
and no one will get hurt.
Leave me alone!
Just leave me alone...
Drop the gun.
Leave me...!
( two gunshots )
( moaning )
Ten blade. Set up for a pulse ox.
Central line is in, two units on the infuser.
Rib spreader.
We asked three times, right? Yeah, she didn't respond.
Asystole.
Start internal compressions.
How'd she get your gun? I don't know.
What are you going to say?
Put the suction on high.
We'll talk about it. The right atrium
and ventricle are completely shredded.
We should figure it out before they get here.
The aortic root is blown away. I guess one shot
wasn't enough. Come on.
Another amp of epi.
Side-biting clamp and pick-ups; let's move.
Need a cordis introducer
for the atrium. I need a lap pad.
Let's go.
Hope they get their story straight.
All clear.
No carbon monoxide, no flammables.
The kids smelled something?
Maybe, but it's gone now.
Probably just mass hysteria.
That's it?
Kids smell nail polish remover
pretty soon everybody thinks they're sick.
Do we need to scrub them down?
No one's contaminated.
All right, let's split them up.
Who had vomiting?
Luka, postural vitals and a pulse ox.
Okay, come with me. What's your name?
Emily.
Are you still nauseated?
Any stiff neck or double vision?
No.
Are you really a doctor?
When I'm not out fighting crime.
Right this way.
All right, guys, let's go.
We like it out here.
Yeah, they say fresh air is good for you.
Put out your cigarette.
You got a spare ashtray?
Come on.
Beck's suture.
Fifth and sixth units are in.
How's she doing?
Heart's empty, not so good.
It looks like hamburger in here.
Officer Kimball?
Did you discharge your weapon? Uh-huh.
You need to go with Detective Westland.
Statinsky.
Officer Grant, you're with me.
Push another atropine.
I need the names of the treating physicians.
Dr. Weaver.
12 French foley.
Come on, let's move, people.
And Dr. Benton.
Okay, inflate balloon.
Did you witness the shooting?
WEAVER: Yes, we both did.
B-E-N-T-E-N?
O-N.
Okay, hold compressions.
Still asystole.
Is she going to make it?
Not if you don't let us do our job.
Let me know if she expires.
Resume compressions.
You want some more blood?
How long has she been down?
Half an hour.
All right, let's get, uh...
two more units and I need some more o-silk, come on.
I'll get some.
KOVAC: Deep breath.
Excuse me.
Once again.
Is that stuff still in my lungs?
I don't think so.
Everything sounds good.
What kind of chemical was it?
We don't know.
Well, then, how do you know it's safe?
Because your oxygen level is normal
and your lungs are clear.
Do you think it could hurt my baby?
You're pregnant?
I think so.
OLBES: Laura Beckton, 23.
Put her car into a fire hydrant.
She's altered, no response to verbal commands.
Whoa, this is a crime scene.
We have a critical patient.
You've got to go around. Let us through.
I can't.
B.P. 120/85, pulse 90.
What's with all the cops?
We had a shooting.
Let's get X-ray down here.
Laura, open your eyes.
Pupils are equal and reactive.
Let's get a portable c-spine, chest and pelvis.
Head CT to follow.
Looks like Peter's patient didn't make it.
What patient?
The old lady from the hall.
That's my patient.
Cop shot her.
What?
Feeling better?
Starting to.
Did that lady die?
You think it'll be on the news?
Yeah.
She could have blown my head off.
Weren't you scared?
A little.
Then why'd you get in front of me?
Guess I wasn't thinking.
I was really scared.
Me, too.
You're still wheezing.
Have you had a cold?
No.
Well, something triggered your asthma.
You think it was the fumes?
Maybe, I don't know.
You're not sure?
I'm just trying to help.
It was the fumes.
Where'd they come from?
You know, anything that you tell me, it's a secret.
Another 4-0 prolene.
Shirley, can you rub my back for me?
Excuse me?
Oh, yes, yeah, that's it.
Okay, release the vessel loop.
Oh, yeah, that's it, oh...
I'm sorry, this must be
the day spa, I was looking for the O.R.
Everything's under control, Robert.
I hope so, you've been in here long enough.
I've repaired the liver, the diaphragm, and now the IVC.
Uh-huh. What about the defect to the ascending colon?
Where?
Little lower.
Yeah, right there.
I hadn't fully run the bowel yet.
Or maybe this is too big a case
given your delicate condition.
We were doing perfectly well until you came in, thank you.
Are you crying?
No.
We don't cry in the O.R.
That's what the ladies room is for.
I'm not crying!
Good.
Then you won't mind if I scrub in.
( sighs heavily )
Where's Malucci?
He's with his new fan club. As if.
Find him.
Right now?
No, sometime in the next two weeks.
You don't have to be so snippy.
Dr. Greene, some of the kids on the bus
had a can of solvent.
They were huffing? Trying to get high.
Great, I've got a pregnant girl.
What were they using?
I don't know, actually.
They just held a rag over my patient's face
and forced him to take a hit.
Tox screens are negative.
Solvents, they don't show up.
We have to find out what it was.
I know where to start.
Just don't implicate Stuart, okay?
He's a little afraid of payback.
Tell them.
Dr. Dave was talking to me
and he fell asleep in the chair.
Now he's drooling.
Okay, Mr. Gunderson
you need to change into a gown
and then the doctor
will be in to examine you.
Just have a seat on the... bed.
Dave...
Dave?
Dave!
I'm good...
I'm good.
No, man, you gotta stick it up his butt.
Okay, guys, what were you sniffing?
What? On the bus.
You smell something on the bus, Eric?
Yeah, Mrs. Linden's farts.
( laughing )
We found chemical solvents in your blood stream.
Some of your classmates are really sick.
Uh, can I get another Band-Aid?
I need to know what it was. Butane?
Paint thinner? Adhesive?
Okay, fine, we'll do more tests.
Bo?
What kind of tests?
MALIK: Just lie still, man.
We take the blood and label it
with radioactive hydrogen.
Then we re-inject it into your body...
and do a nuclear scan.
Really?
It's the only way to identify the chemicals.
It was spot remover.
What kind?
Carbon tet.
Carbon tetrachloride?
Order liver panels on all three of them.
Got it.
Am I going to be okay?
I hope so.
Hey, can I help you?
Yeah, I'm looking for Rena.
She's just finishing up with a patient.
Dr. Carter, right?
Yeah, have we met?
No, I'll let her know you're here.
( clattering )
Dr. Carter?
Yeah, hi, I... I...
Don't worry about it.
This is always falling apart.
Um, okay...
actually, it goes like this.
Are you sure you're a doctor?
Yeah, I was a surgical resident for a year.
I guess it's easier taking things out
than putting it back in.
Hey, uh... I was waiting
and I accidentally eviscerated this guy.
( chuckles )
I heard about the shooting, are you okay?
Yeah. It was...
Did you need something?
I've been doing some thinking about you and me
and I realize that I may have been...
Stupid?
I was going to say wrong.
But maybe I was a little of both.
Uh, look, I enjoyed the time that we spent together.
I'd like to do it again.
So I was wondering if you would have lunch with me.
What about the age thing?
Not an issue...
Anymore.
You dropped your spleen.
Right, so is that a "no"?
I'll think about it.
Okay.
I was just up at Grand Rounds.
Why didn't anyone get me?
There wasn't any time, she arrested immediately.
She wasn't that agitated when I left.
What did she want with a gun?
She didn't want anything with a gun.
She was altered, all right?
( sighs ): Yeah, I'll see you.
Got the film.
I have to get out of here now.
No, you need to sit down.
You were unconscious from a car accident.
I'm going to be late. For what?
For my gynecologist.
They have to harvest my eggs by 6:00.
You're on fertility drugs?
Yeah, uh, I had ten days of FSH injections
and yesterday they gave me beta HCG.
Look, I'm ovulating now.
There's only
a two-hour window to retrieve the eggs.
Well, I don't think that's going to be possible now.
Why, did I damage my ovaries?
Head CT looks normal.
We think you may have had a small blood clot in your brain
which caused you to pass out and crash your car.
But I'm okay now?
Well, we need to give you blood thinners
to prevent any more clotting.
Then I'll go to the clinic and come right back.
No, you need heparin now
which means you can't have an invasive procedure.
No, when I come back, you can do whatever you want
but I have to harvest these eggs.
Hold on, who's your gynecologist?
Her name is Dr. Alexander.
Let's call her, and maybe she'll come here.
What is taking so long?
Have a seat.
Did you do the test?
You are pregnant.
I knew it.
What about the fumes?
Shouldn't be a problem.
Good, I want a healthy baby.
Have you thought about your options?
What do you mean?
Can you take care of a baby?
Well, there's day care in high school.
And my mom can help out until I'm in ninth grade.
Does your mom know?
Maybe you should tell her.
No, don't tell her.
She'll freak out completely.
It's a big decision.
No, it's not.
All my life I wanted a baby.
KENNY: She's a good cop.
Saved my ass a couple of times.
No one ever wants to draw their gun.
She was forced to make a split-second decision.
Oh, was she?
She followed the guidelines.
Hmm, they teach you to shoot little old ladies, huh?
She could've shot anyone in that hallway, you know that.
No, all I know
is that an elderly black woman is dead.
No, man, Lisa's not like that at all.
I would have done the same thing.
Hold still.
Look, you don't know her.
You can trust her.
She's a good person, she...
Look, she's been raising two kids on her own
ever since her husband died.
She's had it rough.
I'm telling you, this investigation goes the wrong way
you could ruin a good cop's life.
She was trying to protect you and your patients.
That's all she was doing.
You might want to consider that
when you talk to these detectives.
( sighs )
I know she's in the middle of a procedure.
I need you to page Dr. Alexander.
Have her call Dr. Greene at County General.
Hold on, Malik.
Yeah, the patient's name is Laura Beckton. Thanks.
Robert Borsellino? This is Bo?
Yeah.
All right, we need a protime, type and cross for four.
You going to admit him? Pedes I.C.U.
KOVAC: She's in the seventh grade.
They're emancipated for a reason.
When they're pregnant, you can't tell her mother.
She'll have to tell her eventually. Yes, she will.
But don't you think it's better for her
to tell her mother now?
Well, yeah, I do.
So, you'll talk to her? What?
Maybe she'll listen to you. Exam Two.
I don't need this.
I can just go home and rest.
We really need to find your parents.
They don't back till about 8:00 or 9:00.
They have a cell phone or a pager?
No, don't even bother.
We really do.
Well, what is it?
You're in liver failure.
How'd that happen?
You need to huff pretty much every day to hurt your liver.
Well, people drink every day.
This is worse.
We have to start looking for a donor.
A donor?
You could die
if you don't have a liver transplant.
Is this another one of your scare tactics?
No.
Mark, Laura's crashing.
I'll be back.
What happened?
She slumped over, stopped breathing.
Damn it, I should've heparinized.
Pavulon and sux. Let's paralyze.
I don't think you have to.
Number eight E.T. tube.
Suction.
No muscle tone in the legs, either.
Blood clot knocked out the corticospinal tracts.
She's a quadriplegic.
How about TPA?
Maybe we can bust up the clot.
Not after a car crash.
She has pulmonary contusions.
She could bleed into her lungs.
Dr. Greene, I took a message.
Dr. Alexander can come see the patient.
Forget it.
She stroked out.
MAN: And you also heard
Officer Kimball ask the woman to drop the weapon?
Yeah.
What happened next?
Mrs. Howard was startled, and she raised the gun.
Pointed at anyone in particular?
There were other patients around
but, no, no one specifically.
Okay.
We'll notify you if we need anything else.
That's it?
Yeah.
Something you'd like to add?
Yeah. They could have grabbed the gun.
What makes you say that?
She was a frail, frightened, demented, elderly woman.
She didn't know where she was or what she was doing.
She still could've fired it.
Uh... maybe.
But...?
They didn't need to shoot her.
WOMAN: Was she huffing?
KOVAC: No.
I've talked to her about drugs, but you never know.
Uh, I don't think she does drugs.
I shouldn't have let her go on that field trip.
Why?
She's been sick.
She tells me she's been, uh, throwing up every morning.
Yeah, could that be gallstones?
You know, my mother had them.
Do you know when was her last period?
I don't keep track.
She has a boyfriend?
Is she pregnant?
Oh, that little slut.
Mrs. Perault...
How could you be so stupid?! What?
This is your mother? Yes, I'm her mother.
If you're going
to sleep around
you could at least use a condom!
He didn't want to. There's no need to shout.
Who is the bastard?
Let's talk about this outside.
You're getting an abortion.
I am not!
Yes, you are!
Leave me alone.
Why don't we all just calm down?
You can't take care of a baby!
You can't even take care of yourself!
Get her out of here.
I need you to step outside.
I need you to mind your own business.
Mrs. Perault... I told you not to tell her.
She's a psycho.
She is not leaving here pregnant!
Yes, I am.
I'm having this baby
and I'm going to be a much better mother than you
you bitch!
You doing your homework?
No. That lady brought it in.
What lady?
The really cute one with the curly hair.
She works in Pediatrics.
Oh, yeah. Rena.
Yeah.
You didn't tell them I told you?!
No, we didn't have to. They told us.
They told you, or you asked?
Either way, it's not going to be a problem.
They think I squealed.
No. I know it.
Bo is going to kick the crap out of me!
You're not going to have to worry about Bo.
Everything's going to be all right.
No, it won't. They saw me naked!
They just saw you from the waist up.
They're going to make fun of me forever.
Listen, I knew a boy who was a little husky
and he didn't have very many friends
and all the kids used to make fun of him.
So, he spent most of his time studying
and he went on to college, and he became a surgeon
and at his high school reunion, he took out his scalpel
and he cut the tongues off of every kid
who ever made fun of him.
That's supposed to cheer me up, Doc?
Okay, help me mobilize the small intestine.
Pancreas is fine.
Uh-oh, take a look at this.
( sighs )
It's a hematoma of the duodenum.
Yeah. The bullet went through the medial aspect
of the second portion.
You're kidding.
Have you known me to kid?
Okay, open a pancreatoduodenectomy tray.
He needs a Whipple.
That's a five-hour procedure.
Well, I'll call in Peter.
No, no, it's my patient. I'll finish.
No, no, no. No need to torture yourself.
I just need a bathroom break.
A bathroom break?
I am seven months pregnant.
You should have
considered that before you started.
( sighs )
I'll be back in five minutes.
Fine. Shirley, call in another scrub tech.
I need an extra pair of hands.
Okay, forget it. I won't go.
Go.
No, I won't.
Bovie, pickups.
Shirley, can you crawl between my legs
and insert a Foley?
All right, go on. Go on, get out, go on.
Get out of here. Go ahead.
( clang )
Don't you need a cable or something?
Nope. It just sends it right to your phone.
( keys clatter ) Done.
Okay, okay, call me.
( phone plays "Last Resort" )
Papa Roach-- that is so cool!
Stuart, do one for me.
Blink 182.
Looks like he's found some new friends.
How did you do that?
Yes, I love Sugar Ray!
Well, I guess it's a little late for lunch.
Well, we got busy with all these kids.
How about dinner?
I'll probably grab a Happy Meal on the way home.
Okay, I deserved that.
Now you can forgive me.
I don't know.
Come on, I'm starving.
You and me, a couple of big steaks...
I'm a vegetarian.
Or brussels sprouts?
It's a school night.
No, seriously, I've got a midterm tomorrow.
Well, I can help you study.
Well, I might have to pull an all-nighter.
So, is that a "yes"?
All right.
Excuse me.
So where and when?
Uh... uh, l-let me think about it.
I'll call you upstairs when I...
when I know something a bit more specific.
I thought you were over this age thing.
I am, I am.
So what was that about?
Do you know Abby?
No, but she seems nice.
She's nice, yeah.
No, she's just...
She always had this thing for me.
( nervous chuckle )
You used to go out with her?
Yeah, y-you know, she's got some issues
and she gets a little weird
around the other nurses and stuff.
So, it's probably best not to let her on...
let... ( clears throat ) let on about us.
I'll meet you down here after your shift.
Yeah. Sounds like a plan.
Okay.
When you have a chance
the family wants to talk to you.
Peter...
Hey.
Mrs. Howard's sodium was 172.
What?
She was delirious because of profound dehydration.
Did you check her mucous membranes?
I examined her abdomen for post-op complications.
That's it?
Well, didn't you examine her?
I shotgunned her labs and gave her to you.
Come on.
( sighs )
This whole thing was preventable.
If I had recognized the problem and started an IV...
Hell, if I had given her a glass of water
she might still be alive.
You don't know that.
It always takes time to make a diagnosis when we're busy.
She wouldn't have grabbed the gun.
That's no reason for them to shoot her.
GREENE: You'll see a tube in her mouth
hooked up to a ventilator.
Well, she's not breathing?
The stroke affected the part of her brain
that controls breathing.
Will that get better?
We'll have to wait and see.
Here.
You can sit down.
Laura... it's Greg.
I'm right here.
She's only 23.
How could she have a stroke?
We think the fertility drugs caused a blood clot.
Fertility drugs?
The injections.
What are you talking about?
I talked to her gynecologist.
Your wife was trying to be an egg donor.
She was selling her eggs?
There was an infertile couple willing to pay $80,000.
We have this, uh... this little hardware store.
Um... bills are stacking up, business is down.
Uh... we're about to file for bankruptcy.
I guess she was trying to help.
I'm sorry.
You didn't have to do this, honey.
You didn't have to do this.
( sniffling )
Is Dr. Carter around?
He was here a minute ago.
Uh, will you tell him that I'll be late.
There's a new admission to the PICU.
( chuckling ): No problem.
Hi.
Hi.
I'm Rena.
Abby.
You're Dr. Carter's friend?
That's right.
I hope you don't mind me spending time with John.
Why would I?
Well, he told me.
Told you what?
About you and him.
Me and him?
I just don't want there to be any hard feelings.
I-I understand how some relationships
take longer to get over than others.
He told you... we had a relationship?
I find his honesty refreshing.
He's different than most guys.
Oh, yeah.
He's special.
Good view of the heartbeat.
There's the head.
"It's time to explore new places.
"Even though Taureans cringe at the thought of change
trust what lies ahead as a fantastic, once-in- a-lifetime opportunity."
That's so perfect.
What?
My horoscope. What's your sign?
I don't know.
Well, when's your birthday?
Looks like you're about ten weeks along.
So, when will I have it?
November.
Early Christmas present.
Oh, look how cute.
Babies are a lot of responsibility.
I know.
It's hard work getting up in the middle of the night.
It's easy... if you love them.
How old was your mom when you were born?
16.
Maybe if she had waited a couple of years
she would have been a better mother.
I'm way more mature than she was at 16.
( sighs )
I'm going to have a social worker stop by to see you.
Good. I need to sign up.
For what?
Money.
When my friend Gina had her baby
she started getting a check every month.
Your wife wanted us...
Randi, any word from the O.R.?
They're still working. No, no, I said no!
Look, it'll only take a few minutes
and we won't harm her in any way.
Stay the hell away from my wife!
Whoa, whoa.
Dr. Alexander?
Mark Greene.
Could you keep her out of here, please?
What are you doing?
We were discussing his wife's condition.
Well, right now you're a consultant.
You talk to me first.
I couldn't find you.
I was reviewing her records when he walked in.
No, you were twisting his arm
because you want to harvest the eggs.
I was presenting it as an option.
He'll never let you do it.
She's already given
her consent.
He just lost his wife.
Leave him alone.
Dr. Greene, she's going to need a lengthy hospitalization
and then round-the-clock home-nursing care.
That's a tremendous financial burden.
Thanks to your fertility drugs.
I don't think so.
I've been doing I.V.F. for 12 years and...
I've never seen this happen.
She must have a protein S or an antithrombin deficiency.
Those are pretty rare conditions.
Not as rare as a vascular occlusion from FSH.
I'll send up the labs.
There's only an hour left to retrieve the eggs.
It's a ten-minute procedure
but it'll give them a nice financial cushion.
Why don't you try and calm him down, discuss the situation?
Mm-hmm.
Another Vicryl.
Why don't you go take a nap?
Because I've got my second wind.
Well, it's about time.
I'm happy to close.
Be my guest.
Skin stapler.
SHIRLEY: Dr. Greene called again.
He'd like you to phone him when the case is over.
Oh, how sweet.
You are one... lucky lady.
Couple of ABDs.
SHIRLEY: You going to write post-op orders?
Uh, yes.
Leave the clipboard for me.
SHIRLEY: Okay, here we go. One, two, three.
CORDAY: Um, ABG in 20 minutes.
I'll meet you in recovery.
His brother's in the waiting room.
Can you talk to him?
Yeah.
( sighs heavily )
( sighs )
Hey, Abby, can you update the tetanus on my foot lac?
Sure. Why not?
You okay?
Oh, yeah, I'm peachy.
What's wrong?
I don't know, maybe I'm still getting over our breakup.
You talked to Rena?
I'm sorry. I panicked.
( chuckles )
Um... wh-what did you say to her?
Nothing.
No, really.
Really.
Against, uh, my better judgment
and everything I hold sacred in life
I covered for you.
So, you owe me.
Thank you.
Mm-hmm, sure.
Also, I told her... I dumped you.
You dumped me?
And she believed you?
Of course she did.
Why wouldn't she?
Well, it's just...
you'd never dump me.
I would dump you like a bad habit.
Oh, no.
I definitely think I'd dump you first.
In your dreams, maybe.
Oh, I would dump you.
No, you wouldn't.
Oh... you're acting crazy now.
( alarm warning )
GREG: What's that?
Pulse ox came off.
That's it for the right side.
Is she in any pain?
No.
Left ovary looks good.
JAMES: She wrote children's books.
Did you know that?
Those were, um... our bedtime stories.
I still can't believe this is happening.
She's had dementia for such a long time.
I know.
Usually, she's forgetful
or thinks she's still living at home
but she's never been agitated or violent.
I can't imagine her fighting with the police.
So, you're sure it's nothing from the surgery?
No, no.
Dementia is a progressive illness
and... over time, there's worsening psychiatric symptoms.
You know, it's been so hard to watch her deteriorate.
Even little things can lead to agitation--
sleep deprivation, a bladder infection.
Actually, we think it was dehydration with your mother.
From not drinking enough?
I told you, there's too many people at that nursing home.
They weren't even giving her water.
I never should have moved her out of the house.
It was too much for you, okay?
I could have done it, I could have cared for her.
I was the one who put her in there.
This is not your fault.
( sighs )
Thank you, Dr. Benton.
I know she appreciated your kindness.
I was looking everywhere for you.
Shh.
( whispering ): Is that Dermabond?
How's he going to get it off?
Maybe he'll find some acetone.
( snoring )
Carter... can you cover for Dr. Dave
until about 11:00?
It's okay.
Actually, I promised Rena I'd help her study.
Tutoring?
Yeah, it's a midterm, right? Yeah.
Psychology. Family Studies.
Good night, Dr. Carter.
Randi, could you call up to the O.R.?
Again? Yes.
Don't bother.
I thought you'd never get out.
Neither did I.
How are you?
If I don't get off my feet
my ankles are going to explode.
Oh...
Your patient make it?
Yeah, how was your day?
The usual.
Did you save any lives?
I hope so.
Oh, thank you.
That's wonderful.
Dr. Corday, your dinner has arrived.
"Nice work, Mom."
It's from Robert.
Maybe we should have someone taste it first.
I am so hungry...
Pepperoni pizza.
And ice cream.
Cherry Garcia.
Oh, let's go
with the ice cream first.
( chuckles )
Oh, I had the most difficult case today...
and I got through it.
Mmm. Mmm...
Oh, that's good.
Have some.
Mmm...
Now that it's over
I'm thinking, why do I have to prove
that a pregnant surgeon can be competent?
I don't know.
I mean, I can operate until the day I deliver
but what the hell for?
So, as of now...
I am officially on maternity leave.
I'm going to rest
and I'm going to take care of myself
and my baby.
Oops, no napkins.
Mark, can I just sleep here?
I don't think I have the strength to move.
I don't think I have the strength to carry you.
( laughs )
Keep it coming.
I'm sorry.
( chuckles )
( chuckles )
