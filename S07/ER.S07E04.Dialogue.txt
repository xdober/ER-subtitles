Previously on E.R.:
So, what is my position here?
You have no position here, Peter.
You're firing me?
No, no, no, no.
You fired yourself.
I'm short on nurses.
I'm an O.B. nurse.
Are you planning on going back to med school?
Yes.
Okay, then you might as well
work as a nurse in the E.R.
You'll see more medicine down here than upstairs.
Listen, if you need anything--
talk about a case or a patient or... anything
just come find me. I will.
You could be a great doctor.
Oh, my God, I'm sorry.
You're an excellent surgeon, Peter
and you're a good man.
And we'll work it out.
Benton: Well, if you'd like, I could come in for another interview.
As a matter of fact, I could come in this morning.
Yes, I know, but you said you were interested.
You actually said you were very interested.
Right, but if you could just...
Right.
Well, thank you.
Want some breakfast?
No.
Going over applications?
Yup.
I thought you took the position at Loyola.
Withdrawn.
Why?
I don't know, Cleo.
Maybe because I took another job somewhere else.
Have you tried Northwestern?
Fully staffed.
U. of C.?
What do you think?
Right now, I think you're being an ass.
You barely say anything, and when you do, it's rude.
I talk to you. Not about this.
Why don't you let me help you?
I don't need your help, all right?
I need a damn job.
I should have left County when I had a chance.
( door slams )
Out for fresh air?
Man found down. ETA is any minute.
They're finally letting you work on traumas.
Provided I only handle two patients at a time.
Really.
Weaver's rules.
Ah, play by them or die by them.
Thanks.
She didn't exactly ask me
if I wanted to be assigned to the E.R.
What are you supposed to do while you wait for labs?
Oh, catch up on medical journals.
That sucks.
Show time.
You with me on this one? Yup.
50-year-old male
found in the park, full arrest.
That's one well-fed bum.
How'd you load him on the rig?
Paid a bunch of his buddies five bucks.
Okay, come on, let's go.
One, two, three!
Large lac to the occipital scalp.
Not sure if he was rolled or fell out of his tree.
What's he doing in a tree?
Maybe he lived in it.
He's in asystole.
Why didn't you intubate him?
His neck is as thick as a power pole.
We couldn't find the cords.
It was 40 degrees last night.
He's hypothermic.
We might still get him back.
Oh, yeah? With what, a blowtorch?
No, active core rewarming.
Let's set up for pleural and peritoneal lavage.
I'm in. Bag him.
Who's got scissors?
Good air bilaterally.
So, Carter, you know anyone who plays hockey?
Nope.
Get me some warm blankets.
Need an extra guy for a game tonight.
I'm busy.
Yeah, I was asking if you knew anyone.
Okay, looks like we're in fine V-fib.
Core temp is 86.
So's his pulse ox.
All right, charge the paddles to 360.
Why? He's a frozen dinner.
Excuse me.
Put two chest tubes in on the right.
Run warm saline through the rapid infuser.
You're kidding, right?
He's not dead until he's warm and dead.
I'll prep the chest. 32 French okay?
Yup. Okay, everybody clear.
What the hell?
What the hell?
Give him an amp epi.
All right, charge again.
Clear.
They're attacking.
Still V-fib.
Damn it, Dave, get over here and do CPR.
Charge again to 360.
What do you mean do CPR? The guy's brain dead.
Not until I say so. Clear.
A bunch of beauty contestants
are in the salon getting final touches
worker mixed the wrong chemicals and Boom.
Who's worst?
Uh, that would be Audrey Hoffman--
Miss Skokie.
She's got lacerations
and partial thickness burns on her legs
and smoke inhalation.
Hi, Audrey. I'm Dr. Greene.
My legs, are they bad?
I want to check your breathing first.
Can you lean forward?
Any shortness of breath?
No.
Any chest pain?
Not really.
Miss Tri-State is tonight.
Is it bad?
Nothing that won't heal.
Does this mean that I'm out?
We're going to do everything that we can.
What's your talent?
Rhythmic dancing.
With hoops and ribbons.
Hmm.
Malik, how many times you going to pass by with the same cart?
Malik, I got a spot on my hockey team I need to fill tonight.
Do I look like I play hockey?
Well, what about your pal in Cards?
Big East Indian dude?
Malucci, I can skate.
I played in college if you're in a pinch.
Sure thing, G.
Dr. Chen, hey, hey, hey.
Cute guy, curtain three-- Daddy material.
Just say thanks.
Oh, Malucci... Chen.
What?
Your mother's been holding for ten minutes.
Not very pleasantly, I might add.
Just tell her I'm with a patient.
Thank you.
Lying might be part of your job description
it's not part of mine.
Yeah.
Hello, Mummy.
Well, I've been busy.
Frank, any messages?
Thank you.
Power meeting today, huh?
I have a seminar that I do not have time for.
Could you remind me to leave by 6:00, please?
Seemed like a good idea at the time.
Super-glue.
Carter, I hope that's one...
Carter, bird man still dead?
It's one of one, actually.
Is there any traumas coming in?
No, but I've got a guy in exam three
who cut his hand on a tin can.
Ooh.
Dr. Gottschalk, do you have a minute?
Unfortunately, I'm on my way to a conference
and I'm very late.
Well, I'll make this quick.
I'd like to discuss with you the faculty position here.
I apologize for bothering you like this, but...
After you turned us down, we offered it to someone else.
Well, has it been accepted?
Not officially.
Well, then you can withdraw it.
Our candidate's credentials are excellent.
So are mine.
And he comes with positive recommendations.
And I don't?
I'm not at liberty to discuss your current standing.
Which means Romano said something, didn't he?
I can't get into this.
What did he tell you?
Dr. Benton...
I need to know what that man said
and who he said it to.
You may have difficulty finding work locally.
That's all I can say.
I'm sorry.
It's 1100 hours.
Excuse me?
I need to ship out.
Okay, sir, if you're waiting for a transfer to another facility
why don't we have a nurse help you?
We're taking Inchon.
Inchon?
Korea, huge battle, if memory serves.
Sorry.
He's a wanderer.
What's his story?
72 years old, from the Golden Glen Nursing Home.
Altered mental status.
They said he became combative.
Picked a fight and got punched in the nose.
History of dementia?
No, the military talk
started just a few days ago.
Anything on exam?
His nose isn't broken
but he's got a low-grade temp
with no obvious signs of infection.
CBC, chem-7 and UA
and if his pulse ox is low, get a chest film.
Damn tab busted off.
Ever think about using a can opener?
Yeah, sure, but then what's the point of having a tab?
I started digging around the edges there.
It looks to me like you may need a few stitches.
Of course, that makes the tuna juice leak out
and then it starts getting greasy all over
and then Bam-- the knife goes right into my hand.
I'm going to do a regional block
to numb the, uh... area around where I'm going to be suturing.
You sure you've done this before?
Sorry, I need some I&D kits.
You might feel a little burning.
Uh-huh.
I'm going to the 8:00 tonight, Abby.
How about you?
I don't know. Maybe.
The exact same thing happened
when I tried to open a milk carton with a pair of scissors.
The bruises just sort of sprang up overnight.
That's why I brought him in here.
He has Niemann-Pick's Type A.
I have some material here if you're not familiar.
Oh, no, that won't be necessary.
His liver and spleen are both enlarged.
That's from the sphingomyelin deposits in both organs.
Yeah, well, a big spleen chews up platelets.
That's why he's bleeding.
Is there anything we can do?
Well, we can make him more comfortable.
I'll order an IV and start him on some morphine.
Would that make him unconscious?
Because I want him to be lucid
for as long as he can be.
It'll be a very small dose of medicine.
What about the spleen?
You said that's causing the problem.
Well, if it's taken out
that might help stop the bleeding, but...
You do know your son is end stage.
Yes.
We'll get an ultrasound of his abdomen and...
I'll have surgeon come take a look.
Thank you.
Okay.
Dr. Chen?
Yes.
I usually wait for labs to come back
before consulting surgery.
He's got splenomegaly.
Pretty clear case of bleeding due to thrombocytopenia.
Thought you said he was end stage.
That doesn't mean he can't have surgery.
I'd think about whether it's appropriate at this point.
Hi.
Hi.
I need to get...
Thanks.
Abby?
Yeah?
You... you have a feather.
I have a...?
Oh.
We had these...
That's all right.
Thank you.
What?
Um...
I was just thinking, uh...
I... I was just wondering
if you wanted, maybe we could, um...
We could what?
Go out sometime.
Oh, you mean, um, like, a date?
Uh, yeah.
That's sort of what I was thinking.
Tonight?
Sure, tonight works.
Okay.
Okay.
See you then.
Okay.
Romano.
Peter, back for a visit.
How are you?
How the hell do you think I am?
Well, judging by your demeanor, I'd say you're a tad dyspeptic.
You've been trashing me all over town?
Oh, having trouble landing a job, huh?
Yeah, thanks to you.
Oh, I'm offended, Peter.
You've made enemies on every floor of this hospital.
Why assume I'm the only person with something negative to say?
You're preventing me from earning a living.
No, no. Actually, I'm willing to help.
What?
Look, your personality sucks
but you don't have to prove to me that you're a great surgeon.
Now, I am willing to offer you a per diem position.
Per diem.
Yeah.
It has no benefits and even less stature
but, uh... it's yours for the asking.
You can kiss my ass.
I take it that's a no?
You couldn't pay me enough to work to work for you again
you arrogant little prick.
Fair enough.
Just keep working on those people skills, Peter.
The labs are back on Mr. Mellonston.
Oh, good.
Great color. Thanks.
UA's full of white cells.
He's got a rip-roaring urinary tract infection.
Sorry I called you down here prematurely.
Happens all the time with nursing home patients.
Take an old guy, give him a bad UTI
next thing you know, he's General MacArthur.
Yeah, I called the home
and they're already given his bed away.
Hey!
Any family members who can take him in?
No, he's at the mercy of social services.
Hey, back to work! Get back to work.
Come on, the show's over.
Maybe not.
He talks like a vet.
If he is one
he could qualify for the VA.
Yeah, that'll take days to process.
I know a case worker at North Chicago
who could pull a few strings
maybe even get the case to transfer today.
Do you want me to call?
Sure, if you think it can be done.
Anybody missing an old man looking for brass cleaner?
He just walked into a pelvic exam.
Mr. Mellonston!
Mr. Mellonston?
Hey, Kerry, hold on.
Peter. I thought you'd left us.
I could be talked into coming down to the ER.
As an attending?
As a liaison to surgery.
As a surgical resident, you went out of your way
to take every procedure away from us.
Yeah, right, but think about this.
If you had a surgeon teaching your residents
more procedures would stay here.
How would that work?
I could expedite cases to the OR.
We have surgical residents for that.
Could you tell me
if there's an elderly gentleman in there?
Man: 47 old enough?
No. Thank you.
Right, but I could do scheduling and-and...
God knows we could use the help.
Kerry, hire me. Look, I'd love to.
Get Romano to pay for it, you got yourself a job.
Trolling for work, Peter?
Dr. Chen, I'm interested to see
what required the interruption of my lunch.
As I explained on the phone
splenomegaly and thrombocytopenia.
So you'll operate?
Well, I would if he didn't have Niemann-Pick's.
Snow him and wait.
No, we can't just let him slowly bleed to death.
It's a terminal disease.
Surgery will only slightly delay the inevitable.
Well, if the surgery were successful
then the family would have more time with him.
Yeah, and if wishes were horses
we'd all be knee-deep in crap.
Look, I didn't become a surgeon
so I could torture dying children.
Let the boy die in peace.
But the mother wants it.
No surgery, Dr. Chen.
What the hell is this?
Explosion in a hair salon.
Sad cultural commentary, isn't it?
Pursuit of beauty at all costs.
Nice legs, though.
There you go.
Oh, God... what am I going to do?
It probably won't scar.
Yeah, but they look hideous.
I can't go on stage like this.
Can you wear pants?
Not in the swim suit competition.
You know, you probably think this is so stupid
but I'm just trying to win a scholarship.
I'm pre-med.
Listen, I can give you something for the pain
if you'd like.
It's okay.
They look worse than they feel.
Okay. Excuse me.
Malik, can you get ahold of Miss Pruitt
at Abbott and Sons?
Oh, yeah, Miss Pruitt.
You mean that...
Don't ask, just do it.
Hey, Dave. Yeah?
Did you find anybody yet?
Uh, for what?
For hockey tonight.
Oh, uh, yeah, a friend of mine.
He might sign on.
Former pro, just looking for some exercise.
Oh, okay.
Yeah. It's kind of a rough game if you play...
Oh, so you don't think I could handle it?
Oh, I didn't say that.
I used to play varsity, second line.
Well... if he can't make it, I'll call you then.
Kovac: Type and cross for four.
Start two units of 0 neg on the rapid infuser.
What happened?
Multiple GSWs.
One to the chest.
Looks like a hemo-pneumothorax on the right.
500 cc's out.
I'll take this.
Lost the pulse.
Starting compressions.
We need to crack her chest.
Right-sided GSW
is an indication for the sternal saw.
Can I do it?
Next time, Carter.
Ten blade.
Hold CPR.
Sternal saw.
( buzzing )
She needs a central line.
I'll do it.
Weaver: Mr. Mellonston?
Mr. Mellonston?
Mr. Mellonston...
He said he lost his razor on Old Baldy.
Wanted to borrow mine.
Gil didn't really need it, though.
All he had was peach fuzz.
I'm sorry, I don't understand.
A... mortar shell took his head off.
Why don't we take you back to your bed
so you can rest, okay?
There we go.
Y-you've seen war, haven't you?
Actually, no, I have not.
Hmm...
But you've seen men die.
Yes.
Mr. Mellonston
I-I'm afraid I have some rather unfortunate news.
Uh, you've lost your bed at the nursing home
but we've already called the VA to see...
No! No, they won't take me.
I'm sure that you're qualified.
I won't go there!
Mr. Mellonston, please try...
I can't go there! I won't!
Please calm down.
We're only trying to help you.
I can't go there! I won't! Malik?
Malik, come over...!
No, please...
Don't let them take me!
Don't let them take me away.
Please...
His nose stopped bleeding.
What'd you find out?
Well, the surgeon feels that
it's too great a risk to operate on Kenneth.
But he's suffering.
Can't you see that?
Ms. Stein, Kenneth is barely conscious.
That's not true.
He squeezes my hand.
He understands me.
That means everything that can be done
should be done.
Yes, but there's a good chance
that Kenneth won't survive the operation.
I know what you're thinking.
I'm selfish.
I'm keeping my son alive for me, not him.
Ms. Stein, I'm not the...
He's my child.
I want every minute I can with him.
Wait till you're a mother.
Then you'll know.
Get him the surgery.
Looks like a small caliber GSW
to the right ventricle.
Okay, that should do it.
Heart's not filling.
She's had five units.
You need more volume.
Prep the paddles.
Ooh, can't shock an empty heart.
You'll never get her back.
Run in another two units.
Give me some O silk.
Hold compressions.
What are you doing, Carter?
Beck's suture.
All right, keep traction on that.
I'm going to check the back side of the heart.
What do you see?
Exit wound in the left ventricle.
Give me 2-0 silk.
I can repair it.
Not from that side.
I got a better angle here.
Ah... saw blood welling up behind the heart.
Thought there might be
another hole.
Okay. Charge to 20.
Okay, now. Cut it.
Clear.
Still defib.
Okay, charge to 30. Clear.
Got a rhythm.
Sinus tach.
Got a pulse.
Nice job, Carter.
Notify the OR.
She's got a septal defect
they need to repair.
Jarvik: Dr. Kovac
Mrs. Danzer's having more chest pain
dropped her pressure to 90.
I'll be right there.
Going to take her up? Mm-hmm.
Sterile saline dressings
and hang the FFP.
Great save, Carter.
Very slick.
Thanks.
Ativan?
Yeah. Point five.
He's pretty subdued.
Did you hear from the VA?
There's good news and bad news.
I found Mr. Mellonston a bed, but it's in a brig.
He's AWOL.
AWOL?
From where?
Korean war. 1951.
Army corporal.
Deserted on leave.
Unfortunately
my VA contact took it upon himself
to notify the active military.
Why would they care about someone
who deserted 50 years ago?
Who knows? They may want to slap him on the wrist.
They may want to court-martial him.
Oh, for God's sake, he's 72 years old.
I know.
Is there anything we can do?
Legally... no.
( knocking )
Hey.
Peter. What are you doing here?
Did you get any of my messages?
Yes, uh, and I meant to call you.
I'm just been incredibly busy.
Uh... I just didn't know what to say.
Yeah. It's okay.
No. No, it's not okay.
I've been avoiding you for days.
Yeah. I got that.
I'm sorry.
What Robert did was wrong, and I've told him as much.
I just wish there was something
I could do.
Yeah, well, I didn't exactly expect you to resign in protest.
That's a relief.
There is something you can do, though.
You can put the word out.
I know you've got
a lot of contacts at other hospitals.
Of course.
I'm surprised you haven't
been snapped up already.
Yeah, well, it seems that lately
my reputation has taken a hit.
He's a horrid little turd, isn't he?
You know what?
I spoke with a friend of mine in Philadelphia
who's looking for someone.
I just wasn't sure you'd care to move.
At this point
I'm open to anything.
Dr. Benton, they need you in the ER.
I no longer work at this hospital.
Weaver called.
Your sister, Jackie, is down there.
What's her last BP?
100/60.
Okay, let's go.
I'll grab the drug box.
How is she?
Who are you?
Her sister.
She was shot in the chest.
She's critical. She needs surgery.
You can go wait...
( grunts )
Oh, Lord!
What happened?
Kovac: Call security now!
Oh, my God!
Carter, Carter, are you all right?
Heart stopped beating.
Weaver: I'll start compressions.
Any rhythm?
Agonal at 34, looks like PEA.
Amp of atropine, amp of epi.
Mix up the dopamine.
Chest is dry.
Kovac: Pupils are fixed and dilated.
There's grey matter everywhere.
You won't get her back.
She blew her brains out.
Hyperventilators.
70 of mannitol.
Okay, check all water calorics.
Somebody call the police!
What happened?
Jesse got into a fight.
You don't know, all right?
I was surprised when they said you were here.
I had to take care of something.
How is he?
Superficial lac above the eyebrow.
Mild periorbital swelling
but no bony deformity or tenderness.
Nothing serious.
Jesse: Told you.
He was bleeding pretty bad.
Did you hit your head?
Pass out?
He slammed me into the locker once, all right?
That's all.
You get a CT?
You think he needs one?
Maybe.
There was no LOC, no focal neuro deficits.
They say with head injuries
you can't be too careful.
Jackie, he's fine.
He's fine.
Come on. Hey, Jackie...
how about I buy you a cup of coffee?
Are you sure?
Yeah, come on.
How are you doing?
I'm okay.
They found the shooter.
Good.
Only 15 years old.
Why don't you go home?
I'll be all right.
Go home.
You have probably seen enough trauma for one day.
I'll tell Kerry.
He's a teenager.
It's normal stuff.
No. He's changing.
You're just not around enough to notice anymore.
What is that supposed to mean?
He's got a girlfriend now.
She's pretty rough.
You try talking to him?
We've tried everything.
Grounding him is a joke.
He doesn't care.
He goes out anyway.
I can't have him locked up.
The other day, he shoved his father.
It took everything Walter had not...
You all right?
Can you talk to him?
Can you try?
Talking to him?
( sighing )
Maybe he'll listen to you.
( sighing )
Yeah.
Hey.
Hey.
You look nice.
Thank you.
You, too.
So, uh, what did you have in mind-- dinner, movie?
I was thinking of something a little more physical.
Not if you go in laparoscopically.
Recovery time is reduced
and he gains back weeks, maybe even months of his life.
No, I don't understand.
Are you saying that it's too risky
for you or for the patient?
Yeah, whatever.
Thank you.
Problems?
Can't find a surgeon.
Is our department booked?
No, just uninterested.
This your kid with Niemann-Picks?
Yeah.
Tough situation.
I all but promised his mother I'd make this happen.
And now you can't.
Well, there are a few other people I can try.
But you know they'll turn you down.
You know, sometimes, as much as we like to give it
hope can be cruel.
Malucci: Dr. Greene!
Think fast!
8:00 tonight-- the arena.
I can't believe the VA is moving this quickly.
They're not.
I got him into another home.
Borrowed a social security number
from a corpse at the morgue.
Sour cream and onion?
No, thank you.
You borrowed a number from a deceased person?
Yeah. We do it all the time.
Oh, I don't wan... I don't want to know this.
You said you felt bad.
Hey, that is not the point.
I work with a lot of elderly homeless.
You learn a few tricks along the way.
Not another word, please.
Dr. Weaver, time for that seminar you been avoiding.
Thank you, Frank.
Advances in neuroleptic therapy?
Yeah, how did you know?
I'll be there.
Save you a seat.
So, where is this body?
The patient is right here.
Audrey...
Can I go home now?
Not yet.
This is Miss Pruitt
and she's here to help you.
She's an expert cosmetologist.
Can you cover all of this in time for the pageant?
Honey, I've worked on worse.
Trust me.
Yeah, but I've got open wounds.
You're on antibiotics.
But afterwards, no makeup until you're fully healed.
Thank you, Dr. Greene.
Good luck.
Isn't that the gal
who does the makeup on dead people?
Whatever works.
Mark, there you are.
You knew we were meant to leave half an hour ago.
For what?
We're looking at artwork tonight, remember?
I'm subbing in a hockey game.
What?
Malucci-- he asked me to play hockey.
Malucci-- are you mad?
What?
Well, you never said one word to me
about hockey before.
You never asked.
Do you play well?
Well, why don't you come find out?
You wear your sweater, you bring some pom poms.
I'd be in uniform...
I didn't know sports had this effect on you.
( both chuckling )
Has something happened?
No. Why?
You're home early.
Yup.
You never leave the hospital early.
Someone fax you my schedule?
I know when you left this morning
and I know
the kind of hours you put in.
Yeah, it was slow, so they sent me home.
So, it's been all right?
Yup.
What you expected?
Whoo! I'm hungry.
How about you-- have you eaten?
Take you to Dominique's.
John, to be honest
I hoped that you would feel so uncomfortable there
that you wouldn't want to stay.
I know.
So that I wouldn't have to ask you not to.
Well, then don't.
Just give me five minutes.
I'll get changed.
John...
I know your heart is in the right place.
I know you enjoy being a doctor.
Start a practice.
I'm not fighting you on that anymore.
Can't we just agree to disagree on this?
No.
There are other ways to help people.
You don't have to destroy yourself.
Gamma...
That place nearly killed you, John.
It killed your friend.
It drove you to drugs.
No, I did that on my own.
You don't owe them anything.
You don't have to prove anything.
You have a beautiful spirit.
I've seen them beat that spirit out of you.
Gamma... I'm going to be fine.
I promise.
( sighing )
I wish I could believe you.
Gamma...
Stop spinning.
You're not supposed to spin.
How am I supposed to keep you from...?
( grunting )
It's all in the wrist.
I-I think I pulled a muscle.
Oh, maybe we should take a break.
Good idea.
Draft, please. Abby?
Oh, can I have a club soda?
Okay.
So, uh, next time I choose the sport.
Something more civilized.
Ah, such as...?
There's a pool table at my hotel.
Your hotel?
Yeah. I don't own it.
I just-just live there.
You live in a hotel?
Yeah. As a doctor.
I take care of the tourists
they give me a break on the rent.
It's a good deal.
I mean, maid service, laundry, amenities...
( laughing ): It's-it's great.
You'll have to come see it.
Your hotel room.
Yeah.
I-I mean, I mean, no.
I'd never ask such a thing of a lady.
Especially after just one kiss.
Uh, no, I should hope not.
Now, of course, that makes it two.
Come on. Rematch.
We out of here or not?
Yeah. After we talk.
About what?
Your mom says you been hanging out a lot lately.
So?
So, she worries about you.
She worries about everything.
That's what she does.
You got new friends?
A new girl.
That's it.
Using a condom?
Uncle Peter...
I'm serious.
( sighing )
I'm not stupid.
Good.
I'm not doing anything, all right?
It's just...
I'm a man, you know?
And my folks just can't get used to it, that's all.
Well, maybe they would
if you treated them with respect.
You mean do what they say.
Look, sometimes you got to do what you don't want to do.
That's part of being a man.
Peter
do you have a minute?
Uh, yeah, hold on a sec, okay?
Just... just do what your mother says, all right?
That job's yours if you want it.
Are you serious?
You're a full surgical attending
on the academic track.
( laughing )
I'm so happy for you.
What's all of the celebrating about?
I got a job.
That's great.
Yeah. Elizabeth pulled some strings
with a friend of hers.
Where?
Hahnemann. They made me a full attending.
In Philadelphia.
Anyway, um, he's expecting your call.
Oh, right, right. Thanks.
Sure.
Well, I didn't have much of a choice.
I mean, I'm being blackballed here.
When will I see you?
Well, it's only an hour by air.
We'll, uh, work something out.
I guess so.
You coming home with us?
No, no, I got to make a stop.
Can you do me a favor and take him?
Of course.
( growling noise )
I'll, uh, I'll call you.
Okay.
What?
All I'm saying is
you were at four, and then you were at six.
That's because I scored very quickly.
You're a bad sport.
I can't handle losing to a girl, okay?
Oh, no.
I'm kidding.
I actually enjoy losing to you, Abby.
Thank you. Thank you.
That's much better.
Your hands are freezing.
You want to catch a cab?
Nah. This is strolling weather in Minnesota.
Is that where home is?
( grunting )
Luka...
Give me your purse.
Give me the purse.
Give me the damn...
Give me the purse!
( grunting )
Stop. Luka, stop!
Stop it!
( grunts )
You okay, Doctor Greene?
I thought you said this was a no-check league.
There's no such thing as a no-check league.
Thanks for the tip.
Hi, I thought you'd left.
Well, briefly.
You know, you don't need to finish your shift.
I've still got a couple hours left.
Carter, I think that you'd be better served
by taking it easy...
I'll go to a meeting after my shift's over
if that's okay with you?
I need to finish.
All right, but not too much.
Keep it to minor medical.
Thank you.
Have a nice night.
You, too.
Kovac: What's open?
Trauma two.
Elizabeth: I thought you two went home.
This guy attacked us.
Blunt head trauma with LOC, intubated
for a GCS of eight.
Two seizures en route.
He's had four of ativan.
Luka, you're bleeding.
I'm all right.
B.P. 180/100.
I'll take it from here.
Luka.
Get someone to take care of him.
Hey, Carter, I need you in here.
Dr. Weaver doesn't want me...
I don't care-- get in here now.
We've got a major head trauma.
On my count, one, two, three.
He's seizing.
Two of ativan.
CBC, chem panel, coags, type and cross for four.
Okay, give me some suction now.
He's vomiting.
Get x-ray in here for a c-spine.
All right, I'll stabilize the neck.
Ativan's on board.
Still seizing.
Hey, Carla.
Peter.
Uh, we need to talk.
Here, okay?
We're really busy tonight.
Sure.
Table eight first.
I called the hospital, they said Reese
could stay until the end of the month.
Good, that gives us a little more time
to find another daycare center.
It's going to be hard
finding a place he loves more.
Yeah, I know.
Listen, uh, I just got an attending position
at Hahnemann in Philadelphia.
Really?
Yeah.
Good for you.
So, we just need to work out
Reese's visitation schedule.
Maybe he could fly down
every other weekend, or something.
I'm sorry.
You're not really suggesting
that I put my son on a plane by himself, are you?
Carla, we have joint custody.
In Chicago.
I already took the job.
Um, wish that'd worked for me
when I wanted to move.
What are you talking about?
That was Germany-- That's nine hours away.
That's completely different.
No, it is completely the same.
What is this about, payback?
No, this is about our agreement.
Now, either you stay local or you give up custody.
I can't find a decent position here.
Oh, that's right.
You have your career to think of.
The rest of us just have jobs.
Table six needs more bread.
This is the only way for me to keep the momentum going.
Yes, and Germany was Roger's.
No, Carla, I'm asking you not to do this.
I'm not doing anything.
I'm just playing by your rules.
( gasps )
Looks pretty deep.
You need suturing.
Okay.
Someone should sew it up, Luka.
I'm okay.
Dr. Kovac?
Detective Stetler.
Can I have a moment?
Seizing stopped at 21:42.
Lateral neck looks good.
I need some more kerlex. He's soaked through these.
Whoa, we got a pumper!
Curved kelly.
Pressure's sky-high, 260/140.
Pulse down to 42.
Stop the nipride.
Blown right pupil, he's herniating.
80 of mannitol, prep for a posterior burr hole.
Hurry up, Carter, I need you to assist.
Perforator drill with a chisel-point bit.
Damn it, Carter, tie that off.
I'm trying!
Well, stick a finger on it, for God's sake.
V-tach, no pulse.
Starting chest compressions.
Charge to 200.
Carter, can you grab the paddles.
I'm controlling the bleeder.
Elizabeth: Get a pressure dressing on it, for God's sake.
Give me those four-by-fours.
Haleh, I need that drill.
Come on, come on.
Okay.
Clear.
After he hit you from behind, what happened?
I went down.
Did he take your wallet?
Yeah.
And you felt your life was endangered?
Mine, and hers.
Did he threaten to hurt you?
I'm not sure.
Did he say, "Give me your money or I'll kill you"?
Anything like that?
He had a pipe.
He was going after Abby.
And you can corroborate this?
Yeah.
Okay.
Let's wait and see what happens.
Seems pretty clear it was self-defense.
Shouldn't be a problem, Doc.
There, that's the inner table.
Irrigate the bone dust.
Looks like a subdural.
More irrigation, Carter, 11 blade.
Five minutes since the last epi.
Give another amp.
Opening the dura.
Get ready to suction.
Can you see the source?
No.
Let's just pack it off.
What's the rhythm?
Haleh: V-fib.
Charge to 300.
I need saline gauze.
Clear.
Sinus brady at 50.
Got a pulse. Excellent.
You decompressed the brain.
Amp of atropine, let's check the pupils.
Seizing again.
Damn it. More atropine?
He's maxed out at 20.
How about phenobarb?
Let's go with pentobarb 200, slow I.V. push.
That'll induce a coma, you know.
It's either that, or watch him die.
Luka, Abby told me about what happened.
Can I take a look?
It's superficial.
Did you lose consciousness?
For a moment, yeah.
Come on, let's fix you up.
No.
Do you have a headache?
Leave me alone!
I-I'm fine, okay?
I-I'm fine.
Elizabeth: Clear.
Haleh: Still V-fib.
Charge to 360.
How long's the bretylium been on board?
Five minutes.
Clear.
Haleh: Asystole, what now?
( sighs )
Open up the dopamine.
It's been 45 minutes.
I know.
Luka.
Luka, wait.
Luka, wait!
