Previously on ER.
Abby, your mother needs hospitalization
not a road trip with you and Carter.
Yeah, Luka, we're doing it for the fun of it.
She's been suicidal?
If you count attempted suicide.
Maggie? Maggie, can you hear me?
Maggie!
( groaning )
Did she take something?
I don't know. Sit her up.
She took something.
Where'd she get it?
Call the paramedics.
Breaths are shallow, but her airway's clear.
She's seizing! Oh, watch the tube.
Somebody help me keep her head steady. Hold on, hold on.
( alarms beeping )
Hi. I'm looking for Carl Ferris.
He's not in his room.
How much longer?
Where's the damn ambulance?
They're on their way.
What's the problem?
I'm a doctor.
Well, then, get in here!
I think this guy's
having a heart attack.
Make way! Doctor coming in!
Bernice, shake a leg.
Mr. Ferris, are you having pain in your chest?
He says yes.
It's like someone's squeezing his heart.
No, no, no, no.
It's more like he's been punched in the chest.
When did it start?
A few hours ago.
Okay, give me your stethoscope.
Let's sit him up, come on.
Here we go, here we go.
( groans )
He needs oxygen.
WOMAN: We're board and care.
We don't have any.
Jerry, I need your oxygen.
Hey, get your hands off that!
Hey, hey, that's mine.
How am I supposed to breathe now?
Ah, he's in CHF.
Oh, CHF. NURSE: What's that?
Congestive heart failure.
I thought you were a nurse.
I just take blood pressures.
I know CPR.
PICKMAN: Dr. Benton.
Ah, good, he's in rapid a-fib.
Let's start a line...
Oh, my God... ...and push 20 of diltiazem.
We can't take your orders unless
you stay with us all the way.
All right, uh, five liters O2 on a nasal cannula.
Let's get him on the gurney, nice and easy.
Hang in there, Carl.
You're going to be fine, Carl.
Lungs are wet--
I want another nitro spray in five minutes.
40 of lasix and titrate up to ten of morphine.
Let's keep his pressure above 100.
( siren wailing )
Lasix and MS.
What's happening?
You've got fluid in your lungs
so I'm giving you a diuretic.
Ten of morphine.
This morphine might make you
a little drowsy, okay?
Pressure's holding at 110, pulse down to 100.
Am I going to make it?
You're doing just fine
Mr. Ferris, you're going to be...
( loud bang )
Anybody hurt?
Uh, no, I don't think so. MORALES: No.
Are you okay?
Yes.
What happened?
He came out of nowhere.
Sir, does your neck hurt? A little.
All right, let's get a collar for him.
He pulled out right in front of me.
I didn't see you.
All right, sir, don't move your head.
I had my lights and sirens on.
I'll go call another rig.
No, get another backboard, we'll take him with us.
WOMAN: I don't wash my hair.
I-I never wash my hair.
You shouldn't wash your hair every day.
It's get rid of the natural oils.
Hi, Mom.
Hey, Abby.
What are you doing here?
I'm on break.
If you comb it too much
you'll damage the ends.
How're you feeling?
Better.
Now it's full of static electricity.
Winona, your hair looks fine, really.
I don't think she knows where she is.
NURSE: Time for your meds, Maggie.
I think Winona needs to go to the bathroom.
She gets agitated when she has to pee.
NURSE: Thanks.
You need to use the bathroom, Winona?
I need to fix my hair.
Okay, I'll be right back.
Um...
you're going to have to stay here for a little while.
They're keeping you
on a 90-day hold. I'm sorry.
No... No, it's me.
I should never have put you through all of that.
It's me.
I'm sorry.
Trauma panel, c-spine, chest and pelvis.
Let's prep the left chest.
Where does it hurt, sir?
My chest and stomach.
Any headache or neck pain?
No.
He was helmeted--
no loss of consciousness.
Sir, is there someone you'd like us to call?
My ma.
Okay, let's infiltrate with lidocaine, Malucci.
Where're you going?
I'll be right back.
CBC, chem panel, cardiac enzymes
12-lead EKG and a portable chest.
He was in a-fib with a rapid ventricular response.
Heart rate's 88 and irregular.
He's in CHF.
How about some lasix?
We gave him 40.
How are you doing, Mr. Ferris?
You tell me.
Don't worry, you're going to be okay.
Listen, I've got to go and work
on the crash victim, but Dr. Kovac here's
going to take care of you, okay?
Yeah, thanks.
Let me see that EKG as soon as it comes back.
Lidocaine's on board, second liter of saline is up.
Do the ultrasound, Malucci.
MARQUEZ: Pulse ox 89 on two liters.
Okay, up it to five. 32-French. Thank you.
Uh... damn it.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
MARQUEZ: Pulse ox down to 85.
MALUCCI: Hurt yourself? No.
I can give it a try if you want.
I'm fine, I'm fine.
Just open up another tube.
Can you shove this under the desk for me?
It belongs to Mr. Simpson in Exam Four.
You don't want to know.
Abby, shouldn't you be at the courthouse?
Huh?
Your mother has just been transported
to her commitment hearing.
Aren't you supposed to testify?
Uh, what commitment hearing?
The State Attorney's office was supposed to call you.
Well, nobody called me.
Okay, your mother has contested
her certificate of commitment.
By law, she's entitled
to a hearing in front of a judge.
And what, he could release her?
Technically.
The attempted suicide is
a really good argument for a 90-day hold
but, uh, since you witnessed it...
Wait, wait. When is this happening?
11:15, County courthouse.
BENTON: Tube placement looks good.
Pressure's up to 120.
I'll meet you at the elevator.
How are we doing in here?
Chest pain is zero after two more nitros.
Where are you admitting him?
He's fifth in line for tele admit.
How long will that take?
Sometimes, we rule out MI
and send them home from here.
He spent two days in E.R. last time.
It's okay, Mr. Ferris.
I'll sort this out
and get you a bed as soon as I'm done in the O.R.
Thank you, Peter.
Sure.
ABBY: She sat there and let me apologize to her
and she knew she was going to court today.
Maybe she didn't want to get you involved.
Maybe she doesn't want me to testify against her.
Are you? I don't know.
I have to find this State's Attorney
whoever that is.
I'll go with you.
No.
I can get somebody to cover for a few hours.
I-I can't wait.
You shouldn't have to do this by yourself.
I shouldn't have to do this at all.
You'd rather Carter go with you?
What's that supposed to mean?
He helped you deal with her before.
I'll call you later.
Hey, nice basket.
Is that for Greene and Corday?
Yeah, and you still owe $50.
Fifty, for that?
We got them a baby video monitor.
Nurses pitched in 20, doctors 50.
I have to pay the same as Benton and Weaver?
You're a doctor, aren't you?
That's debatable.
Cleo, can you take a lady in Exam Two?
I'm already juggling seven patients.
Well, I'll trade you one.
Then, can you lend me 50 bucks?
Hey, Jing-Mei, I got a woman in Exam Two
says she hasn't had a bowel movement
in over a week-- she needs a rectal.
So? Do it.
Uh, she threatened to Mace me.
You should be used to that.
I'm serious. You have to take this one.
No, forget it.
What's the problem here?
Uh, I don't know, maybe it's your BS.
Or maybe it's PMS.
Excuse me? Look, I'm just saying that...
You're just saying that it's okay for you
to dump a patient on me and it's okay for you
to refuse any hand-offs, but the minute I do
it's because I'm a bitch Yeah, all right.
or it's because it's that time of the month.
Well, you know what? Screw you, Dave.
Okay, forget I asked. I'll leave, yeah.
I'm tired of your crap.
Another 2-oh silk.
Pressure's holding at 120.
ROMANO: Dr. Benton, what are you
still doing in here?
The gastrosplenic and splenorenal
were very vascular.
Are you suturing with your left hand?
Yeah, I'm ambidextrous.
The hell you are.
I've seen third-year medical students sew faster.
Let me see you use your right hand.
Uh-huh.
Sterile gloves.
What happened?
How?
Fell to an outstretched hand.
Ah! Perfect mechanism for a fracture.
Get your hands out of the field, Peter.
What?
Hold them out, like this, fingers spread.
( sighs )
The radius and ulna feel okay.
I'm fine.
Ouch.
Point tenderness at the snuff box.
We call that a scaphoid fracture-- scrub out.
I can finish this case, I'm almost done.
No, Peter, you are done. If this poor devil
had some acceptable complication
and his lawyers discovered his surgeon was operating
with his wrong hand, we both might as well bend over.
Be thankful you're not a racehorse, Peter.
I'd have to take you out and shoot you.
Dr. Benton, your wife's here.
What? I'm not married.
I'm sorry. Carla.
Where is she?
How long have you had the pain?
A few hours.
When was your last period?
Seven weeks ago.
When I didn't get it, I did a home pregnancy test.
It was positive. That was two weeks ago.
Have you seen your gynecologist?
Do you have a history of migraines, Mr. Granger?
Yeah.
And are you on any medication?
Inderal and sumatriptan, but they're not helping.
It just keeps getting worse.
Hmm.
So, where's the pain?
Uh, it's all around my right eye.
How many other pregnancies?
This is my first.
Am I having a miscarriage?
I can't tell that until we do some tests
and a pelvic exam.
It pounds with every heartbeat.
I-I think it's the numbers.
What? You're an accountant or something?
No, no, binary numbers, ones and zeroes, electronic data.
80, 146, 72, 109, 80, 146, 72, 109...
Deb?
What?
80, 146, 72, 109, 80, 146, 72, 109...
Freaky.
( Malucci yelling )
( groaning )
What happened?
TAKATA: Patient Maced him.
You happy now?
Yosh, flush out his eyes with saline.
Call security.
Give me that pepper spray.
Hey! Give it to me.
Do you want me to have you arrested?
I told him not to touch me
or my personal possessions.
Dr. Malucci was only trying to help you.
You could have seriously injured him.
Well, I hope I taught him some manners.
Have you been in this E.R. before?
I've been in a lot of E.R.s
and to be honest, this one's substandard.
Oh, well, maybe you'd feel more comfortable in jail.
You know they used to drown redheaded babies
in the old days
'cause they thought they were evil.
And they used to burn crazy people
who they thought were witches.
I just need something to help me go to the bathroom.
Is that too much to ask?
She's historically non-med compliant?
Well, she has phases
but this time she's been off for about, um...
six months.
How many serious suicide attempts?
Um... this one... this one makes three.
Don't you... don't you know this stuff?
I'm just reviewing before we go in.
I got the case this morning.
Hey, Marty, you got Wynenski?
Wyczenski.
Wyczenski, sorry.
Oh, yeah, drug overdose.
Oh, so you're stipulating
to an attempted suicide, right?
No, but nice try.
No intent.
I'm sorry, what was your name again?
Um, Abby.
Did you witness the attempt, Abby?
I was with her.
She took the pills in a gas station bathroom.
Who, who was that?
Your mother's public defender.
Since they're not
willing to stipulate, I'll have you testify
to the intention and the lethality of the intent.
N-nobody called me to testify.
That's why you're here, right?
You want your mother to stay committed?
Well, yes, but-but, but somebody should...
Okay, you're here now.
Come on.
NESMITH: We pretty much have it all...
Just answer all the questions
that we talked about.
CARLA: Peter.
I thought you would never get here.
What happened?
I was carrying Reese.
I stepped in a grate in the sidewalk
and twisted my ankle so bad
I thought I was going to pass out.
Was he hurt?
Hey... were you hurt?
He scraped his elbow.
He's okay.
Carla, you were carrying him
while you were wearing these?
They said they want to operate.
I kept telling them, call you.
I do not want an operation.
Yeah, well, you have a trimalleolar fracture.
Going to have
to put a screw in it to align it
to make sure that it heals properly.
Can't you do it?
No, you need an orthopedic surgeon.
Well, how long am I going to have to stay in the hospital?
A couple of days.
I can't.
Roger's out of town.
Is he ever around?
We haven't been getting along too well lately.
Which is one of the reasons
why I cannot deal with this right now.
I'll tell you what.
I'll take Reese off your hands
for a couple of days till you get back on your feet.
I don't think that's going to be
a very good idea.
Why not?
Jackie told me that you moved in with that girlfriend.
And that's a problem?
I don't think it's a very good environment for our son.
Carla, give me a break.
She's a pediatrician.
I'm just saying she don't seem
like the motherly type.
DERAAD: She was admitted to the ward following a suicide attempt.
NESMITH: That's not what I asked.
Has Mrs. Wyczenski shown any signs of suicidality
since her admission?
Not that I'm aware of.
And she's voluntarily submitted for all treatments
and medications recommended by your department.
Is that correct? Yes, I believe that's correct.
No further questions, Your Honor.
Thank you, Doctor.
Does the State have anymore witnesses?
RIFKIN: Yes, Your Honor.
People call Abby Lockhart.
TOMMY: Uh, hold on.
Uh, I was next, I was next.
It's-it's my... it's my turn.
The testimony you shall give
in the case now pending
before this court shall be the truth
the whole truth, and nothing but the truth
so help you God?
Yes.
MOSES: Please have a seat.
It's my turn.
Miss Lockhart, you're Mrs. Wyzcenski's daughter.
TOMMY: I've been waiting
and now this bitch takes my turn?!
Miss Lockhart?
Yes. And as such
you support a mandatory hold for your mother
because you believe she might attempt
to kill herself again.
Objection. Leading.
MOSES: Sustained.
RIFKIN: Miss Lockhart, do you feel
that your mother should be involuntarily committed?
Yes.
Why?
Oh, no, no. There are no such things as cuts.
No such thing as cuts! Russell?
No back cuts
no front cuts. No, no, it's my turn.
No, that bitch stole my spot.
You take her. You take her out!
I didn't do anything!
I didn't do anything!
She took my spot!
No!
Approximately 38-year-old male pushed down in an altercation.
No LOC. Point of tenderness to midshaft clavicle.
I thought you said there was no LOC.
He's faking. Vitals are completely normal
and there's no chest or belly pain.
What's his name?
He refused to give us his name.
Said it was O. Possum.
Ow!
His name's Bret Paxton, and he's crazy.
What's this?
Human bite to the left hand, no other injuries.
I'm going to need stitches, thanks to this freak.
Hey, hey, hey! Cool it, cool it. Okay, okay.
Take the possum to Exam One, and get the kangaroo to Sutures.
Come on.
Ah! God! Okay, okay, okay.
You need to flush them out.
Yeah, well, you flushed enough already, okay?
Here you go.
You know I've never worn one of those.
Well, maybe it's time
you at least start dressing like a doctor.
Come on.
Yeah.
( giggles )
What? What?
Carter! Carter, she's bleeding out.
Noni?
Oh, God!
Hey, Noni, can you hear me? Wake up.
I can't find a radial pulse.
She's got a weak carotid.
Go get a gurney.
You're divorced, Mrs. Lockhart?
RIFKIN: Objection. Irrelevant.
NESMITH: Goes to living arrangements, Your Honor.
I'll allow it.
Yes.
And when was your divorce finalized?
Last summer.
Have you been dating anyone?
RIFKIN: Your Honor...
MOSES: Get to the point, Mr. Nesmith.
Your mother can be... eccentric
maybe a little embarrassing at times.
She suffers from a debilitating mood disorder.
Having her live with you
when trying to date would be
a major inconvenience, wouldn't it?
I-I've tried having her live with me before several times.
It doesn't work.
It doesn't work?
No. She stops taking her medication
she loses control and she disappears.
Does she look out of control to you?
She's on her meds now.
So sometimes she does take her medication.
She's only been taking them for a week.
But as long as she's med compliant, she's not a danger
to herself or anyone else.
She doesn't stay med compliant.
That wasn't my question.
Have you known your mother
to be a danger to herself while med compliant?
No, not usually.
And you think that locking her up
in a psychiatric facility
would be better for her than living with you?
I can't take care of her.
Can't or won't?
She tried to kill herself when she was with me.
Nonresponsive.
Please... just answer
the questions
Miss Lockhart. Well, tell him to ask them!
Miss Lockhart.
Are you okay?
Yes.
Would you like some water?
No, thank you.
B.P. 60 palp.
What's the hemocue?
Ten point eight.
Good. She's got a little reserve.
No fetal pole, no heartbeat.
Just blood and POCs.
That's an incomplete miscarriage.
Call OB, tell them she needs an D & C.
I'm going to do a pelvic
see if I can find some tissue in the os.
Carter... this is her boyfriend.
What happened?
Your girlfriend had a miscarriage
but it's incomplete.
She needs a D & C to stop the bleeding.
But she's going to be okay?
We need to get her pressure up.
She might need a transfusion.
I will speak with you
but after I get her stabilized.
Oh, God! Chuny, can you take him out?
Let's call for packed cells.
If her pressure's not up after two liters
hemocue every 30 minutes.
Is it true human bites are worse than dog bites?
Yeah, because of the virulence of the bacteria.
If germs infect a joint, it can cause scarring
which can limit your range of motion.
You don't want to lose your opposable thumb.
So... you guys rival mascots or something?
No, we were at
the Fur-turama Show.
It's a convention for Furries.
People who like to dress in animal costumes.
TERRENCE: He started it.
I think he'd been drinking.
One minute he was skritching me...
The next minute... Skritching?
Scratching, mock grooming.
It's sort of our version of a handshake.
Next thing you know, he's got his hand in my pouch
so I decked him.
I'm not into the weird stuff.
It makes me sick.
Uh, I never felt like myself.
I told the doctors that
and they never really listened to me.
They just keep giving me more pills.
NESMITH: And how do you feel now?
Better.
So you're no longer depressed?
No.
Did you try to kill yourself
during your last depressive episode?
I... took an overdose of sleeping pills, yes
but I never meant to kill myself.
She's lying.
Shh!
Why did you take so many pills?
Who in their right mind wants to...
drive from Oklahoma to Chicago, really?
I get carsick.
I just thought if-if...
if I could sleep, I'd be all right.
I-I took some pills.
( whispering ): She took 900 milligrams.
I didn't know they didn't work right away.
You know, I foolishly then took some more pills.
She took 900 milligrams.
That's 36 pills.
I-I know it-it was stupid.
I just thought if I could sleep, and, uh...
The next thing I know, I-I woke up in the hospital
but I... I never meant to hurt myself or-or anyone else.
Abby...
I'm so sorry.
I never meant to put you through that.
( snapping fingers )
Ask her where she got the pills.
She stole the pills.
MOSES: Mr. Rifkin...
could you please ask your witness to be quiet?
NESMITH: If your daughter's not prepared
to take you in, are you able to take care of yourself?
I always have.
I've always worked, always.
Do you have any money?
I have a few credit cards.
They're all canceled.
I mean it, Miss Lockhart.
Hemocue every 20 minutes.
Follow me.
VICTOR: What's happening?
She's going up to the O.R.
I removed some tissue from her cervix
and she's still bleeding
but it's slowed to the point where her pressure's okay.
Did you have to give her a blood transfusion?
We had to give her plasma
'cause her blood wasn't clotting properly.
Why isn't her blood clotting?
Uh, it could be a sign of liver disease.
Liver affects the clotting factors.
Has she ever had hepatitis?
No.
She drink alcohol every day?
No.
Tylenol? Any other medications?
Maybe some herbal stuff.
Mm-hmm.
What kind of herbal stuff?
Root extracts.
They're supposed to induce miscarriages.
Oh, I thought she, uh...
I thought she wanted this baby.
She didn't know.
How could she not know?
I gave them to her.
You what?
I put them in her tea for the last few days.
She didn't even ask me if I wanted the baby.
So you poisoned her?
I wasn't ready.
I thought she'd just...
What?
Bleed to death?
I didn't mean to make her sick.
( disgusted sigh )
No, man. You just meant to kill her baby.
You have a large tumor on your left ovary.
I came in here because I couldn't poop!
The tumor is large enough
that it's blocking your bowel movements.
Cancer, huh?
Well, well, well.
Every day comes with its own surprises.
What?
Nothing.
That's how I know you.
You're Princess Tafetta.
And-and you had that children's show
I used to watch all the time when I was little
and you always used to say
"Every day comes with its own surprises."
I don't think so.
It was you, and you worked
with those great puppets.
There was, um... Mojo
and-and Mr. Whiskers
and then, what was...?
Coconuts-- the chimpanzee in the sailor uniform.
We got that monkey from a lab
and we had to dress him in that stupid outfit
to hide his open sores.
We'll need to admit you and...
a gynecologist will want to see you
and start treatment right away.
No, thanks.
I don't like hospitals.
Look...
the tumor will only get worse, and you'll feel sicker.
Is there someone that we can call--
a family member, perhaps-- who will talk to you about this?
Nope.
Don't have any brothers or sisters
and never got married.
I was engaged once
to a man named Christopher Clemens.
He-he was going to be a-a famous jazz musician.
I was going to be a movie star.
Doesn't really matter now.
In the end, everybody dies alone, right?
ABBY: Excuse me?
Do you have a light?
Hey.
This is turning into a freaking disaster.
You did fine.
( laughs )
Whose covering for you?
Don't worry about it.
I'm not hungry.
She's asking for you.
Maybe you should talk to her.
What for?
You're the one that didn't want me to deal with her.
No.
I thought she needed hospitalization.
Why do you think I'm here?
'Cause you know she needs your help
even if she doesn't want it.
I thought you should eat something.
Thank you.
You lied.
You wanted to kill yourself.
I can't be committed.
Well, you need help, Mom
and I obviously don't know how
to help you.
I understand.
I don't want to be a burden to you, Abby.
I swear that's the truth
but I can't be committed.
So, what? You're just going to go out
and do this to yourself all over again?
You're just going to roll through the whole cycle?
No. Then what?
What? What are you going to do
differently this time?
I don't know.
I don't want to make any pro...
I don't want to break
any more promises to you, Abby.
I've put you through so much...
If you believed that, you would seek treatment.
I will. I just...
Can't be committed.
Right. Well...
Well... just forgive me
if I don't trust your judgment.
I would have found a way to try, Abby.
It's not your fault.
Nothing I do is your fault.
My company has this Christmas charity event.
One year the guy who always
dresses up for the kids got sick.
My boss made me put on this reindeer suit.
The kids went nuts.
The adults thought it was great
everybody was getting their picture taken with me...
Sounds almost fun.
It was a blast.
I used to be so shy.
But the suit gives you freedom.
It let's you do things you normally wouldn't do.
But I'm not a plushie or a fervert.
A what?
Ferverts like to wear their suits during sex.
And plushies are overly fond of stuffed animals.
What?
But not me, I just like the suit.
Some people still
disapprove and think it's wrong, but the truth is
I'm never happier than when I'm a kangaroo.
You have to rule out appendicitis
biliary disease, food poisoning...
Does she have a fever?
No, 98.8.
Good breath sounds.
What's that smell?
Oh, my god.
I've seen this before.
Get a surgical consult, I'll call DCFS.
No, it's a folk cure.
They heat a coin over a candle and drag it across the back.
Sometimes they dip the coins in essential oils.
Just because it's an ancient tradition
doesn't mean it's not child abuse.
The minty smell is probably oil of wintergreen.
It's got a high concentration of salicylates
could have caused aspirin toxicity.
Let's get a blood gas and a salicylate level.
You do that, I'm calling Family Services.
Will I be able to have more children?
Yes.
Noni, what your boyfriend did was really wrong.
You need to consider whether or not
you want to file criminal charges.
Victor loves me.
He just got scared.
That doesn't justify what he did.
I was so excited to be pregnant.
What do you want to do?
Mrs. Wyczenski, are you familiar
with reading directions and warnings
on over-the-counter medications?
Yes, I suppose so.
Would you please read the label on this?
I'm sorry, I don't have my reading glasses.
I can't see.
Allow me then. Okay.
"One tablet at bedtime
"may repeat in four hours if necessary.
"Do not exceed four tablets
in a 24-hour period."
You took 36 tablets, did you not?
I didn't have my reading glasses with me then either.
You took 36 pills
and you didn't intend to kill yourself?
I was depressed
but I didn't want to kill myself really.
Where did you get the pills?
Um, I got them at a convenience store.
How did you pay for them?
I didn't.
You stole them?
Objection.
Shoplifting has nothing to do with suicidality.
Goes to intent.
Get to it quickly.
Why did you have to steal them?
Why didn't you ask your daughter
to pay for them?
She wouldn't have.
Why not?
She was worried.
Worried that you'd try to kill yourself?
She worries when I get depressed.
Because during other depressions
you have attempted suicide?
In fact
you've been committed on two other occasions
for attempted suicide, haven't you?
In '83 and 1974?
Yes.
What method did you use for those attempts?
Carbon monoxide poisoning.
In '83...
What about in '74?
I took some pills.
Did you coin Lynda because she's sick?
( speaks Cantonese )
I don't understand what you're saying.
Can someone get me a translator?
Where's Chen?
Hey, look who's here.
Your cardiac enzymes are back, Mr. Ferris.
You had a small heart attack.
What did I tell you, huh?
I know my heart attacks.
I guess I'm lucky you showed up when you did.
Hey, we kept you alive till he got there.
Well, if there are any blockages around the heart
we'll open it with an angioplasty balloon
and keep it open with a stent.
Thank you, Peter.
Not bad for a guy
who blew up a rubber in your classroom, huh?
( laughing )
All right, I'll check on you later.
Hi, Reese.
What are you doing here?
His mother broke her ankle
so waiting to be admitted to surgery.
Ouch. Could you take a look at a belly? Sure.
Excuse me.
You hurt your hand?
( speaking agitatedly )
I don't understand what you're saying.
Could you just...
just calm down, all right?
She seems pretty upset.
You think?
( speaks Cantonese )
( speaks Cantonese )
Hey, you speak Cantonese?
You think?
I was a translator in the Army.
Could you ask her
what she used to treat her granddaughter?
I think I can manage.
Malucci.
Her labs are back. Electrolytes are normal.
No anion gap. pH 7.4.
Salicylate level's 10 milligrams per deciliter.
That's not in the toxic range.
Nope. And her liver function tests
and her head CT are also normal.
Well, she's got one hell of a case of gastroenteritis.
We've already given her 10 of Compazine
and she's still puking.
Peter's looking at her now.
I'll let you know what he finds.
Well, anything?
She says she used hot coins and liniment.
Yeah, I know that, but did she say why?
She's possessed.
Grandma or the girl?
What are we talking here, demonic spirits?
No, more like evil thoughts.
Sinful behavior, you know, S-E-X.
Faye? Faye?
Hey, Faye, where are you going?
Where are you going?
I got a garden party at 6:00.
Yeah, you need to be admitted to the hospital
so you can start treatment.
We both know that's not going to happen.
You can't leave.
I've never been one for hospitals.
They smell funny.
Besides, I already signed the papers.
Will you at least speak to a psychiatrist?
Mr. Whiskers.
Take it.
No, I can't, really.
Look, honey...
I'm going to be dead in a few months
you said so yourself.
It'd make me feel better knowing he's with someone
who'll appreciate him.
Stupid puppet ended my acting career...
but it did buy my first house.
Thank you.
Every day comes with it's own surprises.
NESMITH: A statement
from a former employer of Mrs. Wyczenski states...
Sit down, Marty, I don't need any more statements.
Your Honor, the employer affirms...
We've spent enough time on this already.
Let's move on.
Mrs. Wyczenski's
released on her own recognizance.
What's next, Mike?
Willie Goldman, ten-day hold.
Wait. Is this yours, Marty?
Yes, it is, Your Honor.
So I can just go? Yes, you can go.
Wait a minute, that's it?
I'm sorry.
No, she's, she's letting her go?
Is the respondent here?
Yes, he is, Your Honor.
She needs hospitalization.
I'm not debating it with you, Miss.
You've had a chance to counsel your client?
I have. Yeah, but I mean--
We did all we can, I'm sorry.
We have to move on.
Oh, okay.
That's good, move on. All of you should just move on.
We wouldn't want to waste one more minute on this.
I've only been dealing with her for 30 years.
Russell... You didn't have to drive her to the hospital
or pour charcoal down her throat
or breathe for her--
This way please.
I'm getting my coat.
Just don't touch her.
She's not your mother, right? What do you care?
The rest of us will just take care of her
and maybe... maybe if you're really lucky next time
you won't have to hear the case at all because
maybe next time you'll do it right
and then it'll be the coroner's problem.
Biliary colic? No.
I'm about ready to give up.
Did you check for pyelo? Yes, and hepatitis.
Get an X ray of that wrist if it's bothering you.
No, I'm fine.
What are you going to do with Reese?
I left a message on Jackie's machine.
Hopefully, she can pick him up on her way home from work.
Why don't you take him home?
You can't doing anything with that hand.
I know, but I want to stick around until Ferris gets a room.
Then I'll take him home with me.
I'm off in an hour.
No, I don't want you to have to do that.
I don't mind.
We'll have fun, right?
All right, yeah, thanks.
You have to let me take an X ray of that wrist.
Oh, come on, you're resorting to blackmail?
What the hell's that?
Hey, I remember Mr. Whiskers.
Where'd you get him? On eBay?
Princess Taffeta was the patient who maced you.
Wow, that's probably worth some money.
Looks like roadkill.
Malucci...
there's a priest in with Lynda An?
Uh, yeah, he's doing an exorcism.
Excuse me?
Actually, he's a chaplain
and it's more of a blessing, but it should work.
I think her problem's psychosomatic.
Based on your vast knowledge of psychiatry?
That and the fact that her grandma caught her
messing around with her boyfriend.
It's all about guilt. Really?
Hey, how's it working out?
I think she's going to be fine.
MALUCCI: How we feeling, Lynda?
LYNDA: Hungry.
No more nausea? No. I'm starving.
If she's eating solid foods and not vomiting
she's ready to go home.
I'd like to admit you-- keep you in overnight
for observation and rehydration.
Could I get a pizza or something?
We'll see what we can work out, okay?
Nice catch, huh?
I'd still like to do some more tests.
Why? Because you can't admit that a surgeon
and pediatrician got outsmarted by Goomba.
Yeah. Don't sweat it.
You're not the first to be deceived
by my rugged good looks and boyish charm.
LEGASPI: "By signing, you acknowledge that your doctors feel
"it's in your best interest to remain hospitalized
"and that you accept and understand
"by leaving against medical advice
you risk a deterioration of your psychiatric symptoms."
What about my, my meds?
Can I have a prescription?
I will give you three days worth.
I want to see you Monday.
If you're doing well
then I'll give you a week's worth.
Okay.
Okay, what? What does that mean?
Could I, could I call you?
Sure.
All right.
You can call me anytime.
You can call me just to talk.
Okay.
I brought some stuff from that motel room
and some stuff you left in my apartment.
Thank you.
Figured out where you're going?
Yeah, um...
Dr. Legaspi gave me the name of a shelter.
I'm-I'm going to go there
for a few days.
Okay.
Okay.
Good luck, Maggie.
See you next time.
Next time?
Yeah, whenever it is.
Wherever it is.
Maybe there won't be a next time.
You're going to walk out of here on your own
one week after swallowing a pharmacy
as close to death as I see people get
and you think there's not going to be a next time?
I hope not. I... I don't know.
I, I promised myself
I wouldn't make any promises.
You know... when I saw you
seizing on that table
I thought... This is it, this is it.
This is how it's all going to end.
I am going to watch my mother die.
And I still might not be wrong about that.
It could still end that way
and there's not one thing I can do about it.
But I'll show up
because you will always have that power over me.
I'll will show up, and I will try to stop it.
I love you, Mom.
How long is she going to be in the hospital?
We're going to keep her overnight for observation.
Can I see her?
I don't think so. I want to talk to her.
Well, she prefers to be alone, and you need
Is this the guy? to speak to the police.
This is the guy. Wait a second.
This is between me and Noni.
What did you do, talk her into pressing charges?
Didn't have to. Murder's a felony.
Let's go. It wasn't even a baby.
Yeah, can I speak with Dr. Quaid?
Mm, Daryl Quaid.
Well, he gave me his card
and it has this number on it.
Right.
Okay. Thanks.
One of those days, huh?
Mm.
Ever find out what happened with your numbers guy?
Was he some kind of a savant or something?
Don't know.
He left with this doctor from the VA
and I just called to follow up
but there's no record of my patient
or the doctor that I let him leave with.
What are you going to do?
Same thing I always do: hit a bar, get drunk
go home with some stranger and have wild sex
until I pass out from sheer exhaustion.
Take-out and a hot bath? Yeah.
Hey, Randi, have you seen my puppet?
Your what? Mr. Whiskers.
I didn't touch it, trust me.
I can't believe that somebody would steal that?
So were do you guys want Super Larry?
Uh, Exam One.
Oh, the possum guy's still in there.
Okay, well, let's get rid of him.
Mr. Paxton?
Mr. Paxton, you still playing possum?
Mr. Whiskers?
Whatever happened to Mrs. Linstrom?
Retired.
She was mean.
That woman was born mean.
Even the other teachers were afraid of her.
( sighs )
I'm sure you thought the same of me
with all those detentions I gave you.
Hey.
Your detentions steered me towards medicine, so.
I'm glad to have played a small role in it.
I'm proud of you, Peter.
Yeah, well, thanks a lot.
And you should be proud of yourself.
I am.
Look, don't get me wrong
but sometimes it's hard
when people's lives depend on your success
and you're not always successful.
Sometimes you...
( sighs )
sometimes you get so tired
that you start forgetting what's important.
And what is that?
Two things in this world I'm certain of:
my love for my son
and my skills as a surgeon.
I'm a father...
I'm a doctor.
At the end of the day, that's enough for me.
And what about a teacher?
No, that was never one of my greatest skills.
The only skill you need to be a good teacher
is to care.
That's all.
And who knows...
maybe one of your students
will wind up saving your ass one day.
( chuckles )
Hi.
Hi.
I, uh, heard you were here, but I haven't seen you.
Uh, yeah.
Most of my day's spent in the jail ward.
I'm sorry.
I was glad to hear that the charges were dropped.
Shannon Wallace decided to tell the truth
after she got the treatment that she needed.
That's good.
What do you want, Kerry?
I thought you might be hungry.
No.
No, I'm not.
And I have a ton of work to do, so.
Right, well, uh, if your change your mind
here's some Kung Pao chicken from George's.
KOVAC: Abby?
Are you okay in there?
You want some dinner?
You need to eat.
You've been watching Martha Stewart again?
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm. ( chuckles )
Thank you.
For what?
For being there.
And here.
Everything.
( knocking on door )
Is the food here?
What food? I'm making dinner by myself.
( laughs ) Why are you laughing?
I just hope you didn't order from that Thai place again.
KOVAC: Who is it?
Abby?
