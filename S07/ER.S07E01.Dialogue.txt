Previously on E.R.:
There's a drug rehab center
in Atlanta that specializes
in treating doctors with addiction.
Forget it. Forget it.
This is your only chance, Carter.
Great. I quit.
...like your cousin-- some babbling gork...
( crying )
It's all right, man.
Name?
Dr. Carter.
Somebody should have called ahead.
Okay.
All the information is confidential
and you can have a seat over there.
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.
90 days?
This is a three-month program?
Yeah, I-I-I guess so.
Can you send me some clothes
or they issue prison garb here?
You okay?
This pen doesn't work.
Do you have a pen?
He's diaphoretic and cramping.
We'll take care of it.
When?
Soon.
He's got the tremors. He needs something.
You should go now.
What?
It's important that he checks himself in.
Right.
Mm-hmm.
There.
You, uh...
You good from here?
Yeah, I guess so.
Carter, you can do this.
( heavy breathing )
Hey, you got any Compazine?
I'll give you something after group if you're still nauseous.
Group?
Yeah. For therapy.
When is that?
Now.
In the middle of the night?
The entire group meets whenever a new patient arrives.
Ready?
No, I need to lie down.
You'll make it.
Group therapy is not what I need right now.
If you want to be in the program
you do the program.
Otherwise you can leave
and when you want a fix
you can score down on Tenth and Piedmont
which is six blocks down, one block over.
Those guys are out there all night.
( clearing throat )
John Carter?
Yes.
Security! Security!
See, I put the needle down!
I said no needles!
I told you to put him in restraints.
I did. Lily, could you get extra security down here?
On their way!
Did you give him Haldol?
What do you think the needle was for?
The toilet's plugged in the men's restroom.
So unplug it.
Hey, Malucci, what is Mr. Hunter still doing out here?
Transpo's backed up.
Half the guys staged a sympathy sick-out
to support the janitors.
Then take him down there yourself.
Why can't we just give these guys their raise?
I'll recommend you for the negotiating committee.
What about the maintenance closet?
I don't know, Malik!
Use some initiative-- pick the lock.
Take a fire axe to it. I really don't care.
Oh, my God, can somebody please
put Mr. Spencer in an exam room?
Excuse me. What?
We've been waiting here for a while.
Shouldn't we
be doing something?
Any plumbing experience?
Well, what happened?
You know what, Mark?
Just don't start with me, okay?
Custodial staff is on strike.
Yeah, so they had to destroy the Admit Desk?
This is a remodel-- open floor plan.
It's supposed to be safer.
I've already scratched myself on a nail twice.
Make sure you update your tetanus.
Where are my fans?
Working on it.
What's the deal?
I don't know. You know, the construction workers
won't cross the picket line.
Oh, you mean those three guys
I saw out there with signs?
Hey, Mark, how was your vacation?
It was good.
Did you go anywhere?
Wisconsin Dells.
Come on, let's go back to your room.
She got a needle! I seen it!
Where's the board supposed to go?
Don't ask.
I don't like needles.
Give him another...
We're not supposed to talk about it.
Cleo, you got that covered?
I hate needles!
Hi, Dr. Greene.
Take it easy. Let's Go.
Relax, dude.
Is it me or do those med students
look like 12-year-olds?
How long have they been waiting?
Three hours.
Two and a half.
I'll take them.
Be my guest, but make sure you see some patients.
Malik?
What?
Malik!
Strong, steady heartbeat.
The amount of amniotic fluid is normal.
Everything looks fine.
Now, I've got a good angle here if you want to know the sex.
Sure.
You are having a boy.
Congratulations.
Thank you.
Your, um... blood sugar level is normal
but you're a little anemic.
You taking any iron?
Yes.
Have you arranged with Kerry to take some time off
after the baby's born?
Oh, uh, no, not yet.
You still have time.
Actually, I haven't told anyone yet.
I think you may want to.
I don't see how you can keep this a secret much longer.
Yeah.
So what are you supposed to talk about
in an exit interview anyway?
That you don't have all the answers.
No argument there.
You scared?
I don't remember the last time I wasn't scared.
Good.
What? That's it?
"Be afraid. Be very afraid"?
We're like the Army, okay?
We break you down, make you face your addiction
and we build you up.
You start to function.
You feel healthy, confident.
Don't worry.
Pride is what got me into this.
Yeah. And deep down you feel like this
is something that just happened to you, huh?
No, I took responsibility, I take responsibility.
I'm going to get my life back.
It's not going to beat me.
Yeah.
That's what I thought--
the first three times.
But I hope you do.
Day or night
if you ever need to talk.
Are we done?
You're just getting started.
Is this where I'm supposed to say thank you?
Some people do.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Someone's still on vacation time, I see.
Sorry.
That's all right.
Peter was helping me hang this straight.
How's that look?
Great.
You finish the interview?
I was just getting to that.
Okay, so where were we before we left off last time?
You were just about to give me the job.
Developing a sense of humor, Peter.
That's progress.
You get points for that.
Uh, why don't we discuss faculty responsibilities?
Um, Peter, as an attending, you'd be responsible
for supervising resident research.
I look forward to that.
Liar.
I like working with residents.
You mean you like abusing them.
You don't exactly have the best track record
in the research department.
That can change.
Uh-huh. Where else have you applied?
What?
Where else did you apply?
You can't ask me that.
Oh, no. Someone call the interview police.
Has anyone offered you anything?
You're not supposed to ask me that either.
Come on, Peter, it's a simple question.
I've looked elsewhere, as a backup
but I'd like to stay here as an attending.
Okay. Was that so difficult?
Elizabeth
what are you doing?
Uh... my hands itch for some reason.
Well, cut it out. It's distracting.
Linear vesicles, probably a phytodermatitis.
You allergic to any plants?
I don't think so.
You have a garden?
I went camping.
Tell me you know what poison ivy looks like.
Poison ivy?
Is that in Wisconsin?
Oh, boy.
Sorry, Peter, I got to run.
We'll have to finish this later.
When?
Um, my office will reschedule.
Good luck with that, Lizzie.
He's never going to give me this job.
Of course he will, he's just being Robert.
Don't scratch.
You should put
hydrocortisone T.I.D. on it.
If it gets any worse
get a shot of steroids.
It won't spread, will it?
Well, that depends on what you touched last
before you washed your hands.
Oh, dear.
These are your orientation packets.
Why don't you guys have a seat over there
and read them over, okay?
Then we'll give you the tour.
We'll go over charts, order sheets
and discharge instructions.
Any questions?
Remember, you're students.
The only stupid question is the one you don't ask.
Dr. Greene? Yeah.
Well, I have a question.
What?
Something wrong with the Australian boys?
Who?
You're scratching Down Under.
Oh, yeah.
Doesn't make a good first impression.
Pickman, what have you got?
Mike Palmieri, 17, wide receiver.
Got hi/lowed in midair.
Brief L.O.C.; complains of neck and chest pain.
Can he move extremities?
Yeah, but with numbness in the hands
we didn't take the helmet off.
Okay. Malucci, I got it.
Give the med students the tour.
I gave it last rotation.
Oh, then you're getting good at it.
Okay, Mike, I'm Dr. Greene.
Can you squeeze both my hands?
My neck's not broken, is it?
We're going to check you out.
Mike, does your chest hurt?
A little. The safety speared me with his helmet on the way down.
He's tachy at 120.
B.P.'s 110/68.
Good breath sounds bilaterally.
That's illegal. Second play of the game.
Let's get him on a pulse ox.
They were looking to take me out.
Who's that?
The other team?
Our rivals. It's their homecoming.
You want to push any drugs?
Sure, one amp of epi and a mig of atropine.
She have a pulse?
Oh, she's dead.
I know.
Like blue dead.
Pulse ox 65.
That's because she's dead.
Her husband drove her in.
Oh. Right.
Luka, you okay in here?
I've got it, Kerry.
Still asystole.
As long as we're faking it, can one of the med students
practice C.P.R.?
No. Go tell him we are
doing everything we can, but his wife is very sick.
She can't get any sicker.
Malucci, please. Go on. Go on.
Give the poor man some time to prepare himself.
No problem, Chief.
I can act with the best of them. Watch this.
She's still flatlining.
Want to do a fluid bolus?
No, that's okay.
Abby.
Abby!
Yeah.
The registrar didn't
put your name on my roster.
You sure you're back on the E.R. rotation?
So my schedule says.
Okay, they must be backed up
because of the strike.
Checking out?
Yeah.
Dr. Benton called to confirm your flight
and said he'd pick you up at the gate.
Thanks.
Good-bye, Margaret.
Good luck, Dr. Carter.
Where did he go?
He was in the hallway with Malucci
a minute ago.
Here's her medication. Forgot it in the car.
She's on Elavil and codeine for arthritis.
Have a seat, Mr. Bristo.
You don't need these?
Mr. Bristo, your wife has suffered
a massive heart attack.
We exhausted all medical resources available to us
but the damage to her heart
was beyond our capabilities to save her.
She died, Mr. Bristo.
I'm sorry.
You see?
I should have called the ambulance.
I should have gotten her here quicker.
There was nothing
you could have done differently
that would have saved her.
It was just her time.
Would you like to see her?
Okay.
Elizabeth: How was I supposed to know?
Excuse us. Sorry.
Haven't you ever heard of "Leaves of three, let it be"?
What?
"Leaves of three, let it be"
as in don't touch.
Sorry.
We don't have poison ivy in England
leaves of three or any other kind.
Oh, man.
Let me see. No, no.
Mark, don't be shy.
You've done enough damage.
Well, do you have it?
Yes, I have it.
Who picks poison ivy?
I was making a wildflower bouquet.
Mark, C-spine's back on the football player.
Thanks.
When you went skinny-dipping in the lake
I got bored.
You do remember what happened
after you got out of the water?
Yes, a big price to pay.
Mark...
Do I have to start worrying about where you've been?
It's not that horrible.
Yeah, you've only got it on your hands.
Mike, X ray is normal.
The mom's here, out in chairs.
Okay. Uh, get off the helmet and pads
and I'll be right back.
Does that mean I can go?
Not yet.
So, do you want the cream or the shot?
Probably both.
Fine. I'll get them.
Mrs. Palmieri?
Yes?
Hi, I'm Dr. Mark Greene.
Good news. Mike's neck X ray came back normal.
No fractures or swelling.
Why were his hands numb?
He's probably hyperventilating.
That can cause a little numbness.
But no nerve damage?
No. No broken bones, no spinal cord injury
no paralysis.
Thank you. Thank you. Can I see him?
Sure.
What's your name again?
Priya Shailendra.
Priya, do you remember where Trauma One is?
I think so.
Could you take her?
Certainly. This way, please. Thank you.
Malucci?
Hey, Dr. Greene. How's that jock itch?
I thought I told you to supervise the med students.
You told me to give them the tour. I did.
Why don't you show them the charting system?
I'm kind of juggling eight patients here.
Have them help you.
Hold this.
Hey, Cleo, you're up with the med students.
Says who?
Dr. Greene.
Then Dr. Greene can ask me.
It's not infected, Mr. Fletcher
but I'm going to have to debride it again.
No, leave it alone.
Well, I would
if you changed the dressings
four times a day like I told you.
I'm not a damn nurse.
How'd it go?
It didn't. Romano postponed.
Again? What's wrong with him?
He's a maniacal sadist.
What did you call me?
Not you, Mr. Fletcher.
Is this machine working?
I feel like I'm drowning.
It takes longer when you're fluid-overloaded.
This happens when you're three days late
for your dialysis.
I told you my son didn't have time
to drive me to the clinic.
Malucci: ...cornerstone of drive-through medicine.
What's wrong with this picture?
Hmm? Those med students.
Not a black face in the bunch.
That doesn't concern you?
I see five.
Not necessarily a representative sample.
I'm glad you take such an active interest.
Ow!
You're going to have
to hold your foot still, Mr. Fletcher.
She your wife?
Hmm? No, no, no.
She talk like she your wife.
Yes.
( both chuckling )
Yes.
I brought you a chair, Mr. Bristo.
Someone will be by to take her downstairs
but it could take a while.
Do you have a funeral home you'd like to use?
I could call them.
We've got two plots, but Florence took care of it.
I forget the name.
Well, if you remember.
Can I stay with her?
As long as you like.
That's very decent of you
to work on his wife like that.
Part of the job.
Well, no. He's really shaken.
It could be a lot worse
if he thought he was responsible.
He does. He's alive; she's not.
I wonder how long they were married.
I don't know. Forever, probably.
How long have you?
What?
Been married?
I'm not.
I thought someone told me you were married.
I was, but my-my divorce became final last month.
Sorry.
Don't be. I'm not.
Lockhart-- Is that your name or his?
It's his, but I'm keeping it
because it's the only good thing I got out of the whole mess.
Why? What was your name before?
Wyczenski.
Right. Lockhart is better.
Have you seen Dr. Greene?
Suture room, I think.
Oh, Dr. Weaver's looking for you.
Me? Yeah.
Dr. Greene... Sorry, sorry!
It's okay, Haleh. I'm just getting a shot.
I didn't see anything.
What's up?
Mike Palmieri is having trouble breathing.
Complained of chest pains when we removed the pads.
All right, I'll be right there.
( snickering )
You done?
All done.
Keep laughing, flower girl.
You're welcome.
Thanks a lot.
Mike, how's your breathing?
A little sore.
Okay, tell me if this hurts.
B.P.'s stable, 115/70.
Satting at 98.
There.
Okay. Any belly pain?
No.
Are you sure?
( groans )
Okay. All right, book a C.T.
and let's sit him up.
Where's your mom, Mike?
She went to check on the score for me.
If we're losing, I need to get back.
Well, we need to take another picture
of your chest and belly
just to make sure everything's okay.
Well, how long does that take?
Relax, Mike.
You're going to be with us for a while.
Mrs. Palmieri.
What happened?
Nothing serious.
Mike might have a broken rib
and I need to get a CAT scan
just to make sure that it didn't nick his liver.
His liver? What does that mean?
Well, it all depends
but it's really a remote possibility.
I just want to make sure.
I knew something like this was going to happen.
I hate that he plays football.
I hate it, but it keeps his grades up.
He's not a great student
but he has to keep good grades to play
so I let him play.
I'm sure everything is going to be just fine, okay?
I'll check back with you after the scan.
Chen.
Chen! Yes?
Are you okay?
Yes. Uh, yeah, great.
You find Dr. Corday and her meet me at C.T.
Uh-huh, no problem.
B.P. 136/28, pulse 125.
They nailed me after the play.
The refs didn't even call it.
Open tibial fracture.
Titrate 100, slow I.V. push.
55! That's the number of the guy who hit Mike!
It was a clean hit.
GSW on the way crashing in the rig.
Okay, Frank, what's open?
Stiff in Trauma Two.
Other than that, we're booked.
Clear it. Chen, take this guy.
Yep, got it.
You led with your helmet.
Ma'am, you'll have to wait back in chairs.
It was an accident!
It was a cheap shot!
What do you call breaking my leg?!
Payback!
Thank you.
Flight Attendant: Sir? Sir?
Thank you.
Can I get a gin and tonic, please?
Anything for you, sir?
No, thank you.
From Atlanta or Chicago?
Uh, Chicago.
Atlanta on business?
No.
Vacation?
I was just visiting a friend.
So, what do you do for a living?
I'm a teacher... high school English.
Wow, and you fly first class, huh?
They must pay teachers pretty well in Chicago, huh?
Excuse me.
( water running )
( sniffs )
( sighs )
( unzips bag )
Mr. Bristo?
They needed the room.
Okay, well, don't worry.
We'll find her another room.
Are they coming to get her?
Yeah, soon. They're coming soon.
Lost a pulse!
Starting compressions!
What's in the monitor?
P.E.A.
Amp of epi, squeeze in the blood.
Dr. Weaver, Malucci has an assaulted cheerleader coming in-- bat to the face.
Okay. Get Mark.
He's in C.T.
Got a pulse!
Increase dopamine. Get him up to the O.R.
Are you finished in the trauma room?
Yeah. Abby, I'm glad I saw you.
I need to talk to you.
Somebody find Kovac, please?!
This man's wife died and we told him
he could wait until transpo comes...
I know. We'll lean on them.
Look, I checked with the medical school registrar...
Out of the way!
and they've retracted your clerkship.
B.P.'s 130/90.
Is that from the football game, too?
Yeah, someone choked her in the bathroom.
Something about a delinquent tuition notice.
My ex-husband was supposed to pay that. I apologize.
No need to apologize.
I'll get it paid by tomorrow.
Abby, you don't understand. You need to go home.
You're not covered to work on patients.
I'll work it out with the registrar.
Once a clerkship is pulled, it's pulled.
Nothing I can do.
You have to wait till the next academic quarter.
In three months?
Sorry, Dean's decision.
Turn in your lab coat and your I.D. to Frank.
Okay, prep for an intubation. Hang mannitol.
40 of Lasix. She needs a Foley.
Give me some gloves, somebody. Move!
God!
What's this for?
Kovac: Whoa, whoa!
Sorry. Sorry.
Abby, what's wrong?
Abby?
Abby?
Oh, you got cleaned up, huh?
Looks good.
Thank you.
I'd choose the fish if I were you.
The steak looks "ew."
I'm not hungry.
Excuse me, Dr. Carter.
Were you smoking in the lavatory?
Yes.
Then you're in violation of federal law
punishable by a $2,000 fine
and imprisonment.
Do I need to have the Marshals meet us at the gate?
No. It won't happen again.
Do you have the butt with you?
All right then.
Doctor, huh?
Mrs. Palmieri.
What is it?
Apparently the blow to Michael's chest
caused a little internal bleeding--
some of it in the sac surrounding his heart.
Oh, God, that sounds serious.
It can be.
But right now there's only a small amount.
But we need to operate to drain the blood
before it restricts function.
Open-heart surgery?
No, we go through the upper abdomen.
A very small incision.
It's a really simple procedure.
I just need you to...
Now?
sign the...
I just need you to sign the consent.
You're going to do the surgery now?
Right now Mike's blood pressure is stable
which is a good sign
but more blood could accumulate.
We need to do the operation immediately
to avoid an emergency procedure down here.
You just need the one signature, right?
I couldn't find his father if I wanted to.
One is enough.
All right, what's the big emergency?
I'm here.
I didn't call you.
Robert.
Kerry, look, if you're going to leave messages
with my assistant, don't also page me.
It gets annoyingly redundant after a while.
Sorry to inconvenience you, Robert
but we have a real crisis down here.
Yeah? And?
And it's become a health hazard.
If somebody calls the County, we'll be fined.
But someone's not going
to call the County, is she?
Look, Robert, housekeeping won't clean any sheets or towels.
I need the nurses here.
It's not their job anyway to be doing...
Look, Kerry, what do you want me to say?
Troubleshoot.
It's called being a manager.
You need to end this strike.
Find me the half million
it'll take to meet their demands
I'll be happy to do that.
Peter, keeping banker's hours?
I've been on since 5:00.
Yeah, well, you got a sec?
Actually, I've got to go...
Wait, come on, let's finish this.
What?
The interview.
What about Elizabeth?
I let her sit in to make her feel important
but it's my decision.
So, let's talk turkey.
I know you've got the surgical skills.
I don't question that.
I do, however, question your loyalty.
My loyalty lies with my patients.
As it should, but...
and don't take this the wrong way, Peter
but you have a real propensity
for being a pain in the ass.
Now, I...
I'm not going to jump you, you homophobe.
Damn janitors.
You should try paying them.
You see?
Now, that's exactly my point.
Instead of trying to understand my problems
you immediately champion the opposition.
The janitors?
Whoever.
Peter, if I'm going to give you a faculty position
I've got to be sure that you're going to be part of my team.
Of course.
Of course, what?
Of course I'll be a part of the team.
I can expect your full commitment?
No whining, no complaining, no excuses about your kid
or your cat or whatever.
I don't have a cat.
Splendid. You're hired.
Congratulations, Peter.
You're a free man.
Delivered from the shackles
of your residency and fellowship.
You're going to have to dry your hands first.
Right.
Oh, well, it wasn't me.
You selfish son of a bitch!
Well, hello, Abby.
Is this fun for you?
Or is it like an addiction?
Do you wake up in the morning
thinking, "How am I going to screw Abby today?"
Okay, what's the problem?
I just lost
three months of med school--
three months I can't make up.
Three months that put me exactly one year
behind on my residency.
This is about your tuition.
Yes, it's about my tuition!
Will you calm down?
I was going to call you.
The IRS disallowed our '97 home office deduction.
I don't want to hear one more lie
or lame excuse out of your arrogant, condescending mouth.
They were going to hit us with a huge penalty.
This was important to me.
And you knew it, so you ruined it!
Can you be a little more dramatic?
I put you through med school.
You were going to put me through med school.
You did not put me through med school.
What?
My student loans put me through.
I fed, clothed, sheltered you.
Loans I'm paying for along with
a house, your condo and two cars.
Don't forget the apartment
for the whore.
I assume you're cheating
on the whore with another whore.
All right, just stop it.
No, you stop it.
Haven't you done enough already?
I didn't make you unhappy, depressed and miserable.
You did that all by yourself.
Screw you, Richard.
Right, screw me.
That's right, screw you.
Screw you!
Yeah, you're the one
who decided you wanted more.
Cheating...
You're the one who decided you could change your life.
...spineless... spiteful... ass.
So screw me!
Are you done?
No.
You are in violation of our divorce agreement.
I am hiring a lawyer
and I am getting my tuition money.
Hell, Abby, do me a favor.
Why don't you take it all?
Take the debt with it.
Shut up, jag-off.
Hey, Nat.
Hey, Dr. Benton.
Still plugging away, huh?
You know it.
What are you doing?
Go around the other way, would you?
Yeah, Nat, I'm late.
The news is here.
All right, brother. Good luck.
Thanks.
Chen?
I'm on break.
Right.
( sniffling )
You all right?
Uh... yeah.
Peter, good. You're still here.
We got a mass cas coming in--
a riot at a high school football game.
I was just leaving to pick up somebody.
Man 1: Get off of me!
Man 2: We've got an emergency coming through.
Stay back.
Take it easy.
Blunt abdominal trauma.
B.P.'s low at 90 palp.
I gave him two liters of saline.
What happened?
Bleachers collapsed.
Get two units O-neg, draw pre-op labs.
Ultrasound?
You bet.
Page me if anything changes.
Chen: Drop an N.G. and check his urine.
Shoot a chest and a pelvis.
Sorry.
Man: The game was getting way too ugly.
I mean the refs they called it before the end
and everybody just started swinging.
You okay, Cleo?
Yeah.
Hey, Doc, they need you.
Damn kids jumped a teacher in the parking lot.
Head trauma, maybe a collapsed lung.
Short of breath.
B.P. 100/70, pulse 120.
Mitch, do you have any pain in your chest?
It hurts.
Titrate another six of morphine.
Page ortho and vascular.
Elizabeth, what are you doing here?
I thought you'd be operating.
Mitch, is that you? What happened?
Half the rooms are empty but dirty
because of the work stoppage.
Some jerk smashed my leg with my shield.
Are you doing okay?
They got to operate. Who won?
Where are we going?
Nobody.
Try an exam room.
Get an EKG, chest x ray
and find me when the femur film is up.
How long before you can get an OR?
I don't know.
The nurses are cleaning
but there's a leaking triple-A going up first.
We're going to keep him down here
and do a pericardiocentesis.
All of this so housekeeping
doesn't get an extra dollar an hour.
So, I don't need the operation anymore?
No, you just have to wait a little bit longer.
If you're going to chuck my guy with your helmet
don't whine about a little payback.
You did it on purpose, you faggot!
Hold still or I'll put you in restraints.
What did they hit you with?
The pavement.
Frank, Frank, what's open?
Nothing, nothing's open.
I can't believe this.
I mean, it's just a game.
Is the nurse taking me up?
We're going to have to drain some of the blood down here.
You said he was going straight to surgery.
I know, but it can take a while to prep
and drape and anesthetize him
and his cardiac echo shows
that the effusion's actually growing larger...
Crush injury at 70 palp
despite a fluid bolus.
Intubated for agonal respirations.
Two units of O-neg on the rapid infuser
and set up for a supraumbilical peritoneal lavage.
I'm never going to get out of here.
Pulse 140, satting at 92.
Med student, what's your name?
Ryan. Ryan Bradford.
Ryan, I need your help now. Move.
That's not so bad.
This is the little needle to numb you
for the big needle.
You're a tough guy.
You can take it.
B.P.'s 90.
I can't believe all this fighting started over me.
You're a popular guy.
Mrs. Palmieri: He looks so pale.
Mrs. Palmieri, perhaps you should wait outside
during the actual procedure.
I can't stay?
I'm okay, mom.
I'm just a little tired.
Haleh.
This way, ma'am.
I love you.
I love you, too, mom.
Alligator clip.
He's in tamponade, Mark.
I know.
Mike, how you feeling?
Pulse ox down to 78.
Mike?
Mike? Mike, open your eyes.
8-0 ET tube.
I'll intubate.
He's still breathing.
Not for long.
Just keep an eye on the injury current.
Just get that needle in.
( buzzing )
Bradford: Dr. Carter?
Are you Dr. Carter?
Yeah.
Hi, I'm Ryan Bradford. I'm a third-year.
The E.R. got slammed
and Dr. Benton asked me
to come down and pick you up. Oh... great.
Need a hand with that?
No, no. I-I got it.
We're back this way.
Benton: Where are you going?
Pre-op. He needs an ex-lap.
No, there's no room. Forget it.
No, he's stable. He can wait upstairs.
What's his B.P.? B.P.'s 140/60.
Grab the head injury in three.
All right. Hey, Malik, you got this?
Yeah, I got it. Go on.
( sighs )
Hey, sir?
Sir, are you all right?
Sir?!
Malik! I need a gurney now!
Oh, my God.
Malik!
Hey, you, come here!
What did I do?
Help me move this man.
Now! Come on!
Sats are up to 92.
You want me to try?
No, he has weird anatomy.
I have to go more anterior.
I should be there.
Run of five, pull back.
Pressure's dropping down to 70.
Give him another liter of saline.
Look at the monitor.
Profound S-T elevation.
Damn it! He's having an M.I.
More P.V.C.s.
100 of lidocaine.
You must have transected the coronary artery.
No, no, no, no, no!
It's a known complication.
You went in blind.
Prep the chest.
He should be upstairs right now.
Corday: Mark.
Thoracotomy tray!
What happened?
He swallowed a whole pharmacy in the hall.
I found empty bottles of Elavil, codeine and Lorazepam.
Did you give him Narcan?
Yeah. Two migs times two.
Sats are dropping.
Resps eight and shallow.
Add an amp of bicarb.
Chem seven, C.B.C. and a tox screen.
Yeah, I'm in.
Who's Florence?
What?
Well, the pills say "Florence."
His wife. She died this afternoon.
Pericardium's tight as a drum.
Metz.
Okay, start internal compressions.
Need suction in here.
We've got a crowd.
Someone close the blinds.
Can you see anything?
Sponge stick.
( grunts )
Right there.
Laceration of the L.A.D.
Greene: Can you repair it?
Not without bypass.
We've got to do something.
I am not losing him.
Right. Let's open some sterile I.V. tubing
Cut a one-inch piece for a shunt.
Someone close the blinds.
I don't know how you guys do that everyday.
It's pretty intense.
You sure get to do a lot.
You know, you just-just jump right in.
I was interested in surgery, but...
I don't know, maybe the E.R.'s my thing?
I guess if today's any indication...
never a dull moment, huh?
Yeah. Right.
Corday: Tubing's in. There.
Greene: Hold compressions.
It's a V-fib.
Charge internal paddles to 15.
Charging.
Clear.
Still in V-fib.
Charge to 30.
Haleh.
Clear.
Another amp of epi.
Charge again.
50 of lidocaine. Start a drip at two per minute.
Mother: What's going on? Clear.
Still in torsade.
360. Magnesium on board?
That's four grams.
Isuprel's pouring in.
Clear.
Asystole.
It's the tricyclics.
We'll never get a rhythm back.
Maybe we could try overdrive pacing?
No. He's been down too long.
That's it.
Time of death: 1954.
Take him downstairs.
Make sure he's put beside his wife.
You guys done in here?
I've got a stab wound to the thigh.
Yeah, we are done.
Come on, Mike... come on.
How many units of blood?
Chen: Six so far.
The heart's filling well.
He's not hypovolemic.
When was the last epi?
Three minutes.
He's had two of atropine?
Both amps are in.
Someone should prep the mother.
Dopamine's wide open?
For the last five minutes.
Son of a bitch.
Mark.
Let's keep going.
You want me to talk to her?
No, I should do it.
Chen!
You come take over chest compressions?
Okay, let's go again with the paddles.
Charge to 30.
Clear.
Hey, man, what's going on?
Is he dying?
What's happening to him?
Hey, come on!
He's our friend!
Someone said you had to shock him.
Is that true?
We've... we've had some complications.
What kind of complications?
The needle poked a hole in the artery
that supplies the blood and oxygen to Mike's heart
which caused him to have a heart attack.
We opened up his chest to repair the artery
but his heart has been deprived of oxygen for too long
and it wasn't beating.
Oh, my God.
We're giving him intravenous drugs
and shocking his heart.
There's been no response.
What does that mean?
What does that mean?!
We might not get him back.
What?
He could die.
But you said that this was a simple procedure;
that he would be fine;
that he would sail through this.
I know. I know, Mrs. Palmieri.
This is an exceedingly rare complication.
I don't care.
I don't care. You fix him.
You fix my son!
We'll try.
No... But...
You promised me.
I have to go back.
You promised me.
Is he going to be all right?
You got to tell us, man.
We're working on him.
You got to give us room!
Everybody back up!
Back up, guys. Let the doctor through!
Corday: Clear.
Anything?
No. Again.
How long are we going to go?
Until I say stop.
Clear.
We're out of epi.
Chen...
I want you to go get some epi.
Sure.
Crash cart. Curtain Three.
Clear.
Excuse me.
The doctor told
Mike's mom he was going to die.
Hey!
Hey! Hey!
( screaming and yelling )
( grunting and shouting )
Malucci!
You okay?
Whoa! Whoa! Stop it!
Hey! Put it down! Stop it!
Hey, Break it up! Break it up!
Get off of him!
Security, we've got a problem down here.
Geez!
( screaming and shouting )
What is going on out there?
I don't know. They just started fighting.
Clear.
Chen, are you okay?
Yeah.
Mark! Mark! You okay? You okay?
Mark! What?
A rhythm... We've got a rhythm.
( tires squealing )
What's that?
You never know.
I better get back. You coming in?
No, I'm going to get my car and go home.
Okay, well, it was good to meet you.
Thank you.
