Previously on E.R.:
Woman: Take a look here
you'll see numerous fractures consistent
with repetitive blunt trauma.
I know how he died.
He's a teenager. It's normal stuff.
No, he's changing.
You're just not around enough to notice anymore.
I'm not doing anything, all right?
It's just...
I'm a man, you know?
And my folks just can't get used to it.
Sometimes you got to do what you don't want to do.
That's part of being a man.
Luka, this is grounds
for dismissal.
Fine, Kerry, fire me.
Dr. Kovac.
( screaming )
B.P.'s 100/60.
( screaming )
Sir, you're going to have to settle down.
Settle down!
Fluids in the field?
Bolused a liter
of saline and gave him ten of morphine.
Okay, now.
Get another I.V. going
pre-op labs, serial crits, type and cross times four.
Who's on for trauma?
Benton's on at 7:00.
Okay, see if he's here yet.
I don't have a hand!
( screams )
Where's my hand?
Titrate another ten of morphine.
Sir, you've got to calm down.
Oh, man, that's got to hurt.
Somebody's not going to be
playing the flute again, huh?
That bastard shot me!
Yeah, with what, a Howitzer?
Shotgun, point-blank range.
Page ortho. Let's get an O.R.
I found the hand
but I don't know what you're going to sew it to.
Sir, you've got to settle down.
Let's get some restraints.
On the corner of Madison and Pulaski
6:30 in the morning, selling rock.
You got a regular pharmacy down here, don't you?
And a gun.
Didn't your mother tell you
selling drugs was dangerous?
Malucci, get over here.
You have this now?
Yeah, go.
All right, deflate the B.P. cuff.
( screams )
Oh, God.
Man: I had a tough week with my kid.
He's 14, and he's been getting high.
It's tough for me to lecture him.
He knows I'm sober now, but it was only two years ago
I was high all the time.
Now, when I try to talk to him, he just walks away
or he screams at me
tells me I have no right to talk to him about it.
I think he's probably right, you know
after all I put them through.
Hey, I got the perfect plan for killing off Romano.
We wrap the hand around the gun, pull the trigger
it's got this guy's prints on it, huh?
Put down the hand, Malucci.
Come on, when will we get another opportunity like this?
Put down the damn hand.
Listen, when there's a patient on the table
I want respect, all right?
Respect for the patient and respect for me.
Respect for a drug-dealing banger?
The only thing
I want to hear from you is the medicine.
You say so, Pete.
And when you're addressing me
it's "Yes, Dr. Benton. No, Dr. Benton."
Are we clear?
Hey, Brant, sign my card?
Yeah.
There you go.
Thanks.
You were doing a crossword.
I was listening.
You know, this isn't my first meeting.
I had months of this in rehab.
When's the last time you shared?
I'll get up tomorrow.
There are other meetings, you know.
No, you're right.
I'll get up and share tomorrow.
I used to go to one at Saint Michael's
that seemed like it had a lot more addicts.
I like this one. It's convenient.
I know, but I just thought
you might feel comfortable around N.A. people.
I go to meetings. I take my meds.
I pee in cups when they ask me to.
If you want me to get up and share tomorrow
I'll do that, too.
I'll do it tomorrow.
Hey.
Hi.
Busy night?
Hmm, not bad.
Any messy leftovers?
There was a hypersexual dementia guy in curtain three.
He's fast.
Thanks for the warning.
Hey, uh, you and Kovac still going out?
Not many secrets down here, huh?
No.
Is he doing okay?
It's just he seems a little off.
I'm sure he's fine.
Good.
See you later.
Bye.
Greene: I always hate mornings like this.
Good and slow, just the way I like them.
Calm before the storm?
Always means it's going to get crazy
right before the end of your shift.
Weaver: Hey, Frank, call security.
Mike passed out in the linen room again.
Mad Mike? He's back?
No need for security.
I threw him out of there twice yesterday.
And tell housekeeping
to keep that damn door locked.
Frank, what have you got?
Oh, a little homeless helper
just speeds things along.
Give me that.
I'm not going to hit him with it.
Give me it.
Kerry, remember I'm off today at 6:00.
How could I forget, Mark?
You've only mentioned it three times.
Well, actually just two, counting now.
Cutting school a little early today, Dr. Greene?
It's on the schedule.
Heading off to a professional conference, I hope?
No, a personal one.
Oh, you and Lizzie going off somewhere romantic again?
I put in the request weeks ago.
No doubt.
Frank, those films back on my elbow lac?
Where's Frank?
Out harassing the homeless.
What?
Old cop habits are hard to break.
Morning.
Hi.
Can we get some lunch?
Kerry, paramedics have a 13-year-old
fell on her way to school, two minutes out.
Okay, Luka, you take it, Chuny, go with him.
Lunch?
Yeah, sure... if there's time.
Abby, page Corday.
She might have a herniated disc in three.
Kerry...
Yeah, I know, 6:00.
I should've grabbed a coat.
It's going to be snowing again before you know it.
Excuse me. Hi. Is this the way to the E.R.?
I'm just a little lost.
This is the ambulance entrance.
Walk-ins are around front.
Woman: 13-year-old girl, ground-level fall
oriented times three, no L.O.C. I'm okay...
The school called me at work.
They wouldn't let her back in class
until she got checked out.
I'm fine, Dad, really.
What's your name?
Man: Teresa.
Teresa, did you pass out when you fell? No.
Right around the front, ma'am.
This is for authorized personnel only.
No, it's all right. My daughter works here.
Excuse me. Hi.
Hi.
I'm Maggie. You are...?
Uh... Chuny, your daughter works in the E.R.?
Yes, she's a doctor.
Frank, can you help this lady, please?
Yeah.
Chuny, you come back when you have time. I've got bagels.
I catch you sleeping in there again, Mike
I'm going to chain cinderblocks
to your legs
and toss your worthless carcass off Navy Pier!
Do you have any pain?
No, please, I just want to go back to school.
Let the doctor check you out.
She loves school.
What grade are you in?
Seventh. I'm missing a test.
Yeah, C.B.C., chem seven, and U.A.
Is there something wrong with her neck?
Just a precaution.
She has some pain
but it's probably nothing.
( groans )
Okay, this is going to take a few minutes.
Mr. Ruiz, why don't you get a cup of coffee.
I want to stay with my daughter.
You can come right back.
Debra, would you show Mr. Ruiz
where the coffee machines are?
Honey, I'll be back in a minute.
Any chance you are pregnant before I get an X-ray?
No.
Do you have anyone you'd like to designate as the adoptive parents?
I need to find someone to adopt my child?
No, but a lot of women already have someone in mind--
a family member, an acquaintance.
No, no one.
Can I be candid?
In my experience, it's very unusual
for a woman of Asian descent
to offer her child up for adoption.
We've found that most Asian women end up changing their minds
oftentimes at the last minute.
Did you bring me out here just to make sure
I wouldn't change my mind?
Lots of women never make it past this bench.
I can't keep this child.
Have you discussed adoption with your family?
No.
You really should.
And what about the father?
Is he prepared to sign away his parental rights?
Does he know you're pregnant?
Uh-uh.
Well, he may want to keep the baby.
Well, what if I don't want him to?
He's the father. He has rights.
Hi.
Hi.
Can I help you?
I'm making a fresh pot. Be ready in a second.
It's Kenyan, fresh ground. Smell that, oh...
Excuse me, who are you?
Maggie Wyczenski. You want a bagel?
I've got lots of bagels.
Let's see. What kind would you like here? Any kind...
Um, Maggie...
No, it's not ready yet.
Maggie, this area is for E.R. staff only.
How about a bagel?
Yeah, sure.
Malik, go, get out of here.
Excuse me, you are not supposed to be in here.
Oh, now, now, it's fine, really.
My daughter's a doctor here--
Abby Wyczenski...
Oh, no, Lockhart, actually.
Abby Lockhart.
I just heard this loud pop.
How would you describe the pain, Mr. Patterson?
Al, please.
Is the pain sharp or dull, Al?
It's a bit of a bastard, really.
It's like a burning right down my right leg.
Any numbness?
Yeah, a bit.
What were you doing when you heard the pop?
Surfing.
I know I'm a bit old for it, but I've been
surfing all my life.
Is this tender?
Oh, yes, very.
It's hard to give it up.
Have you ever paddled out yourself?
I can't say I have.
You were surfing Lake Michigan?
No, Kauai. That's where I live.
I'm in town for the sportswear convention.
( groans )
Plane trip nearly killed me with this back.
Can you get me a safety pin, Abby?
That's London, isn't it?
I'm just trying to pick the accent.
Sussex. I went to London for university. Yours?
Zambia, born and raised. My father was a doctor.
You're going to feel a couple of pinpricks.
Tell me if they feel the same.
Abby.
Yeah.
You're mother's here.
Your mother-- she's out front.
No, she's not.
Nice lady, kind of a looker...
My mother's in Florida.
Maybe she was.
Right now she's serving breakfast out of Admit.
Doesn't seem to know you're back to nursing.
You two don't stay in touch much, I guess.
...and everything's flying in the air...
That's not my mother.
I have no idea who that woman is.
Woman: So I'm walking down the aisle...
Looks clear.
Okay, Teresa
now this terrible thing can come off.
So, she's okay?
Can we go?
Her neck is fine, but I need to do
a complete neurological exam.
Well, how long is that going to take?
I-I got to get back to work.
This may take a few hours.
I'm sorry, Daddy.
Forget about it.
I got to call them.
Is there a phone around here?
Pay phone in the waiting area.
I need to examine your face.
Any pain here?
No.
Here?
It doesn't hurt anymore.
You worried about your father?
I'm sure he wants us to be certain that you're all right.
Would you stand up, please?
Okay, now, lift your arms up, keeping your eyes shut.
Higher?
No, that's fine.
Keep your eyes closed for a little longer.
All right, final calls.
Everybody finished with these bagels here?
Wait, wait, there's still
some fresh-squeezed orange juice.
Fresh-squeezed? Yes, fresh-squeezed!
You think I'd use that concentrate stuff?
There you go. Try that. Thank you.
Frank? Frank...
How much longer do you think my daughter will be?
I don't know.
I-I think she's still with a patient.
She'll be out just as soon as she can.
All right, all right, I'll be over here.
May I?
Yes. Eat up.
Thank you.
( giggling )
Who's that?
Some nut job.
Claims she's Abby's mom.
Weaver called Psych.
No kidding.
Nice legs, eh?
Hmm, mother-daughter fantasies come instantly to mind, huh?
Dr. Malucci?
I think we have patients needing your attention.
Actually, Chief, we don't.
Malik: Rescue 54's
two minutes out.
GSW to the chest.
There. Now you're busy.
Gunshot wound, yes!
Not on your own. Oh, I can handle it.
Where's Dr. Benton? He's up at surgery.
Corday's around here somewh...
Okay, find her. Go.
I'm ordering a CT on a girl
while I call the police.
Head trauma?
No. I'm just stalling for time.
I think her father's abusing her
and he wants to take her home.
Okay, send her up.
When the cops show, cancel the procedure.
Okay.
Still no Psych?
I could page them again.
Abby has no idea who she is?
Said she'd never seen her before.
( sighs )
Hi.
Hi.
Well, I think the bagels were a big hit.
Yes, everybody loved them.
I put everything in Ziploc bags.
I put it in the refrigerator.
You can go in there whenever you want.
Can you just stop for one minute?
I'm almost done. There was a lot of leftovers in there.
I threw them away. You can't leave stuff like that in there.
Maggie? It really goes... what?
Can I talk to you for just a minute?
Oh, my God...
Look how pretty you are.
You have a beautiful face.
Just pick your hair back a little bit.
Maggie... Oh, my God.
The bone structure is exquisite.
I need you to stay out there in our waiting area...
Could I work on you? That's what I do.
I can't have you back here by yourself, okay?
I'm an artist.
I do collages and things like that
but I do makeovers to make money.
I could make you over.
I cannot have you back here by yourself.
I'm waiting for Abby.
Okay, it's just right across the hall.
You won't miss her.
There's sick people out there.
The thing is, Abby says that you are not her mother.
Of course I'm her mother.
You know, why don't we gather up your things and...
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
So she... she s-said she's not my daughter?
Please, let's go...
No!
Where is she? Abby?!
Damn it! Damn it!
Maggie?
Abby!
Abby, where are you?!
Hey, Maggie, take it easy. Abby, it's your mother!
Maggie, it's all right.
Abby! Mag-Maggie, you cannot go back there!
Abby!
Frank, call Security, and get Psych down here now!
Abby!
God, please pick up, please pick up.
Eric, if you're there
could you pick up the phone, please?
It's Abby, Eric.
Hello?
Hello?
Okay, Eric, Mom is in Chicago.
What the hell is she doing in Chicago because I can't...
I can't take her now, okay?
She can't be here. I...
( line disconnects )
Well, Al, I'm afraid you've herniated a disc.
That doesn't sound too good.
With the weakness in your foot
you'll need surgery
to eliminate the pressure on your nerve.
Can it wait till I get home?
I wouldn't suggest it.
I don't want back surgery.
Then I'd recommend an outpatient procedure--
endoscopic surgery.
And how long will that take?
An hour.
I'd insert a small endoscope into your spinal column
and remove fragments of the herniated disc.
A couple of stitches
and a Band-aid.
Malik: Dr. Corday, got a GSW to the chest.
Benton's still upstairs.
Okay.
Will I be able to surf again?
I don't see why not.
If you'll excuse me.
Call the OR.
Book a room
for an endoscopic diskectomy.
Maggie: Abby! Abby!
Abby Lockhart!
Abby!
Ma-Maggie? Maggie?
Maggie, calm down.
What the hell's all that about?
( screaming ): Abby! Abby!
You need to calm down.
Abby! Abby!
Maggie... Please, please...
Weaver: Is there somebody that you can call?
( Maggie yelling continuously ): Abby! Abby! Abby!...
Maggie, Maggie, you need to calm down!
Calm down.
Ab... all right, all right, okay.
Good girl.
All right, all right. I'm fine, I'm fine.
Abby!
Abby... there she is.
That's my daughter.
Hi, Mom.
Abdomen's soft, no tenderness, no rebound.
Please, I don't want to die!
Hey, hey, partner, pipe down.
I can barely hear anything.
Decreased breath sounds on the left, trachea midline.
Trauma panel
O-neg, cross times ten.
Needs a chest tube.
Mother, may I, huh?
Huh, chest tubes?
Step in.
Look at you.
Look at you. You're still so pretty.
What are you doing here, Maggie?
I came to see you.
How'd you get here?
On the bus. I came on the bus.
Does Eric know where you are?
You know how busy your brother always is.
So you just left?
And-and you didn't call?
Why didn't you call me
a-and tell me that you were coming?
I was worried about you.
A year ago.
Yeah. I'm divorced.
Oh, my God.
What about your job?
The department store?
My daughter is more important
than any stupid job.
Oh, you know what I did?
I left all my stuff
in the coffee room.
I'm-I'm going to go get it
and you and I are going to talk.
I'm working.
I know, I know, I know, I know
but I'm going to wait for you
and we're going to talk.
I'll be back.
Frank said that you said you didn't know her.
How long has she been bipolar?
Since I was a kid.
And she's off her meds?
( scoffs )
Apparently.
I called the Inn.
Said the weather's going to be great.
Getting away for the weekend?
That's the idea
pending any last-minute complications.
He means me, and there won't be.
Hemoglobin's 11.
How much you get out?
Only 700cc's.
He's losing blood somewhere.
Pressure's dropping. 60 palp.
No breath sounds on the right.
Okay, bullet must have tumbled to the right side. Malucci?
Intubate and put in a second chest tube.
Right you are.
Okay, we need a chest tube tray.
Tension hemo-pneumo?
Corday: Yeah, let's find out.
So, where you guys going?
Wisconsin, Lake Hatteras.
Heard you had a kid.
GSW. It's surgical.
So you've got it?
Three docs, no waiting.
Oh, whoa...
He's bleeding
into his right chest.
Lost his pressure.
God, I love this guy.
He's an entire medical education
in one convenient package, you know?
Jackie?
Oh, God, Cleo, do you know where Peter is?
I think he's up in the OR.
What are you doing down here?
I've been trying to reach him.
I told the man at the desk.
What happened? What's the matter?
Well, they called me at work, and I came right away.
It's Jesse.
They said that he was brought here.
Jesse, your son?
The man over there said
that he was brought in a few minutes ago.
That he was shot.
Somebody shot my boy.
Where's Dr. Benton?
Um, Two, with Spencer on a hernia.
What the hell are you doing?
We found a hole in the right ventricle.
I just cross-clamped the aorta.
Thank God for bangers, huh?
Better than a good shooting war.
Come on, come on, get out of my way.
Hey, Hey! That's my patient.
Peter, we've got it.
All right, I'll over-sew it. Two-O silk, move!
Peter, Dr. Malucci's assisting.
Guy's not even gonna make it. It's his nephew.
What?
It's Jackie's son
Jesse.
Corday: Oh, my God...
Where the hell's the two-O silk?!
Hey, Frank.
Half-day?
12:00 to 12:00.
Much going on?
Pretty slow.
My mother's here.
You weren't expecting her?
No.
Um, do you have a few minutes?
Sure.
Pregnancy test on that Ruiz girl.
Damn it. Where the hell are the police?
I'm in a few minutes early.
You want to grab some coffee.
Yeah. That'd be great.
Corday: It's still not filling.
( alarm blaring ) There has to be another hole.
The left ventricle is macerated on the posterior surface.
More two-O silk, come on!
Blood's pouring out of the right chest.
We need to crack open his other side.
Hold on. Peter...
I can get it! ( alarm blaring )
Somebody cut off that damn alarm!
There's no time, Peter.
Corday: Another thoracotomy tray!
Romano: Lizzie, you ordered a percutaneous diskectomy
on a 50-year-old? Robert, I'm busy.
It looks to me like doctors Greene and Benton have this covered.
Why don't you step out, please?
That's Peter's nephew in there.
Whoa. And you've opened up both sides of his chest, huh?
Well, anyway, Patterson looks like
a perfect candidate for open-lumbar disc surgery to me.
Endoscopic surgery is the best course of treatment in this case.
And it's faster, too. Yes, it is.
No traumatic muscle dissection, no bone removal.
And you can still ditch out of here
in time for your romantic weekend.
What the hell are you insinuating?
That I'd choose an inappropriate course of surgery
to accommodate my weekend plans?
You said it, not me.
I've got to get back.
Gloves!
The bullet tore up the hilum.
Foley catheter!
I'll throw in a purse string.
No, I'll do it.
What was going on out there?
Corday: Nothing.
Heart's not filling!
All right, uh, we're going to bypass.
I'll take the aorta; you take the femoral vein.
We need ice!
What for? Malucci, get four basins full.
We're going to pack the head to preserve brain function.
That'll work?
Just get it!
Lockhart: She sold cosmetics
but she used to get fired all the time.
Carter: What about your dad?
He split when I was seven.
He couldn't take it.
She's an artist.
And when I was little and she was manic
it was fun, actually, because we would do stuff
like, um, camp out in the living room--
actually really camp out, with tents and stuff.
We painted the walls of the living room once.
This whole landscape, it was...
And then suddenly everything would change.
She would start screaming and crying and...
Eric took the brunt of that
because he was much more of a rebel than I was.
Eric is your brother?
Yeah.
She was living near him in Florida.
He's in the air force.
He's an air traffic controller.
Really?
Yes.
And then she would get depressed and just go to bed for weeks.
So by the age of ten
I had figured out how to scam meals off the neighbors
so Eric and I could eat.
You could get her some help, you know?
You could get her on Lithium or Depakote.
No, she won't take the drugs.
She likes it when she's manic.
But I can't do this again.
I'm not strong enough.
Jackie?
Jackie.
Did you find Peter?
Yes, he's in with the trauma team working on Jesse now.
Oh, thank God, how is he?
He was shot in the chest.
They found some bleeding around his heart
and Peter is trying to repair it now.
His heart?
His condition is very grave.
They're working to stabilize him
so they can move him to the O.R.
Oh, Lord...
I...
Can I get you anything?
No.
No, I should try Walt again.
He's out on a parts run
and I don't know what's keeping him.
Girl: Mrs. Robbins?
Is Jesse okay?
Get out.
Is he all right?
You don't get to be here.
Please...
Get out.
Get out!
I don't want you here.
You get away from him.
( screaming ): You stay away from my son!
All right, the aortic clamp is released.
Start the bypass.
Sponge stick still has oozing.
I can't see.
I'll suction.
All right.
Move the light!
Uh, he's bleeding out everywhere.
All right, uh, let's get, uh...
Uh... uh...
Give him, uh...
Give him, uh...
Give him two units of FFP and, uh...
a-a-a ten-pack of platelets.
He's not clotting.
We can reverse it.
Uh, more suction!
Pump's running dry.
We're not keeping up
with blood loss.
Well, squeeze it in faster!
Finally.
Where you been?
We've been waiting here for hours.
You said you were going to run a few tests
and then you disappear.
My eye is just a little sore, otherwise
I feel okay.
I'm going to lose my job
and we've been sitting here for hours.
Woman: Mr. Ruiz.
Mr. Ruiz, would you step out in the hall, please?
Who the hell is this?
Please, sir, out in the hall.
Teresa, you wait here.
I'm Detective Tancredi, Chicago P.D.
Dr. Kovac here is concerned about the extensive bruising
he discovered on your daughter's body
when he examined her.
The what?
She has bruises all over her back and stomach.
Yeah, from her fall.
They're at least a week old.
You think I beat my little girl?
Oh, my God...
I love my daughter.
I would never...
No, uh-uh.
You're wrong.
You are very wrong.
More lap pads. I can't see.
If I can put one more suture in
I can stop the ventricular bleeding.
Cut.
Chest cavity is filling with blood.
He's oozing everywhere.
Come on, Jesse.
Come on, man, don't give up on me.
Jesse...
Come on, man.
Don't give up, please...
Come on, Jesse...
( softly ): Peter...
Peter...
Jackie ( screaming ): No!
( sobbing ): No!
No!
No!
No!
Oh, Peter...
Oh...
If I work Christmas Day
I get Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve off
and New Year's Day, too.
Yeah, right.
You buying that?
Hi.
Hey.
D, can you guys give us a minute?
Yeah, you bet.
Um... so...
Yeah.
I'm sorry.
I guess I should've told you sooner.
Uh, I'm not sure what I'm supposed to say.
I want to give him up for adoption
but I need your permission to do it.
Him?
Will you sign the paperwork?
Please?
Where's Peter?
Still talking to his sister.
God, what a tragedy.
You didn't recognize him?
I only met him once.
You all right?
Headache.
Oh, neck's still sore from hockey?
Next time I'm going to go early and warm up.
( pager beeps )
My O.R.'s free.
You still want to go?
I have an outpatient procedure
should take less than an hour.
Okay, you know, it's Friday.
If we leave before 6:00...
One hour, I promise.
Dr. Greene?
Yep?
What should we do with the body?
It's a mess and I don't know where Benton went.
The police been here yet?
Not that I've seen, no.
We can't do anything until they sign off.
It's a real freak show, though.
Well, why don't you pull a sheet over it.
You think he heard me?
Who?
Benton.
You know, all that stuff I was saying
about his nephew before I knew?
I don't know.
Boy: Excuse me...
Yeah.
Is Teresa Ruiz here?
Who are you?
A friend.
They brought her here from school
she never went back, so I got worried.
Up in Radiology, you can't miss it
just look for a long line of pissed-off people.
Can you tell her Vinnie stopped by?
Yeah, Vinnie, right.
Corday: So where's the best
surfing spot for a beginner like me?
Waikiki.
But you've got to get out there early.
Damn...
it's bleeding. Cautery.
It's ten to 6:00.
I know.
Pressure's dropping, 100/80.
Okay, let's run in another liter.
I can see the disc.
Can't get a good hold of it.
There we go. Got it.
Uh, we got some leaking fluid.
It's just irrigation solution.
It's looking good.
Let's get ready with 4-0 vicryl.
We're almost there, Mr. Patterson.
You'll be hanging ten again before you know it.
( chuckles weakly )
Hanging ten?
So you do know something about surfing.
Only what I've picked up
watching old Frankie Avalon movies.
( laughs )
What are you doing?
Waiting for you.
Can I see?
They're beautiful.
Yeah.
May I see?
This is Dr. Legaspi.
Psychiatrist?
( chuckles )
Yes.
I don't need you.
Abby tells me you have bipolar disorder.
How long have you been off your meds?
Am I off my meds?
Why did you stop?
I don't like Lithium, all right?
It makes me tired, it makes me sick to my stomach.
I can't do these on drugs.
I can't do anything.
What medication are you on now?
Prozac.
I was depressed.
The doctor at my HMO gave them to me.
You need to stay away from anti-depressants.
They can trigger a manic episode.
She knows.
Okay.
I'll write you a prescription for Depakote
if you promise me that you'll stay away from Prozac.
Sure.
Great, I'll go get you the scrip.
You okay?
Thank you.
So, are you going to take it?
You bet.
What's this?
I called.
That's enough for a bus ticket
back to Tampa.
Oh, don't. Really, don't... don't start.
Mom, I can't have you here.
I told you that last time.
I can't do it anymore.
Honey, I came here to be with you
after what happened with Richard.
I'm fine.
Just please go home.
Why do you want to hurt me, Abby?
Why do you want to hurt me?
I didn't ask you to come here!
You just showed up.
Off your medication, again
wearing a dress that would look ridiculous
on a woman half your age
running around the hospital screaming, humiliating me!
Why, why, why do you want to hurt me?
Now the crying, then the depression
and you know what comes next?
Weeks of me worrying that I'm going to come home
and find you dead in my bathtub
or maybe with your head stuck in my oven.
All right!
All right!
All right, fine.
I'm out!
( crying )
Dr. Benton?
Listen, I'm sorry, I...
I didn't know he was your nephew.
Get away from me.
Look, I just thought he was some banger...
6:00, on the dot.
You're ready to go?
I'm waiting for you.
( crash )
What was that?
Hey, stop it!
Stop it!
Peter! Hey!
Oh! Kerry, are you okay?
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Peter!
Peter, Peter, Peter!
What the hell is going on?
Malucci! Come on, stop!
I was just trying to apologize.
Says her father never touched her.
Says she falls down a lot.
And you believe her?
Doesn't matter what I believe.
Court's not going to remove her from the home.
He denies it, she says it's not him.
Can I talk to her?
Sure.
What happened this morning?
I fell down.
What about the other bruises?
My father wouldn't hurt me.
Sometimes people who love us hurt us anyway.
Sometimes they can't control their anger.
They don't mean to, but they do hurt us.
It's a sickness...
and something they need help with.
Do you know you're pregnant?
We ran a test.
I told him this would happen
but he wouldn't listen to me.
Listen to you about what?
He won't wear a condom, he won't.
That's what we fight about all the time.
That's when he hits me, but he doesn't mean to.
Your father?
No, not my dad.
Then who?
Vinnie. Vinnie?
My boyfriend.
We're in homeroom together.
He's in the seventh grade?
He'd never hurt me on purpose, he just gets upset.
He loves me.
Romano: What is it?
I was halfway to my damn car.
Patient's complaining of backache and severe headache.
What patient? Patterson, Lumbar Diskectomy.
Corday's case? Yes.
Mister, uh, Patterson
I understand you're having a bit of a headache.
You want a couple of Tylenol?
My back is killing me.
Okay, roll over on your side.
I can't move my legs.
Can you feel this?
No.
You, help me roll him.
( groans )
Okay, Mr. Patterson, you're leaking spinal fluid.
Probably a cord compression. Get him to the O.R.
And find me Elizabeth Corday!
Mark, it's lovely.
Nice, big bed.
I want to see the bathroom.
( telephone rings )
Hey, the tub, it's huge!
We can both fit in it.
Hello?
Yeah.
Elizabeth.
Who is it?
I don't know.
Hello, this is Elizabeth Corday.
Elizabeth?
Where's your coat?
You look like you're freezing to death.
I'm sorry.
All right? I'm sorry.
I've ruined everything, I know.
I've ruined everything.
And I've hurt you and your brother...
I'm sorry.
You have every right to hate me.
Of course you would hate me.
I don't hate you. I'm sorry.
I don't hate you. I'm so sorry.
It's okay.
I love you. I love you so much.
You're my angel, my angel...
I never meant to hurt you.
I never meant to hurt you.
Please forgive me, oh, please forgive me.
I forgive you, Mom.
( sobbing )
When you were born, you were this little baby
and it was like you were the answer to all my prayers.
You were the answer to all my prayers.
And I thought to myself, "I'll be okay now.
I'll be okay because you're here, I'll be okay."
And I held your little hands...
I loved you, God, how I loved you...
Okay, I know.
I'm so sorry...
I know... I'm so sorry.
Shh.
