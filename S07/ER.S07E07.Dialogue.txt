Previously on E.R.:
Calm down.
All right, all right!
Good girl. Okay!
How long has she been bipolar?
Since I was a kid.
Psychiatrist?
Yes. ( chuckling )
I don't need you.
I don't want back surgery.
Then I'd recommend an outpatient procedure:
endoscopic surgery.
Let's get him to the O.R.!
And find me Elizabeth Corday!
Get out of my way. Hey, Hey!
It's his nephew.
I found some bleeding around his heart
and Peter's trying to repair it now.
( woman screaming ): No!
No!
Benton ( singing ): * The wheels on the bus go round and round *
* All over town
* The door...
* The doors on the bus go open and shut *
* Open and shut, open and shut *
* The doors on the bus go open and shut *
* All over town...
Hey.
Reese woke up early.
I'll go make breakfast.
Hey, no, no, no. I got it.
Why don't you go back to bed.
There's no point.
You want me to write you something
to help you sleep?
No. No, no, no.
Walt still asleep?
Mm-hmm.
Thought I'd come home early today from hospital
and help with dinner.
Thought you were going to Cleo's.
I don't have to.
I'm not making a big Thanksgiving dinner.
Please go.
Have Thanksgiving over there.
Jackie, I'd rather be here.
( voice breaking ): Please... go.
( softly ): Hey.
Have you seen the Tylenol?
Uh, I took the last two.
Did you put it on the list?
Uh, no.
If that neck's still bothering you...
I know.
No more hockey games.
There you go.
Greene's eggs and ham.
I'm sorry, Mark.
I'm just not hungry.
Well, I hope you have an appetite tonight
'cause I am going to be grilling filet mignon
and baking potatoes.
On Thanksgiving?
No turkey? No cranberries?
Nah, we did that last year.
( doorbell rings ) What, no yams?
No, no pumpkin pie?
Pumpkin pie, yes.
Whoever it is, don't buy anything.
Dr. Elizabeth Corday?
Uh...
Yes?
Happy Thanksgiving.
What is it?
Some sort of letter.
It says:
"Notice to the defendant..."
Oh, my God.
I'm being sued for malpractice.
I'll keep taking my medication.
I... I won't be a burden.
Oh, come on, at least let me stay
through the weekend.
I can't go back.
I lost my job at the department store.
Your brother's not even talking to me.
You can't throw me out; I'm your mother.
I put the bus ticket...
and some money in your purse.
And, uh, you'll have to find a job as soon as you get there.
Abby, I've been here for a week.
I know how hard things are.
I know what you're going through.
We've been through this.
I just want to be here for you...
I have to go. Excuse me.
Honey... please.
Here, take my coat.
I love you.
( door closes )
I love you.
( softly ): Hi.
Morning, guys.
Hey.
( no audio )
You're getting pretty good at that, huh?
I've been practicing.
Are we still on for tonight?
Yeah, yeah. Actually
I'm looking forward to meeting your parents.
You'll like them.
Their flight get in okay?
Picked them up this morning.
Hope you don't mind going all the way out
to my cousins. No. No.
How's Jackie?
She's okay with you not being home tonight?
Yeah.
She doesn't want me around.
Hmm. I'm sorry.
I, uh, I got to get him up to daycare.
Okay.
Chen and Carter are late.
It's pouring outside.
You know, when I was a resident
Carter: Whoo! Boy! It's a mess out there.
Finally. Sorry I'm late.
John, you got a drunk with a hand lac in Sutures.
Chen, a breast abscess in four.
If you need an attending, Kovac is here.
Greene is due in an hour.
Happy Thanksgiving. Happy Thanksgiving.
Taking Mr. Mogan up? He's a bit anxious.
They were going to murder Bernadine.
He's delusional.
Threatened to blow up his neighbor's house.
Did you do something different with your hair?
Oh, no. Not really.
You look different somehow.
Contacts. Broke my glasses.
Oh, suits you.
Thank you.
Abby. How's your mother doing?
Better.
She left for Florida this morning.
I'm really sorry about what happened the other day.
Don't apologize.
She has a disease.
Nothing to be ashamed of.
Hi.
Hey.
Did you put her on the bus?
Yep.
Would you like...? Are you free...?
( both chuckle )
Dinner?
Yeah.
Think anything will be open?
I think... Doc Magoo's.
I think that's kind of depressing
on Thanksgiving.
( clears throat )
I could cook?
At my place?
Rescue's pulling up.
Guy got hit riding his bike.
Call my wife! She's waiting for me!
30-year-old male. Bicycle versus minivan.
Bent the bike up
and pinned him against a light pole.
Vitals?! BP's 100/60...
Get some pressure on it!
...cut off as much of the bike as we could
but his leg started bleeding!
I can get it from here! Four-by-fours!
Abby!
Abby!
Abby...
What are you doing here?
Kovac: Come on, Abby!
Okay, let's go. Let's go!
Get four units of O-neg.
I need a thigh cuff and a Doppler scope.
Ask for some dry clothes at the desk...
Abby, I tried to get on the bus.
I can't leave you...
Pulse is 124 and thready.
Abby...
Set me up for a central line...
Slow down, damn it! ( man screaming )
Oh! Oh... Oh!
Set me up for a central line
and prime the rapid infuser!
We need X-Ray to clear the neck.
I'll get the Foley.
Call maintenance for a hacksaw.
Aah... that smarts like a son of bitch.
I gave you lidocaine, Mr. Florea.
It should be pretty numb.
I can give you some more.
Yeah, please.
It hurts like hell.
So does my knee.
What's the matter with your knee?
I twisted it when I fell off the curb.
Dropped my turkey...
...cut my hand.
Cut yourself on a turkey?
Wild Turkey.
Wild Turkey.
I was drinking it on account it's Thanksgiving.
Don't think the pilgrims envisioned the liquid kind
when they established the holiday.
How about you giving me something for my pain?
What would you like this time, Percocet or Demerol?
I'm allergic to Percocet.
This Mr. Florea's third time in here this week
complaining of pain.
Really?
Oh, I see.
Didn't realize it was that serious.
In that case, I'll refer you to a clinic
to help you manage it.
I don't need no damn clinic.
Need something for my knee.
Well...
We'll get you some X-rays
and then I'll give you some Motrin.
You think I'm an addict?
I think you have a problem with drug dependency.
What do you know about my pain?
Oh...
I'll be back in a couple of minutes.
You want to finish him up?
Sure.
Randi...
Randi, excuse me.
Do you have a bag
I could put these wet things in?
Excuse me. Did they just bring in a man from a bike accident?
You'll have to sit in Chairs.
I'll be right back.
Uh... he's in the trauma room.
Where is that?
Well, I'll show you.
Right this way.
I saw them bring him in.
Was he badly hurt?
Well, I know they're doing
absolutely everything they can for him.
I got two units of type specific.
( frame clangs )
Okay, neck is clear.
Pulse ox is down to 88.
Okay, bag him while we set up for intubation.
Twenty of Etomidate, 100 of sux.
He's got a quart of melted strawberry ice cream.
His name's Jim Eakins.
He's relaxed. Take off the collar.
Abby, give me some cricoid pressure.
Whoa!
Big neck lac.
It's hard to see the cords.
Direct your pressure to the right.
How's that?
Better.
Looks like a foreign body down there.
MacGill's.
Stats are 82 and falling.
Hold on... there...
Got it.
You pulled my gauze right through his neck wound...
Open up some lap pads.
I'm in.
Bag him.
Abby, call for a vent.
Stats are still low.
Decreased breath sounds to the right.
Chest tube tray.
( alarm sounding ) V-tach!
Okay, start chest compressions.
We're out. Charge the paddles to 200.
I'll get them.
Clear!
What are you doing here?
The gentleman's wife showed up
and there was no one out there to help her.
I'm not his wife.
I hit him. It was an accident.
I didn't even see him.
Randi, can you sit this woman
down in the hall, please.
Is he going to be all right?! ( baby crying )
Abby, Abby, I need to talk with you.
Not now.
It's important.
I'm not going anywhere, Abby. I'm staying here.
Romano: No good deed goes unpunished.
I step in, I clean up your mess
and I end up named in your lawsuit.
I'm so sorry.
Sorry isn't going to save your ass or mine.
I take full responsibility for what happened.
How noble of you!
The guy's a gimp.
He walks in here with a little bit of a backache
and he's going to be wheeled out in a wheelchair.
Do you have any idea how that's going to play
before a jury?
Not well.
"Not well"?
When his lawyers get through with you
you'll be lucky if you're slinging fish and chips
back in England.
Robert, I thought the procedure had gone smoothly...
Oh, it was a screaming success
if your desired outcome was paralysis.
I'll talk to risk management.
I'll make certain you're not implicated...
Rocket, are you almost through?
( sweetly ): One minute, love.
Do not talk to risk management.
You will not discuss this case with anyone.
Am I clear?
Yes.
A surfer.
Couldn't be just some fat-ass couch potato, no.
And don't even think about paging me
during the weekend.
( sweetly ): Ready, Nikki?
Let's go.
Lockhart: Still in V-fib.
How long has it been?
25 minutes.
Two liters out of the chest tube.
Okay, shock once more, then we'll call it.
How about a thoracotomy?
Not with blunt trauma.
Okay, charged.
Clear.
Asystole.
Okay, that's it.
Time of death: 10:57.
Any family here?
No, just the woman who hit him.
She's waiting out in the hall.
Ma'am...
Yes.
The man on the bicycle was
uh, profoundly injured.
We did everything we could
but he didn't respond to the treatment.
Oh, God...
He died a few minutes ago.
( sobbing )
My ba...
My baby was crying and I turned around.
I didn't see him.
I'm sorry.
God, I didn't see him.
Sweetie, it's all right.
It's all right. It wasn't your fault.
( sobbing ) It was raining.
It wasn't your fault.
It's going to be all right.
My God...
It's all right.
It's all right. It was raining.
You didn't see him.
Oh, my God...
It was raining. You didn't see him.
I thought you quit.
I did.
Then my mother showed up.
She going back?
Think it will ever stop?
What?
The rain.
Has to stop eventually.
I hope so.
Florea: I'm telling you, my knee still hurts
like a son of a bitch.
Yeah, that's why you're going to X-ray, Mr. Florea.
Hey, Connie, can you take him up?
Call transport.
They're understaffed over the holiday.
I'm suffering.
Stop torturing me.
Yeah, yeah, catch you later
when you get back with your films.
Excuse me.
I'm looking for Dr. Chen.
Is she working today?
She's with a patient.
Just take a seat in Chairs.
Thanks.
Hello.
Hi.
Do you work here?
Oh, no. Oh, these?
No, I got caught in the rain.
My daughter works here.
So does mine.
Really? Mm-hmm.
Jing-Mei Chen.
The cute one-- pregnant.
What?
You must be thrilled.
I tell you I would be so excited
if one of my children made me a grandmother.
Actually, I don't think of myself
as old enough to be a grandmother
but I am.
You must be thinking of someone else.
Jing-Mei.
Mommy.
Jing-Mei...
Oh...
my God.
What are you doing here?
I wanted to invite you for Thanksgiving dinner.
Why didn't you tell us?
Because I didn't know how.
Come home tonight.
Is everyone coming?
Yes.
No, Mommy, not with all those people there, please.
They're your family.
I can't.
Please?
No, I just can't.
No, please.
I need a hand in Exam One.
I got to go.
Don't tell Papa.
We love you.
I know.
You looked like you needed some help.
Thank you, Carter.
No problem.
Hey, did you page me?
I've got a appy in ten minutes.
Old patient of yours is here, Debby Marlin.
You operated on her
last year for breast cancer.
What's she doing back?
She's in terrible pain.
Mets to the spine.
I thought you'd like to know.
All right.
( weakly ): Hi, Dr. Benton.
Hey, how are you doing?
Terrible.
I went to my pharmacy this morning
and they told me they couldn't refill my morphine prescription.
Why not?
Well, they don't carry narcotics anymore.
Too many robberies.
Oh.
I gave her a shot of morphine
but it's barely taken the edge off.
All right, come on. Let me see.
How much did you give her?
Ten.
You contacted your oncologist?
Mm-hmm. I just got the service.
He's away for the holiday weekend.
All right, come on.
Give her another ten.
If she's feeling better, send her home with Percocet.
You mean I have to come all the way back here tomorrow
for my medicine?
Well, I'm sorry
but the outpatient pharmacy's closed today.
Can we admit her for pain control?
Yeah.
All right.
Let's admit her to medicine.
Thank you, Dr. Benton.
Corday: The little weasel warned me not to speak to anyone.
You're not going to listen to him, are you?
Do I have a choice?
You're being sued.
You have to respond.
Romano insisted he'd handle it.
Yeah, sure.
Cover his ass and hang you out to dry.
Let me talk to my buddy, Dave Midler.
He's in risk management.
Off the record.
See what he thinks.
Thanks.
You look tired.
So do you.
I shouldn't be dragging you into this.
We're getting married.
Your problems are my problems.
Mark, ortho's waiting in Two.
See you later.
* It's now or never
* Come hold me tight
* Kiss me, my darling...
What's the score?
Texas up by six.
* Be mine tonight...
I see Judy's back for a return engagement.
Elvis's greatest hits.
Connie's serving turkey in the lounge if you're hungry.
No, I'm going to wait for dinner.
Is there any ETA yet on my X-rays?
Nope.
I got three patients waiting.
There's only one file clerk in today.
Well, you don't look that busy to me.
You want to cover the phones?
I'll get the X-rays myself.
You all right?
Look at her, just sitting there.
How long are you going to make her wait?
She's supposed to be on a bus.
Have you talked to her?
I have been talking to her my entire life.
There's nothing left to say.
Randi, can you call Security?
Tell them to move her out?
Security?
What?
Oh.
* Are you lonesome tonight?
Abby...
Abby.
Listen, what are you trying to prove?
You're my daughter.
I care about you.
Do you mind? ( singing stops )
I'll take my medicine.
I'll get a job, whatever it takes.
We both know that's not going to happen.
Abby, I'm not going anywhere until you talk with me.
Damn it, Abby. I'm your mother.
Go back to Florida, Maggie.
Wright: I need a monitored bed.
Trauma One's open.
What have you got?
25-year-old pharmacy tech found down in Central Supply.
BP: 260/140.
He's combative, not moving his right side.
And he's vomiting.
He's got increased intracranial pressure.
Probably a brain bleed.
He needs intubation
a nipride drip and a stat head CT.
( screaming ): Go away!
We need hard restraints.
How about we paralyze and intubate?
Six of versed, 100 of sux.
Bet I know why his pressure's so high.
Want a tox screen?
It's probably coke or crystal meth.
Paralytics are on board.
8-0 ET tube.
Damn it.
That's all right.
I'll get another one.
You all right?
Oh, yeah, just a little dizzy.
You want to sit down?
Nope.
Okay.
I'm going to be sick.
Ooh. Get an emesis basin.
( vomiting )
Pulse ox down to 86.
Bag him.
I'm sorry.
That's okay. Sit down.
I'm sorry.
Sit down. Put your head down.
( gasping )
His sats are still dropping.
Chuny, can you get some help?
You have to intubate.
Randi, find a doctor!
We need some help in Trauma One now!
I can't see the cords. I need suction.
There's a lot of vomit down here.
Try a straight blade.
Lydia, we need a vent.
How's that nipride drip coming?
Working on it.
What do you need?
It's a difficult intubation.
Dr. Corday's sick.
Go lie down.
I've got it.
Take one more look.
If you can't get it, I'm here.
Cords, tube...
I'm in.
Bag him.
Good.
Knee film on Mr. Florea looks normal.
I knew it.
Take a look at his ultrasound.
I didn't order an ultrasound.
He was in a lot of pain.
Oh, man.
He's got a clot...
from the popliteal fossa...
to the femoral vein?
Uh-huh.
( groans )
I thought he was drug-seeking.
Where is he?
Guy was a real pain in the ass.
He tried to bum an el token
from the desk clerk.
When the guy wouldn't cough it up
he got pissed off.
You just let him leave?
I'm not a hall monitor.
Damn it.
Mr. Florea!
Mr. Florea!
Mr. Florea! Mr. Florea!
Excuse me.
Mr. Florea!
Excuse me.
Mr. Florea.
All right, move away.
Move away from him.
Mr. Florea?
Mr. Florea?
Randi, it's Carter.
I'm at the el station.
Send a gurney up here right away!
Found him down at the el station.
He was drinking again?
No, he left AMA.
Clot in his leg must've traveled to his lung.
Sats are only 78.
Just get the TPA box ready.
Mix up the TPA
run in 100 milligrams over the next two hours.
I've got to do the checklist.
No, no, there's no time for that.
He's altered. That's an absolute contraindication.
He's altered because of the PE.
He's not getting enough oxygen to his brain.
I won't give it.
What if he has head trauma?
Fine, I'll give it to him.
I'm not signing my name to this chart.
Then don't!
Randi: You know the pharmacy dude
the one that Corday and Abby were working on
the one with the crack pipe?
Yeah?
Cops said he was cooking crystal meth in the basement pharmacy.
Had a whole lab set up.
You're kidding.
Bad news. Debby Marlin's HMO
wouldn't authorize admission.
Who?
Breast cancer with spine mets.
HMO said she should be managed as an outpatient.
All right. Well, if she's still in pain
have her contact her HMO tomorrow.
Oh, should she do that before or after
Cleo, Cleo, we've done all we can.
She's got end-stage breast cancer, Peter.
She's in pain.
All right, I know, but she's going
to have to take it up with her HMO.
She'd be better off without insurance.
Then we'd have to admit her
and county would have to pay for it.
Doesn't make a damn bit of sense.
How's your sister doing, Peter?
Uh, you know, as well as can be expected.
Randi, how long is Abby's mother going to be sitting in Chairs?
I bet three days.
You want to join the pool?
No, thanks.
You're giving TPA?
He's got a pulmonary embolus.
Are you sure?
He's got a DVT, he's hypoxic
he's got a right ventricular strain pattern on the 12 lead.
What are his coags?
What's his head CT show?
I don't know.
Then stop the TPA.
He could bleed out.
This is his only chance.
Intubation kit. You know nothing about this man's history.
You could kill him with this drug.
He's hypoxic on 100% oxygen.
Stop the drip. They can try to do a thrombectomy.
He'll never make it to surgery.
Hey, he'll arrest.
I'm the attending.
Pulse ox is going up to 80.
Heart rate steady at 72.
I just pray he didn't bleed in his brain.
Thanks.
I feel like such a klutz.
These things happen.
My husband likes celery in his stuffing
so I'm chopping away and whack!
Next thing I know, there's blood everywhere.
Oh, I should've stuck to my oyster recipe
but Sam likes a traditional stuffing.
You know, you can tell a lot about people by their stuffing.
My mother hates sage
and I'm not too fond of nuts or raisins.
To tell you the truth, I don't like a lot
of that fancy stuff thrown in like eggs or raisins.
How about you, Doctor?
What kind of stuffing do you like?
Dr. Greene?
What do you prefer?
Dr. Greene, lab needs another red top on Cain.
Dr. Greene, can I run my asthma patient by you?
Mark, we've got a lady with syncope in Four.
( panting )
Bah, bah, bah...
Hey, Mark, do you have a minute?
I got into a thing with...
Not now.
Wright: Are you going anywhere tonight?
Lockhart: I don't think so.
Well, stop by. I'm making Thanksgiving dinner for 30.
30 people? How do you do it?
Takeout from Chicago Chicken served on my good china.
Abby, Abby, please talk with me, please.
Please don't do this to me again.
All right, all right, I lost my apartment.
I've been evicted. I have no place to go.
I don't want to hear it.
Oh, why are you so damn stubborn?
It's called self-protection.
I did the best I could.
I took care of you and Eric all by myself.
Uh, excuse me, Mom. We took care of you.
You always had a place to stay
and food to eat and clothes to wear.
I worked hard for that.
When you were on your meds.
I tried hard to be a good mother. I tried every day.
Abby, Abby, now you listen to me.
There is a lot of me in you. I see it.
Oh, please. Do you know that every night
before I went to sleep, I used to pray
that you would take your lithium
and just... just act normal?
You think it was easy for me?
But it was exciting for us, though
because we never knew what to expect.
Would you bring home some loser you picked up in a bar?
Or maybe you would just run down our street naked
screaming your head off.
You can hate me, all right? Abby, you can hate me.
Oh, and then there was that Thanksgiving when I was ten.
Oh, God, here we go. Do you remember that one?
I think you were cooking mashed potatoes, if I recall correctly.
Here we go, here we go, here we go.
I walked in... I walked in and you asked me where I'd been...
Oh, God... ...and I said I'd been to visit Dad
and I'll never forget your face.
You threw the food on the floor
and you chased me around the house with a knife.
I would never hurt you, Abby. I would never ever hurt you.
I had to lock myself in the hall closet.
I remember sitting in there with my feet...
It was the disease, Abby.
...pressed up against the door...
so that you couldn't get in.
You have to see me. I'm not just a disease.
Then that night, you made me sleep beside you
to prove you were sorry, but I had to stay awake and look at you
because I was scared you were going to flip out again.
I'm your mother. You'll have to deal with me.
I was ten years old.
I didn't choose to be sick.
You never tried to get better!
I can't make things different.
That's right! You can't.
So now, just go home.
( Aretha singing ): * Rescue me
* Oh, take me in your arms
( Kerry joins in ): * Rescue me
* I need your tender charms
Aretha: * 'Cause I'm a-lonely
Both: * And I'm blue
* I need you
Aretha: * And your love, too
Both: * Come on and rescue me
Aretha: * Come on, baby
Both: * And rescue me
* Come on, baby, and rescue me... *
I couldn't talk.
The words just wouldn't come out.
Have you had any other symptoms?
Change of vision? Headaches? Syncope?
Nothing significant.
Neck's a little sore from hockey
headache on and off.
Could be an atypical migraine, maybe cerebritis.
You under a lot of stress lately?
Who isn't?
Right. Let's take a look.
You ready?
This is ridiculous.
I'm actually feeling much better.
It's probably hypoglycemia
from skipping breakfast and lunch.
Well, when I was dizzy and vomited
I took a pregnancy test.
I'm not pregnant.
I had a period last month.
Hmm. That was breakthrough bleeding.
What?
You're pregnant.
Well, that's impossible.
Really?
Technically, it's possible...
You know, maybe we should run
a serum test just to make sure.
It's okay. Why don't you lie down.
I'll do an ultrasound and we'll see how far along you are.
What's the word?
Tobiason: It appears to be a 3.5-centimeter mass
in the frontal cortex.
A brain tumor.
How bad is it?
I want to discuss it with a neurosurgeon first.
You're a radiologist. How bad is it?
Really can't say.
What's my prognosis?
Phil.
You need to talk to a neurosurgeon right away.
It's not like he swallowed one nail.
We're talking pounds of hardware.
I mean, there's nails and screws
and, uh, one of those metric socket sets.
And a plier.
I'm palpating this guy's belly, and there's...
there's a crescent wrench outlined in base relief.
I mean, just smashed up against the skin.
So my husband says to me
"You've got to go in there, and consent this guy."
You were married?
Yes, and, um
he was a surgical resident.
So I go in there
and I say, "Mr. Jepson, how did you get
all this stuff down?"
And he says, um, he says, "A good Chablis."
Like, a...?
( laughing )
He says, "A good Chablis."
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
I'm so... sorry.
Oh.
It's fine.
No, you missed most of me.
I will pay for the dry cleaning.
I'm... Kerry, it's fine.
Randi: Did you bring the guacamole?
Marquez: Yeah, and onion dip.
Wright: Oh, I'm going to put on ten pounds by Christmas.
Chen: Hey, Dr. Greene.
Hey.
Are you okay?
Just heading out.
Good night.
Good night.
Happy Thanksgiving.
Have a good one.
I was going to make dip, but...
I'm starving.
It's like my favorite.
Oh, good.
Hey, what happened?
Hmm?
Your...
Oh, I went for a walk.
In the rain?
How's Mr. Florea?
He, uh... He threw a clot.
I had to give him TPA.
Oxygen levels are up.
Vitals are stable.
So, can I give a hand?
Can I help you with anything?
No, I'm just starting an IV.
With your mom, I mean.
No. Every time she goes out for meds
she says she's not going to do it again.
Why should this time be any different?
I don't know.
My patient's smoking again. Excuse me.
Mr. Thal, I told you
if you want to smoke, you have to go outside.
In the rain?
I've got pneumonia.
( sniffing )
Man, this is smelling weird.
I need an ashtray.
Anything else I can get you?
An extra pillow would be nice.
Dr. Carter, could I speak with you?
Sure.
I know you're a friend of my daughter's.
Oh, this is awkward for me.
I don't know what else to do.
Could you...
talk to her for me?
Um, I'm not sure it would...
Oh, God, Abby's in there!
Stay here!
Abby's in there!
You guys okay? Yeah.
Oh, my God, Abby!
Everybody move outside!
Abby! Stay out here!
Everybody move outside!
Abby!
Abby!
Abby!
Oh, my God! Abby!
Abby?
Abby!
Please wait outside.
Abby?
Is she all right?!
Is your neck okay?
Is she all right?!
Is she okay?!
I think she's okay.
Let's go. Let's go.
Down the hall. To the right.
Carter, do you need any help?
No. I think she's okay.
I'll be in Curtain Two.
Chuny, give me an intubation kit.
Look out, please.
...and lots of burn dressings.
Abby?
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Is she all right?
Is she badly hurt?
Can you please wait outside?
No. She's my daughter.
Do you have any chest pain?
Yup. You do?
Where does it hurt? Uh, right there.
Right here? Yup.
Okay. Okay.
Take a deep breath for me.
All right, give me the oxygen.
Hi, Mommy.
Jing-Mei. Oh!
Oh. I'm so glad you came.
Who's here?
Everybody.
Uh, great.
I'll go get your father.
You didn't tell Papa yet?
You asked me not to.
He'll be okay.
Shocked, but okay.
You underestimate us, Jing-Mei.
You've always underestimated us.
Mommy, will you love the baby
if the father is black?
He's black.
That's what I thought.
Jing-Mei!
It's okay, Mommy.
That's why I didn't tell you.
Any idea what started it?
Ether. Ether?
A couple of guys in the pharmacy were cooking crystal meth.
Transported the ether in IV bags.
One of theirs got mixed in.
Damn!
Everybody out?
All but two patients.
Well, move it.
We're evacuating this whole department.
They're critical.
I'll give you ten minutes.
Just take a deep breath.
Chest still hurt?
A little bit. Can I get up?
'Cause I'm okay, and I could help.
Not until I get a chest X-ray.
I don't need a chest X-ray.
Oh, Abby, come on. Let him help you.
How are you?
I'm a little sore.
She cracked a rib.
How's Mr. Thal?
He's going up to the burn unit
but I think he'll be okay.
How much ringers do you want?
Ten liters over eight hours.
How's your guy with the PE?
CT was normal. No brain bleed.
Good.
Let's get you up to radiology.
He was staring up at me from the pavement
and with every breath
I could see...
frosted cloud from his mouth
get smaller.
I just talked to him.
Tried to reassure him.
And I held his hand until he died.
The ambulance never came.
He was gone by the time they got there.
Oh, my God.
What happened to the driver who hit him?
Not enough.
He was drunk, but this was 19 years ago.
They, um... revoked his license for a while
and had him pick up trash on Saturday or something.
Well...
( laughing )
I certainly got us off on a very depressing tangent, didn't I?
( sniffling )
I think we're going to close this place down.
Oh, I'm sorry.
We have to take care of this.
Oh, no. No, no, no.
Let me. No. You paid last time.
Come on. Why don't... you know what?
Why don't we just split it.
I got it.
Thank you.
You know, this is our second meal together.
Some people might consider a second dinner a date.
A date?
You do know I'm gay, right?
Of course, I do.
I don't have a problem with that.
I have... I have gay friends.
Oh...
Oh. I'm sorry, Kerry.
I misread this.
No. I mean, I didn't.
I-I... I'm so sorry if I gave you the wrong impression.
It's just that you called me down for eight psych consults...
Yeah. in the past week.
We work well together.
My instincts are usually a lot more reliable.
Thank you.
You know what? I'm really very flattered.
It's just that I'm, uh...
I mean, gosh, you're such a beautiful woman.
You're...
You're so beautiful, but I'm...
I'm straight.
I mean, I don't... I'm straight.
Okay.
Oh, God. Oh, my God.
I don't know...
I don't know what's...
I'm sorry, I just...
I don't, uh...
I feel very...
I'm...
You know, I-I just...
I mean, I-I guess I never even really considered this.
You haven't said a word since we left the hospital.
We can talk to each other.
That's what people do in relationships.
All right.
I'm pissed that Romano's docking my pay
for punching Malucci.
Is that better?
You should be furious.
Malucci was way out of line.
Not that I'm surprised.
What's that supposed to mean?
You get docked because Malucci's a jackass.
Your nephew gets crappy care
because they assume he's a banger.
And today, our patient couldn't get her meds.
You know, Cleo, I'm so tired
of hearing you go off on this.
You need to stop trying to teach everybody
how to be black.
And you need to face reality.
Debby Marlin couldn't get
the pain medication she needed today
because her pharmacy was in a black neighborhood.
You grew up in the suburbs.
What the hell you know about that woman's problems?
What, and I can't relate because I wasn't poor?
No, I'm just saying, you know what?
I know who I am.
I don't have anything to prove.
And I do, because my mother's white?
I didn't say that.
Where you going?
I'm getting off.
This isn't our stop.
It's mine.
I don't want to see you tonight.
Cleo, we're supposed to be going to your cousin's.
Good news.
Your lungs look clear.
But you cracked a rib on the right.
I'll write your discharge orders.
You don't have to do that.
Fine, but you did have
a concussion with loss of consciousness, so...
I'll call you later.
Thank you.
Doctor.
Doctor.
I borrowed an umbrella.
Okay.
Happy Thanksgiving, Dr. Carter.
Hey.
Hey.
Ooh.
That steak smells fantastic.
How did you get the charcoal going in the rain?
I just pulled the grill in under the overhang.
I've never had a deck to grill on before.
Makes me feel very American.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Shall I help you with the salad?
Sure.
Okay.
Uh, Mark...
Mm-hmm.
I have something to tell you.
It's not going to be easy.
Go ahead.
Well, I know it's not exactly the best time, but...
What the hell. I'm pregnant.
Uh, Chen did an ultrasound.
What are you thinking?
I think it's wonderful.
Oh, I love you.
I love you, too.
