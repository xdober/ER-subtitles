Previously on E.R.:
There she is. That's my daughter.
Hi, Mom.
I can't have you here.
I told you that last time. I can't do it anymore.
How long has she been bipolar?
Since I was a kid.
Don't tell me. Don't tell me. Don't tell me.
I'm sorry. It's, uh, part of the disease.
Don't you sass me. I'm your mother. Not by choice.
( screams )
No!
You want five of Haldol?
No! Maggie.
Come on, Maggie. Calm down.
And I held your little hands.
And I loved you. God, how I loved you.
It's okay. I know.
( sobbing ): I'm so sorry.
I know.
CARTER: So, he's a scalper?
He's a respiratory therapist.
But he's got a friend who can get us good seats.
So it's either a sporting event or a concert.
No more hints. Sporting event.
Were you one of those kids who peeked at his birthday presents?
Hey, guys. Hey. Hey.
You on swing? Yeah, I only have an hour left.
You're bringing your dog to work?
Oh, no, we're just picking something up.
What's his name? Norman. Norman.
Hello, Norman. Don't let him get too close to your leg.
John. What?
There's nothing to be ashamed of.
He's a guy.
I'm getting him fixed. Oh, God.
What?
That car.
What about it?
Read the license plate.
Huh. "Man-O-Med."
( chuckling ): That's Richard.
Ah.
Who's Richard?
Hey, Randi, is there a guy
named Richard looking for me?
Your ex?
Yes.
In the lounge, talking with Dr. Kovac.
( sighs )
Call Security.
Tell them there's a BMW illegally parked in the ambulance bay.
MAN: She tried to quit three times while we were together.
The last time, she gets addicted to the gum.
What do you need, Richard?
You didn't return my calls.
When did you call?
Last night, this morning.
I haven't checked my messages yet.
Excuse me.
Nice meeting you.
Yeah.
Look, it's your mom. She's gone off
the reservation again.
She's holed up in a motel
outside of Muskogee, Oklahoma.
She called you?
No. Apparently some guy
that she's been traveling with prepaid the room
for a week, and then he split.
That was three weeks ago.
The manager of the hotel got your old number
which is my number and... took it out of her bag.
What was he doing going through her stuff?
Looking for money, I guess.
He says she's all spaced out.
She won't leave the room.
Is she answering the door?
Richard, is she answering the door?
You should call this guy.
Abby, I'm sorry.
How did you fall?
Greased pigs.
What?
We were chasing greased pigs.
Tau Beta Chi against Gamma Psi Mu.
Mm-hmm.
Is this a contest?
Oh, yeah.
And thanks to Tasha, Tau Beta kicked ass.
( laughing )
Been drinking already, huh?
It's Greek Week. Mm-hmm.
Okay, we'll have to seal that
with some calcium hydroxide paste.
I'll be back.
Abby?
What did the guy say?
He... she's there.
Um, he said she owes him $800.
Do you have that?
Not really.
I do.
No, Luka.
Hey, I'll take care of it.
But don't give him a credit card.
We'll wire the money.
I told him I'd give it to him when I got there.
( girl laughing )
When you got there?
I-I'm going to take a red-eye.
No. No, Abby.
We'll call the local hospital, talk to a psychiatrist
and see if we can get the police to bring her in.
I can't put my mother in a lock-up in Oklahoma.
You can fly down there once she's medicated.
No, no, if I have to commit her
it'll be easier to do it from Chicago.
Trust me. Why are you doing this?
Because my mother's sick, Luka.
Dr. Kovac, possible DKA in Four.
Accu check is 400.
In a second.
I have to talk to the nursing supervisor;
see if I can switch my shift.
Abby, don't go out there.
It's my problem.
( drilling )
GREENE ( groaning ): Damn it.
You all right?
Oh, yeah, yeah. No problem.
Mark, I don't know why you insist
on baby-proofing every drawer and cabinet.
The baby's not going to be crawling immediately, you know.
There's a high likelihood
that he's going to be advanced for his age.
Who was at the door?
UPS.
More gifts.
Between the baby and the wedding, they know me by name.
You didn't lift anything, I hope.
No, it was light.
No lifting. I'm serious.
( exhales )
What are you doing?
Trying to get this show on the road.
Well, I hope you don't have it on the floor.
I've been sitting around for days.
I need to move.
Who's a good boy?
Who's a good boy?
I had to pee, Haleh.
I didn't say anything.
Come on.
You have nothing in coach?
Okay, well, what if I fly into-- to Oklahoma City?
Hi.
Hi.
What did Richard want?
My mother has, uh, bottomed out
40 miles outside of Tulsa.
And of all people, the motel owner
had to call Richard.
Hey.
Did you talk to her?
Mm-hmm. She's not picking up the phone
and she won't come out of the room, so...
Hey, your dog.
Norman, stop that.
Norman, drop that.
John, you brought him inside?
Yeah, we had to take a little bathroom break.
Well, is that going to hurt him?
No. No worse than that chili. No. No.
There, we got it.
Good boy. Come on. Let's go.
Did you get the tickets? Uh, yeah. All set.
So, am I going to have to call you a cab
or will you make it back?
You know what, I'll meet you outside. What's wrong?
Nothing. I just want to change the bag on that thing.
Give me five minutes, or you can start running.
I'll give you a head start.
I'll wait.
A dog has no business in a hospital.
Seeing-eye dog.
Well, how many people are going to Oklahoma tonight?
No. Thank you.
You okay?
I can't get a flight.
You're trying direct to Tulsa?
I... tried. I can't get anywhere close.
There's not even a connection opening.
What are you doing?
I have a really good travel agent.
She can always find something somewhere.
You want to fly out tonight?
Hi. Katy Whitcher, please.
Open return?
No, I have to drive her back.
Why?
She can't fly. She can't handle flying.
You're going to drive her all the way back to Chicago by yourself?
Is Luka going with you?
Hey, Katy. It's John Carter.
Good. Yeah.
Any way that you can find me
two one-way tickets to Tulsa?
Tonight.
* A gathering of angels
* Appeared above my head
* They sang to me this song of hope *
* And this is what they said... *
CORDAY: Mark!
* They said come sail away...
Mark!
* Come sail away, come sail with me... *
( beeper beeps )
Sorry. I didn't hear you.
I think it's time.
Will I have a black eye?
Probably.
"Piggy kick to the face."
Bet that's a new one, doc.
It's not funny, Kevin. Ow.
Sorry.
Do you have a minute?
Yeah.
Your eye movement is intact.
But we'll have to take some x-rays
to make sure there's no fracture.
It could've cracked my face?
Probably not.
But maybe next time you wrestle animals
you should be sober.
Well, it wasn't my idea.
You're still the best-looking piggy mud wrestler I know.
Shut up, Kevin.
I'm taking an 11:40 flight to Tulsa.
Hold on; I checked.
There's a psychiatric facility
at St. John's Medical Center--
Carter's coming with me.
What?
Her mom suffers from bipolar disorder.
She's locked herself in a motel room.
A motel room?
Probably in a major depression.
Wh-why do you have to go?
He offered to help.
And I have to drive her back here, so...
I offered to help.
No, you offered to decide for me.
Abby, your mother needs hospitalization
not a road trip with you and Carter.
Yeah, Luka, we're doing it for the fun of it.
It's going to be a blast.
It's a Bulls game-- thought you'd like it.
You said you like basketball.
I do.
Then let's go.
Abby needs someone to go.
Why can't her boyfriend go with her?
Abby, it's a mistake.
Are you going to lecture me on this?
No. Good.
Because you have no idea what it's like.
I grew up with this.
I don't want to be lectured on it.
I'm not lecturing.
I'm trying to help.
You're spending the weekend with her.
And her clinically depressed mother.
Look, I will pay for the tickets.
It's not about the stupid tickets.
Shut up, Norman. Don't tell Norman to shut up.
Don't put yourself
in the position to get hurt again.
Well, you'd be the expert
at that, wouldn't you?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Go.
Rena...
Okay. Go.
I think I can make it.
Hospital policy. In the chair.
How far are you dilated?
She wouldn't let me check her.
You're the father, not the doctor.
I'll get it.
You get the elevator.
You having a baby?
That's the plan.
Did your water break? Not yet.
What are the sneakers for?
I might be on my feet for awhile.
He's worried about foot pain.
Well, I've been through this before.
Well, I haven't.
Hey, you got cigars? Are you in labor?
How far apart are the contractions? Three to five minutes.
I know a great place.
I'll pick some up for you.
For how long? Every hour.
Okay.
All right. Is it time?
We think so. Congratulations.
Don't be a hero, get the epidural.
We'll see.
She'll get it.
I'm so humiliated.
It was an honest mistake.
I've already been through the real thing.
You'd think I'd know what Braxton-Hicks were like.
Hey, Dr. Corday.
You drop that baby already?
Couple more hours.
Or days.
Hey, I thought you were having your baby.
I am, just not right now.
They're sending us home.
Hey, don't worry. Take your time.
This place ain't going anywhere.
I suppose I don't need this chair anymore.
Relax. You'll need your energy.
Did you get any sleep on the plane?
No.
So, why doesn't she like to fly?
What?
Your mom. Flying.
Oh.
Uh, one, well, one day she woke up
and she decided she wanted to take us to Disneyland
which sounded like a great idea.
We got to skip school, and we all rushed to the airport.
She didn't get on the plane? No.
When we were flying over Nevada
the pilot came over the P.A. playing tour guide
and... she freaked out.
She was convinced we were flying over a nuclear test site
and she tried to open the emergency exit door.
It took two flight attendants and three passengers
to restrain her.
And they tied her up
right there in the seat next to me
and she screamed her head off all the way to Los Angeles.
Did you ever make it to Disneyland?
No.
30 years and I still wonder.
Wonder what?
What brings her here.
MAN: He was an interstate trucker.
Freelance, by the look of his rig.
Stayed one night, prepaid the week and then left.
I figured he'd be coming back for her.
She was ordering pizza for awhile and then nothing.
I saw her by the candy machine a few times.
Tried to talk to her. She didn't say nothing.
Whoa. Shouldn't we, uh, we should knock first.
No, she don't answer.
Maggie?
Maggie, it's, uh, it's John Carter.
We met in Chicago.
I have Abby with me.
Told you.
Thanks, we'll take it from here.
You're paying her bill, right? Yeah, I'll be up to take care of it.
Mom.
God.
Abby.
Come on.
Do you have any clean clothes?
Mom?
Mom, do you know where you are?
I'm in a motel.
Where?
Where's the motel?
It's in Oklahoma.
( knocking on door ) Abby? Yeah.
How is she?
Oriented. No focal findings.
Can you run out to the car for me and grab my bag?
I brought extra clothes.
Yeah, sure.
Okay, raise your arms. No.
Yeah. No.
I need you to raise your arms, Mom, please?
No. Come on.
( phone ringing )
Hello.
Who's this?
Hey.
Nah, Abby's inside with her mom. We're at the motel.
I don't know. I haven't really seen her yet.
Abby's giving her a bath.
( clears throat )
Yeah, I will.
What?
You related to her?
I'm just going to set them on the bed, okay?
LOCKHART: Thank you.
And, uh, Luka called. He said you can call him tonight.
Abby?
Yeah?
There's a diner about a half a mile down the road.
You want me to pick up something to eat?
Uh... yeah.
Some eggs maybe, and some toast.
Sure.
Okay, I'll be right back.
You going to be okay?
Abby?
Yep.
Okay, lean your head back.
No.
Come on.
Come on.
There you go.
( groans )
You're okay.
I have to go to the bathroom.
Someone? Please?
A nurse will help you.
When?
Soon. You're late.
Four minutes. I needed a coffee.
You wouldn't be late if Dr. Weaver was here.
That's true, but she's not.
Yep, show time.
Will you take me to the bathroom?
Get this guy a urinal, will you, Frank? Find a nurse.
MAN: Ow, my foot. What have we got?
MORALES: Frat boy. Jumped roof to roof, didn't quite make it.
Yeah, you had a few, man?
Yeah, stopped counting yesterday.
I can't walk on either leg.
Reed, you baby. Pete's the one really messed up.
Dude.
B.P. 110/65, pulse 120.
Complains of right-sided chest pain.
Oh, man, you really ate it, bro.
I'm okay, man, I hit the trees.
Trauma panel, c-spine, chest and pelvis.
Fall from height?
Second story, maybe 20 feet.
Losers couldn't clear six feet.
Yeah, looks like you had trouble, too.
I was the only one that made it.
How'd he fall? I jumped.
Ugh.
( knocking )
Come in.
No toast.
I hope you like biscuits.
Whatever.
Hi, Maggie.
John Carter.
Abby's friend.
Abby, you don't have to clean up.
I gave the guy a little extra money for the mess.
Abby.
You don't have to clean up.
I took care of it.
Here, are you hungry?
No.
But she needs to eat, so...
Okay, Mom.
I need you to eat some eggs now.
No. Yes.
No. Yep.
I'll settle for one bite.
No. Come on.
Oh, my God, no.
Come on, just one bite.
Eh, get that away.
Okay, well, we're ready to go then.
I don't want it.
No.
Yeah, we're leaving.
Let's go.
No, I want to stay here.
Can you get the bags, please?
I'm staying here.
No, you're not staying here. I'm staying here.
I'm taking you back to Chicago.
I don't want to.
Mom...
I don't want to go back.
I don't want to go.
Mom, this one you're not going to win
so get up, get off the bed, now.
Abby.
Okay, we'll carry you to the car then.
No. We're going to carry you.
Damn it, Abby, I want to stay.
You sure? Yeah, I'm sure.
Get her into the car.
Why can't I stay here?
Why can't I just stay here?
Please, just let me stay here.
Come on, Maggie.
Come on, sweetheart.
Why can't I just stay?
No, no.
I want to stay here.
Why won't you let me stay?
Just let me stay here.
Damn it!
Just let me stay!
Why won't you let me stay?
God.
God...
Seat belt?
No, just go.
Stay here.
I want to stay here...
Let's get a post-procedure film on the way to unit.
You want a Foley?
Sure, let's get this idiot a tube in every orifice.
Can I please go to the bathroom?
Haleh, would you please take this man to the bathroom?
In a minute.
Benton, right?
Peter Benton.
Have I seen you before?
Yes. What for?
I believe it was an exploding condom.
Excuse me?
You filled a condom with gas from a Bunsen burner
and set it on fire in my classroom.
Ahh, Mr. Ferris!
How are you?
You remember, yes, yes.
I guess all that detention time paid off.
Hey, come on.
I'll take you to the bathroom.
Oh, thanks, I'm about to have an accident.
You grew a few inches. Uh-huh.
So, how've you been?
Good until last month-- I had a stroke.
What from?
Atrial fibrillation.
It left me with some left-sided weakness, but I'm managing.
What are you doing here today?
I had my teeth cleaned a few days ago
and they won't stop bleeding.
Hmm, what's your Coumadin dosage?
Five milligrams.
Any other bleeding?
From your nose or...
No, just my gums.
Did they draw your blood?
An hour ago.
You know what, I'll try to track down your labs
and see what your prothrombin time is.
Thank you, Peter.
I mean, Dr. Benton.
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have let you come here.
You shouldn't have to deal with this.
This is...
It's no problem.
Is this as bad as it gets?
Has it been worse?
It's always different.
Sort of.
Or maybe I'm different.
Your perspective changes from seven to, to 20.
Although, it was pretty bad
the time she locked herself in the garage
and turned on both cars.
She's been suicidal?
If you count attempted suicide.
How many times?
Seriously, two times.
You cut a tendon, Adam.
Broken bottle.
It was stupid. My fault.
Let me guess.
Greek Week.
How'd you know?
Because you smell like you slept in a beer garden.
Actually, a car trunk. Oh...
Here.
( retching )
So you were locked in a trunk?
Yeah.
It's a... it's a pledging thing.
Uh-huh. And that's supposed to
make you feel like a man?
I don't know.
It's tradition.
How did the bottle break?
I was, uh... I was pounding it on the trunk of the car.
I don't know why, but I panicked in there.
It's called claustrophobia.
But I knew they'd come back.
They did last time.
You did this before?
Yeah, I'm pledging again.
I didn't make it through last time.
Well, I guess you really want this, huh?
It's a good house
and they're good guys.
CORDAY: Don't you think you're jumping the gun?
Hold on a sec. I'll be right back.
You're about ready to pop.
Shouldn't I be the judge of that?
Is this time for real?
We should've been here a few hours ago.
We were.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
If we waited any longer
we would've had a home birth.
You get any sleep?
Do I look rested?
Okay. Good luck.
Thanks.
LOCKHART: And a chef's salad
and a cup of pea soup for her.
No. Just coffee.
You have to eat something.
Mom.
Pie.
Okay, fine.
But could you bring a glass of milk, also, please?
Well, it's about 30 more miles to Springfield
and there's not much after that until St. Louis.
Unless you want to stay in a town called Lebanon.
Sounds kind of dangerous.
So... Maggie, how'd you end up in Oklahoma?
Don't bother.
He can talk to me if he wants.
Fine. How'd you end up in Oklahoma?
None of your business.
Ooh, what's that?
Depakote.
No. No, you can't make me, Abby.
I don't want to make you.
I want you...
No. No. No.
to do it on your own.
Thanks.
Mmm.
I have to go to the bathroom.
No.
I can order for myself
I can talk for myself, I can pee for myself.
Just...
I'm not a child.
It's a bathroom.
What am I going to do?
You going to follow me in the stall?
No.
Don't expect a thank you.
We needed to start her on her medication.
How long does it take to reach therapeutic levels?
Tomorrow night.
It's ten hours to Chicago.
I'll take her to my house
and I'm trying to get her to psych intake on Monday.
Well, are you working on Monday?
No, I'll switch shifts.
Well, what about Monday night?
Uh... Luka, I'm going to have to call you back.
Why?
I'll call you back.
No, no, wait.
Where'd she go?
You're completely misinterpreting this. What?
My mother.
I thought I locked that door.
I unlocked it.
Okay.
I needed some air.
Okay. Okay.
See that family down there?
Right down there.
Those two little boys over there--
they're fighting by the pool.
Do you see them?
And I think that must be their parents over there
having a cocktail.
I watch people like that for hours.
People doing their marketing...
tying their shoes...
Just doing routine things
that probably bore them to tears.
I think how lucky they are.
They have...
They have ordinary lives.
You could be like them.
No, I couldn't.
I couldn't ever be like them.
Yes, if you took your medication.
I tried.
I did everything I could think of.
I got married, I had two kids.
I tried to fool everyone that I was just like them.
God, why did you come, Abby?
Because you needed me.
There's no one here to save.
LOCKHART: Do you want me to talk to her?
What would you say?
That I asked you to come with me
to help me with my mother.
You didn't ask me to come with you.
Just get back and send her some flowers.
I'm sure it'll be fine.
I don't think so.
She's young.
If you're going to get involved with a teenager
you have to expect a little drama.
We broke up.
You broke up?
She broke up.
When? Last night.
She broke up with you over a basketball game?
Over you.
That's silly.
What does she think--
we're having an illicit affair or something?
No. Just that I have a crush on you.
Whatever.
It's not like the, uh, relationship
didn't have its obstacles.
Yeah, I know, but I wouldn't want you
to break up because of me.
Face it.
You're a home wrecker.
Dr. Greene?
Hey, Malucci.
Hey, I got you your cigars.
Ah, great.
Congratulations.
Wow, she's a cute one. Look at her.
You'll have to keep the boys away from her, you know what I mean?
What's her name?
Ella.
Ella, you're quite the heifer, aren't you?
Can I hold her?
No.
I just washed my hands.
Good for you, Dave.
You serious?
I'll see you later.
Why can't I hold her?
Go away, Dave.
Hey, you owe me 300 bucks for those cigars.
What's the matter?
My mother's coming.
She just left.
Yes, well, she decided
she wanted to come help with her granddaughter.
We'll all get along famously.
Yeah, we'll see.
How did she do?
She was an angel.
She didn't even cry with the heel stick.
Now she's going to give her mother a hard time.
Well, if you don't feed her, I think she will.
I think she's hungry.
Well, the postpartum nurse
said she'd walk me through breast-feeding.
I don't think Ella knows that.
I suppose I can... wing it.
There we go. Oh, yeah.
Oh, it's okay.
It's okay.
Just try to keep the head above the tummy.
Okay.
There you go.
( baby crying )
I don't know that I can do this, Mark.
Yes, you can. It just takes patience.
No, I mean... I mean...
I know, I know what you mean.
You're going to do great.
You're...
( crying stops )
( chuckling softly )
See?
( chuckling )
Can I help you?
MAN: Looks like you got a leak, ma'am.
What?
Yeah. Here's your problem.
You must've run over a nail.
But it just started hissing.
Yeah, I can patch that for you, $15.
You did that.
Just because I saw it doesn't mean I did it.
You put that nail in the tire.
CARTER: What's the problem?
This guy popped the tire.
He thinks I don't know about cars 'cause I'm a woman.
You want me to fix it? Ten bucks.
His price is going down.
You should fix it before we call the cops.
Five bucks.
Negotiating with me now?
Mom.
Mom.
Mom!
Mom!
What?
What are you doing?
I'm hungry.
You're hungry?
Yeah.
Okay. I'll go with you.
You all right?
Do you want something to eat?
No. What?
No. Here.
What's that? Egg salad.
That's disgusting.
It's not as disgusting as Twinkies.
I don't want it.
Uh, and a veggie burrito.
You're getting a Slurpie.
Fine. And some Twinkies.
Anything else?
Yeah, pack of light cigarettes.
Oh, that's a nasty habit.
I know that.
You should take better care of yourself.
$9.49.
Maybe I'm just being paranoid.
She was pretty close to traffic.
It's hard not to overreact sometimes.
She seems better today.
She couldn't really be worse.
All right, I'm going to go pay Paco his three bucks.
I'll bring the car around.
MAGGIE: Coming.
You all set?
Yeah.
How much longer to Chicago?
Two or three hours.
Abby, thank you for coming.
Good news.
They haven't given your room away.
Frank's calling a cab.
Right, Frank? Right.
So, don't take any Coumadin tonight.
You're going to take four milligrams tomorrow
and I am going to see you on Friday.
Thank you, Peter.
Ah, you're welcome.
Well, I have to say
I'm impressed by your dispo skills.
I talked to everyone at his Board and Care
and they all refused to take him.
Yeah, well, I promised to go by and do his blood test.
Every other day?
Mm-hmm.
Since when does Peter Benton
give home care?
Ah, well, you know what?
I owe that guy.
He must've done something
for you to make house calls.
He was my junior high science teacher.
I did something, I should've been expelled.
He gave me a month's worth of detention instead.
Expelled?
What did you do, blow the place up?
Almost. I had to prep the experiments
the night before and just, you know
it changed how I thought about things;
how I looked at school, science, everything.
You ever tell him?
No.
What was that for?
School, science, everything.
You did not.
I did.
You did not.
Why would I make that up?
You got a perm?
Twice.
Twice?
What?
It was junior high school.
That was the style.
Now, I don't know what planet you grew up on
but I do not remember
perms on boys ever being popular.
Yes, it was.
I don't...
Jenny Butler liked it.
I have to see pictures of it.
I think I burned them all.
Twice.
So that means you thought
it looked good the first time.
As far as youthful transgressions go
I think it scores pretty low on the scale.
If you say so.
Is she still out?
Yeah.
( groans )
Well, I think you'll be all right
by yourself tonight.
I should be.
I really want to thank you again for doing this.
You didn't have to.
I'd never seen Oklahoma before...
No.
I mean it.
Well, I'll help you inside.
Okay, Mom, we're here.
Mom.
Wake up.
We have to go inside.
Mom.
Mom.
Mom!
John!
What?
She's not waking up.
Maggie!
Maggie, can you hear me?
Maggie!
Pupils are dilated.
How much?
About nine millimeters. She take something?
I don't know. Sit her up.
Did you see her take something?
No. She's tachy.
Oh, God.
Pulse is 130. Oh, God.
I don't see any sign of head injury.
She took something.
Where'd she get it from?
Call the paramedics.
What are you doing?
We can be there before they can get here.
Come on, shut that door.
Keep her chin up.
Keep her airway open.
Chuny, pull an intubation kit, get a vent, NG and charcoal.

How many are missing?
All of them.

That's 900 milligrams.
Okay, stand by with bicarb.
Hurry up, Carter.
Give me some crichoid pressure.
Charcoal after intubation.
Abby, do you want to be in here?
QRS complex is .16.
Push the bicarb.
Okay, I'm in.
Abby?
I'm okay.

Long time. They thought he was sleeping.
What's the writing?
His frat brothers did it.
They were trying to clean him off.
Peter splinted this guy yesterday.
I can't get a radial pulse.
Nothing at the neck either.
Peter, was this your patient?!
He's in V-tach.
Charge the portable paddles.
What the hell happened?
Too much to drink. Charged to 200.
Clear!
How much?
Uh, they were having a shot contest.
Is someone coming in?
I don't know, they're all pretty drunk.
Still V-tach.
Charge again. Amp of epi. Come on.
Clear!
No change. 100 of Lidocaine.
Let's charge to 360.
I'll shock him again.
If that doesn't work, we'll get him on the gurney.
He's young. We can get him back.

She's seizing. Whoa, watch the tube.
Four of Ativan.

Somebody help me keep her head steady.
Hold on, hold on.
Ativan's on board.
Another four?
Give it a minute to work.
Still fib.
Pulse ox down to 72.
All right. Um...

Wait, aren't you going to shock him again?
You can't shock a flatline.
You only shocked him once.
We've been shocking him for 40 minutes.
No capture, no pulse.
Time of death 20:23.
But.. you got to help him.
His heart's been deprived of oxygen too long.
He's gone.
Here.
Clean him up.
What?
You and your friends.
You wrote this on him, right?
Yeah, but-but it was just a joke.
I hope you got a good laugh out of it.
I didn't know this was going to happen.
You're his big brother.
You're supposed to look out for him.
Well, he drank volun...
Shh, shh, shh.
Just shut up, all right.
Now get over there and you clean him up.
Hey, Maggie.
Maggie, can you squeeze my hand?

HALEH: CT said they can take you on the way.
She's got a unit bed?
2102.
You want to call Psych?
No, no, not yet.
She should be on a hold.
They can't talk to her.
Pressure's down to 80 after two liters.
KOVAC: I want her in a hold when she wakes up.
She might not wake up.
Dr. Benton?
Dr. Benton?
Hey.
What are you doing here?
Is this a bad time?
No. I, uh...
I just had to tell a father in Iowa
that he lost a son.
So, it is a bad time.
What can I do for you?
I wanted to let you know--
I was accepted into med school.
Yeah, I know, I know.
Congratulations.
I want to thank you for your help.
You deserved it.
But it wouldn't have been an option
if you hadn't gone out of your way.
Look, uh... don't thank me.
Just... just work your ass off, all right?
( coffee lands in trash )
They extubated her?
She woke up and started fighting the vent.
Her vitals are normal.
Did you get a hold?
Legaspi saw her.
I thought I was watching her every second.
That's not possible.
I should've listened to you.
She'll be okay.
She'll never be okay.
