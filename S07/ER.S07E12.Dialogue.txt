Previously on ER:
I feel terrible about what's happened.
What? Me being crippled
or you getting sued for malpractice?
CARTER: I took Vicodin
from a patient's prescription bottle
and I swallowed them.
Did you successfully expel them?
Yes.
You coming back to work soon?
Uh, next week, I hope.
I heard you're doing immune therapy.
As soon as the tumor vaccine's ready.
I'm sorry, I can't stay.
I'll send in a surgical resident.
ROMANO: Where do you think you're going?
I'm sorry. Lizzie, get your ass over here now!
Look, I know that it's been tense between us
and I really don't mean it to be.
In a few weeks we'll just be
friendly co-workers all over again.
I'm not sure that's what I want.
LEGASPI: Kerry... I'm going to put a fresh towel
on the sink for you.
Okay, thank you.
What time does your shift start?
Uh... 9:00.
Oh, yeah, you better hurry up.
( giggling ): Do you want some coffee?
Sure. Thanks.
Okay.
That looks good on you.
What?
My blouse.
Oh, yeah.
It's not too long...?
No.
It's a good thing I have
a 40-gallon water heater.
What?
You take long showers.
I'm sorry.
No, no, so do I.
Sometimes, I have to stand under there
for 20 minutes just to wake up
when it's cold.
Especially in winter.
Is it cold outside? Low 20s.
Do you want a bagel?
No, thanks.
You know, I've got to-- I'll get something at work.
Okay.
You okay?
Yeah-- no--
I got it, I got it.
No, I meant about us.
First time can be a little...
No, it's just...
just different.
That's true.
But good.
Really?
Yeah.
I'll see you at work.
Yeah.
Okay.
I'll see you later.
Hey, um...
I'm sorry, but I-I know this is understood
but I just... this is just going to be between us, right?
Of course.
I'll get the door.
Open a GAI-50
and a TA-55 on the resection.
No need, Peter-- I gave it to Henderson.
What?
Page us if the CAT scan shows free air.
Come on, let's go.
Where we going?
I got a chore for you.
You know what, I'm a little busy.
Yeah, so am I. Let's go.
So, Peter... how is this, uh
per diem situation working out for you?
Could be a lot better.
Really? What's the problem?
Where we going?
Are you, uh, dissatisfied in some way?
Besides being grossly underpaid?
Ah, well, would a $10,000-a-year raise
and a limited benefit package help?
What?
Okay, let's make it $20,000, but that's my final offer
and you'll have to take on
some administrative responsibilities.
You're serious. Yeah, yeah.
Look, you've been, uh
you've been doing your penance.
You've been working hard, displaying dedication
and an appropriate amount of groveling.
I'd have to be a complete sadist
if I didn't ease up eventually.
What do I have to do?
A little of this, a little of that.
Won't take you more than a few hours a month.
What's in it for you?
All right, fine. Forget it.
Go back to surgery.
Hey, I'm just asking.
No look, do you want the bump or don't you?
Sure.
So, we have a deal?
Yeah.
Okay, let's go.
This way please.
Sorry for the delay, everybody.
Dr. Benton had to finish
a complicated pancreatoduodenectomy
on a gunshot wound to the abdomen.
Come on in, Peter. Don't be shy.
Come on, come on.
Okay, now, as you
are all aware, we at the county level
are very concerned about the declining numbers
of minority medical school students
and faculty physicians
not only here in Chicago, but nationwide.
The medical school is committed to addressing this issue.
And, as part of that commitment, I am appointing
a Director of Diversity for the medical center--
Dr. Peter Benton.
Dr. Benton's bio and resume
can be found in your handout materials.
So, he's all yours.
REPORTER: Dr. Benton, is your appointment
the direct result of the Trib's investigative report
about the declining numbers
of African-Americans being admitted to medical school?
I, uh...
uh...
Well, I mean, you know, it, uh...
it could be a part of it.
How can you insure minority representation
at the medical school
in this post- affirmative action era?
CARTER: Is he drinking?
DIANA: Just water.
He had a little rice three days ago.
Did you start an IV?
We can't give him
intravenous fluids without a court order.
Call Dr. Samson.
Dr. Samson doesn't work here anymore.
What?!
Dr. Miller treats your cousin now.
Fine. Call him.
That's probably not necessary
now that you're here.
Why is that?
I think he's just lonely.
Can you get me a, uh...
a protein shake, or something?
Mmm.
Hey, Chase.
It's John.
Mind if I sit down?
Hey, I'm, uh, sorry that I haven't been
around here very much.
I've been busy.
For a year?
You're right...
you're right, that's not an excuse.
Hey, your speech sounds good.
You been, uh...
getting around much?
Nope.
NURSE: Here you go.
( shaking can )
You know, you've got to eat something, Chase.
( pops top on can )
Nope.
Why not? What's the matter?
Come on, just take a sip.
No.
Just take a little sip.
No!
Maybe later.
Go away.
Let me know if this hurts.
Ow! Hell, yes! Wuss.
You want another beating? Keep talking.
Nasal film and a skin series. I'm sitting right here.
This is his sparring partner, Walter.
Lip lac and a possible broken jaw.
Aren't you guys too old to be fighting?
Never too old to defend a lady's honor.
Is this over a woman?
"Grace is in all her steps
"Beauty in her eyes
In every gesture, dignity and love."
Yeah, don't let him fool you.
He stole that from a book.
At least I know how to read.
Yeah, with your lips moving.
Lip? I'll give you... Okay, okay, okay.
Let's start with, uh, 6-0 nylon.
And let's try and keep these kids apart, shall we?
WEAVER: Hey, Mark?
Morning, Kerry.
How's it going?
Uh, well, snow blower blew a rock into a guy's larynx.
I had to trake him.
No, I meant with you-- you know, first day back.
So far, so good. Good.
I'll let you know at the end of my four hours.
You getting a little backed up?
Three patients waiting for a surgical consult.
Who's on the service?
Peter, but, she's stuck in a press conference.
Who?
Peter. She's been in for an hour.
Who's she?
What?
Wait, I mean, I mean, who's giving a press conference?
Oh, I don't know what it's for
but I heard Peter's in it.
KOVAC: Kerry.
Yep.
Can you call radiology?
They sent this guy back without his films.
And they won't chase them down.
Is there any bone exposed?
Yeah, I have to rongeur it
and I need the X ray.
How did it happen?
I don't know, they just lost it.
No, the finger? I don't know. He won't say.
Um, ¿Habla usted ingles?
No.
Chuni already tried.
¿Como se corto el dedo?
Fue un accidente.
Looks like some kind of saw.
¿Con que se corto?
Me corte en el trabajo.
What did he say?
¿Donde trabaja?
¿Donde?
Told you.
Did someone bring him in?
I think he took a cab.
What cab company?
Nobody saw him arrive?
Malik was out there. Why?
Okay, we should put a call in to OSHA.
OSHA?
They monitor workplace safety requirements.
He's probably illegal
and he isn't saying anything
because he doesn't want to lose his job.
That's his choice, isn't it?
Until someone gets seriously hurt.
I'll call, find out where they picked him up.
I just need you to call radiology...
I gave you a promotion. What are you crying about?
You should have talked it over with me first.
I did talk to you about it.
I said a little extra money for added responsibilities.
I don't like being used. Everyone is used, Peter.
It's what makes the world go round.
The only reason you gave me that job is because I'm black.
Well, you're discounting
your finely honed public relations skills.
I don't want it.
Sure you do. Nope, I don't.
Well, you should've thought of that
before your press conference.
Look, surprise, yes.
I need a minority to be the Director of Diversity.
But it's not going to require any real work.
It's going to get you that much closer
to a full-time faculty position
so please get over yourself.
You know what? You can find somebody else
to be your little poster boy.
Well, I... I... the truth is I don't have anyone else.
Which is a perfect example
of why the diversity issue
needs your immediate attention.
You don't even believe that.
Actually, I do. But look...
it doesn't really matter, does it?
It's on your shoulders now.
Excuse me, I have a meeting.
Time's up, Peter.
Did I misread the schedule?
What schedule?
You canceled six elective cases in the past week.
The weren't canceled. They were rescheduled.
Which means canceled.
One had a fever.
Another had a family emergency.
All of them happened to be
the more complex procedures.
If that's true, it's simple coincidence, I assure you.
Look, I've been completely slammed by this JACHO review.
Nothing seems to be up to standard at the moment.
I have every confidence
that you'll get them up to standard.
But I also need an Associate Chief of Surgery
who actually performs surgery.
I do.
I will, gladly, once I get out from under all of this.
No. Today.
You're covering the ER.
Robert, they're coming on Monday.
You only have to go down there if they page you.
( sighs )
Are you married?
No.
Oh? A cute girl like yourself?
Well, he didn't crack your skull.
What?
There's no blood behind your eardrum.
He didn't crack your skull.
He couldn't crack a smile.
You know I'm a big proponent of marriage.
Of course, you've got to be married to the right person.
Is that a proposal?
We have to get to know each other first.
We have to wait on the X ray of your hand
but I don't see any other injuries.
Does anything else hurt?
Nothing I want to talk about in mixed company.
Well, I'm a nurse.
Just the same, if I'm going to talk to you
about my private parts
I'd prefer to do it in a social setting.
Does it hurt when you pee?
Yeah, how'd you know?
Do you have an enlarged prostate?
It's large enough.
Well, it could be prostatitis.
I'm gonna need a urine sample.
You're gonna have to hold it a little lower.
I'm going to show you to the bathroom.
You know, actually, it feels more like
something you pick up.
Pick up?
Yeah, burning.
I got it once before when I was stationed in Korea.
From sex?
Well, I didn't get it from dancing.
Abby, we need you.
Grab a hundred mannitol.
Gunshot wound to the head. Okay.
I'll be right back. Pee in that.
From here?
PARAMEDIC: Intubated in the field.
Pressure's only 80 systolic
after two liters.
What do you want for labs?
Full trauma panel.
Get a c-spine, cross him for four.
On my count. One, two, three...
Sinus at 65.
Rate's coming down.
What is it?
15-year-old with self-inflicted gunshot
to the right temple at close range.
Pupils are fixed and dilated.
Was there a suicide note?
No, his friend claimed
they were playing Russian Roulette.
Oh, God. Guy's right behind us.
Bullet blew through this one and grazed his cheek.
There's no response to painful stimuli.
I smell alcohol.
He could just be drunk.
Dropped his systolic to 70, bradying down to 50.
Amp of atropine.
Open the fluids. Pump in O-neg.
What are you doing?
Massive blood loss from the scalp.
Could be the cause of his low blood pressure.
Or he could have blown out his brain stem.
Crit's 39.
Doesn't sound like blood loss.
HALEH: So do you want O-neg?
But if you want to try transfusing him...
Uh, yes, hang two units
on the rapid infuser.
I'll put in a central line.
What?
Nothing.
Is this the other guy? Yeah.
Superficial cheek abrasions, cranial nerves intact.
You were playing Russian Roulette?
What?
Olbes said they were playing Russian Roulette.
It was his idea.
Gram of ancef is up.
How old are you? Why?
How old are you?
He wanted to play.
Mark, I got this.
What, 20?
Nineteen.
He's 15 years old. He's drunk.
I could smell the alcohol
from across the room.
He came over that way.
Give her anything to drink?
Who?
Your friend.
He brought a case of beer along with his dad's gun.
Then you made him hold the gun to his head.
I didn't make him do anything.
Hell, I went first.
It was his idea, but you went first.
Yeah, better odds.
Better odds? Hey.
That's the point of the game.
It's not a game.
She blew his brains out.
Who's she?
What?
You said "she."
He. He's dead.
He loaded the bullet.
He knew what could happen.
Where are the police, huh?
Why aren't they arresting this idiot?
I didn't kill him.
The hell you didn't.
Did you call it?
Yeah, after six units of blood
and 45 minutes of CPR.
I should never have started.
You wanted to make sure.
Rubbish.
You would have called it from the beginning.
Yeah, but I'm lazy.
Mark, please.
You wanted to give it a chance.
No big failure.
I'm going back upstairs.
Later, Gator.
Hey, you taking it easy?
Yes, Mom.
Sour milk?
It came back from the dry cleaners like that.
Smell it. It's fine.
So anyway, he's not psychotic?
Uh, no.
Sociopathic maybe, but, no, I can't hold him.
We'll leave it up to police.
Thanks.
Anytime.
So, Elizabeth...
Yeah.
Is Mark doing okay?
Very well.
There's no change in personality, or...
He's a little tired, why?
Have you noticed that he's mixing his pronouns?
Uh, mixing, how?
Well, like saying "she" when he means "he."
Uh, it's nothing that I've noticed.
Has he said anything to you about it?
I don't think he realizes.
Well, maybe you've misheard.
Yeah. Maybe.
Doctor Weaver.
I'm starting my shift. Yep.
Okay.
You wanted to see me before I started my shift.
Well, uh, I've been thinking about it
and the fact that you told me
that you claimed responsibility
I, I think is a positive sign.
Therefore, I feel
that I can't summarily dismiss you.
But...?
What chip are you up to?
What?
Your AA chip. Oh.
How many days of sobriety?
240.
Okay, give it to me.
It's, uh, it's at home.
All right.
Well, you're starting over.
Day One.
Another 90 days, another 90 meetings
and I need documentation.
And you'll go back to not administering or distributing
any Schedule Two narcotics or benzos
until further notice.
But, that's it, Carter.
Even the smallest infraction
and you no longer work here, is that clear?
Understood. Good.
Thank you.
Don't make me regret it, John.
How are you doing, Mr. Nicoladies?
Call me Walter.
Walter.
I'd be doing a whole lot better with a sponge bath.
You want a bath?
Yes, please.
Malik.
Yo.
What?
Oh, no.
I'm fine, really, I was just kidding.
Okay, never mind.
Whatever. Geez.
Boy, you're a real firecracker, aren't you?
That's me.
Nurse Firecracker.
Hmm, married?
None of your business.
My second wife was a spinster.
Married her when she was 32.
Well, just waiting for the right guy, I guess.
Yeah, damn right.
We were married for another 32 years before she passed.
You know, but don't you worry because feisty gals like you
always take a little longer.
I wasn't the one who was brought in for fighting.
Oh, well, Earl started that.
He was flirting with my Victoria.
Who's Victoria?
My lady friend.
Are the two of you intimate?
Well, I still get up a full head of steam
if that's what you're driving at.
I see.
Uh, tell me, Walter
have you been experiencing any burning when you pee?
I mean, it was cool at first
but then my girlfriend went to work
and it just stayed like that.
You taken any drugs lately, uh, Gary?
A little coke.
Okay, that'll do it.
You tried masturbating?
No, I'm a Christian.
Oh, well, too bad.
Sometimes that helps.
Guess we'll have to drain it.
How?
With a needle.
Do you have a men's room around?
Yeah, down the hall to the left.
I'll check back.
HALEH: How you know she's gay?
MALUCCI: It's obvious.
KOVAC: Are the fibroids actively bleeding?
Crit is down to 28.
I mean, why risk multiple transfusions
if she's not gonna use it anyway?
Her uterus. Use what?
Oh, come on!
What do you want me to do with these? What?
These files.
Dr. Benton's on the med school admissions committee...
MALUCCI: ...it doesn't ensure they won't come back.
A hysterectomy is the safest way to go, man.
Dr. Weaver?
Uh, lounge.
I'll just make sure she understands the risks.
Hey, Malucci, be careful.
I don't want a lawsuit.
Hey, I'm the King of Couth, Chief.
FRANK: Great. Storm's back.
It's snowing again.
Is this my hand X ray?
Does it have your name on it?
Yes. Then it's yours.
Orbie Coronado from OSHA called back
said thanks for the address
wanted to let you know someone from the INS
may be calling.
Wait a minute, I didn't want them to call the INS.
Is that my patient?
They've been having problems
with furniture sweatshops in that area.
Call back, I need to find out what he said.
That's great, Kerry.
Hey, we have a responsibility
to report unsafe working conditions.
You don't know that.
He wouldn't even say how he cut it.
He was scared. Yeah, scared of getting deported.
Nobody's getting deported.
Why the hell not?
If he's illegal, he's illegal.
I mean, who's paying for this guy?
Shut up, Frank.
Hi. Hey.
Hey, I heard you got stuck with a couple grumpy old men.
Well, horny old men is more like it.
They both have chlamydia.
How old are they?
Late 70s.
Seems to be going around the nursing home.
It's nice to know
there's more than shuffleboard in our futures.
You want Mr. Baker, 20-year-old sickler in crisis?
Better not.
Why not?
Because I'm back to not pushing narcotics.
You told Weaver?
Yeah.
She was okay?
Well, not okay, but she let me stay
with a few reinforced restrictions.
Good for you.
I guess.
No, I mean it.
Well, thanks for the push.
JARVIK: Carter?
Wound check in Five.
I'm coming, I'm coming.
He's getting difficult. I'll be there.
GREENE: Both EKGs are normal.
Cardiac enzymes are normal.
We just talked to his cardiologist.
He said that he should have a treadmill test
and maybe an angiogram.
He probably meant as an outpatient.
He didn't say that.
That's what he meant.
Keep taking your medications
as directed, and come back if there are any problems.
That's it?! Make sure
you see your cardiologist
when you get back home.
You're not
going to admit him?
Nope.
Georgia, it's all right.
I want him checked in.
This isn't a hotel.
I told you we shouldn't have gone
to a county hospital. Georgia...
Is there another doctor?
I want a second opinion.
Okay. Here's your second opinion.
Your husband's overweight.
He suffers from stable angina.
He needs to stop drinking and smoking.
He needs to lay off the pizza, burgers and fries
and get some exercise
otherwise, all the second opinions in the world
are not going to keep him
from dropping dead in the next two years.
MALUCCI: I'll clear the trauma rooms.
Notify respiratory and the ICU.
HALEH: I'm calling the blood bank.
Can I get eight units of O-neg
and every bag of ringer's that central has.
Carter, what's going on?
Rescue's bringing in multiple victims of a basement fire.
Smoke inhalation, crush injuries and flash burns. How many?
I don't know, they were too busy to count.
Call the OR? Yeah, and the burn unit.
ETA? They're rolling in.
CARTER: Mark, you get this
I'll take the one on the end.
Partial thickness burns to the right arm and face.
What happened? Some kind of raid.
Bunch of workers got trapped.
BP 120/60 pulse 92.
Keep her on O2 and check her carboxyhemoglobin level.
( crying and screaming )
Have respiratory put him at .5 albuterol.
Mark, I thought you were off.
Not anymore.
You need to take it easy.
Not much chance of that.
Why don't you go triage?
I'm fine.
Flush out the joint upstairs!
She was by herself.
I just threw her in the front seat
as I pulled out with a critical.
Any burns? Just a superficial lac to the right calf
with bony tenderness.
( speaking Spanish )
What's she saying?
She's saying she wants her mom.
Smoke inhalation with pleuritic chest pain.
Malik, I need a blood gas on this guy right away.
Portable chest?
Yeah, and get me a twelve lead.
PARAMEDIC: Got an INS officer who crushed his pelvis.
Decreased tidal volume.
WEAVER: Any shortness of breath?
Did they get out? Who?
We only got half of them out.
They had the windows to the place barred shut.
What place?
We got a tip on an illegal sweatshop.
We went to case it, it just started burning.
Sats are down to 82.
Dr. Weaver
his pulse ox is falling.
Put him on 15 liters, open an intubation tray.
He needs a trauma consult now. Go.
Ay, me duele mucho!
Decreased breath sounds on the left.
Carter, can you take this?
Possible pneumothorax.
Yeah, Trauma Two.
Luka?
30-year-old male, full thickness burns over most of his body.
B.P. 100/70, pulse 120.
Where should we go?
Just get him out of the hallway.
How much fluid in?
One liter Ringer's and ten of morphine.
MAN: Ernesto!
Okay, give another round of both.
I need a sterile gown and gloves.
Quien comenzo el incendio?
ERNESTO: No se.
KOVAC: You know each other?
HARMS: Ustedes se conocen?
Si. Trabajamos juntos.
They work together.
Mark! Mark, what's open?
I don't know. Try the suture room.
Suture Room. Go!
He needs an NG tube and a foley.
Open an escharotomy tray.
Dr. Weaver, we're out of I and D kits.
Use suture removal kits for debriding.
MALUCCI: C.B.C., chem panel and cardiac enzymes.
Donde esta? What have you got?
Possible electrical burns.
She may have touched a high-power line
when she pulled some rubble off her daughter.
Vamos a investigar. Por favor, buscala.
How old? She doesn't know what happened to her.
Five. First name Araceli.
Haleh, call dispatch.
See if they have a 20 on a five-year-old girl.
Busca a mi hija.
Good air entry, scattered rales bilaterally.
Put her on a pulse ox.
Here's the entry. Got an exit wound here.
Damn, she's burned from the inside out, huh?
I don't know. What was the voltage on the line?
Well, get on the phone with the incident commander and find out.
JARVIK: Pulse ox 89.
BENTON: Put him up to five liters.
Me duele mucho!
Just take it easy, just take it easy.
Just lay back, just lay back.
Here we go, here we go.
Titrate another ten of morphine.
I think we got about 20 percent partial thickness burns here.
He needs a chest tube on the left.
Lily, I need to prep for an escharotomy.
That doesn't sound very good.
Can you set up
a fiber-optic laryngoscope? In a sec.
I need it now. Go, go, go, go, I got it.
Carter, help me prep the chest.
Hurry up. I'm losing pulses.
How fast do you need the fluids?
I'm estimating 92 percent surface area burns.
Start Ringer's at 1700 cc's per hour.
Setting at 91 on 15 liters.
Okay, switch him to humidified O2, non-rebreather.
Que tan mal estoy?
What?
He's asking how bad it is.
Tell him very serious.
La situacion esta grave.
Me voy a morir?
Am I going to die?
Most likely, yes.
Probablemente, si.
JARVIK: His finger's swollen. I can't get his ring off.
Okay, get the ring cutter.
GREENE: I'm in.
No persistent pneumo, good tube position.
MALIK: He's still hypotensive.
Do you know how it started?
Paint thinner. I think someone
kicked over a space heater when they were running out.
Where's that crit?
I'm working on it.
Borderline widened mediastinum
and a left pleural effusion.
Might be his aorta.
All right, chest CT. Let's move him.
MALIK: Hold on.
Crit's low at 31.
Do you want to take him up to the O.R.?
No, I don't want to open him if I don't have to.
It could just be an intercostal artery.
Fine, fine. We'll do a transesophageal echo.
Somebody call upstairs; tell them we're on our way.
WEAVER: Neck is swollen.
MALUCCI: So are the upper extremities.
Where did you find her? Mija!
She came in with Morales.
HALEH: Sats are dropping: 86.
WEAVER: Put her on high flow O2.
Open saline, push 80 of lasix.
High voltage fried every cell in its path.
Look, her CK is over 2,000.
Donde esta me hija?
It's okay.
Esta bien.
Did you check her out?
She's fine. She has
a non-displaced fracture of the tibia.
Si, Senora. Esta bien. Es posible que
solamente tenga fractura de la pierna.
Mama...
She's okay, see?
Pulse ox dropping: 82.
Okay, lets intubate. Abby, take her out.
Por favor, cuida mela.
WEAVER: Abby, out.
She wants you to take care of her.
Abby, go. Okay.
No te preocupes, mija.
WEAVER: 20 of etomidate, 100 of sux.
Todo va salir bien.
MALUCCI: 8-0 ET tube.
( yelling )
Relax, relax, relax.
No. Me duele!
Okay, okay, Carter hold him down.
Dejame ir!
Hold on, hold on, watch the drape.
Relajate.
Sats are down to 78.
He's getting hypoxic.
All right, push some Versed.
What?
The Versed-- right there on the mayo stand, come on.
Why not? I can't.
I'm not allowed to.
Carter, push the damn Versed.
I got to get this tube in him.
Hold on.
Carter, where are you going?
Hold on.
WEAVER: Inflate the tube. Bag her.
Her complexes are widening.
Dave, go push some Versed for Benton.
I'm busy.
Sats are still dropping.
I got this. Go ahead.
I'm not a nurse. She's hyperkalemic.
Give her ten units of insulin and D-50.
Come on, just do it, man.
You do it.
Dave, go. What?
Now. Help Benton.
You got a run of six.
Get a repeat potassium.
She's in V-tach.
Crash cart. Charge to 200.
Got a weak femoral pulse.
Give an amp of bicarb. Clear.
HALEH: Still V-tach.
Charging 300.
CARTER: Pressure's 60 palp.
Clear.
Pressure's 92 over 62, pulse 110.
Repeat crit is 28.
I can't isolate the aorta.
You got to go in now.
Not blind, I don't.
Come on.
Come on.
Okay, there.
There's extraluminal fluid.
He's torn his aorta.
No kidding.
Set up a thoracotomy tray.
Call the perfusionist.
I'll scrub in.
BABCOCK: Scrub fast.
BJERKE: How much blood?
Eight more units type specific.
Clear.
CARTER: Still in V-tach.
360. A hundred lidocaine, an amp of calcium.
Clear.
What happened?
Lost the pulse.
Damn it. She's in V-fib. Let's start CPR.
I've got it. Benton's taking your patient up.
Did you get the chest tube in?
That's not all.
WEAVER: Clear.
You had to intubate, huh?
A.R.D.S. Sats were low after thoracostomy.
I'm taking him up to the SICU.
Well, I'm sorry. I'm just not allowed
to push controlled substances.
He was about to arrest, Carter.
Part of my diversion agreement.
No exceptions.
Then you don't need to be in there.
If you can't treat a patient, you don't need to be in the room.
I didn't set up the rules this way.
Sometimes you got to use your own judgment.
If I push the Versed, I'm out of here.
How long has it been, eight months?
Yeah. This is ridiculous.
I'll talk to Weaver.
No, no, no, don't.
MALIK: Dr. Benton, post intubation film.
I'll handle it.
It's, uh, you know, it'll just piss her off anyway.
Well, you know what? I'm pissed off.
You should be pissed off.
Well, it's my problem.
No, Carter. It's everybody's problem.
Listen, just don't talk to Weaver, please.
Swelling of the upper airway.
We'll intubate after the escharotomy.
No, no.
Necesitamos hacerlo. Esta cortando la circulacion.
Cuando... cuando me voy a morir?
When? When is he going to die?
In about a week, from infection.
( speaking Spanish )
Your body won't be able to keep the bacteria out.
( speaking Spanish )
You'll also get major fluid imbalances
and possible kidney failure.
( speaking Spanish )
We'll have to put a tube down your throat to help you breathe.
( speaking Spanish )
Pueden buscar a mi esposa?
Can you find his wife?
Does he have a number?
Hay algun numero?
No. Ella esta en Guatemala.
No, she's...
No tiene telefono...
She's in Guatemala and there's no phone there.
( speaking Spanish )
He has $520 in a little box by his bed.
( speaking Spanish )
He lives in a garage at 395 Londale Street.
( speaking Spanish )
Can you get it to her?
( speaking Spanish )
Can you get her the money and tell her what happened to him?
Yeah.
Si, Ernesto.
( speaking Spanish )
Can you tell her I love her?
( speaking Spanish )
I love her very much.
Okay, 30 of etomidate
and six of Pavulon.
( ragged breathing )
Clear.
MALUCCI: Fine V-fib.
Charge again. 360.
Potassium is 7.5.
Pulse ox is 65.
How long has she been down?
HALEH: 25 minutes.
Clear.
Asystole.
How much atropine has she been given?
Two amps.
When was the last epi?
About three minutes ago.
Okay, that's it.
Time of death 12:16.
There was too much internal injury, Chief.
Yeah.
There's more. Rescue found a guy trapped inside
with a blunt head trauma and blown pupil.
All right, let's go.
HALEH: I'll clear the room.
I need better exposure.
Get a large Deaver in here.
That is a large Deaver.
Then give me more retraction.
BABCOCK: I can't maintain this pressure much longer.
Metz. Where's the bypass machine?
Open hearts going in two O.R.s.
First one will be off the pump in 30 minutes.
I need it now.
Right now. These are my last two units.
Debakey.
Lisa, you go in there
you tell them we have an unstable patient on the table.
I did. The pump's not available for... now it's 29 minutes.
Pressure's 80.
You've got to cross clamp him.
No, if I, if I do that
I'll cut off circulation to his spinal cord.
Or you could let him bleed out.
I will not paralyze this man.
You want to kill him?
I can't isolate the aorta.
Find Romano.
We can't wait.
Lisa, now, go!
Carter, I've got to go home.
Girl in Exam One needs a leg burn debridement.
Burn unit's full.
Does she need admission?
No, give him thermazine to use at home.
Boy or girl?
What? You just said him.
Carter, I'm really tired.
So much for a four-hour shift, huh?
See you Monday.
Have a good weekend.
WEAVER: It's none of your business.
It is when it affects patient care.
Dr. Carter did what he was supposed to do.
The guy's SATs were dropping.
Lily, this one needs a tetanus booster and a sterile dressing.
There was an unnecessary delay.
If I need a resident to assist me...
Peter, you are a surgical consultant.
You do not dictate E.R. policy.
This is not policy, Kerry, this is punishment.
Peter, we're not going to have this conversation.
This one needs xeroform and a tube gauze dressing.
In a second.
Fine.
What do you have against him?
What?
He made a mistake; he got through it.
Peter, for the last time
the terms of Carter's diversion program
are not your concern.
Kerry, it's time to let up.
He's been clean now for, what, eight months?
Has he?
Tenth unit's up.
Proximal aorta is dissected.
He taching at 120.
Damn it. There's a traumatic pseudoaneurysm.
Where the hell is Romano?!
I paged him three times.
Did you check his office?
And the staff lounge and his cell phone.
Get the resident on call.
The resident?
Yes. Just get him.
B.P.'s 70 and dropping.
Okay, we'll give him two more units.
This is all I've got.
So, call the blood bank.
They're out of A-positive, I told you.
Then get O-negative!
For Christ's sake, just keep transfusing him!
Don't you understand, I need more time?!
You've got to cross clamp him, now.
Do you want the Zanger or the Craford?
Dr. Corday?
Dr. Corday
what clamp?
Dr. Corday?
The Craford.
The Craford.
We'll establish proximal control.
Open a 20 millimeter Dacron.
Okay.
We'll maintain blood flow to the spinal cord
by sewing his intercostal arteries into the graft.
BABCOCK: B.P.'s down to 60.
Okay, the clamp's on.
Dr. Babcock, I need another hematocrit.
Eleven blade.
BABCOCK: Okay. Pressure's up to 80.
Better work quick.
I'm okay.
I'm okay.
Collateral flow should reduce the risk of paralysis.
Okay... cut.
3-0 Prolene.
Hey.
Boy, days like today
you look down at your watch
and suddenly your shift is over.
What are those?
Med school applications.
Oh, yeah?
Where are you applying to?
Why the two separate stacks?
Interviews. No interviews.
You have a special secret formula there?
GPA times competitive factor plus MCAT scores.
Over 25, you get an interview.
You don't read the letters of recommendation?
After the interview.
Poor kids.
I don't know if I would have made it in
if I had to interview with you.
How'd you get on the committee?
I'm busy, Carter.
Did you talk to Weaver?
Yep.
It was nothing.
It was... a slip.
Not even a slip.
You know, I threw them up.
Urine output 75 in the last hour.
Hemoglobin's 10.8.
Less then 100 cc's of chest tube output.
Is that good?
All good.
Just need to do a quick neuro check.
For what?
To check sensation.
Ow.
What's so funny?
Let me see you wiggle your toes.
That's excellent.
Lizzie, you called for me?
Yeah, over an hour ago.
Well, I'm here now.
What's so emergent?
Will you excuse me?
( sighs )
We had a little trouble with an aortic graft
and I wanted a second pair of hands.
Do I need to worry about another lawsuit?
Uh, no. No.
Things got hairy for a moment, but I pulled him through.
Well, that's your job, isn't it?
Yes, it is.
And I am now late for dinner.
Thank you, Elizabeth.
Thank you.
It's a good thing they didn't frisk me.
It's chocolate.
Go away.
There's a reason I didn't come to see you, Chase.
I thought about coming, but I didn't.
And I didn't because I was afraid.
And I was afraid because I didn't want to adm....
When I got stabbed last year at work
a friend of mine got killed
and I, um...
ended up addicted to painkillers
and it caught up to me.
And I started to, um, shoot morphine and Demerol and fentanyl
and whatever else I could get my hands on.
And I don't know what would have happened
if I hadn't gotten busted, but I did
and I went to rehab...
But I wasn't like any of those people.
I mean, I got into this because of an injury
because of circumstance
because of a near-death experience.
And they...
Anyway, it wasn't me.
I mean, it was me, but it wasn't...
Anyway, I did the program.
I pretended that I bought into it.
I did everything that I was supposed to do.
Except... believe that I had anything to do
with what had happened.
And then... I almost relapsed.
Or, I guess, I guess I did relapse.
Anyway, I didn't come to see you, Chase
because I didn't want to admit to the fact
that... I was just like you.
The fact-- the truth is...
there's not a day that goes by
that I don't think about getting high.
It's the first thing I think about
when I wake up in the morning
and it's the last thing I think about
when I go to bed at night.
And I think about it all day.
I'm a drug addict.
( groans )
Did you bring any french fries?
Yeah.
( chuckling )
( woman speaking Spanish )
Did the mom say anything about any relatives in Chicago?
No.
How about in Guatemala?
We didn't have time to ask.
All right, thanks.
Hey, um, what's going to happen to her?
Put her in a group home for now.
Will she be deported?
Not unless we know she's going back to family.
If we don't find anyone, she becomes a ward of the state
and then we look for a Spanish-speaking foster home.
You okay?
Yeah.
