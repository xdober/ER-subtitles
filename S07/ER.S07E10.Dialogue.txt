Previously on E.R.:
GREENE: A brain tumor.
It's a GBM.
The speech arrest you were experiencing
was probably the result of a focal seizure.
You'd lose all ability to comprehend
interact with the world around you.
I had a biopsy.
While the tumor's adjacent to Broca's
it hasn't invaded yet.
We'll do an awake craniotomy.
You'll be conscious and talking
while I map out Broca's and resect the tumor.
MAN: Don't you pull out, you dumb ass.
I asked you a question.
I just don't want to play anymore.
Oh, you think I like waking up at 5:30 in the morning
for the past ten years to drive you to a cold arena?
My toes are frozen
my ass is numb
and that damn coffee machine
gives me heartburn all freaking day.
Wake up, Dad.
I'm not going to make the NHL.
Not with that attitude.
Well, you want to end up working in a factory
like me and your Uncle Don?
No.
No, you're damn right, you don't.
If you want to go to college, you've got to get a scholarship.
I mean, you're a bright kid and all
but you're not going to get a scholarship
with those grades.
Well, maybe my grades would be better
if I wasn't playing hockey all the time.
Oh...
( music plays louder )
Dad!
( tires screeching )
It's okay, keep it.
Nice tip.
It's New Year's Eve.
He's got a long day ahead of him.
Sounds okay to me.
Drive around Manhattan
listen to the radio, talk to people.
No brain surgery.
Ha, ha, ha, very funny.
It's weird, you know
I've sent a couple thousand people to the O.R.
And? And I've never been myself.
Oh, you're a virgin?
I still have my appendix, my tonsils.
The only general anesthetic I've ever gotten
was in the dentist's chair.
Oh, it's no different, really.
Oh, sure, pull a tooth, have my skull sawed open--
it's pretty much the same thing.
I mean the anesthesia.
Except for that part where they wake me up.
At that point, you'll know things are going well.
Yeah, right.
( airplane flying overhead )
( horns honking )
Are you ready?
Let's do it.
( horn honking )
( saw blade whirring )
MALUCCI: Come on, we've got to get them out of there!
No, take my Dad.
Okay, but we've got to get
you out to get to him.
All right.
Blunt head trauma and an open tib-fib fracture.
Dad, you okay? Start a line.
Get a pressure dressing and splint him.
I think I'm hurt pretty bad.
Okay, easy...
( moans )
Paul?
That's good.
Paul!
Paul! You hear me!
How you doing, sir?
What's wrong with my son?
He's going to the hospital. What's your name?
Uh, Dan Harris.
Can you tell me what day it is?
December 31.
That's good.
Get a C-collar. I need another backboard!
Paul!
Pupils equal and reactive.
Okay, let's roll 'em!
Okay, let's roll 'em!
Did you pass out?
I don't know. Any more pain?
I think that airbag gave my chest a pretty good shot.
Give him another two of morphine.
CARTER: Didn't know you were doing a ride-along.
Residency requirement, been putting it off.
Always thought you would make a good paramedic.
MALUCCI ( chuckles ): That's funny.
Dan Harris, auto versus garbage truck
restrained passenger.
Air bags deployed.
I cleared his neck on the ride.
My son, Paul Harris?
Did they bring him here?
Yeah, I think so; we'll find out for you.
Are you taking any medications?
No. You got any
drug allergies?
No. Previous medical complaints?
Not really, no. I don't think so.
Any past surgeries?
Appendix when I was a kid. Where's Paul?
That's his son.
Weaver's got him in Two.
Who's Weaver?
End of the line, Mr. Harris, good luck.
You're leaving?
Yeah, got to save some more lives.
One, two, three.
Let's get a 12-lead
and cut these clothes off.
All right, C-spine, chest and pelvis
trauma panel and a UA.
B.P. 130/92, pulse 116.
My wife just bought those pants.
Have you ever been in
this hospital before?
No, I haven't been in a hospital since my son was born.
Give me 20cc's of one percent lido with bicarb.
Whoa, that's cold.
Who's your family doctor?
Ow! Ow!
Uh, uh...
Klizowski, uh, Morgan Family Clinic.
What are you doing?
Putting a tube in your chest
to re-inflate your lung.
I got a collapsed lung?
It happens with your type of injury.
You'll breathe easier and feel better once it's in.
Thoraseal's ready.
Is there anyone we can notify?
Uh, my wife, Debra.
All right, 28 French.
Do you have a number?
Uh, I can't remember.
I got it on speed dial.
She teaches at Our Lady of Perpetual Hope.
You got an extra foley kit in here?
A gram of ancef, 100 of gent.
Paul! Give me a large Kelly.
Paul!
Dad? Is that you?
Can you open that door?
I need to see him.
WEAVER: What are you doing?
This is the father.
I'm right here, son.
Irrigation saline
sterile 4 x 4s.
Oh! Dad?!
Yeah, they just stuck
a freaking tube in my chest.
CARTER: I'm in, hook me up to low suction.
I'm okay, though.
You know, your mom's
going to be really pissed off about her truck.
I'm going to tell her
you were driving, okay?
Hey, Cleo
I need some xeroform over here.
Paul?
Don't be scared, Paul.
I'm not.
Be strong, now.
Be strong.
He's going to be okay, right?
Looks like a tough kid.
Yeah, he is.
You finished?
Yeah, I just need you to sign this.
It's a Power of Attorney.
If something goes wrong...
If something goes wrong, what?
No heroic measures...
no ventilators, no feeding tubes
if there's no hope of meaningful recovery.
You're going to be fine, Mark.
Elizabeth, you're a surgeon, you know that...
That you're going to be fine.
You don't want the responsibility?
It's unnecessary.
I don't want to end up like that.
Now you're being dramatic.
So if I end up in a persistent vegetative state...
Fine.
Fine, give it to me.
What's in the thoraseal?
Minimal blood loss.
Oh, good, no hemothorax.
Mr. Harris? Yes.
I need you to sign this consent
for medical treatment for your son.
Where is he? Radiology.
What's he doing there?
We had to get some X-rays of his leg.
He'll probably need surgery.
Can't you just put a cast on it?
The bone penetrated the skin.
Oh...
But there's no joints involved, and it's mid-shaft
so it'll probably heal nicely.
Okay, Mr. Harris, I've got to take you for a head CT.
What's that?
Head CT, um, CAT scan.
It's a picture of your brain.
It's pretty standard after you hit your head
and lose consciousness.
Did you tell her yet?
Who? Weaver.
Oh, um, no. Not yet.
But it's part of my New Year's resolutions.
Uh-huh.
No, really, it is.
You okay?
Am I bleeding?
No.
Then I'm fine.
Did you call the furnace guy?
Yep, last week.
Is he coming over?
You don't want the pipes to freeze.
Larry let him in.
Who's Larry?
Larry Corbin, the neighbor.
In the blue house?
No, in the brown, actually.
Oh!
I'm sorry.
No, no, it's my fault.
Oh, damn.
You have to put on scrubs anyway.
Scrubs?
You were planning on coming in?
Uh, don't you think Burke might object?
You're probably right.
It's going to be pretty crowded in there.
Mark, do you want me to come in?
No, I'll be fine.
You go get cleaned up.
I can finish this.
I'll be right back.
Okay.
( inhales sharply )
I've never been so claustrophobic before.
Happens to a lot of people.
Is everything all right?
Looks good
but a radiologist has to review the films.
Can I sit up?
Sure.
Let me know if you get light-headed.
And we contacted the school.
They're trying to reach Debra.
Oh, God, I hope she doesn't get in a car accident
rushing over here.
Hey, can we see Paul before his operation?
That depends on when the orthopedic surgeon
can schedule the surgery.
Well, it's just his leg, right?
No, he had a head trauma.
Trauma, what do you mean, trauma?
Well, he hit his head, just like you did.
And he's stable now
but we observe head injuries very carefully.
He could be unstable?
I'm sure he'll be fine, Mr. Harris.
Oh, God, she's going to think it's my fault again.
What?
Our first son died of SIDS.
He'd be about 20 now.
I'm sorry.
Yeah, he was three weeks old.
I'd sent my wife out, you know, to get some rest, you know
for herself for a couple hours.
The baby had been up all night, and finally fell asleep.
I must have dozed off myself.
I didn't wake until I heard her scream.
She had come home to find Nathan had died in his crib.
Well, I mean, we didn't have the baby monitors and stuff
like you do nowadays.
I mean, she didn't blame me
but I know...
I know that she thought if she'd stayed home that night
he'd still be alive.
There was no way you could have known.
Stick out your tongue.
Show me your teeth.
Repeat after me
"Ready to rock and roll."
Ready to rock and roll.
And that we are.
So, you know the procedure, you've had your meds.
Anything on your mind?
That's why I'm here.
You won't see me in there, but I'll be talking to you.
Good luck.
We don't need it, but thank you, Mark.
( sighs ): Oh...
BOY: So, what are you here for?
I'm Leo.
I'm Mark.
What are you here for?
I got something growing on my heart.
I'm not sure how to say it right.
Myxoma?
No, but it sounds like that.
Teratoma?
How'd you know?
I'm a doctor.
Yeah, right.
Doctors get sick, too, you know.
I've got something growing on my brain.
What do they do for that?
Same as you.
Operate, take it out.
Does it hurt?
They told me it wouldn't hurt.
You'll be asleep the whole time.
And when you wake up
if you're sore, they'll give you medicine.
This sucks.
It'll be over before you know it.
Still sucks.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Is Trauma One still open, Randi?
Blast injury to the face coming in.
Some guy testing Roman candles
for a New Year's Eve party.
I have to park you here
until I find you a new room
but I'll be right back.
Oh, thanks.
* And surely
* You'll be your pint stowp
* And surely I'll be mine
* We'll take a cup o' kindness yet *
* For auld lang syne!
Happy New Year.
Okay, okay, Gordy, back to bed.
WEAVER: Hey, Randi!
Randi, get Blue Beacon on the phone.
They cannot deny authorization for retinal artery occlusion.
Excuse me.
I got a page for a surgical consult.
The guy in Curtain Two has a beeper up his rectum.
What? He has it on vibrate.
He can't figure out how he slipped it in there.
Ma'am... Never underestimate
the elasticity of the anal sphincter.
Excuse me, excuse me
you're the doctor who's taking care of my son
Paul Harris? The car accident?
Yes, is he, uh... is he all right?
They've arranged to have him sent up to the O.R.
Dr. Weaver, we need you, his sats are dropping.
To what?
Seventy-four.
He was getting sleepy on the table
but now we can't wake him.
Heart rate's down to 50. Paul!
You want atropine? Push a milligram.
Rapid induction, 20 of etomidate
100 of Sux, number eight ET tube.
Paul! Let's go.
B.P.'s 90/60.
Bag him on 100%. Paul!
Call for a vent. Give me crichoid pressure.
I'm in.
Bag him. Paul!
Get X-ray down here for a portable.
Cuff is up.
You hear me, be strong, Paul!
Don't quit!
Give me 800 tidal volume of 14 A.C.
Hey, Mr. Harris, feeling any better?
No.
No?
You had a collapsed lung?
Blood bank's low.
Weaver wants everybody to donate
before their shift's over.
I always do.
That's very generous of you.
That, and I get drunk for half as much
when I'm down a pint.
Take it easy.
Uh, yeah.
Good news, Mr. Harris, your CT looks normal.
I know, but this tube you stuck in my chest is killing me.
Yeah? Hey, Abby
give Mr. Harris another five of morphine.
Sure. We're going to admit you
and monitor you for a day or two
and then we'll take that tube out.
Okay, listen, did you find out anything at all?
His oxygen level was low for a while.
We're not sure why.
Is that your son?
Yes. What are his sats?
100% after intubation.
GCS is ten.
What does that mean?
It could be a bruise to the brain
but we won't know for sure
until after the scan.
Well, when is that?
Any minute now.
Mr. Harris?
Yes?
I'm Officer Darcy.
How are you doing?
Well, I've been better.
I have to write an accident report.
Can you tell me what happened?
Well, I...
I-I honestly don't remember.
One minute I'm driving in the car with my son
and then... next minute
the paramedics are just dragging me out.
The guy came out of nowhere.
You failed to stop for a red light.
I would never do that.
No, it wasn't my fault.
Several witnesses say it was.
Guess it's too late to change my mind now.
Would you?
No.
They took that kid in for a teratoma resection
while you were gone.
He was pretty freaked out.
I'm sure they'll be here soon.
Okay, time to go.
Okay, you need help?
Nope, I've got it.
You going to go see a movie?
I'll be right outside.
Hey, your hands are like ice.
Do you want a blanket?
Mark?
Mark, are you okay?
If I don't make it through this...
Shh. Don't talk like that.
If I don't make it
I left you the life insurance.
It'll pay for the house for you and the baby.
I'm sorry, Mark, I can't go through here.
I love you, Elizabeth.
I love you, too.
You're going to be okay
and I'll see you very, very soon.
Okay, Mr. Greene
I'm going to lower your head now.
Jesus
this is my last guy, you done?
Nah, I'm pulling a double.
Happy freaking New Year, huh?
Hey, Mark
you found the right place.
Is all this for me?
Yep.
Slide on over to the table for us.
Okay, Mark...
I'm Dr. Hammond, your anesthesiologist.
You'll be looking at me
and talking to me throughout the surgery, okay?
Okay.
All right, just rest your arm.
For the burr hole
I'll need a Midas Rex with an M-eight bit.
Then I'll switch to a V-one for the bone flap.
Excuse me, Dr. Burke?
Let's contour the lesion on the stealth system.
Uh, you said you'd give me a little something
to take the edge off.
Excuse me, Dr. Burke?
DAN: So, what, it's a coma?
It's not what you think of as a coma.
He's having what we call purposeful movements.
And the CAT scan shows there's no sign
of hemorrhage or skull fractures.
You know, he's unconscious
but if you'd like to talk to him
I'm pretty sure he'll be able to hear you.
Hey, son...
It's time to wake up now.
You ready to go home?
Well, you've got to open your eyes.
Every day I used to do this
to get him up for school.
Sometimes he'd fake it...
until I tickled him.
Son...
be strong, now.
HAMMOND: Mark?
Mark? Hey, Mark?
Hey, Mark?
Mark?
Breathe for me.
( coughs )
How you doing, there?
Tell me your name.
M-Mark...
Mark what?
Mark Greene.
Hi, Mark, I'm Dr. Malcolm from Neurology.
How many fingers?
Can't see.
CORDAY: He needs his glasses.
Elizabeth?
Elizabeth?
Fingers first, Mark.
How many?
Three.
Good.
Elizabeth?
I thought you might like some company.
Nice hat.
( chuckles )
Thanks.
All right, Mark
I'll be doing the language testing
while Dr. Burke maps the brain.
I have an itch.
Where?
Behind my knee.
May I?
Sure.
CORDAY: Left or right?
Left.
Okay, Mark
name the months of the year.
January, February...
March, April...
...ahhh...
...that's it, a little lower...
...uh, May, June, July...
Mr. Harris?
Mr. Harris, your wife is here.
Dan.
Debra.
What happened?
We got hit by a garbage truck.
MALIK: O.R.'s ready.
No, you said he'd wake up on his own.
Yeah, the surgery is for his leg.
We'll take him up to the O.R. in a minute.
He looks so big just lying here, doesn't he?
Remember, I used to hold him in my hand and rock him to sleep?
Yeah.
You used to think I was going to drop him.
Remember that? Yeah.
Hey, Paul...
Debra, I ran a red.
We were arguing about him quitting hockey
and the music was really loud like it always is
and I don't know
I must have missed the light change.
Honey, it was an accident.
Debra, I-I'm sorry...
( groans )
Mr. Harris
you all right?
I think this tube is hurting my chest again.
Okay, maybe we should get you back to bed.
No, I want to stay here with my son.
Malik.
I think you'll feel more comfortable if you're lying down.
No, no, I want to stay here, damm it... Debra...
How's your breathing?
Are you having any chest pain?
A little. He needs a 12 lead!
No, I want to stay with my son!
Turn him up to ten liters, let's get a B.P.
Debra, I'm sorry, honey!
Give him a nitro spray
if his systolic is over 100.
GREENE ( weakly): Trumpet...
Hammer...
Dolphin...
Guitar...
Tent...
Pachyderm...
Another name for this one?
El-e-phant.
It's Dr. Burke, Mark.
You're doing great.
We're mapping out Broca's just fine.
Glad to hear it.
Four milliamps, please.
Catapault...
Thermometer...
( slurring his words): Bull-dozer...
Hesitation on that one.
Got it.
Window...
Hesitation again.
Try to read the card, Mark.
How you doing there, Mark?
Mark?
My... th-th-thumb...
He's diaphoretic.
I don't... good.
Elizaba...
HAMMOND: He's seizing.
Oh, my God.
BURKE: Cool saline, please.
Sats are 92.
What's happening?
The electronic stimulation
induced a seizure.
Dousing the brain with saline should cool it down
and stop it.
Mark, you said...
Mark!
...now 9:00!
Give him some Ativan.
We can't sedate him, or he won't be able to talk.
We cancel the surgery.
Try a little Propofol.
What else can you do?
Give it a minute.
More irrigation, please.
GREENE: ...were too severe.
Mark? Mark!
I think he's stopping.
He's post-ictal. What now?
I can't resect the tumor until he's awake and alert.
Mark! Mark, it's Elizabeth.
Wake up!
WOMAN: Mark, come on home!
Mark, we need you to talk to us.
Mark!
( coughing )
That's a good gag with the scope.
He might be lightening up.
Mark?
Come on, Mark.
Come on, buddy, try and wake up.
Mark!
Ah, no response to painful stimuli.
His eyes are open, but he's out of it.
BURKE: How long since the seizure?
Half an hour.
No significant change in GCS.
Well, maybe we should just close up
and come back in a few days.
In a few days?
You've just opened his skull.
GREENE: Hey.
What's... what's going on out there?
You had a seizure during mapping, Mark.
We had to wait.
I'm okay.
Keep going.
You heard the man.
Dr. Malcolm?
Okay, Mark.
Name things that start with the letter "B."
Baseball...
broccoli...
Brazil...
bamboo...
Burke...
brain...
Broca's...
You okay?
Fine.
How are you feeling?
Okay.
I'm sleepy.
Excuse me.
Uh, come on, now, Mark.
Things that begin with "B."
Uh... baby...
boy...
So you think we're going to have a boy, do you?
Just a hunch.
We could find out, if you like.
Let's... let's wait, see.
Well, then, we have to argue about boy and girl names.
What about... Jesus?
Jesus?
That's Jesus-- Jesus Greene.
I'm sorry, Mark, but I need you to work with me here.
More B's.
Okay.
Bobby...
Bill...
Bradley...
Bubba...
CARTER: Any more pain, Mr. Harris?
Not since you put that stuff under my tongue.
MVA with pneumothorax.
He had some chest pain
but responded very nicely to the nitro.
I'm going off duty.
Dr. Kovac, here
is going to continue to manage your care.
He flipped his T-waves in the anterior leads
waiting for a tele-bed.
Is that bad?
You could be at risk
for a heart attack.
We need to admit you for observation.
Did they start his surgery?
My son.
You know, they took him to the operating room
to-to operate on his leg, but nobody's told me
how he's doing.
Dr. Kovac can find that out for you.
Good luck, Mr. Harris.
Happy New Year.
Were you having chest pain before your collision?
No. I don't remember anything.
Did you pass out?
What do you mean?
With angina, you can get an irregular heartbeat.
And that can cause you to pass out?
Yeah, because your heart doesn't pump enough blood
to your brain.
Well, could that have caused my accident?
It happens a lot.
( groans )
So, it wasn't my fault?
What?
The accident.
Probably not.
( groaning ): Oh, I got to talk to my wife.
Does your chest hurt?
Oh, like a son-of-a-bitch.
Malik, I need some help here!
Pressure's down to 80 systolic.
S.T. elevation on the monitor.
We've got to mix up the dopamine.
He's having an M.I.
What's an M.I.?
A heart attack.
Oh, Jesus!
Go to the cath lab now.
What are you going to do there?
You've got a blocked artery on your heart.
We need to open it up.
Well, first I got to talk to my wife. Wait, wait!
Dr. Burke?
He's awake.
Hey, Mark.
You know where you are?
Hospital.
That's right. You're in recovery.
What's the date?
New Year's Eve.
And who's that?
I've never seen her before in my life.
( chuckles )
She's pretty darn cute.
Hold out your hands.
Wiggle your fingers.
Now wiggle your toes.
Very good.
How did it go?
Fantastic.
Resected the tumor with clean margins.
Chemotherapy wafers are in.
You see, you made it.
I told you.
Now get some rest, both of you.
I'll be back in an hour for a neuro check.
Do you remember anything?
Something about the baby.
We discussed a boy's name.
We're having a boy?
DAN: God, it feels like someone
parked a Volvo on my chest.
KAYSON: He's still throwing PVC's.
KOVAC: Could be his chest tube.
I'll try to reposition.
I need to talk to my wife.
I'll explain what happened.
Just relax.
Oh, God.
Me and my son had to be arguing when this happened.
How old is he?
Fifteen.
Part of being that age.
He needs your support the most when he wants it the least.
You a dad?
No.
Mrs. Harris would like to come in.
For a minute.
You look like a nurse.
Paul's awake.
Is he okay?
Yeah.
They took the tube out and he's breathing on his own
and, well, he's asking for a cheeseburger.
Oh, God.
Thank you.
Hey, honey.
What happenend?
I got a blocked artery
on my heart.
I guess those sliders finally caught up with me.
Yeah.
Well, the docs figure that the blockage
made me pass out this morning.
That's what caused the accident.
Oh, God... I-I'm really sorry about downstairs.
I just... he was lying there...
And you thought I did it again.
Dan, stop.
Okay, I think it's time for visiting hours to end.
Lily.
Mrs. Harris.
Tell Paul I'll see him in a bit.
You better.
I'm going on break, Dr. Corday.
Can I bring you back a frozen yogurt or something?
No, thanks, I'm fine, Terry.
I have to go now, I'm late.
Hey.
It's good to see you still have your sense of humor.
I suppose that's a good sign.
Mark? Mark!
I left the oven on.
TERRY: He's off the monitor.
I know, I know.
He's altered.
Now, where are my car keys?
Can you give him some valium?
I don't have an order for that.
Lie back down, Dr. Greene.
No, no
the lasagna, it's going to burn.
Look, he needs sedation and a stat head CT.
No, I need to leave right now.
I can't take your orders, Doctor.
You're not on the medical staff.
He could have an epidural bleed.
Get Dr. Burke.
He's called to an emergency consult.
What do you think this is?
What's going on?
Trauma patient had a coronary thrombosis.
Yeah? Why wasn't I consulted?
Cardiology is handling it.
Yeah, I can see that.
What about our Glycoprotein 2B3A Inhibitor study?
He didn't meet the criteria.
( sarcastic chuckle )
I decide who meets the criteria.
What? You mean I didn't have to have this?
If you'd been on a low-fat diet
you wouldn't have to have any of this.
Damn it! What's wrong?
There's a dissection in the left vein.
Nice work, Jack.
Wh-what's wrong? What's happening?
The catheter made a small tear in your blood vessel.
What?!
He's dropping his pressure.
Multifocal P.V.C.s.
Hundred of lidocaine.
Looks like he's a surgical patient now.
Up the dopamine to 20 mics.
Notify the O.R.
Wh-wh-what's wrong?
You've had a complication.
The only way to save your heart now
is with bypass surgery.
Open heart surgery?!
Yup. When?
Right now.
Wait, can't we talk about this?
( coughs softly )
Hey, Mark.
You had us a little worried.
No sign of post-op bleeding.
But the steroids made you a little crazy.
What did I say?
I've heard much worse.
Look, I'll check on you in a little bit.
Call me if you need me, okay?
Mark
I'll be right back
all right?
Dr. Burke?
( weakly ): Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Pressure's down to 70.
Dr. Karis?
Put him in Trendelenburg.
Squeeze in two units.
Get me a staple remover.
CLAIRE: A liter out of the chest.
Get him off the vent.
Bag him at 100%.
Tell the blood bank we need another six.
KARIS: Splash him with betadine.
Open a thoracotomy tray.
Wire cutters.
TERRY: He's tachy at 130.
KARIS: Ready for rib spreaders.
He's ruptured his aeortic trunk.
Side biting clamp.
I'll see you in Recovery.
You're not coming with me?
You're with the surgical team now.
Say good-bye to Dr. Kovac.
Good luck.
( gasping )
I don't want surgery.
Well, you don't really have a choice.
What about a second opinion?
You could get that, but you'd be dead before another doctor
could examine you.
Let's move, people! We got no time!
I want to be cutting in five minutes!
Nurse: Okay, we're going to scoot you over now.
Ready, and...
lift.
( grunts )
Mr. Harris, I'm Dr. Babcock
the anesthesiologist.
Are you allergic to any drugs?
Uh, no.
Are you taking any medications?
Just the stuff they gave me today.
What's he on, Shirley?
Dopamine, lidocaine, and nitro.
BABCOCK: You ever have a bad reaction to an anesthetic?
Mr. Harris?
No!
ROMANO: Why the hell isn't this guy under?
BABCOCK: I had to throw in an art line.
Gown me.
You're the guy in the emergency room.
ROMANO: Dr. Benton does it all.
You were in a collision.
You came in with your son.
Yeah.
Mr. Harris, you're going to go to sleep now.
Wait, wait, wait. I got a bad feeling about this.
The pump primed and ready to go? All set.
I'm not going to make it. I know it.
You'll make it. You've got to tell my son something for me.
You can tell him yourself after the operation.
Not if we don't get in there soon.
No, please tell him that I love him
and that I'm very proud of him...
BENTON: All right, let's tube him.
Okay, let's go!
The clock's ticking. His heart isn't.
BURKE: Okay, Mark, follow my finger with your eyes.
CORDAY: Mark, follow his finger.
Sorry.
TERRY: Mrs. Street, why don't we go up to the surgical waiting room?
They'll call you with the updates.
MRS. STREET: Okay.
Now, what were the three things I asked you to remember?
Huh?
The three items? You remember?
Uh... Giraffe, beach ball, 123 Main Street.
Three for three.
Do you know what happened to him?
Who?
The heart kid.
Uh, they got him to the O.R.
It's touch and go.
I want to have somebody from psychiatry
come down and talk to you.
No, thanks.
I recommend it to all my patients.
Depression suppresses the immune system.
It can hinder recovery.
Don't need a therapist.
I could get this Foley out.
If you have urinary retention...
The nurse could throw another one in.
Mark...
The sooner I get it out
the sooner I can walk.
The sooner I can walk, the sooner I get out of here.
No offense.
Okay, we'll take out the Foley.
Bathroom privileges?
Only if somebody walks you.
You're a lucky guy, Mark.
There has never been
a more successful treatment for your tumor.
If you believe that
and mobilize your inner resources
you're going to survive.
Time of death, 20:48.
He didn't make it.
No.
But I did.
Yeah.
You fixed my heart.
Yep.
I didn't even know I had a heart problem.
That car accident saved my life.
PAUL: You never heard of a yearly checkup?
Hey, son.
You okay?
Yeah, I feel like I got hit by a truck... again.
Did you sleep well?
Yeah, except when you were yapping in my ear
asking me to wake up.
I notice you didn't listen.
I was in a coma.
You know, you always got an excuse.
Hey, son, I guess this means, uh...
you're not going to play hockey
any more this year, huh?
They said the cast will be off in six to eight weeks.
Come on, your leg's broken. It's weak.
Let it heal.
Well, I mean, I'll be doing physiotherapy.
Maybe we can start running together
or something.
Are you trying to give me another heart attack?
You gave me a scare, Dad.
You, too.
REPORTER ( on TV ): Just under a minute here, Dick
and Times Square is raring to go.
Some rockin' New Year's Eve, huh?
It'll do.
( groans )
When are they going to come take this damn Foley out?
It's been over three hours since he put in the order.
Well, I think she's busy with another patient.
I can't wait any longer.
I got to pee.
Then go.
Mark...
You know how to do it.
I can't believe you're doing this.
( relieved groaning )
I don't think I can order those for a patient ever again.
( chuckles )
Are you sure you're up to this?
Nature calls.
Easy.
I got it.
You're not supposed to do this on your own, you know.
( groans )
Once I get in there
can I stand on my own?
No. You can sit.
( chuckles )
Okay. Let me try.
All right.
Ooh...
See?
It's not a race. Just be careful.
Okay. Small steps.
Mm-hmm.
I know. Small steps.
That's it. See? You're doing it.
That's it. See? You're doing it.
