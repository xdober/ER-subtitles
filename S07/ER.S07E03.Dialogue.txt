Previously on ER:
I'm a drunk.
How long have you been sober?
Almost five years.
So you could sponsor somebody.
I'm pregnant.
Why did you wait so long to tell me?
( crying ): I don't know.
We got a call you were trying to bounce him.
From whom? Anonymous.
Dr. Romano, I thought...
Not a word, Peter, not a... single word.
I was hoping you'd give me
the joy and honor of being your husband.
All right, we'll put you on the schedule for next week.
Start out very light.
No trauma.
Whatever you say.
( Kovac speaking in Croatian )
Clear!
Still in V-fib.
Been down 28 minutes.
Hey, Carter!
Hey, Dave.
Hey, man, good to see you.
It's good to see you too?
Yeah, you miss me?
What happened to your hair?
The chief's training me on the sternal saw today.
Hope we get a G.S.W. that needs his chest cracked.
I'll keep my fingers crossed for you.
Carter. Cleo, How are you?
Busy.
( Marquez speaking in Spanish )
Woman: Necessito agua!
That's disgusting!
Hi, Carter. Hi, Chuny.
I'm glad you're back.
She drinks anything she can get her hands on.
Probably secondary polydipsia.
You want to check her lytes
and then call for a psych consult.
Hey, Carter!
Hey, Lily, how are you?
Chuny, Weaver needs somebody to make a blood run.
Weaver needs to get a couple more nurses down here.
Can you tell we're short nurses?
Uh-huh.
( woman speaking in Chinese )
Congratulations.
John, welcome back.
Hey, Carter!
I've got a live one waiting in Exam Three.
Freak tore off all her toenails with a pair of pliers.
What about me?! I need medical attention!
The only thing you need, Moony, is a bath.
I'll be there in a minute, Lydia.
Hey... Hey, you. Where do you think you're going?
Oh, I, uh, I work here.
No, that's an old I.D.
Well, I've been away.
Dr. Weaver, does this one belong to you?
Yes, he does.
You'll need to get a new I.D. from personnel.
You can get it after your shift.
Sorry, Doc.
Why not Christmas?
Next Christmas?
No, this Christmas.
Are you mad? It takes months to plan a wedding.
Hey, Carter.
Carter.
We bought a house. We got engaged.
Wow. Congratulations, on both accounts.
Boy, I go away for a couple weeks
you guys get engaged, Chen's pregnant, Malucci's blonde,
Admin looks totally different
and I can't seem to remember
my locker combination.
Oh, you know, the State Medical Board made us
clean it out. I'm sorry.
Where's my stuff?
Listen, I'll look into getting your locker back
but you can use mine until then.
Uh, look, I'd better run.
Listen, there's a surgical conference today.
We're terribly short-staffed.
Please don't let your residents call
for any unnecessary consults.
Thank you. Good luck, Carter.
We'll talk dates later.
You ready to rock and roll?
Yeah, I guess so.
Listen, if you need anything-- uh, talk about a case
or a patient or anything, just come find me.
I'll do that.
I will.
Hey, you got anything good?
I've got a chest pain in Two hooked up...
I think Dr. Greene is free, thanks, Lily.
Sorry, Carter, but in order to facilitate
your return, we need to implement a few rules.
Uh-huh. Such as?
You're to do only minor medical, no trauma.
No suturing, no needles, no narcotics
and absolutely no surgical procedures.
That leaves me with...?
The chance to practice medicine again.
Man: Let me up!
Settle down, Mr. Dibattista!
Hold still or you could wind up paralyzed!
I'm not staying!
Get my some four-by-fours!
I know this guy!
Stabilize his leg!
I'm fine, fine... Leave me alone, bitch!
All right, that's it.
Once you get back in the swing of things
you can resume a normal schedule
and do procedures again
but until then, it's baby stuff.
So why don't you start with Mr. Griffis.
Gluteal rash.
Nothing worse than a chapped ass, or so I'm told.
Dr. Carter, when did you get out?
A couple of weeks ago.
Well, I've got a patient.
Go forth and heal.
So who's watching the Drugstore Cowboy?
I'm head of the E.R., that makes Carter my responsibility.
Correct me if I'm wrong, Kerry
but didn't he develop his drug addiction under your watchful eye?
Is there something that you need, Robert?
Do I need to have a reason to come down and say hello?
But now that I'm down here
perhaps you can tell me what genius replaced
all the candy bars in the vending machines
with raisins and rice cakes?
You're here because you need a sugar fix?
We're a hospital.
We're setting a good example by offering healthy snacks.
What are you, the Nutrition Nazi?
America's poor eating habits help keep us in business.
Did you even take the Hippocratic Oath?
I had my fingers crossed.
Oh, Dr. Romano...
Dr. Chen, well...
I guess I don't have to ask what you've been up to.
Look, um, I-I need a favor.
Well, if it's about taking time off, talk to Weaver.
Maternity leave is a topic for those bearing ovaries.
No, it's about my parents.
I figured you'd run into them today
at the surgical conference.
I'll say hello.
Well, actually, um, I haven't told them
that I'm pregnant yet
and I'd really appreciate your not saying anything.
I-I want to surprise them.
How, by going into labor at Sunday dinner?
"Mom's" the word.
Just a little longer, Mr. Griffis.
How long is this going to take?
Hey, Abby, what are you doing down here?
I'm looking for Weaver.
She seems to be under the impression
I'm her own personal temp.
Is somebody gonna dig She's next door.
this wood out of my butt before it sprouts roots?
Would you mind, before you go, removing some splinters?
Can't you do it?
Weaver won't let me use any instruments.
Oh, okay. Sure, just a minute.
Greene: We need an ortho surgeon
down here for a closed reduction.
I've been paging them every five minutes for half an hour.
Call the attending, tell them you're Kerry Weaver
that usually will scare somebody right down.
Excuse me, Dr. Greene.
I've got a nine-year-old boy who got hit in the larynx
with his skateboard; he's pretty hoarse.
Any subq emphysema?
No, everything's okay.
He's no stridor, good sats
and he's handling his secretions.
Yeah, but he woke up this morning with...
Greene: Did you visualize cords?
Well, our scope is being serviced.
I paged Head and Neck to bring one down
but I've been waiting three hours.
Yes! It's moved to the lower-right quadrant.
We're going to have to scope him.
I'll call the attending.
Well, I tried, but they're either in surgery
or at some damn conference.
He's too sick for a jump test!
Okay, hold on one second.
Dave, you have a problem?
Stewart, here, has had two days of vomiting and diarrhea, right?
Corday says it's not a good story for an appy.
Maybe, maybe not, but now he's got classic signs
including guarding and rebound tenderness.
Did you tell her that?
Yeah, yeah, but she won't come down.
She wants me to make this poor guy
get up and jump around!
Thanks, Elizabeth.
Follow me.
Where we going?
Where we going?
Dr. Weaver, did you page me?
Yes, Abby. Hi. I need those in Exam Four.
Why am I here?
We're short on nurses.
I am an O.B. nurse.
Are you planning on going back to med school?
Yes.
Then you might as well work as a nurse in the E.R.
You'll see more medicine down here than upstairs.
Right, but... Okay, look.
I'm offering you a learning opportunity
that will put you way ahead
when you come back as a student.
Which should only take me about two more years.
It's really not so bad down here, Abby.
Oh, yeah, compared to what?
( whistling )
Excuse me!
I'm having trouble with my card key.
What's the name?
Dr. Peter Benton.
You're not on the list.
Oh... I just became a surgical attending.
You're going to have to park on the street.
You know, I'll just park in visitor.
No, you won't.
Employees can't park in visitor spaces.
Well, if I'm an employee, then you have to let me in.
I can't. You're not on the list.
Uh...
You've got a corneal abrasion.
You mean, pinkeye?
No, you've got a scratch on your eyeball.
Probably some dirt got trapped under the eyelid there.
How on earth would that happen?
I don't know.
Maybe, uh, the wind blew it in.
Well, last time I was in here
they said I had pinkeye...
( gasps ): Ooh! And crabs.
I think I might have them again.
Okay. Well, why don't we treat one thing at a time.
( coughs )
I'm going to go get some antibiotics
put them in your eye so it doesn't get infected.
Will it stop the hurting?
We'll get you something for the pain.
Am I going to get a patch?
I'll see what I can do.
Hello.
Elizabeth, have you gone downstairs
to see that ruptured appy yet?
Rupture? I thought it was a rule out.
Well, that was ten minutes ago.
I'm sure it's ruptured by now.
I told you, there's a surgical conference at Rush today
and we're jammed.
If Dr. Malucci fails to give me a good enough story...
Hey, I gave you a great story for an appy.
When we call for a consult, we need you to do just that.
Well, thank you for the clarification.
What's this?
It's just some things that we need downstairs.
Well, these "things" belong to the O.R.
Well, the surgeons can bring them back
once they've come down to the E.R. to use them.
Hello. I'm Dr. Chen.
So, Willie, it says here
that you're having earaches?
Yeah.
Could you, uh, take off your hat
so I can have a look?
( sighs )
Oh, gee, what happened?
I couldn't stop the bleeding.
Huh. Who did this to you?
I did.
With what?
Kitchen shears.
On purpose?
Didn't it hurt?
What do you think?
I tried to numb them with ice
but they're still pretty sore.
Yeah, I bet.
Now, why would you give yourself Doberman ears?
They're Vulcan.
Is that like a Shih Tzu?
No, I think he means like Mr. Spock
on Star Trek?
Oh. Oh, right, right.
Okay, um, we'll irrigate the wounds
wrap them in saline gauze,
um, give him a D.T.
and in a gram of Ancef.
Okay, psych consult?
Yes, and I'll call plastics.
Psych, wait a second.
But I'm not-I'm not crazy.
You mutilated yourself with kitchen shears.
Well, how long is it going to take?
because the sci-fi convention's today
I'm already running pretty late.
We're moving at warp speed, here, Willie.
Hey, I've got a present for you.
What?
One fiber-optic laryngoscope.
Compliments of the O.R.
Where did you get this?
You're better off not knowing.
So, you pick out a name for the little bambino yet?
No.
No, no...
Let me get that.
You planning on something Chinese
or a little bit more Western?
You know, I haven't really given it much thought.
Hey, you got a minute?
Oh, yeah, sure.
I've got a corneal abrasion that needs some Vicodin
and I'm not allowed to write for narcotics.
Yeah, I'll take it.
There's an otitis in Exam Two you can have.
He presented as pinkeye, but all he needs is the meds.
Okay. And wear this mask
because he's pretty rank, and he's got crabs.
Are you going soft on me, Carter?
It looks like I missed a few things
when I was away, huh?
Yeah.
So how far along are you?
24 weeks.
Was this planned or...?
No, not particularly.
You know, I've got to run.
Albert, sit still so the doctor can look at your hand.
It hurts.
We'll give you some medicine to make it better
but you have to let us clean out the germs first.
Abby, irrigate the wound and start him on augment.
And, Gloria, this looks like a human bite.
Mm. His Uncle Charlie bit him.
Did you call Social Services?
That's Uncle Charlie.
Albert's my grandson.
Charlie's mine.
Oh, you're baby-sitting?
24-7 for the past two years, if you call that baby-sitting.
Gloria's daughter got involved
with someone with a drug problem.
( coughing ): She got pregnant; I got Albert.
How long have you had that cough, Gloria?
A couple months. It comes and goes.
Do you smoke?
Yeah, but I go outside.
I don't light up around the kids.
Okay, I'd like to get a chest X ray.
No, I'm fine. I just need you to look at Albert's hand.
It'll only take a few minutes, as long as you're here.
What about Albert and Charlie?
I can take them to daycare.
You don't have to do that.
It's not a problem.
Come on, let's go to the playroom.
Okay, I'll get a P.A. and a lateral chest on Gloria.
Okay.
Thanks.
Ow!
Grandma, Grandma! Uncle Charlie bit the nurse!
Benton: Has everything gone crazy down here?
I can't even log onto the damn system.
You forget your password? Dr. Romano! Here.
Peter, you're still here.
I had problems parking, and now I can't get onto the computer.
You didn't get my letter? What letter?
The letter stating that your privileges had been revoked?
What?
You remember that dialysis patient of yours?
Well, your tattletaling to the Inspector General cost me a $50,000 fine
which my malpractice insurance does not cover.
I was just looking out for my patient.
You also cost the hospital a substantial IMTALA fine.
Now I had to recoup those monies
from somewhere, so I was forced to eliminate
the attending position.
It's all in the letter.
Hold on. We can't talk about this in private?
Why, Peter? You didn't seem to feel the need
to talk in private about our problem.
You just decided to go off on your own, so now you are.
So what is my position here?
You have no position here, Peter.
You're firing me?
No, no-no-no.
You fired yourself.
Hey, Cleo.
out of little boys' ears?
Keep him still.
I'll get to him in a minute.
Ah...
Woman: I brought her to the doctor's
with a sore throat.
That was three weeks ago.
She's still not getting any better.
Ah... Where are we?
I see tonsillar exudate.
What's that? Excuse me.
It's, uh, pus.
Gross.
Finch: Yeah, looks like strep.
Did you take all the medication
the doctor prescribed last time, Moira?
Yes. She can't miss any more school.
I'm going to order a couple of tests
to rule out other infections. Abby?
Rapid strep, mono spot, gram stain and culture?
That'll do it.
Thanks.
Yep.
Abby, can you find a room
for Mr. Duncan here?
Uh, sure.
Excuse me.
I need you to suture a head lac, Abby.
I-I can't do that now, I'm a nurse.
Oh, I forgot.
Oh, can you clean up for me, though?
Sure, in a minute.
( vomiting )
Abby, just the person I wanted to see.
Ooh, bear's head.
I've got 30-year-old businessmen
with food poisoning.
Shoot him up with 10 of Compazine
and plug them into IVs.
And you might want to call housekeeping
for some buckets.
Buckets?
It was an all-you-can-eat buffet.
Anybody else need anything?
Bring it on!
If I'm being arrested, I get a phone call.
You'll get it.
There's a phone upstairs.
Why are you letting them move him?
The man's wanted for murder.
Lucky I recognized him.
Once a cop, always...
This is a hospital, not a police department.
Yeah, they can observe him in the jail ward.
If people don't feel safe here
they'll stop coming in
when they need medical attention.
Frank: Only the criminals.
I'm not talking to you.
Thanks. I think we're done here, Frank.
I was still observing him.
Freaking liberal foreigners!
It's my decision to transfer or not.
Yeah, he's a threat to the patients and the staff
he needs to be in custody
and that is my decision.
Hey, it's not so bad down here.
Carter: I'm going to give you some antibiotics
but the next time that you want
to pierce your nipples Mr. Hargins
I suggest you go to a professional, okay?
You almost finished? I need the bed.
Yeah.
Uh, hey, how's it going?
Oh, great.
Actually, it sucks.
I'm not allowed to do anything.
Oh, well...
Easy does it.
( chuckles )
You might want to give yourself
a little bit of time.
Time and scut. I got plenty of both.
It could be worse.
How's that?
Did you have to pluck maggots
out of anybody's crotch tonight?
Ooh, I had a guy with crabs.
Ah, that's not even close.
Anything interesting on the big board?
A UTI in Exam Two.
I was hoping for something
a little bit more challenging than a bladder infection.
There are no small patients, Carter.
What about dwarves?
So Carter, you've known Jing-Mei for a while, huh?
I knew her before she was Jing-Mei.
So do you know who got her pregnant?
Even if I did know that, Dave
I don't know if I'd tell you.
That's not a definitive no.
You two haven't been...?
( clicks tongue )
Huh? Huh?
Yeah. Uh-huh...
Sometimes this medicine can give you muscle spasms.
But don't worry, that's easily reversed with Benadryl.
And I'm sure you'll all feel much better
after you're rehydrated, okay?
Abby, you need a hand in here?
No. Everything's under control.
How did you become paralyzed?
I was... I was hit by a car, um, on my bike
and I would've been killed if I wasn't wearing a helmet.
You were lucky, huh?
You know, I didn't used to think so
but, you know, I come to the hospital
and I see kids way worse off than me.
It says in your chart that you think
you might have a urinary tract infection.
Does it burn when you pee?
I don't know.
I don't feel much... I don't feel much below my waist
but I can feel pressure in my stomach
you know, when I need to go
and, um, that's when I know
to catheterize myself.
And how often do you do that?
About every six to eight hours.
But lately, I've-I've been having to do it more
which is usually a sign I have an infection.
You put in your own catheters?
My grandmother used to help, you know.
She passed away in-in February.
Who takes care of you now?
I live in a retirement home
Um, you know, it used to be me and my grandmother
and, you know, now it's just me.
I know that sounds pretty lame
but it's right across the street from my school
and some of the old folks don't get a lot of visits
from their families, so they like having me around.
It's kind of like having 20 grandparents, huh?
Y-yeah, it is.
Okay, you might need some antibiotics
and I'm going to have a nurse come in
and get a urine sample.
Um, that's okay, I can... I can do it myself.
I'm used to doing stuff like that myself.
I'm going to have a nurse come in and help.
Okay?
Chen: I seem to be a magnet
for the weird ones today.
Why? What's up with this guy?
( both yell )
Where did this water come from?
Mr. Kamatovic
what did I tell you?
I found him soaking his blanket in the sink.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to make a mess.
Mr. Kamatovic, why is your blanket wet?
I was afraid I was going to burn.
I have a family history of spontaneous human combustion.
Really?
Yeah. I-I-I got to stay wet
or I'm going to go up like a Roman candle.
Oh, get that oxygen away from me
unless you want this whole place to explode!
Mr. Kamatovic
please just sit and relax.
I-I'll turn off the oxygen
in the hall, okay?
Dr. Chen, let's get Mr. Kamatovic started
on a flame-retardant saline
and get somebody down here
from the special burn unit, please.
Yes, okay.
Don't worry, Mr. Kamatovic.
We've got you covered, okay?
Hey, Chief!
( yells )
( groans )
Malucci, you okay?
Yeah, yeah, there's-there's a multi-trauma coming in
A causeway collapsed at a sci-fi convention.
I'm good.
Spin a crit, dip a urine, lateral c-spine
chest and pelvis.
I'll be right there.
You okay, Cleo?
So far, so good.
There were so many, we had to double up.
First one's a forearm fracture from falling concrete.
Open or closed? Closed.
The neuroshank is intact.
Got a ten centimeter scalp lac, no LOC.
Olbs got a bad one in 43s.
What's this?
with midline tenderness.
BP 125/78, pulse 90.
You got it?
Yeah.
Where do you need me?
Triage the most critical patients
to the monitored beds.
You got it.
23-year old man, crushed pelvis.
Fell at least 20 feet.
Danny, Danny, where is he?
Who's Danny?
He's my brother.
He was standing next to me.
I think Morales got him.
He didn't want to go today. I made him.
Danny...
Looks like a bad tib fib.
Please, don't let him die.
Let's take care of you first, sir.
What's your name?
( groans )
Sir?
Sir, open your eyes.
Losing the pulse.
Okay, let's go.
Blunt chest trauma, tachy at 120.
Decreased breath sounds on the left. Abby?
I said we could handle one major.
They've got 30 critical patients on scene, Kerry.
I told them we could take three major and ten minor.
Yeah, how can we handle critical patients
if we don't have any surgeons?
We can stabilize and triage them to surgery one at a time.
I hope that we can, Mark.
Frank, page the surgeons.
They're all at the conference.
Page them!
Hey, can I help? Greene: No!
Looks like you're getting slammed.
Yeah, all the more reason
for you to take the minor medicals, no trauma.
Dr. Weaver, we need you in Trauma One.
Let's take him to Curtain Area Two.
Give me the greatest hits, Morales.
32-year old male, walkway fell.
This guy crushed his right foot under a girder.
What's wrong?
Open fracture.
There's active bleeding through the perineum.
Marquez: Pressure's down to 60.
I'll put in a central line.
Corday: How's the other patient?
Looks like they're putting in a chest tube.
You should go check on him.
I can't leave this patient.
Where's Peter?
Didn't Romano fire him? What?!
No. I saw him earlier.
Try paging him.
Go on, I can handle this.
Kerry, he needs a MAST suit inflated
a suprapubic Foley
and either a pelvic embolization
or application of the external fixator.
You can't possibly do all of that at once
and I'm certainly not leaving him till he's stable.
Yes, and the other patient has a blunt chest trauma.
He might be bleeding out.
Well, if he is, I'm sure Dr. Kovac will come get me.
Give me a 3-0 nylon and an opsite.
Got it.
Tell Mark Greene we are closed to trauma!
Urine dip is negative for blood.
Hemoglobin's 11.6.
And get him a unit bed.
Working on it.
Third liter of saline, up at 15-ten.
Pressure's down to 60.
Tachy at 130.
I have some breath sounds on the left.
20 of Etomidate, ten of Norcuron.
I'll intubate.
Abby, prep for a chest tube on the left.
Suction!
Open a stair drape.
Too much edema.
I need the fiberoptic scope.
Abby, put in the chest tube.
I can't, I'm a nurse.
This guy needs a chest tube.
You're going to have to do it.
It's a tough intubation.
You know how.
Go!
Ten blade.
Hey, hey, get back in bed, Mr. Kamatovic.
You're not supposed to be here.
Are you feeling better?
There was probably a lot of dust
when the causeway collapsed.
It aggravated your asthma.
All right, 60 of Prednisone.
Repeat nebs in 30 minutes.
Sorry about that.
It's like Mars Attacks in here.
Got A 23-year-old male with hip pain.
BP's 130/85.
Pulse 110, there's no obvious deformity.
( yells )
Okay, let's cut this off, please.
No, don't cut my costume, man!
Well, I need to take a look at your hip.
The zipper's in the back.
Fine, unzip Zantar here.
Titrate ten of morphine.
Get an AP pelvis and a right hip film.
Where the hell is Benton?
I think he quit.
He's got a bad tib tib fracture
and he's losing foot pulses.
We've got to get him to the OR now.
We're short surgeons
because of the conference.
I thought we were closing to traumas.
Yeah, well, it's a little late for that now.
I'll get Corday.
Weaver: Liver and spleen look good.
Excellent. Bleeding must be limited to the pelvis.
We've got a patient with probable compartment syndrome.
Do your best to stabilize him.
I'll be there as soon as I can.
Then we need the digital striker.
Call upstairs. No, no, it's under the sink.
Dr. Greene borrowed it from the OR.
Yeah, stole it, more like.
Nevermind. Let him use it.
Just tell him I want the results of the readings.
Systolics are down to 70.
Another two units of packed cells.
Cops are coming to arrest
your pneumonia mom. Gloria?
For what?
Frank said it's for writing bad checks.
Oh, Frank, damn.
Elisabeth, you okay for a minute?
Yep, go.
Hey, did somebody get hurt?
Uh, yeah.
Hey, did that nurse come in yet
and get the urine sample?
No. What happened?
A, uh, walkway collapsed over at the Tarver Center.
Corday: Run two units of O-neg on the rapid infuser.
Type and cross for four more.
A lot of people got hurt, huh?
Yeah.
It's too bad.
I bet they never saw it coming.
I sure didn't.
Okay, let's get you up here, huh?
Oh...
I-I'm sorry, I-I didn't know I had to go.
I would've cathetered myself
but I was waiting for the nurse.
It's okay, no big deal, Dennis.
Oh, I'll-I'll get to him in a minute, Carter.
Oh, that's all right.
I got this, Lydia.
They need you in the trauma rooms.
You sure?
Yeah, go.
Dennis: You know
most doctors don't like to do this stuff.
All right, let's get you out of those wet clothes.
Gloria, this is the Zithromax.
Take two tomorrow, then one a day for the next four days.
Is something wrong?
Yes, the police are on their way to pick you up.
What?
There's a warrant out for your arrest.
You know, sometimes I have to bounce a check to buy some time.
I usually pay everything off in time.
I just, you know, I've got two jobs...
I understand.
Here we go, right this way.
No, honey, day care is... on the fourth floor.
Thanks for everything.
Kerry.
Oh, tell me that you're here to help out.
No, but I will take Mr. Kamatovik up to psych
once we get a bed available.
Yeah, I appreciate that
but we could really use an extra pair of hands down here.
I'm sorry, we've got our own problems up there.
Tonight's a full moon.
Stop by later if you want.
It'll be like Mardi Gras.
Anterior compartment pressure 68.
That's not good.
Normal is 30.
He needs a fasciotomy now.
You're going to do this?
I did one in med school, on a cadaver.
Well, you can't do it down here.
If we don't do this now, he's going to need an amputation.
Get Corday on the intercom.
Dr. Corday.
What is it?
We've got the pressures.
Average reading, 65.
I have to open the compartments.
Well, we're ready.
This guy's bleeding from his pelvis.
You're going to have to wait.
Can't wait, we've lost foot pulses.
Look, could you get another surgeon?
No one's here, you're going to have to talk me
through this.
Well, I don't think I can.
You're going to have to do this, Elisabeth.
Another o-silk, please.
What are you doing?
Sewing in a chest tube.
When I said you'd get more medical experience down here
this is not what I meant.
Nurses do not sew in chest tubes, do they, Dr. Kovac?
She knows how.
Of course, but our malpractice insurance
no longer covers her doing anything
outside the scope of normal nursing practices.
We were short-handed.
The patient could've died if she hadn't put it in.
You let her put in the chest tube?
She did a great job.
Yeah, that's not the point.
You should've called me.
You were busy.
Step back, Abby.
I'm really almost done.
Step back.
Get Corday some pavulon.
I need some pavulon.
How's it going in there?
He'll live.
Hey, do you know if we have
any extra-small scrubs in here?
Sure they'll fit you?
I've got a paraplegic kid with a UTI who just wet himself.
I want to give him something to change into
and these are all huge.
Well, don't ask me.
I didn't even know I was working here till today.
I swear, I can't win with Weaver.
Well, who can?
You know, she drags me down here claiming it's for my benefit
so I can get more experience, but not too much experience.
Talk to your nurse manager.
Right, and then Weaver completely hates me
if I ever come back as a med student.
Oh, you'll come back.
I don't know if I want to, this place is a freak show.
This place grows on you.
So does foot fungus.
Abby, get Mr. Palmer a CBC urine dip monoglobin
and put in a foley.
Which one's Palmer?
300 pounds with blue skin.
Excellent, fat and colorful. Here.
Hey, well, at least you've got something to do.
I'll trade you Jabba the Hut for the UTI.
I said I was bored, not desperate.
Abby, Corday's
still waiting on that pavulon.
Your self-diagnosis was right on.
You've got a urinary tract infection.
Hey, are these for me?
Well, you think like a doctor
so you may as well dress like one.
I'll help you put those on when I get back.
I'm writing you a prescription for some Bactrim.
If you follow all the directions and take all the pills
you'll be better in no time.
Oh, and do you think I could get
some extra catheters while I'm here?
Sometimes they forget to order them for me.
I think we can manage that.
Really?
Sure.
Thanks.
Here, I made this for you.
Hey, thanks, that's very cool.
It's supposed to look like an F22 raptor.
Oh, you like jets?
Yeah, I wanted to be a pilot
now I make paper airplanes, but...
Will it fly?
Yeah. Here, check it out.
Weaver: Where's Frank?
Where is Frank?
Grow up, Malucci.
What did I do?
You've got patients to treat.
Lydia said you needed more versed.
Yeah, try another two.
There's a lot of masseter spasm.
So, when are we going to meet "Daddy"?
Huh?
The father of your baby.
Everybody's kind of curious.
How's he doing?
He's out.
You know, my pregnancy is none of your business.
In fact, nothing remotely concerned with my personal life
is anybody's business.
I just wanted to meet the lucky guy.
You do know who the father is, right?
Hey, I'm sorry, I can't help myself sometimes.
There's something about seeing you this way
that I find very sexy.
I'm going to order a post-reduction film.
Oh, contra-sedation protocol.
Somebody's got to baby-sit this guy till he wakes up.
Yeah?
Well, I guess that would be your job, Dave.
Thank you.
Oh, crap.
What's wrong?
I've got a 16-year-old with gonorrhea in her throat.
Her mom brought her in.
Now I've got to find a way to tell her
without her mother finding out.
I'll take that.
No, it's okay.
It looks like you've got your hands full.
Carter, I've got it.
Lateral incision, start three finger breadths
below the fibular head
and carry it down to above the lateral maleolus.
How deep?
First incision, just through the skin and sub-Q.
Got it.
Is there anything I can do?
Yeah, get Elisabeth out here.
What's next?
Now, carefully
extend the incision through the deep fascia
of the anterior and lateral compartments.
What about the anterior tibial nerve?
You should be okay.
Don't cut too deep and you'll stay superficial to it.
How's he doing?
Who, Mark or my patient?
I'm going to need more pavulon.
Hey, Moira, where's your mom?
She went to find you.
She was getting really pissed off waiting around.
Well, it's good she's not here.
Why?
You have a sexually transmitted disease.
What?
You contracted gonorrhea.
Wait, but that's impossible.
I've never even had sex.
I'm a virgin.
What about oral sex?
That doesn't count.
Oh, God.
You and your boyfriend both need to be treated with antibiotics.
He gave me gonorrhea in my throat?
Have you had any more partners?
I'm not a slut.
I didn't even want to do it in the first place.
Then don't.
You're not going to tell my mom, right?
No, but you have to promise me
you're going to practice safe sex.
I thought I was.
Hello?
Hey, it's me.
Peter, what are you doing home?
There was a surgical conference
so all elective surgery was canceled today.
I figured I'd come home and hang out with Reese.
Ooh, being an attending has its privileges.
Hey, man.
Hey, Reese, how are you?
What's happening?
Hey, what's this, what are you playing with, huh?
Playing with your fire truck
you want to be a fireman?
What's that
a horse?
You want to be a cowboy?
Looks like I'm going
to have two doctors in the family.
How much longer am I going to have to wait?
Have a seat. I'm sure someone will see you in a minute.
I've been seen; she disappeared.
Who's that?
I don't know-- some black woman.
She came into the room
looked at my daughter's throat three hours ago.
What's your daughter's name?
Moira Garvey. This is ridiculous!
Mrs. Garvey.
There she is. Where have you been, at lunch?
I'm sorry, I had some traumas come in.
I gave Moira her shot; she's ready to go home.
Three hours to get a needle.
I'll be right there to discharge her.
What did you say to her?
Nothing. I don't even know who she is.
Tell them I'll be up in a little while to put in
the suprapubic catheter.
Hey, how's he doing?
Pulses are bounding.
May I take a look?
Did you get your guy's pressure back up?
Oh, yeah, after eight units of packed cells.
That's not bad for a first time.
Piece of cake when you follow directions.
Yes. Funny how I can talk you through
a complicated fasciotomy
but when I tell you to pick up your socks, you just ignore me.
I'm sorry. Did you just say something?
Doctor Dave: 14, Death: Zero.
Nice job on triage, Dr. Malucci.
Thanks a lot, Chief.
I still can't believe
we didn't get one penetrating chest trauma, you know?
Hey, we got another one-- Greg Fulton, Exam Five.
Wanted for assault, battery, and indecent exposure.
Hey!
Sorry, Frank, this isn't working.
What are you talking about?
We made two arrests.
It would've been three if that
mother hadn't escaped, and between you and me
I think someone on the staff tipped her off.
No more record checks on patients.
What'd you do with my patient, Kerry?
Mr. Kamatovik?
I got him a bed, but he's gone AWOL.
Well, he can't have gotten too far.
You look pretty good in scrubs.
Uh, can I keep them?
Uh, sure. Hey, I'll be right back, okay?
Hey, Cleo, was that your gonorrhea patient?
Yeah.
Did you manage to treat her without her mom finding out?
Yup.
Listen, I wasn't trying to step on your toes
when I offered to take the case.
I was just trying to help.
I know.
Hey, Cleo, do you, uh, have a problem with me being here?
Of course not.
I told you, he's disappeared.
What is this?
Weaver: Alcohol wipes.
He says he has to stay cool to avoid spontaneous combustion.
Yeah, he begged me to give him a popsicle enema.
We settled for ice chips.
Mr. Kamatovik...
( knocking )
Are you in there?
Yes!
All right. Come out so we can help you.
I can't. I'm burning up. I need wet blankets.
We can get you some upstairs.
You want me to bring him out, Chief?
Please.
( knocks again )
Mr. Kamatovik, open up.
Whoa!
( Kamatovik screaming )
( screaming continues )
Somebody call the burn unit!
Get a gurney!
Dennis: This is a modified version
of Ken Blackburn's 1998 World Record design.
You sure you want to launch it?
It's just a piece of folded paper until you let it fly.
All right, let it fly.
All right.
Wow.
That looks like it could go on forever.
Dennis: Well, theoretically, it could if the wind kept blowing
and it kept finding up currents.
This is really cool.
I've never been up this high before.
( pager beeping )
Looks like your ride is here.
I'm out of airplanes, anyway.
Thanks for bringing me up here, Dr. Carter.
Well, you make some more airplanes
and we could do it again sometime.
I'd like that.
Hey.
Hey.
You're popular today, huh?
I know.
What's that about?
I'm everybody's favorite nurse...
( sighs )
But that's the problem, because as a med student
I screwed up everything-- everything--
things I could do even with my eyes closed.
I think it's all in here.
You are a good nurse, Abby, but you could be a great doctor.
You just need a little confidence.
Oh, my God, I'm sorry.
I can't believe I did that.
Marquez: Abby.
Yeah?
You've got a code brown with Mr. Pozoni.
Again? Geez, how much can that guy eat?
I got to go.
( chuckling ): I'll see you later.
Bye.
Bye.
Peter, are you here?
I've been calling.
Why didn't you pick up?
I didn't feel like talking.
I went up during my break.
Shirley said you'd been fired.
Hmm...
I guess the whole hospital knows by now, huh?
Why didn't you tell me?
Peter, I was worried about you. I called Jackie.
She said you had been gone for hours.
What did you tell her?
I didn't tell her anything
except I didn't have any idea where you were.
( sighing )
What happened?
Peter...
Peter, tell me.
Romano got hit with a big IMTALA fine over the Fletcher case.
Good, he deserves it.
Yeah, well, now he's taking it out on me.
Maybe he's just blowing off steam.
No, I've seen him do that.
This time he's serious.
Talk to somebody.
Call Anspaugh.
And tell him what?
Tell him Romano
is a racist, sexist, elitist jackass.
Oh, Cleo, he knows that.
You're an excellent surgeon, Peter
and you're a good man, and we'll work it out.
( sighing )
How's it going, Carter?
Good. My day got better. How about you?
Yeah, I think so.
I don't know, it was like-- whoom!
The guy just went up in flames.
You should've seen it, man.
Hey, Carter, you ever see spontaneous human combustion?
No, Dave, it doesn't exist.
Ah, I was there, I saw it--
no lighter, no matches, no nothing.
He's right. I went on a missing persons call once.
All we found was this old gal's legs.
The rest of her burned to a crisp.
But that chair she was sitting in-- barely singed.
So, Carter, how was your first day back?
It was good; a little slow.
Glad to hear it. Finished up?
Yeah, I am officially out of here.
Just one last thing to do.
Sure.
You coming with me?
That's the rules.
Sorry, Carter, I have to witness the entire process.
Trust me, it's no treat for me, either.
Seen any good movies lately?
No.
You want me to run some water or something?
( liquid splashing )
