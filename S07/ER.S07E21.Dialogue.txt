Previously on E.R.:
You should know you're being considered
for Chief Resident next year.
I'm pregnant.
Roger's out of town.
Is he ever around?
We haven't been getting along too well, lately.
What do you want, Kerry?
I thought you might be hungry.
No, no, I'm not, and I have a ton of work to do, so...
Your mother has just been transported
to her commitment hearing.
Aren't you supposed to testify?
Mrs. Wyczenski's released on
her own recogizance.
She needs hospitalization.
I'm not debating it with you, miss.
Why do you think I'm here?
'Cause you know she needs your help
even if she doesn't want it.
I just hope you didn't order
from that Thai place again.
Very good.
My turn now?
Hey, he finish his breakfast?
No, but I got him to eat some strawberries.
Ah, Cleo, he's supposed to have hot cereal
before he gets treats.
These are just as nutritious
if not more so.
And they're yummy, too.
At least tell the baby-sitter
to make sure he has a good lunch.
I canceled the sitter.
What?
I'm off today.
Cleo, Reese needs a lot of attention.
Peter, I'm a pediatrician.
All right.
Hey, see you, man.
Say, "See you at the game, Daddy."
What are you talking about?
I didn't say I was going to play tonight.
You're not-- you're going to sit
in the bleachers with Reese.
Come on, it'll be fun.
I'm playing first base.
He doesn't have a jacket here.
I'll go to Carla's and pick one up.
No, you know what, I'll do it.
I can go.
I said I'll go, okay?
I'm on the cell.
Okay.
Want to play trains?
God, I slept so great, and dreams...
It's so wonderful to be able to dream again.
Obviously, the therapy sessions are helping
and these walks.
Good.
You know what
you don't have to stay home all the time.
I'm sure Luka would love to see you.
It's only been a couple of weeks.
He's a good man.
Yeah.
So's your friend John.
Yeah.
Must be fun to have two men interested in you.
Ah, Mom...
I've had men interested in me all my life
you know, just not good ones.
Actually, I think your father was the best
compared to all the rest
but I certainly blew that.
Think we should head home?
Why is it we can't talk?
We're talking.
No, I mean about important things.
You know, Dr. Legaspi says it might be
easier for us to do it in a therapy session.
Do what?
Talk.
She wants you to come to one of the sessions.
No.
I want you to come, too, please?
You could come during lunch break.
I'm going to head back.
Abby, will you come?
I'm going to go to work.
Come on, just, just think about it, all right?
Hi.
Hi.
Can I help you?
Uh, I was just dropping something off.
For Kim?
She's in the shower.
I can give her that if you want.
No, thanks.
I'll pass it on later.
Well, you're welcome to come in...
No, that won't be necessary, thank you.
If you give me your name
I could tell her you stopped by...
Dr. Greene? Huh?
Yeah, sorry, I need to get some lab slips.
Oh, sure, sorry.
Baby keeping you up, huh?
Oh, not really.
She slept for six hours last night
ten minutes at a time.
How long we got to wait here?
I've been in the hall for five minutes
can't find a doc to save my life.
What do you got? Seven-year-old boy
tried to put out a fire in a garbage can.
Partial thickness burns over both hands.
Need some help? Sure.
BOY: Get it out! B.P.'s 110/60.
That him? He sounds agitated.
You could say that.
Hey, I'm Dr. Mark Greene.
You want to tell me your name?
No! It's Ben.
I want this out of my nose!
That's to help you breathe.
It's only for a little while, okay?
Are you his mother?
Next-door neighbor.
He's a friend of my son's.
No answer at the kid's house.
Good air entry, both lungs are clear.
Any way to contact the parents?
He just has a father, I left him a message.
I want to go home!
Let's go.
Randi, what do you see me in--
a Beemer or a Porsche?
Most of the time I see you walking.
Okay, you can forget about a ride.
Carter, buy or lease?
Dr. Dave behind the wheel, huh?
This is topaz blue metallic.
What do you think?
I think it's out of your price range.
I'm moonlighting at a doc in the box, my friend.
Figure three months, I've got my down-payment.
Ooh, then what happens?
Eh, fake my own death.
Hey, you playing ball tonight?
We're going to kick Sanitation's ass.
Maybe.
Neck pain in curtain one is asking for you.
I'll be right there.
Black or sand interior?
Dr. Malucci, I hope you're not
keeping patients waiting
while you shop for a car.
No, no, no, I'm all over that board, Chief.
Don't worry, he still has to pass his driver's license test.
Dr. Carter, can I speak to you a minute?
Sure.
CHEN: Morning.
Morning, Dr. Chen.
Hey.
Deb.
Could you excuse us a minute?
Oh, sure.
Your application was intercepted by administration.
The processing time has improved.
You realize you're still in a probationary period?
Which will be completed by the time
the Chief Resident slot needs to be filled.
Why do you want to do this?
Well, it gets me closer to a junior faculty position.
Looks good on the c.v.
No, I mean why risk compromising your recovery
by taking on a new and very demanding position?
I guess I don't see it as a risk.
Having teaching and administrative responsibilities
along with your clinical shifts?
I'm in the program.
I've been managing my stress.
I got myself back up to speed.
Carter, you'd all but give up nights and weekends.
It's a tremendous amount of work.
I'm ready for it.
You can't just gloss over what happened last year.
Neither can the committee.
You're returning my application?
Did you honestly think
that you'd make the first cut?
Get your hands off me! PARAMEDIC: He's all yours.
Okay, let me take a closer look.
Don't touch me!
It'll feel better in a second, I promise.
Mild erythema, no blistering.
It hurts! Stop!
You have to let the doctor finish, okay?
You want to tell me what happened? No!
I think he may have lit the fire himself.
Shut up!
Why don't we get
a burn tray for Ben here? Sure.
He's home by himself a lot.
I said, shut up!
I just wish he would stop hanging around my son.
Hey, good news.
Our second baseman has the stomach flu.
Luka, I'm not playing softball.
Well, you don't have to be great, it's just for fun.
Actually, I happen to play very well.
So go, it'd be good for you.
I can't.
One night away from your mother
isn't going to do anything.
I miss you.
Have a good time tonight.
Connie, can you dispense some ketoconazole to Exam One?
Sure. Thanks.
Emergency ringworm, huh?
Yeah, pretty hard to avoid-- guy has 40 cats.
You might want to give him a flea bath while you're at it.
Sure.
So what was going on between you and Weaver?
Not much.
Except for her denying my application for Chief Resident.
Apparently, I still have a scarlet "A" on my chest.
Oh, wow, I'm really sorry, John.
Don't be.
Makes you a shoo-in.
There are other candidates.
Not really.
I guess congratulations are in order.
Congratulations, you deserve it.
Thanks.
Not as much as me, but... Yeah, right.
Hey.
I put a cap in there, too.
Oh, good.
Why don't you stay a while
and have some coffee maybe?
You know what, I need to get back.
You all right?
Yeah.
Roger...
...moved out a few days ago.
I'm going to be all right.
You sure?
It would've saved us both a whole lot of trouble
if we had just stayed together, you know, Peter?
It would've been better for Reese, anyway.
( heavy sigh )
He said he never loved me.
You know, Carla
people say a lot of things they don't mean
when they're fighting.
I don't know.
I think, uh, it's true.
Maybe we never had anything.
Well, it'll work itself out.
You and I...
( deep breath )
we had something.
Didn't we, Peter, hmm?
Hmm?
Sometimes I think we still do.
I'm not doing this, Carla.
Peter...
( phone rings )
Yeah?
CLEO: That's a nice hello.
Cleo.
Did you make it to Carla's yet?
A few minutes ago.
Good.
Hey, how about picking up deli on the way home?
We can have a picnic on the field.
Uh, sure, yeah, whatever.
You all right?
Yeah, why?
I don't know, you sound funny.
She giving you a hard time?
Who?
Carla.
You know, I'm sorry.
I'm just in a rush.
Oh... Reese, wait!
What's he doing? Hang on, Peter.
( screams )
Oh, my God!
Cleo, what happened?!
Is there something wrong?
Read it and weep.
No bleeding, no hydrocephalus, no midline shift
no subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Okay, do an LP.
Got a chronic neck pain patient.
You want me to give a Demerol junkie a spinal tap?
CT's are only 95% sensitive, Dave.
What are you two, a tag team?
I know what I'm doing.
Oh, to be a junior resident again.
Not.
Dr. Chen, can I see you?
Sure.
Good luck.
Thanks.
As you know, Chief Residency is typically an extra year
completing the Emergency Medicine program.
In rare cases
we make an exception and allow a senior
to be promoted into the position.
Right.
Unfortunately, your maternity leave
put you three months behind
on shifts and procedures
keeping you just shy of senior status.
But I'm in the process of making that up.
Yes, but the academic year ends June 30th.
And I'm planning on working every weekend
and every holiday until then.
Hospital policy actively discourages work weeks
in excess of 60 hours
and given that limitation
it doesn't seem feasible that you'd succeed
in making the deadline.
Oh.
And, as a result
I'm afraid you won't be a candidate
for Chief Resident this year.
I'm sorry, I know it doesn't seem fair...
Wait, this is completely sexist and discriminatory!
Excuse me?
You all but offered me this position
prior to my pregnancy.
Yes, and at that time
I anticipated your completion of the program.
I had a baby.
I think I made a choice
that was both legal and responsible.
Of course you did.
I made a sacrifice, largely for the sake of my career
and becoming Chief Resident is a huge part of that.
Jing-Mei...
I'm a good doctor.
I've offered to make up for lost time, and I didn't screw up.
Under the circumstances, I think I deserve a chance.
I appreciate your thoughts
and I'll take them under advisement.
I'd hope you would.
What is that stuff?
Thermazine cream.
It'll make you feel better
and it helps to keep it from getting infected.
My fingers feel funny.
How?
I can't feel the ends.
No?
Maybe with this hand...
Hey!
( loud crash )
You know, that's not funny.
Everything okay in here?
Yeah.
She was hurting my hand.
Oh, yeah? Let me take a look.
He says he can't feel his fingers.
Let me see your hand.
Ouch!
It hurts there, huh?
Did you fall?
I don't know. Maybe.
Let's get an X ray of this left hand, just in case.
Ouch!
Ow!
Hey, hey! Hey, hey, hey!
Settle down. My head!
Yeah, okay.
Let me take a look at your head.
Hey, do you remember when you hurt your ear?
Huh?
You've got a pretty bad bruise back here.
Six-disc CD changer, tinted windows... hello?
Here's an ACL in Exam Two.
Yeah, I was on my way, Chief.
Yeah?
Dr. Malucci, you're a resident.
You can't afford a car!
What was all that about?
A misguided sense of job security.
Lot of that going around.
I heard you came by the house.
Yeah, I was in the area
and on a whim I thought I'd stop by.
Lori said that you had a letter
but that you didn't leave it.
Just didn't seem like the timing was very good.
I can see how you would feel that way.
How long have you two been seeing each other?
Not long.
I'm sorry. I know this must be painful for you.
No, I'm fine, I mean, it's fine.
Okay.
Kerry?
You take care of yourself.
Yeah, you, too. Okay.
I've got an AMA form I need you to co-sign.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt.
You didn't.
You two okay?
Oh, Dr. Legaspi.
Hi. Hi.
I was wondering if you could tell me
how it's going with my mother?
Oh, I'm sorry, Abby.
I really can't discuss her therapy with you.
Even if she said you said
I should attend one of her sessions?
I think that it would be mutually beneficial, yeah.
Okay.
Could you give me a little bit of an idea
of what to expect?
Well, it's not an ambush.
I'm sorry.
It's just that... she lies a lot.
We meet at 1:00.
You don't have to come if you don't want to.
Still hurt?
I'm sorry.
Oh, baby, look at you!
Oh, it's all right. Mommy's here.
How bad is it?
He's got a fracture of the fifth metacarpal.
His hand is broken?
He's going to have to wear a cast
six to eight weeks.
How is he going to sign?
He's not.
All right. It's okay.
Mommy's here. It's going to be okay.
I'm sorry. I just looked away for a second
and he was at the piano.
Listen. Why don't you give us a few minutes, okay?
Of course.
Hey.
This is your fault, you know?
I am so sorry.
Uh-huh. Reese is not like other children.
I know.
Then how come you didn't stay in his eyeline?
It was an accident, Carla.
I don't know what else to say.
I feel horrible about this.
I want you to stay away from my son.
Carla, can we just...
What would have happened
if you had turned away again?
What would've happened
if Reese had run out into the street?
He is deaf!
You cannot just call out to him!
All right, Carla! Carla!
You have to be with him every second!
I don't want to see this bitch
I said back off!
anywhere near Reese again, you hear me, Peter?
Go.
( sighs )
Hey. Hi.
Hit and run.
ETA is five minutes.
Kind of like, uh, waiting for thunder
after the lightning strikes.
Dr. Legaspi and I...
It ended.
I'm sorry.
Something changed?
Yes.
Do you love her?
Then you should go forward, not back, huh?
50-year-old male changing a blowout on the shoulder
got sideswiped by a car.
LOC at the scene, but started coming around in the rig.
Obvious femur fracture. Vitals?
Initially 90 palp. B.P.'s up to 115/70
after 1500cc's of saline.
Sir, can you tell us your name?
Jim Vogel...
God, my legs!
Trauma Two. Go.
get a C-spine, chest and pelvis.
She won't come out.
Restrained, but got a small forehead lac
from the rearview mirror.
Brother said she's developmentally challenged.
This is her baseline.
Won't say. What's her name?
I'm not sure she understands the question.
Hi, I'm Dr. Weaver. Can you tell me who you are?
Jim's sister.
Okay. Well, we need to make sure
you're not seriously hurt, so can you come out?
I want to go again.
I'm sorry?
On a ride. It's fun.
She's been smiling like this
every since they got her on the rig.
Here we go.
( screaming )
Crepitations on the right
with decreased air entry. I need that chest tube.
Tachy at 110. I'll set it up.
I can't stand it!
What have you got so far?
Pneumo on the right
unstable pelvis and fractured right hip.
Where's Bonnie? Is she all right?
Is that your sister's name? Yeah.
Another doctor is checking her out
and she appears to have only minor injuries.
Mr. Vogel, does Bonnie have any medical conditions
other than her developmental delay?
No, she's always been healthy.
Okay.
MAGGIE: Well, yeah, it disappointed me
but then I'm...
In reality, I was used to being disappointed
so I didn't expect anything...
Sorry I'm late.
It's fine. We're glad you could join us.
Hi. Hi.
Please know that we both understand
how awkward it can be
to step into someone else's therapy.
It's okay. I'm fine.
Maggie, do you want to continue?
Sure, um...
So, uh, Dr. Legaspi and I were talking about...
Well, we were talking about a lot of things
but we were talking about ways that I could stay healthy.
You know, how to position myself
to get it together, keep on track, and, um...
Part of that is...
that I've decided to go home.
Have you talked to Eric?
No, not Florida.
Um, home, home.
I... I'm going back to Minnesota.
( laughs )
Uh...
uh, you haven't been to Minneapolis in 15 years, Mom.
I know that. I know I haven't
but I grew up there, and I feel like I belong there.
I've got, you know, a little bit of family
and some friends...
What friends?
Gina. You remember Gina?
Well, I'm going to stay with her.
She has a spare room. She thinks
she could get me a job
in the convalescent hospital where she works.
Really?
And when did you arrange all this?
Last week.
She accepted a collect phone call from me.
She was glad to hear from me, Abby.
She was glad to talk to me.
Anyway, I-I, I'll, I'll save enough money
and I'll get a place of my own.
A place of your own?
Yes, a place of my own
with no roommates, no men, just me. Maybe a cat.
A cat?
That would be a great pet, a cat.
Are you reacting to your mother's plans?
I'm not reacting.
I... I'm just...
Just, just what?
Nothing.
Abby, I can't stay here in Chicago.
I don't want to go to Florida.
It's just too easy
for me to be a drain on you and...
I think we're way past that at this point.
What is your objection
to your mother going home?
Nothing. It's very romantic.
You're not happy about it?
I... I don't know what you want me to say.
Yippie, she's going home?
Fabulous. That solves all the problems? What?
Then what is your solution?
I don't have a solution.
I... I don't have...
I don't think there is a solution.
And to talk about this as if it were
some sort of "life-management" problem
that you can plan your way out of is... well, it's absurd.
Then what do you suggest?
I-I don't know.
You know what? I don't know.
I don't know.
So, I guess you're right.
You have to do something, Mom. Good luck.
So, what, you're leaving?
You wanted to tell me. You told me.
Well, I'm not going for a week or so.
Okay, great. See you later.
When did Ben Fossen's father arrive?
A while ago.
Someone should've told me.
Hi. I'm Dr. Greene.
Derek Fossen.
Thanks for taking care of him.
Sure. Could we talk outside?
Yeah.
I'll be right outside, Ben.
Mrs. Schayotovich told me about the fire.
Your neighbor?
Yeah. Over here.
He's always getting into trouble.
Yeah?
Yeah. His mom's out of the picture
and I think it makes him act out.
Mm-hmm. Well, those burns will heal.
Oh, good. Thanks.
I'm just waiting on the psychiatrist to come talk to Ben.
Psychiatrist? Why?
We found some unusual bruising on your son, Mr. Fossen.
Do you know about that?
No.
You've never noticed the bruises?
Well, he gets into scrapes at school.
Fights?
Yeah.
Any serious injuries?
No more than any kid.
Well, I'm sure he'll tell that to the doctor.
Look, he doesn't need a psychiatrist
and I have to get back to work, so...
I know, I know. This won't take long.
We're supposed to be at the park.
Is that where you were driving?
2:00 to 4:00, we go to the park...
but we had a crash.
I know.
My parents had a crash.
When's Jimmy coming back?
I don't know.
Did they die in the crash--
your parents?
So what do you do in the park, Bonnie?
The slide.
Hmm!
Anything else?
The swing.
You know, Jimmy pushes me...
not too high, though.
Do you have any other brothers or sisters?
Nope.
C-spine is clear.
No perihepatic fluid, but I can't see the spleen.
Where's Bonnie?
She's fine. She's getting some sutures.
Oh, thank God.
Minimal blood in the thoraseal
but his repeat crit is 34.
He's bleeding from somewhere.
Probably here.
What's wrong?
You shattered your pelvis.
That'll heal, though, right?
Yes, but the edges of the bone may be cutting an artery.
We need to do a CAT scan
to see where the bleeding is coming from.
Lydia, call Radiology. ( groaning )
Tell them we need abdomen and pelvis with contrast.
Will I need surgery?
We'll know after the scan.
Because I can't be laid up. My sister...
Yes, yes, I know.
We'll try to stop the bleeding
by injecting a clotting agent into the artery.
B.P.'s down to 95/60.
Okay, hang another two units
and call for six type-specific.
Okay, we need to go now.
I'm going to bring Carla home
then go by your place to pick up his stuff.
Fine.
Listen, Cleo, I told you
you know, Reese, he needs special attention.
Peter, I know that.
I made a mistake.
All right.
Yeah, but you're acting like
I deliberately let him get hurt.
I'm sorry about what happened.
Carla gets upset.
Well, I don't get called a bitch by anyone.
WEAVER: Bonnie?
Where are you supposed to be?
Finding my brother.
Okay.
Jing-Mei.
Bonnie, you're supposed to stay in that room.
I have to tell my brother what I want for dinner.
Why is he back?
Dropped his pressure upstairs.
BONNIE: There he is. Jimmy!
WRIGHT: B.P.'s only 80 palp.
WEAVER: Hang another two units on the infuser.
What'd the scan show?
KOVAC: He crashed before we even got him on the table.
JIMMY: Dr. Weaver?
KOVAC: Open a peritoneal lavage kit.
WEAVER: We'll go supra-umbilical.
Lydia, drop an NG.
My sister has special needs.
Let's worry about you right now.
WRIGHT: Hemocue's ten.
Okay, we need central access.
Somebody get Dr. Chen!
There's no one else but me.
Okay, Jim. Dr. Chen, put in a subclavian.
Got it.
Pressure's down to 70; pulse ox dropped to 84.
Jim? Jim?
He's not breathing.
Give me an 8-0 tube!
KOVAC: Bag him on 100%.
Get in that line!
Luka, if the tap is positive
he goes to the OR.
If not, maybe we can embolize the pelvic bleeders.
I'm in. Okay, squeeze in all the blood you can.
Call for eight more units.
Well, the hand's okay.
Look at the wrist.
Is that a Colles's fracture?
Ben says he never hurt his wrist.
Well, maybe he was too young to remember it.
His dad doesn't remember, either.
How'd your talk go with him?
Well, he's a pretty hostile kid.
Mm-hmm, clammed up when dad showed up, though.
Yeah, it was hard to talk to him.
His dad was standing outside the door the whole time
and Ben knew it.
He's terrified of him.
I think he is, but, uh...
he says there's no violence in the home.
You saw that bruising.
That's him getting pulled by his ear.
He says that he doesn't remember how it happened.
You don't forget a broken bone or bruising like that.
WRIGHT: Lost his pulse.
He'll never make it to angio.
Pump in that blood. Order two units of FFP. He's in V-fib.
Starting compressions.
WEAVER: Okay, charge to 200.
Clear.
V-fib.
Thoracotomy tray.
It's blunt trauma.
It's an isolated pelvic injury.
Clear.
Lydia, close the blinds to Suture.
KOVAC: Still in fib.
WEAVER: 360.
Clear.
LOCKHART: I'm starving.
CARTER: We can pick something up from Doc Magoo's.
You know, if I were smart, I would have gone to lunch
instead of getting reamed by my mother and Legaspi...
and I don't get it, because a week ago she wanted to have her committed
and now she's completely on her side.
It's not about sides.
Well, it felt like it was.
All of a sudden, it was all about me
and what was my problem
that I couldn't get on board with this plan she figured out?
Would any plan have made you happy?
No.
When was the last time your mom was in therapy?
I don't know-- like, ten years ago.
That's different.
Yeah.
So, you've got a choice.
You can either hope that she makes it this time, or... give up.
Right.
Doesn't seem like you want to do that.
I don't know what I want to do.
Weaver dropped a bomb on me this morning.
What happened?
She bagged me for Chief Resident.
Really?
Apparently, my rehab has caught up to me.
Oh, no.
I'm sorry.
It's not your fault.
Not exactly.
I guess part of facing the problem is
accepting that some people won't get over it.
I'm sorry, John.
Me, too...
for you.
WEAVER: Get a ten-pack of platelets.
KOVAC: Heart's not filling.
WRIGHT: Units nine and ten are in.
WEAVER: Hold compressions.
CHEN: Still in fib.
Vasopressin? On board.
WEAVER: Another 100 of lido.
I'll take the internal paddles.
How long's he been down?
35 minutes.
Charge to 20.
Jimmy?
Bonnie, you have to go outside.
Clear.
I don't like that.
Charge again.
Lydia... I don't want you to do that!
Lydia, please... Lydia.
No, no, w-we're trying to help him.
But it hurts him!
Clear.
BONNIE: It hurts him!
WEAVER: Charge again.
Clear.
Heart's empty.
Asystole.
Should we try
pacing him?
Okay, that's it.
That's it.
Time of death...
17:10.
Can you close the chest up?
Yeah.
Clean him up
but leave the tubes in for the coroner.
I'll tell the sister.
Want me to come with you?
Yeah.
BONNIE: I'm-I'm tired of it here.
I think Jimmy and me should go home.
The doctors are going to talk to you now.
Hi, Bonnie.
Hi.
Bonnie, this is your brother's doctor.
Is he ready to go?
Bonnie, Jim was very hurt
and he couldn't recover from his injuries.
Cover?
Get better.
Your brother died, Bonnie.
I'm sorry.
Do you understand?
Like Ernie.
He died.
Um, who's Ernie?
My hamster.
We put him in a box.
Okay.
Well, like your hamster, Jim won't be with you anymore.
I got a new hamster.
His name is Ernie, too.
You know how your parents went away?
In the crash?
Jimmy went away like that, too.
But it's library night.
I know.
And I get scared at night.
Bonnie, you're going to have to be very brave.
Where's Jimmy?
There you are.
Hi.
Do you have a minute?
Sure. Am I in trouble or something?
I don't usually do this, but I think that it's important.
Okay.
I think you need to give your mom one more chance.
Didn't I just do that today?
Well, you started to, and then you ran away.
Well, maybe that's because I've heard it
about a hundred times before.
I think this time is different.
Do you? Why?
Well, for one thing, she hasn't been willing
to go to therapy for ten years.
Now she's embracing it.
I'd love to believe that meant something.
Don't let your mom go away
without being able to really talk to you.
That won't make either of you happy.
I don't think happy's on the table.
Why not?
Look, I'm not in therapy...
Fair enough.
But I'll consider it--
what you said.
Okay.
WEAVER: She has the mind
of a seven-year-old.
No other relatives?
Her brother was her only family.
I tried ARC, Protection, and Advocacy-- no luck.
Well, the facilities are all full.
She'll have to take a temporary place at a group home.
No, I don't want her sent to a place like that.
I mean, they've got four or five people in every room.
Well, unless you want to take her home
this is all I can offer.
Okay, but I don't want to hear
about her sleeping on a couch or on the floor.
I will pass that along.
You'll have to get her there yourself.
They're too backed up to come pick her up.
Oh, come on!
I'm just the messenger.
Look, in time, she'll adjust.
Adele, this stinks.
They've got job training programs
and, hopefully, she'll learn a skill.
Adele, ready?
Oh, yeah.
Sorry.
It's about time.
Ben has not eaten since noon.
We'll get him something.
We'd rather just go.
Mr. Fossen, this is Adele Neuman.
Hi. She's a social worker.
Hi, Ben. Hi.
Look, my kid does not need any more counseling or whatever.
I'm afraid Ben's going to have to stay here for a few days, Mr. Fossen.
What? We're taking him into emergency custody.
What are you talking about? What for?
I'm not comfortable with the bruising I found on your son.
Oh, God forbid you're not comfortable.
And I also found evidence
of a broken wrist
which neither of you mentioned.
I told you that he fights.
Would you tell them, please?
I fight a lot.
If that's true, then you'll get to go home in three days
but right now, I need you to come with me.
I don't want to. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! You're not doing this!
You're not doing this to us!
NEUMAN: Security!
Get your hands off of me!
You don't have a choice here, Mr. Fossen.
You think I hurt my kid? You're crazy.
I suggest you contact a lawyer.
To sue your ass!
It's for your protection, Ben.
I don't want to go away!
Please let me stay with him!
Leave him alone! I'm sorry.
No! I'm sorry.
Dad! Please!
You bastard!
Please!
Why are you doing this to us?!
Dad! Dad!
Hi. Hi.
Guess what?
The super finally fixed the stove fan
so I cooked dinner.
Cucumber soup, a little salmon...
Why don't you invite Luka to dinner?
He's playing softball.
That sounds like fun. Are you going to go?
I don't play. Um...
The reason why I ran out today like that
is because it's just, um...
it's scary to hope too much, you know?
Yeah. I know.
I know I might not make it, but Abby...
something happened to me in that ICU room.
I realized... I don't want to die.
And more than that...
I don't want my little girl to watch me die.
I can't do that to you.
Not ever.
That's what I wanted to tell you today.
I'm going to handle my life
and I want you to get on with yours.
Okay.
You can't put your life on hold anymore.
It's not on hold.
What do you mean?
You won't even go play softball with your boyfriend.
So? I don't want to play.
Stop sitting things out, Abby.
I don't.
Yes, you do.
You can't use me as the reason
for not doing the things you want to do in life.
Go to medical school.
Well, that's not so easy.
Get married.
I was married.
Get pregnant!
I was pregnant!
What happened?
( whispering ): What happened?
I had an abortion.
Some people aren't meant to be mothers.
Abby, I was a lot younger than you are now
when I had my first manic episode.
I've watched you since you were a little girl; you're not bipolar.
No, but my kids could be.
But they might not be.
They could be anything, and you would just love them, that's all.
You never even told Richard, did you?
No, I... I think that was the beginning of the end for us
'cause we just stopped talking about everything.
I just was too scared...
I cou... I couldn't risk it.
I just, I didn't want to...
Turn into me?
Yeah.
Or have to end up taking care of another me?
( sniffling )
Oh, honey.
Oh, sweetie, sweetie, sweetie.
That's all there is, is risk.
You just have to take a chance and leap into life.
Otherwise, sweetheart, you're going to miss out on all the great things.
Abby, you deserve all the great things.
Do you hear me?
But I like my home.
Someone there will take good care of you.
This man's going to drive you, okay?
Jimmy was going to make me hot dogs tonight.
Okay, take this woman to this address
and make sure she's met by an adult before you leave, okay?
Yeah, all right.
Will they have hot dogs?
I don't know, but I'm sure they'll have something good.
Here you go.
I better go to my home.
I'm sorry, you can't.
But I like my home.
I like my bed and my blanket.
Bonnie, you can't live alone.
But I need my blanket.
Jimmy always gives me my blanket.
There'll be someone there to give you one, okay?
And he gives me hot dogs when I want.
( crying ): I like my home.
I don't want a new one.
( quietly ): Bonnie...
Zip your jacket, sweetie, it's chilly.
( sobbing )
Hey, batter, batter! No batter, no batter!
Strike one!
That's good, right?
That's good.
Put it right here, Doc. You got it, big guy.
Strike two!
Whoo! It's all right.
BATTER: Right here.
Luka, look alive, man.
CARTER: Hey, batter, batter!
No batter! No batter!
That's an out!
( cheering and whooping )
Change your mind?
Yeah, I even brought my own glove.
Abby, you playing? Yeah.
Then pick your weapon, 'cause you're up right after Carter.
Hey. Hi.
KOVAC: You brought your mom?
Go get 'em, John!
Thank you, Maggie.
MALUCCI: You see that hole?
You see it, right?
Luka, I didn't know you played softball.
I don't; I'm last in the batting order.
You should put Abby up.
She was an all-star on her Little League team.
How about you?
I'm just going to watch.
All-star?
I like you in that hat.
Almost look American, huh?
Almost.
( cheering and whooping )
Some vocabulary for a seven-year-old.
Bone survey turned up bilateral, healed, spiral fractures of the radius.
So you were right.
Pin a rose on me.
Kim...
Hi, Kerry.
Um, this is for you.
What is it?
It's how I feel about things; about... about you.
And I never really told you, and maybe it doesn't matter now
but I... I wanted you to know.
Okay.
You broke both your arms, Ben.
No, they're fine.
Well, these are your X rays, and these lines are fractures.
That was a long time ago.
I tripped at school.
Well, you don't get these kind of breaks from falling.
After I tripped, I fell down the stairs.
No, Ben.
You know what I think happened?
I think somebody grabbed your arm with two hands
and then twisted it
like you do with a wet towel.
I'm bad a lot.
You are?
I make too much noise playing.
I leave messes.
And Dad punishes you?
Well, how does he punish you?
Sometimes, like you said.
He calls them Indian burns.
Yeah?
It's my fault.
He wouldn't do it if I wasn't bad.
No, Ben.
Nobody should break your arm
no matter how bad you are.
You understand?
I don't care. I just want to go home.
You can't go home right now, Ben.
I'm sorry.
Malik, show 'em where you live!
CARTER: Yes, yes!
MAGGIE: Run, Abby!
Run, Abby!
Way to go, Abby!
( Maggie whooping )
Way to go!
Brought your cheering section, I see.
That's my girl!
That's good!
Go get 'em.
All right, Luka
make contact with the ball. Just meet the ball
like we talked about, all right?
Hey.
Strike one!
You were so great! You were great!
Did you hear me cheering?
Yes.
I think everybody heard you cheering.
Strike two!
Luka, don't crowd the plate!
What?
The plate!
Get back!
He's very cute
but he's no Mickey Mantle.
No.
Ball one!
Are you cold?
No, no, I love it.
Thank you for bringing me here.
Ball two.
You looked like you were having fun.
I was.
That's good.
That's really good.
Foul ball!
It's a foul ball!
That's a foul ball! That's a foul ball.
I know.
I don't think he knows that.
( Maggie laughing )
