Previously on E.R.:
( sighing ): I took two Vicodin.
Are you going to tell Weaver?
I can't.
I think you have to.
I thought that we were really hitting it off.
You're straight and...
I'm not.
Kynesha, who is this?
This is Tiny.
I hate the thought of her being in my house alone.
Now she's bringing friends over?
I'm sorry. That won't happen again.
Peter, she's manipulating you.
There has never been a more successful treatment
for your tumor.
If you believe that and mobilize
your inner resources, you're going to survive.
( phone rings )
Hello?
What?
Who is this?
Okay, tell me what happened.
Who is it?
Kynesha, slow down.
Hi, it's me,
What's wrong?
Did he put his hands on you?
All right, where are you now?
What intersection?
All right, no, no, no.
Just, uh, just wait down there.
Yeah, yeah, I'll be down.
You're going?
She got into it with somebody at the halfway house.
She got scared and took off.
Did she report it to the manager?
I don't know.
I guess there's some kind of problem there, too.
So where is she?
South Federal.
I thought that wasn't a safe neighborhood.
It's all she knows, Cleo.
Peter, don't you think that it's... a little strange
that she waited until 4:00 in the morning
to call us?
Yeah, but what do you want me to do--
leave her out on the street?
It's ten degrees outside.
You're never going to get rid of her.
Hey.
Mark, go to sleep.
You feeling nauseous?
No.
Have a bad dream?
Please, Mark, you've got to get your rest.
So do you.
You shouldn't be walking around.
You could fall.
Good thing you're a doctor.
( sighing )
How long have you been up?
I never went to sleep, really.
No point worrying about it.
There's nothing you can do.
Gordon didn't say anything else--
any indication why this meeting was so urgent?
Just that Patterson's lawyers called it.
It's probably not bad.
They want to talk.
Yeah, but what about?
You'll know soon enough.
( knocking )
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry up!
Kynesha, what the...?
Go! Go! Go!
Hey, hey, open up!
Hey, right here, open up! Open up the door!
Hey!
Go!!
You owe me, girl!
Hey! Hey!
Kynesha, what the hell was that?
Just a bunch of fools-- used to be my friends.
I told them you a doctor.
Ain't nothing else
on this radio?
I don't understand. You don't like the food?
The room service guy's seen all my pajamas.
So we'll just get up earlier.
Or we could sleep in at my place.
Dr. Kovac, paramedics are ten minutes out
with a ground-level fall, possible hip fracture.
Can you take him?
Yeah.
I guess you're having breakfast alone.
John, how'd it go last night?
With what?
Weaver. Did you tell her?
Right. Uh, I think I'm going to wait
until after my midyear performance evaluation.
When's that?
Some time today.
You're procrastinating.
You're nagging.
No, I'm being your sponsor.
Which is different than being my mother, don't you think?
Okay.
I've got Mr. Lambert in Curtain Three with fever and cough
Mr. Mohlsick in Exam One with frostbite.
Carter, you've got an evaluation at 11:00 in the lounge.
Yes, ma'am.
Don't be late.
No, ma'am.
So you want Mrs. Furtado in chairs?
She has vaginal bleeding.
Yeah, she had it last month, too.
It's called her period. What else you got?
Roger Pilarsky's back. He has abdominal pain.
Oh, no, again?
It's the cold snap. It's below 20.
I know. Where is he?
Exam Two.
Like a "bishop" bishop?
Yeah. I think he may have confirmed me.
Whoa...
I started a line and gave him four of morphine.
Sir, were you able
to get up after your fall?
He tried, but several of us had to help.
I can speak for myself.
Peripheral pulse is plus two.
I think you're supposed to call him "Your Excellency."
"Bishop" is fine.
All right, let's get him inside
and get him into a gown.
All right.
You have a rear window in stock?
Great, great...
All right, thanks.
That shower felt good!
Don't worry about the window.
I'll pay for it.
With what?
I don't know-- something.
You know what, Kynesha?
You need to learn how to start respecting people.
I respect you.
I called the halfway house.
They said you started a fight and then took off.
I hate that place.
The lady that runs it is a bitch.
Yeah, well, that's where you live now
so you better try to make it work.
Well, I'd rather live with you.
We've been over this.
You can't stay here indefinitely.
I could if you had your own place.
Be a lot easier.
What do you think you're doing?
Depends. What you want me to do?
Kynesha, you better...
Where she at-- at work?
Hey.
It's all good.
I'm too tired now, anyway.
Mr. Pilarsky, you haven't stopped taking
your Mellaril, have you?
No.
Okay, how long has your belly been bothering you?
A few days, but it's definitely gotten worse
since I've been here.
He's afibril. B.P.'s 180/70.
Blood pressure's a little high.
Are you upset, Mr. Pilarsky?
Depressed, mostly.
I haven't had intimate contact in 11 years.
It takes its toll after a while.
Well, why don't we take a look at your belly
and find out what the problem is.
Oh... Oh, for God's sake.
Connie?
( snaps finger )
Mr. Pilarsky, why do you do this to yourself?!
I'm an only child, you know.
Are those ours?
Yeah.
Start a line, draw a trauma panel
and set up the sonosite.
Never did get married.
You want a psych consult?
No.
Put my career first.
Let's clear him surgically first.
You want to catch a movie later?
You didn't get my message, I take it.
No. Did something change?
The meeting was canceled.
We took a conference call instead
and agreed on a settlement figure.
Does that mean we've accepted guilt?
It means the hospital's going to take it in the shorts
to the tune of $1.5 million.
But our insurance will pay that.
And so will we, with sky-high premiums.
It could easily have been much worse.
Don't make it out like we're getting off cheap.
She didn't pay a dime.
There was a general recall
on the endoscopic curettes that you used.
I don't remember having any trouble with the curette.
Nonetheless, there was a recall.
We also signed a confidentiality agreement
keeping the details of the suit private
so you can't speak to anyone about it.
But there was nothing faulty with the equipment.
Apparently there was.
And the manufacturer has deeper pockets.
( chuckling ): But that's wrong.
Look at it as a gift.
We pay out the nose and you get a little ding
at the National Data Bank.
How lucky is that?
...and then my parents went through this whole charismatic phase
but... but they're still pretty Catholic.
So what religion do they practice in your country?
This is my country, Dave.
Right. That's not what I meant.
That's smooth.
Excuse me.
I need...
Fill out your name and complaint...
No. I need a laxative.
Amira, why don't you get an emesis basin for Miss...
( gagging )
Never mind.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry...
Okay, why don't you just take a seat right over here?
My stomach hurts.
Thank you very much.
I just need to go to the bathroom and I can't.
Hold on. Do you want to tell me your name?
Anne.
Anne, I'm Dr. Carter.
Has anything like this ever happened to you before?
It started on the plane.
From where?
Texas.
You just flew in?
Did you eat anything unusual?
Airplane food.
Well, that could do it.
Why don't we get you in a room
and see if we can't find out what's going on with you.
Oh, my God! It's blood!
I'm going to need a little help over here!
Did you land on your side or on your back?
On my keister.
Several small children found it amusing.
We were quite worried.
Any tenderness here?
Not so much.
Joe, you're making me nervous.
Go get yourself a cup of coffee.
Please.
The last thing I need is an entourage.
Any physical conditions I should know about?
Osteoarthritis.
Runs in the family.
Are you currently on any medications?
Tylenol.
And the occasional glass of wine.
Where are you from?
You have an accent.
Croatia.
Ah.
Any numbness in this area?
No.
Do you have a primary care doctor I should notify?
( chuckling )
He's... playing golf in Arizona.
Okay.
Someone will take you to X ray.
Would you like anything for pain?
I have a high threshold.
Croatia is a very Catholic country.
Yes.
Are you Catholic?
No.
That's it-- that's all you're going to tell me?
She got into a fight at Creekside, took off
and went to hang out with some friends.
So this whole "I was attacked" was blown out of proportion?
A little.
Did you take her back to the halfway house?
Uh, not yet.
Then where did you take her?
Well, she-she needed to take a shower.
Uh... Cleo, it's just for the day.
That's what you said when she stayed three weeks.
I'll handle it.
Small Mallory-Weiss tear.
No active bleeding, though.
Temperature's higher-- 102.
Ooh... wait.
Foreign body obstructing the gastric outlet.
Okay, grasper.
Reminds me of one of those big claw things
they have at the arcade-- what do you call them?
"Big claw things."
Got it.
Okay, slowly extracting.
B.P.'s rising. 160/100.
Up...
Up...
And out.
Pulse is 140, B.P.'s high-- 240/100.
Is that a condom?
( sighing ): Probably cocaine.
Uh, must've leaked.
I need phentolamine and esmolol drips, 50 grams of charcoal
and four of Atavan, in case she seizes.
She's a drug mule.
Hey, Kerry, I just heard that Roger Pilarsky
was treated for a self-inflicted injury?
Yeah, with a pair of our suture scissors, no less.
You sent him home?
It was superficial, didn't breach the peritoneum.
Don't you think there should have been
a psych consult first?
He's a frequent flyer-- he has a new injury every week.
Could be part of an accelerating pattern.
Look, he's never had a serious suicide attempt.
Your department's refused to admit him
on three separate occasions.
He tried to harm himself.
We're supposed to be called.
All he wanted was food and company.
Frankly, I thought you'd be grateful.
Kerry, I...
I think that we should not let what happened between us
interfere with patient care.
What?
We're both professionals.
Excuse me.
I-I did what I thought was medically appropriate.
And it had nothing to do with the fact
that you've been avoiding me?
It doesn't, and I haven't
but if you'd like me to call you
every time someone the least bit disturbed
comes into the E.R.
you've got it.
Thank you.
Hey, where'd you really fly in from?
South America?
Belize.
Well, you're lucky it didn't pop at 35,000 feet.
You might have died.
Maybe that would have been better.
Hey, you mind, uh, telling me how you got into all this?
I was robbed.
They took everything--
my money and my passport, my clothes, even my shoes.
So you decided to smuggle drugs to get back?
I met this man.
He was very nice to me.
He said he would help.
All I had to do was stop here in the United States for him.
( sobs )
But you knew what he was asking you to do.
I just wanted to go home.
That's all.
I wanted to go home.
( crying )
That whole celibacy thing
was always the sticking point for me, though.
Yeah, me, too, but I got over it.
Yeah, well...
Hey, Dr. Kovac, did you know that St. Peter was married?
Anyway, I should get going.
It was nice talking to you, Bishop Stewart.
Same here.
You have a lot of degenerative changes
but no fracture.
There will be some bruising
but the worst of it should be over in a few days.
Yeah, I know the drill.
You fall a lot?
Damned arthritis makes me wobbly
especially when it's cold.
Ever use a walker?
Now, that would really cramp my style, don't you think?
Might save your hips.
The last time I had a flare-up
my doctor put me on this I.V.
Gave me some kind of steroid.
Solumedrol?
That's it.
That stuff worked wonders.
You realize it's a temporary fix?
I'll take whatever I can get.
Just so it gets me through the hard bits.
Okay.
I'll give you the solumedrol if you promise to use a walker.
What, are we negotiating?
Not really.
Do you want the steroids?
I'll use a cane.
Yosh.
125 milligrams of solumedrol
for the bishop
and order a cane from central supply.
You've got it.
What was your confirmation name?
Mihael.
After the patron saint of the sick.
How appropriate.
"On occasion, he has questioned the decision-making
of more senior physicians in critical care settings."
Yeah, I have a more detailed list, if you're interested.
Probably not.
Inter-personal skills
how you deal with patients and staff, all excellent.
In fact, it's hard to find fault with your work.
Really?
You've made a remarkable comeback
from a serious addiction
and I think I speak for everyone
when I say that we're proud of you.
Thank you.
Good. We're pretty jammed up out there
so unless there's anything else you want to talk about
just sign the bottom of the form.
Is there something you want to talk about?
Sorry, multi-victim trauma. We're going to need everybody.
Seven-year-old hit in the crosswalk
by a pickup doing at least 30.
Complains of chest pain and shortness of breath.
Tachy at 120. B.P. 90/60
Hi, honey, can you tell me your name?
Amy. Where's my mom?
Next ambulance.
Take a breath, Amy.
Does your tummy hurt?
No. Is my dad okay?
We'll find out as soon as we've finished taking care of you.
Let's go, we need a chest tube on the left.
Julie Hembree, 32 years old.
Chest and abdominal pain on the right.
I thought there were three patients.
Father was D.O.A. at the scene.
Systolic of 80 in the field.
Up to 100 after a liter.
Where's Amy? Where's my husband?
Ah!
Sorry, looks like it might be a rib fracture.
Okay, she needs an ultrasound.
Let's get surgery down here.
Mandy, can you push the cholecystectomy to next week for me?
Sure.
These are lovely.
Glad you think so, they're for you.
From Dr. Greene?
Yes.
( phone rings )
O.R.
Hold on.
Dr. Corday, they need you downstairs.
I'm on my way.
Should I put these in your office?
Please.
Mr. Patterson
what are you doing here?
Oh, I came to see you.
I'm afraid I've been called
to the Emergency Department.
Well, I'll ride down with you.
Okay.
Please allow me to say
that I feel terrible about what's happened.
Which part?
Me being crippled or you getting sued for malpractice?
My concern was for your situation, not mine.
Yeah, it doesn't really compare, does it?
Strange how it all comes down to faulty equipment.
My lawyer tells me I can't really blame you.
But I can't quite forgive you, either.
Imagine I'll always remember your face.
I wonder whether you'll remember mine.
TAKATA: Who gets the O-neg?
OLIGARIO: Start in Trauma One.
Dr. Corday! Weaver needs that in Two. Mr. Patterson.
They need you right away!
I'm really sorry.
Yeah, go, go.
I'm so sorry.
What is it, Connie?
Auto versus peds, mother and daughter.
Any critical?
The kid in Trauma One looks pretty bad.
Where's Benton? I don't know.
What have we got?
Blunt chest, hemopneumo on the left.
Did you scan the belly?
It seemed pretty benign.
CORDAY: Where's ultrasound?
Next door.
Why don't you just examine her first?
AMY: Where's my mom?
Why don't we take this collar off, Amy?
You'll feel a lot better.
KOVAC: Okay, one percent with epi.
Sats are down to 82.
Put her up to 15 liters.
Ten blade.
How's the abdomen?
CORDAY: Nontender, but I can't clear her until we have an imaging study.
Ow, that hurts!
Amy, it's okay.
Do you want to intubate?
No, let's wait for the chest tube.
Green zone on the Broselow.
Okay, curved Kelly.
I want my mom! CLEO: Slow breaths, Amy.
Slow, deep breaths.
Pressure's down to 60.
She's bleeding out.
CORDAY: We need to intubate now.
Let's premedicate with atropine.
Dr. Corday, Dr. Weaver needs you right now.
KOVAC: Okay, let's keep up with the blood loss.
Kerry, you need me?
Rebound and guarding in the right upper quadrant.
Looks like a surgical belly.
Please, how is she... my daughter?
I'm afraid there's some bleeding in the chest.
What does that mean? Is she okay?
She's stable for right now, but it is serious.
And what about my husband?
Is he here, too?
Oh, God, no.
Hey, we don't know anything for sure yet.
We've got a liver laceration.
You have some internal bleeding
from the abdominal injury.
We'll need to get you up to the O.R. right away
so that we can stop the bleeding.
Type specifics up. Squeeze in two units.
Carter, call the O.R., tell them we're on our way.
Connie, get her upstairs. Let's go.
Over a liter out on the left.
Get another two units of blood.
CLEO: Push the etomidate, we need to tube her.
No, wait. Just bag her for now.
Bring your patient in here.
I'm red-lining her to the O.R.
Luka, we're hardly maintaining pressure. What are you doing?
Her daughter should see her first.
Please, I want to see her.
This woman has a critical liver laceration.
How much blood do you have? Four units.
You'll be just fine.
CORDAY: Listen, her systolic's down to 80!
Okay, get two pressure bags for the blood.
CLEO: Push the etomidate, then the sux.
Amy?
It's Mommy.
You're going to be all right.
They're going to take me to surgery now
but I'll see you real soon, okay?
CLEO: She's out. Five-and-a-half tube.
Amy?
CORDAY: That's it, we're going, now!
CLEO: Crichoid pressure...
JULIE: Amy?
CLEO: Right there.
I'm in, bag her.
Okay, call X-ray for a portable chest.
Good breath sounds bilaterally.
Pulse ox is up to 92.
Set up a vent.
FI-02 100%
rate of 20.
KOVACS: Lost her pulse.
Starting compressions.
Charge the paddles to 100.
Get another eight units from the blood bank.
Keep pouring it in.
ABBY: Charged and ready.
Clear!
This the ex lap?
CORDAY: Yes, still a little shocky after five liters.
Did you give F.F.P.? Not yet.
What are you waiting for?
We were rather busy.
Any chance you'll be doing an atrial-caval shunt?
I won't know until I open her up.
It would help if I knew what you were planning.
Yes, well, when I decide, I'll tell you.
Shirley, I think Anspaugh's in the lounge.
Can you ask him to assist?
He's ready to go on a fem-pop in four.
Any other attendings around?
They're all scrubbed in. It's just you on this one.
Give another epi.
Sats are down to 70.
Two more liters out of the chest.
Okay, autotransfuse and hang another two.
She's losing it faster than we can give it.
KOVAC: Okay, holding compressions.
P.E.A., rate of 49.
Okay, set me up for a pericardiocentesis.
Take over here.
You think she's in tamponade?
KOVAC: It's her last chance.
We're treating P.E.A. Give me the alligator clip.
Watch for any injury current.
There, back off.
Anything in the pericardium?
Nothing.
Resume compressions.
What's this?
I called for a consult.
I'm admitting her.
Why?
Danger to self.
Does the pound of cocaine she swallowed figure into this?
It wasn't a pound, and we're not obligated
to report drug use to the authorities.
But I'd imagine in the case of drug smuggling, we'd make an exception.
She's not a dealer.
She's a kid. She made a stupid mistake
and she almost got herself killed.
Maybe, but she's not suicidal.
What's your problem, Kerry?
What?
She's 18 years old.
Could you excuse us, Dr. Carter?
Her going to prison isn't going to, uh, benefit anybody.
Excuse us.
Don't you ever talk to me like that
in front of a resident again.
I wouldn't have to if you didn't insist
on interfering with my admission.
She's an E.R. case.
Which I was called into.
I'm admitting her.
Agonal rhythm, rate of 29.
KOVAC: Has she had two doses of atropine?
CLEO: 15 minutes ago.
ABBY: What about thoracotomy?
KOVAC: No, she had a fatal injury.
Probably tore her aorta.
That's it.
Asystole.
Call it.
Time of death, 1:47 p.m.
( distant yelling )
HALEH: Paramedics just brought in another trauma.
We need a doctor in here.
( yelling continues )
I've got it.
MAN: Let me out of here.
I've got to, I've got to go!
Let me... out!
PICKMAN: Kevin Poole, 42 and very drunk.
Under police pursuit until he plowed into a concrete column.
Needed the jaws of life to pull him out.
Vitals stable. He's feeling no pain.
Okay, settle down!
Huh?
I'm Dr. Kovac.
We're going to examine your injuries.
I need you to stay calm.
What injuries...?
Ooh, lovely.
Why were the police chasing him?
Hit and run, took out a whole family in a crosswalk.
They come here or Mercy?
Here. POOLE: Let me out of here.
I've got to, I've got to go!
I've got to find my wallet.
We're going to put a tube in your nose.
You want me to numb him up first?
No, just hold his head still.
( yells )
Swallow, sir.
I can spray the back of his throat.
Just keep swallowing.
( yelling continues )
Hey.
What's good?
What's wrong? You ain't hungry?
Hi, Kynesha.
Who's she?
BENTON: This is Adele Neuman.
She's a social worker.
Nice meeting you.
I thought you called me down here
so I could be with you.
Kynesha, I'm trying to find you a permanent place to live.
I have a husband and wife in Riverside
who are both African-American
and they have two other foster children your age.
I thought you said you cared about me.
I said I care about what happens to you.
Yeah, right.
You're only doing all this 'cause of Jesse.
You think I don't know that?
That's not true.
And I know that bitch Cleo
don't like me!
Kynesha!
I knew that from jump street.
Kynesha, you are underage
without any means to provide for yourself.
Now, it's either foster care
or becoming a ward of the state.
Which would you prefer?
Fine. You don't want me, I'm gone.
Kynesha... Kynesha!
Just let me take it from here.
She's got a stage-three stellate fracture
into the deep parenchyma.
More suction, Shirley.
Canister's full.
Well, change it.
She's oozing all over the place.
How about platelets?
Already gave them.
Well, you need to correct her coagulopathy.
P.T. and bleeding time are normal.
It's your problem, not mine.
All right. Right.
I-I'm going to try and pack the liver and get out.
Okay, uh...
gel foam, penrose.
Come on.
( alarms sound )
B.P.'s dropping, 90/60.
Dr. Corday
you have to control the bleeding.
The injury is too extensive.
Maybe I can get caval control.
Um...
um... bovie, pickups.
I can't maintain her vitals unless you get hemostasis.
I know that!
She's lost another liter.
Two more going up on the infuser.
Call. Call for six more.
B.P.'s still dropping.
Heart rate up to 120.
There's too much blood in the field.
I can't isolate the vena cava.
She's bleeding out.
Get Romano.
I don't know if he's available.
I said get Romano! Get Benton! Get somebody!
Come on! More laps!
( groaning )
How's he doing?
Blood alcohol level is .35
but he's stable.
You're under arrest
for vehicular manslaughter, Mr. Poole.
What?
Morrison's pouch is dry.
Liver intact.
Three D.U.I.'s, revoked license
and the idiot still gets behind the wheel.
Let me out of here, damn it!
Sir, you have to hold still.
His spleen looks good.
( groaning )
She said stop.
All right, what have we got?
M.V.A. with a lot of ETOH.
No free-fluid?
Hemocrit is 42.
Excellent.
Sir, does it hurt here?
Who the hell are you?
Okay, how about here?
( yells )
All right, some periumbilical tenderness.
Okay, let's call radiology, order a C.T.
You think it's necessary?
Yeah, well, it's hard to assess them
when they're drunk like this.
I like to be sure.
Hi, it's Abby in the E.R.
Yeah, I can hold.
How'd it go?
The evaluation went very well.
And?
What?
Forget it.
Well, I didn't get a chance.
You interrupted with the big trauma.
Forget it.
Yeah, hello.
What's going on?
Sorry. Can you hold on?
With what?
With you and Carter.
Nothing.
You seemed like you were fighting.
We were.
I would tell you
but it's a privacy thing... his, not mine.
Oh.
Hi.
Yeah, Benton's on his way up with a blunt abdominal trauma.
This better be good.
Liver fracture with uncontrolled hemorrhage.
You called me out of a lunch
because you can't tie off a liver?
B.P.'s 80/40, pulse rate 120, ten units already in.
Shirley, set up the Argon beam.
I tried to get caval control, but I couldn't...
Did you try the Pringle maneuver?
You learned it in grade school
Dr. Corday.
Ligate with 4-O chromic
while I occlude the hepatic artery. Get out.
Argon's ready.
All right.
I'll coagulate the parenchymal surface.
You tie off the vessels.
Robert...
Not now, Lizzie. Get to work.
It would be best if you had another assistant.
Make yourself useful and sew.
Robert, I'm sorry, I can't stay.
I'll send in a surgical resident.
Where do you think you're going?!
I'm sorry.
Lizzie, get your ass over here now!
Damn it.
Mark?
Hey, Luka.
Need some help?
No, no, I'm fine, thank you.
So, what are you doing here?
Radiation therapy, every day for six weeks.
Elizabeth's giving me a ride back
but she's stuck in surgery.
Dr. Chen still out on leave?
Yeah.
You coming back to work soon?
Next week, I hope.
Wow, fast recovery, huh?
Yeah, speed of light.
I heard you were doing immune therapy.
As soon as the tumor vaccine's ready.
So, everything okay around here?
Okay as ever. Don't worry.
I don't, honest.
Life's too short, you know?
I know.
So, how are you, Luka?
The same.
Good to see you.
You, too.
Who? Where is he?
The bishop.
I think he went to Trauma One.
What for?
To give someone their last rites.
Stewart: Are you truly sorry for all your sins?
What happened?
He crashed during C.T.
There's a large intra-abdominal hemorrhage.
Yes!
There's stranding of the mesentery.
It's a slow leak from a small artery.
I can't hear you...
Blood bank is sending two units.
All right, have them crossmatch another six.
Pressure is 60.
...I absolve you of all your sins.
Put him in Trendelenburg.
He needs a central line.
Let's get an eight French
trauma kit. Let's move.
Okay, prep for a subclavian.
Sats down to 75.
He's not moving any air.
Bag him. I'll intubate.
You should leave.
Don't go!
Okay, one of Pavilon, 100 of Sux.
I need a sterile drape in here, people.
Come on. Let's move!
Hey. You taking off?
Yeah.
I know a guy playing in a blues club later
if you're interested.
No, I think I'm just going to go home.
Maybe tomorrow. He's going to be here all week.
Hey...
I need to talk to you about this Weaver thing.
Look, nothing really happened. I threw them up.
Carter...
I know I'm fine, you know I'm fine
Weaver thinks I'm fine
so why give her any reason not to?
I don't know.
Maybe you could take that up with your next sponsor.
What?
I don't want to be your sponsor anymore.
Whoa, where's that coming from?
I care about you, and I care about your recovery
but I can't keep saying the same things over and over
because it's hard enough for me to do it for myself.
You serious?
Yeah.
Fine. I'll get another sponsor.
Okay.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Dr. Finch, you lose your compass?
I'm here to see Julie Hembree.
Oh, one lucky lady.
A Pringle maneuver, courtesy of yours truly
kept her from bleeding out.
I thought Corday did the surgery.
Mmm, long story.
I'll tell you over cocoa sometime.
She's all yours.
Mrs. Hembree?
You were one of the doctors for my daughter.
Yes.
Is she all right?
Amy was hit in the chest at a very high speed.
I know. I was there.
She needed help breathing, so we intubated.
We gave her transfusions to treat the blood loss
but despite all that, her heart stopped beating.
No...
We used intravenous drugs and shocked her heart for an hour
but her injuries were too severe...
No...
and she died.
No!
I'm so sorry.
No!
Ma'am
with the type of injuries she had
and the massive blood loss...
No!
I'm sorry.
No! No!
Calm down. Just calm down.
I'm sorry.
I'm going to have you take Prednisone
for the next four days.
Bishop, our car is here.
Thank you.
I'll be right there.
What happened to Kevin Poole?
The drunk?
He died on the table.
At least he found absolution.
You don't believe that.
He ran down a family in the street.
The mother is upstairs in surgery.
I see.
And does that make him
any the less worthy of salvation?
He was more afraid than sorry.
Yes, but he found God in his final moments
and he asked for forgiveness.
So any fool can get into heaven if he is scared enough
to say he is sorry right before he dies?
Dr. Kovac, everyone deserves to be comforted
in their darkest hour.
Too bad you weren't there
to comfort the little girl he killed.
I didn't need to be.
God was there.
Was he?
You should arrange to see
your doctor this week
and use the cane for stability.
Okay...
Haleh, I am out of here.
Good night, Dr. Weaver.
Good night.
Hey, can I give you a hand with those?
Uh... thank you.
You going home?
Yeah, shortly.
Do you have a minute to talk?
Of course.
In there?
Okay.
Look, if you're concerned
about what happened, you don't need be.
I respect your judgment enough...
A couple of weeks ago
I took some Vicodin
out of a patient's prescription bottle
and I swallowed them
and then I went into the bathroom
and I stuck my finger down my throat.
Did you...
successfully expel them?
Yes.
( sighs )
I don't know why I did it.
I really don't.
I just found myself...
doing it.
Just thought you should know.
I appreciate you telling me.
I'll see you tomorrow, Carter.
What are you going to do?
Give it some thought.
Meanwhile, keep going to your meetings.
CORDAY: I can't believe you waited.
I thought you would have taken a cab.
Well, I thought you could use some company.
How is that?
Are you all right?
Yeah, you should've seen me an hour ago.
I could've danced a jig.
How did the meeting go?
Oh, uh...
Oh, we settled, rather cheaply...
... um, something to do with a recall.
Great.
Shall we go out and celebrate
get a bite to eat?
What, with you like this?
Or we could just, uh... go home, take a nap.
I don't feel like celebrating anyway.
You're off the hook.
It's okay to be happy.
I can't.
It was my fault, Mark.
Elizabeth, we're not saints.
We just try to get it right as often as we can.
I don't want to talk about it, okay?
Elizabeth...
Mark, please.
You know what I noticed?
What?
Amy's shoes.
They were brand-new.
When she woke up this morning, she had no idea.
Yeah, it's always harder when they're young.
Yeah, so what am I doing in pedes?
You're good at it.
You know what I want tonight?
Climb into a hot bath, get in bed
and be taken care of?
I won't hold you to the last part.
Aaaah...
( Benton chuckles )
Oh, my God.
Look what she did to my house.
Benton: It's okay.
I'll take care of it.
No, it is not okay!
Look at this!
I know.
I'll take care of it.
Hi.
Oh, hi.
I was about to leave, if you want the table.
Oh, no, actually
I called your office and they said you might be here.
I was hoping that we could talk.
I don't know, Kerry.
We've already talked a lot today.
Look, I know that it's been tense between us
and I really don't mean it to be.
I'm sure it'll pass.
Kim, I want you to know that I respect you as a colleague.
Today notwithstanding.
I miss you.
Well, that'll pass, too.
In a few weeks
we'll just be friendly coworkers all over again.
Yeah, I've been thinking, and I'm not sure that's what I want.
You have a good night, okay?
Kim, please.
I'd like you to stay.
Look, I know you might not want to hear this right now...
but I know it's been rough, with everything...
between us.
I'm not easy.
I haven't been there
for you...
not the way you've been there for me.
I've never worked
at being with someone.
I've never even wanted to.
But I want to with you.
I love you.
