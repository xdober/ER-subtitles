Previously on E.R.:
Mommy, will you love the baby if the father is black?
That's what I thought.
I'm sorry, Kerry, I misread that.
I'm so sorry if I gave you the wrong impression.
You can't be here.
They're going to kill me.
Come on, get in the car.
You're pregnant.
That's impossible.
What's the survival rate?
I'm afraid the tumor is inoperable.
I want to give him up for adoption
but I need your permission to do it.
Man ( over TV ): So the roads
will already be frozen.
What's going to occur...
I know they didn't plow my street.
First major snowfall, they always take three days
to get their act together.
Oh, God, it's freezing outside.
Hey, Dr. Weaver, any trouble getting in?
No, I didn't even bother with my car.
I just took the El.
Hey, John, what are you still doing here?
I thought you were off at 3:00.
Five-car pileup on the expressway.
How many did we get? Six out of eight.
Three went up to O.R., two to the SICU
and one's waiting on a monitored bed.
Spent the last four hours catching up.
How did our temp attending do?
Worthless.
Carter here had to keep the board running.
Thank you, Haleh.
What happened to the attending we had last week?
Got a job in the Bahamas.
I knew that guy was too smart for this place.
Where do you need me?
I think we're through the thick of it.
Those are the dispos.
I signed out the rest to Malucci.
Oh, will you give Mr. Phelps a Bactrim and discharge him?
Yeah. Thank you.
And I think I am out of here.
Hey, John.
I'm sorry that I put you on nights so soon
but with Mark gone, the schedule's a mess.
We all do our share of nights.
You heard from him? Mark?
No.
They got there Tuesday.
I didn't want to call.
I mean, if it's good news...
Yeah-- well, I will see you
at 4:00 this afternoon.
Make it 5:00, we'll cover for you.
Thanks.
( grunts )
( beeper beeping )
Anesthesiologist is on his way.
How long?
A couple of minutes.
Jing-Mei, I'm going to need you
to relax for a second, okay?
Okay.
Ugh.
Yeah, I know, I know.
Dilated to four centimeters
completely effaced
zero station.
Start the Pitocin at two per minute
and up it every 20 minutes.
( knocking )
Is it okay to come in?
Oh, John.
John, I'm so sorry to call you.
It's okay, it's okay.
I waited as long as I could.
I didn't want to wake you.
Don't worry, I'm not working.
Jing-Mei, I'm going to rupture
your membranes to help move you along a little, okay?
When did you go into labor?
Midnight.
Where? At home. I took a cab.
All done.
Oh.
You know, I thought I could do this myself
but I can't.
I can't.
Hey, it's okay.
You don't have to.
( crying )
Ooh.
Contraction? Uh-huh.
Okay.
Squeeze my hand.
Squeeze my hand.
There you go, you're doing great, Jing-Mei.
You're doing great.
We'll get the epidural working soon.
Have you taken any birthing classes?
Lamaze? Bradley?
Which one?
Lamaze?
Okay.
Take good, deep breaths.
In, in...
( screaming )
Peter.
Peter.
Yeah.
Listen.
What?
Voices.
It's Kynesha.
Talking to herself?
She's probably just watching TV.
Peter.
What?
You brought her here.
( groans )
Go.
Mmm.
( exhales )
Kynesha: No, you don't know.
This girl stay uptight.
Can't be too uptight
let you stay here by yourself.
Get mad every time I turn on a light.
Place this nice, she's worried about the electric bill.
Sure has straight teeth.
Who are you?
Uh, I was just looking at it.
Where's Kynesha?
Hey, Dr. Benton.
Kynesha, who's this?
This is Tiny.
Hey.
Tiny got locked out.
Her sister's ain't coming home till 7:00.
You went out?
No.
So, somebody else is wearing your boots, huh?
I went to check on my mom.
Tiny says she came back, was looking for me
was pretty messed up.
All right, um... you live in the building?
Yeah.
All right, grab your stuff
I'll take you home.
Kynesha, you better clean this up before Cleo comes down.
Okay?
There, you have your coffee.
Now, let's go.
Mark, I don't want to keep this man waiting.
He's jammed us into his schedule.
What is it?
The kid with the red hat.
What about him?
I saw another kid wearing that exact hat
three weeks ago.
I was buying groceries for Thanksgiving dinner
now I'm in New York, waiting for a miracle.
Well, maybe it's a sign.
Either that or the Grim Reaper wears a red hat.
I didn't come with you to hear talk like that.
I thought that was healthy.
Well, it's not.
I should just stick with denial?
I prefer guarded optimism
until Dr. Burke maps the brain
and gives us his opinion.
Yeah, then I can hear bad news twice.
If you really believed that
you'd have called Rachel by now.
Just call her up and tell her over the phone?
No, you could have flown out there for a day
but you didn't.
Why?
I have a feeling you're going to tell me.
Yes, because deep down, you really do believe
that this technology and this surgeon can help you
and you don't want to tell her
until you know you'll be all right.
Yeah, or I'm desperate.
You've seen enough patients in your time
overcome illnesses they shouldn't have
to understand the importance of a positive outlook.
Now, you have to believe it's possible.
I think I'm a little nervous.
Well, me, too.
Heart rate is 150 with type-one dips.
Is that a normal decel?
Yeah, it's good cardiac activity.
I thought you got high honors in O.B.
I did.
Nurse: Excuse me.
The adoptive parents are here.
Can I show them in?
Coburn: Yes.
Chen: No.
They said they arranged
to be present for the birth.
John, do you mind?
Yeah, I'll talk to them.
Hi.
Are you the adoptive parents?
Yes, James and Linda.
Hi.
You're the doctor?
I'm a friend of Deb's.
Who?
Jing-Mei.
I'm John Carter.
Is there a problem?
No, she's starting to push, baby's healthy.
Could be any minute now.
We should get in there.
Well...
she's feeling a little overwhelmed.
She said we could be present at the birth.
I know.
and she really needs to focus.
We jumped on a plane
and traveled all night from Portland to get here.
I understand.
You can have a seat right here.
Is she changing her mind?
About giving the baby up
for adoption?
No, I think she's a little embarrassed.
Just wants a little privacy.
Look, we really wanted
to be there for the birth of our son.
I'll bring him right out to you, I promise.
Hey, I heard Dr. Chen's having her baby upstairs.
Malucci, Exam One's been here since 9:00 with reflux esophagitis.
In a minute, Chief.
Do you want to send her flowers?
No.
I could start a pool.
No, leave her alone.
Why?
Randi, can you just drop it, please?
Hi, Kim.
Hi.
You have a cyclothymic down here?
Yeah, the guy in Exam Three
trying to set a new world record doing sit-ups.
Got it.
Hey, I tried to call you the other day.
( hiccups )
Oh, excuse me.
I'm sorry, my machine's been acting up.
I need to get a new one.
Oh, well, I wish I'd known that sooner.
I might have gotten you something different.
Merry Christmas.
Oh, wow.
Yeah, I happened across a copy
over the weekend and couldn't resist.
Hopefully, you don't already have one.
Well, thank you.
My pleasure.
Shall I open it now?
Or later. Okay.
( hiccups )
( giggles )
You know, you should try drinking water...
upside down-- it always helps with me.
Yeah, thank you.
See you.
Cleo: You said one night. It's been a week.
Look, I can't find her mother.
What do you want me to do?
Turn her over
to social services.
If her mother's been
on a drug spree for a month
she needs to be in foster care.
Cleo, Cleo, she's 15 years old.
She doesn't want to go in the system now.
Well, I'm not adopting her, are you?
No, of course not.
I hate the thought of her being in my house alone.
Now she's bringing friends over?
I'm sorry, that won't happen again.
Peter, she's manipulating you.
You know, I got a lead on another halfway house.
I-I'll make sure she gets into that one.
Two more days.
After that, she's out.
Cleo, I'm working on it.
Good.
Malik: Hey, L.F.T.s are back on room four--
Bilirubin's a little high.
Woman: I need help, please!
Help me, someone, help me, please!
Weaver: What happened?
Woman: A dog attacked my son.
He's bitten all over.
I can't stop the bleeding.
What's his name?
Oh, God, it looks worse.
Laceration through and through.
He cut his facial artery.
Ma'am, what's your son's name?
Jeff. He was crying, but now he's quiet.
Jeff.
( hiccuping ): I'm Dr. Weaver.
We need to secure his airway.
What's open?
Trauma One. Come on.
Get him on a monitor.
I need suction and a pedes intubation kit.
Draw up 40 of sux and five of versed.
Benton: Cut down tray.
Pulse ox is 86.
Ten liters blow by.
I need four-by-fours and merocel sponges.
Sats are dropping.
Get back, Peter, I need to intubate.
No, I think I can control this. What is it?
All right, now let me get some suction here.
Ma'am, I need some room.
We're going to have to ask you
to step back, please.
Damn it, if only I can tie off this bleeder.
Heart rate's up to 120, pulse ox is 82.
He's not getting enough oxygen-- we have to intubate.
What are you doing!? Why aren't you helping him?
Got it.
Ahh! Ahh!
All right, three, two, one.
Okay, okay, now one more should do it.
I don't want to use suction, all right?
I thought you said he was crowning.
He is-- just one more push.
Oh, oh... I can't.
Yes, you can, just one more push.
Come on, now, you're doing great.
Oh...
You're doing great.
Ahh!
Nine, eight, push!
( panting )
Seven, six...
Coburn: Okay, the head is out.
You can stop, stop pushing.
( moaning )
Is it over?
Coburn: Almost.
Carter: You're doing great, Deb.
You did great.
Coburn: It's a boy.
It's nice and healthy.
Want to hold him?
Carter: Want to hold him?
No.
Coburn: Are you sure?
Yes.
Coburn: Time of birth: 10:46 A.M.
I guess this is more than you bargained for.
You did all the work.
No, I mean having to see all this.
It was a blur.
Let's just say we're closer now.
Surprised you, huh?
Didn't tell you about the father.
Yeah, kind of.
Are those the adoptive parents?
Yeah, you didn't meet them?
Uh, yeah, about two months ago.
They still want to come in and see you.
What did they do when you gave them the baby?
They cried.
They seem nice to you?
Yeah, they seemed great.
Marsha: Here we are.
Any nausea?
Um, yeah, a little.
All right, we'll get you some ice chips
until it passes.
Hey, you know, you don't have to stick around.
I'm fine.
You have a night shift?
Later.
Okay, well, maybe you should go rest.
Crash in the on-call room.
We'll see.
All right, I'm going to change your pad.
Then we'll massage your uterus
to firm it up a bit.
Oh, you don't want to be around for that.
Not really.
You okay?
All right, I'm going to come back
and check on you later.
Okay.
Hey, John?
Yeah?
Thank you.
You're welcome.
The, uh, whole thing takes about an hour.
You'll be doing language tasks
as we map out the speech centers.
Is Dr. Burke meeting us?
He'll stop by at some point.
Usually you meet the surgeon
before he sends you off for a scan.
Burke's one of the best in the world.
He's busy.
Uh, take off your glasses, watch
wallet, pager, cell phone--
anything metal, anything magnetic, right in here.
Could you at least call Dr. Burke
and let him know we're here?
He likes to be notified when the renderings are up.
So as not to waste any time with the patients.
Elizabeth.
Don't forget the belt.
You'll have earphones, and we'll talk by intercom.
Well, can I stay for the scan, then?
I am a surgeon myself.
You can sit back there.
Now, for the first run, we'll ask you to name objects
you'll see projected on fiber optic goggles.
Do I get to shoot down any aliens?
Will he have scars?
The surgeons will do everything they can
to minimize them.
What are you doing here?
I am so sorry. I was worried.
He almost died, Mona.
But, he'll be all right?
You're putting that dog down.
He's a sweet dog usually.
What are you talking about?!
Okay, maybe this isn't the right time.
Jeff must have provoked him in some way.
Provoked him?! That animal mauled my son.
You're putting him down.
I want that animal destroyed.
Shelly...
You better leave it alone for now.
Boy: Mom.
Are they going to kill Winston?
I don't know, honey.
Why don't we find a place for you to sit down?
Here we go.
There's good hemostasis.
The repeat crit is 39.
Great, Peter. Thanks.
Yeah.
( sighing )
Hey.
You're not supposed to be in there.
What's your name?
Taylor.
Come on out here, Taylor.
I hurt my foot.
If you come out here, I can take a look at it.
I'm a doctor.
Okay.
Let's take a look.
Are you a patient here?
Let me see this.
Hey, you're supposed to be up in the blood bank.
You having a blood transfusion?
I don't like needles.
Yeah, well, none of us do,
but, sometimes we got to use them
to make you feel better.
I'm not sick.
Nicole is.
Who's Nicole?
She's my sister.
She has leukemia.
Ah. And you're donating bone marrow.
I did that when I was little.
Now they want to take all my blood
and wash it through a machine.
Mmm. Yeah, I see.
Every time
Nicole gets sick
I have to go to the hospital, too.
I'll tell you what.
You come with me.
I'll make your foot feel better.
You won't take my blood out?
No. Come on.
( groaning )
Where are my shoes?
Jing-Mei, I didn't mean to make you feel uncomfortable.
You should just think about it.
I have thought about it.
Carter: What's up?
John, I'm leaving.
Can you give me a ride home, please?
You can't leave until Dr. Coburn gets here.
I'll sign out A.M.A.
Just get the form.
We keep all post-partum mothers for 24 hours.
Well, I'm not a mother.
I suggested she see the baby.
John, can we leave, please?
They observe you for a reason, Deb.
I think you should sit down and relax.
Well, I'll come back for a blood test.
Don't run away from this, Jing-Mei.
It's better for the adoptive parents, better for you
if you meet your son, hold him, say good-bye.
I don't think I can.
Can what?
Say good-bye.
Man: The last run is word fluency.
For each object, name an action that goes with it.
If you see a dog, you might say, "bark."
Greene: Okey-dokey.
Man: Okay, here we go.
It grows.
Sweeps.
Live in it.
Writes.
Blossoms.
Hey, Marty.
Is this the frontal GBM?
Base line scans are up
but not the functional renderings.
Well, Burke's not going to want to cut this one out.
I'll take him.
For the carboplatin trial?
Yeah.
No, you had the parietal GBM for that one.
He's a good gamma knife candidate.
Come on, best you can offer is a 12-month survival.
We're seeing up to 14 with an inter-arterial protocol.
Yeah, and what an enjoyable two months it is. Hello.
Greene: Slithers.
Okay, I'll be right up.
S.V.C. syndrome in the unit.
We'll duke it out in tumor board.
Greene: Sticks you.
Page me when the renderings come up.
Man: Dr. Burke gets the first look.
No, he won't be interested.
Greene: Entomb.
Hang.
Man: All done.
I'll be right in.
How'd I do?
How'd I do?
You did brilliantly, Mark.
Can I go home after this?
We'll see.
Cleo, you have a call on two.
A girl named Kynesha.
Something about your car.
My car?
She was talking really fast.
Kynesha?
Just gone?
Did you see anybody?
I'll call the police.
Stay near the phone.
What happened?
Kynesha says my car is missing.
Didn't see anything.
( sighing )
Chicago Police Department, main number, please.
Romano: Always the diplomat, Peter.
What?
Dr. Duhlstrom just called me ranting.
Says you stole one of his leukocyte donors
and you won't give it back.
It was a little girl that I found scared
hiding under the stairs.
Finders keepers, is that it?
She cut her foot.
I told them to send her parents down.
If you hadn't hung up on Duhlstrom
you'd know that Dad is at the airport picking up Grandma
and Mom is a little busy
right now comforting her other daughter
who's puking her guts out
from chemo, so, do me a favor-- hurry it up
suture the foot, and ship her upstairs.
Has anyone even bothered to explain this procedure to this little girl?
They've done a few hundred of these.
Well, she's scared right now, and feeling a little used.
Oh, th-th-that's terrible.
You know, the sister's a little scared, too.
She's scared of dying.
And it's not like they're trying to take out a lung.
Well, she has point tenderness over the distal malleolus.
Okay, Peter, you want to play ER doc, that's fine.
I'll tell you what.
I'll tell the mother to abandon her child upstairs
come down, and calm this kid down
but if she is not strapped in for leukopheresis by 2:30
I'm strapping you in.
Linda: What did she say?
Okay, she said that she would see him
but she doesn't really want to.
Are you sure that you want to
force this on her?
We have three days until she has to sign the papers.
And if she doesn't see him, she might regret it
and... then change her mind about the whole adoption.
Okay, well, she's waiting.
All right
why don't you bring him in to her
and the Reeds and I will follow in a few minutes
so that Jing-Mei can hand the baby back to Linda.
Okay.
I got him.
Okay.
You ready?
( sobbing )
Oh, Carter.
He's so beautiful.
( crying )
( sniffling )
Hey.
I hope it's like a jury.
The longer they deliberate
the better chance I have of getting off.
They could still be waiting for Burke.
I'm starting to think that he doesn't exist.
Maybe he only meets people that he can help.
Mark...
I know, I know, positive, positive.
That MRI tech sure thought I was a goner.
He just runs the machine.
He can't offer a prognosis.
You know that those techs can read a scan
better than most surgeons.
No offense.
Do you want to get something to eat?
No. No, nope.
( sighs )
Can't believe they call it a tumor board.
Why? They discuss tumors.
I know, but...
you'd think they'd come up with something
a little more esoteric.
Like what?
I don't know.
You're-completely- boned board.
I heard they used to call it the-poor-bastard board
but too many people were showing up.
Someone told me that they tried
the take-me-out-back-and-shoot- me-now board for awhile.
It didn't stick?
No, surprisingly.
Why not?
Too many letters I guess.
Pity.
Elizabeth.
Mm-hmm.
Will you have the baby either way?
What?
If that man comes out of that room
and tells me he can't do anything
that there's no way I can beat it
will you still have the baby?
Yes.
I've got a 12-year-old in Four
that swallowed a pair of toenail clippers on a dare.
I think he's going to need to be scoped.
( hiccups ) Are you okay?
Hiccups.
I thought they went away.
They did.
Teaspoon of sugar is supposed to help.
It didn't.
Is Luka coming back on the 26th or the 27th?
26th, I think.
Where'd he go, Croatia?
Yeah, he went to visit his dad for Christmas.
Yo, my moms told me
if you stand on your head and swallow
hiccups, gone.
Thanks, Malik.
Hey, no problem. Works every time.
You paged me, Kerry?
Oh, yeah. I got a bad dog bite in Trauma Two.
Little kid who might need to be plugged in
for some outpatient therapy.
Sure.
Did you open it?
What? The present.
Oh, no. Not yet, no.
I'll go with you.
Okay. ( hiccups )
Do you want a shot of Reglan?
For what?
Hiccups.
No, they'll go away.
What about my toenail clippers?
Malucci. Get him.
Hey. Hey.
You're here early.
I was helping Chen with her baby.
Is there a problem?
No, she didn't have a coach.
You were her coach? Mm-hmm.
How'd you do?
I did fine.
She had a rough time of it.
Should I go up... No, she doesn't want any visitors.
I'll fill you in later, got to catch some Zs.
Dr. Carter. Dr. Carter.
They told me you were down here.
She's breast feeding.
She gave the baby back after seeing him
then we talked for awhile.
Then we went back to the nursery
the nurse comes in, says she wants to see him again
she wants to breast feed.
Slow down.
What?
The nurse has to give the baby back to her
if she asks for him.
So she did.
My wife is frantic. Okay.
I'll talk to her.
Is my dad coming?
I'm not sure.
( hiccups ): Your mom went to call him.
Is that a problem?
He's going to kill me.
I was going to put it back without him knowing.
Put what back?
Is Winston going to be okay?
The dog?
They're not going to put him to sleep, are they?
That would be very sad.
But any dog that would attack you for no reason...
( Weaver hiccups )
Excuse me.
I didn't mean to.
What?
I opened my Christmas present early.
I knew what it was.
A BB gun.
Did you shoot at the dog?
I was just trying it out.
Why would she need to breast feed?
It's not unusual.
Does she still have him?
She's changing her mind, I know it.
There's no need to panic.
Why did we have to force her to meet him?
Linda, she's giving up her child.
There's a maternal instinct she can't avoid
and shouldn't try to.
We'll give her some time
and have you rock the baby in front of her.
Won't that make it worse?
No. She needs to know at a very basic level
that the baby will be loved.
Can you talk with her?
Find out what's going on?
What she's thinking?
Yeah, I can try.
I can't lose another baby.
Deb?
What are you doing?
You know, they say breast feeding is good for them
in the first 24 hours.
It's mostly colostrum which boosts their immune system.
Deb, are you having second thoughts?
I've always had second thoughts.
What's changed?
I saw his face.
I'm being selfish.
I have the money to raise him.
There's no reason why I can't.
There's a couple out there
who desperately want to raise a child.
And you're giving them a great gift.
What happens 18 years from now
he shows up looking for an explanation?
Tell him the truth, you know.
Tell him that you wanted to provide
the best home possible for him.
Do I tell him I was a coward?
That my bigoted parents
were more important to me than he was?
Deb, I think you got to take your family out of this
and if you want to keep the baby, keep the baby.
But if you don't or you can't
then you want to make sure
that he goes to somebody who's going to love him
who's going to want him
and know that you're not abandoning your baby.
You're creating a family.
Benton: Did you find it?
Four blocks away with a burnt-out clutch and busted headlight.
You lucked out.
They could've completely stripped it.
Hello, Peter. My car wasn't stolen
by a thief who doesn't know how to drive a stick.
Kynesha and her friend took the car out for a joyride.
What are you talking about?
I gave Kynesha's friend a ride home myself.
Just Kynesha then.
Kynesha's the one that called you.
So she's not completely stupid.
Cleo... Get her in here now.
I want to talk to her.
Why don't we just...
Either get her in here or I'll have the police talk to her.
Cleo...
Excuse me.
Are you Dr. Benton?
Yeah.
I'm Melissa Walker. You found my daughter.
Oh, yeah, she's in Radiology.
We just wanted to get an X-ray of her foot.
Oh, God.
No, it's nothing serious.
She has three stitches.
Did she fight you?
She's afraid of hospitals.
Yeah.
You know, uh...
I think it might be more than just the needles.
The leukophersis
requires a big one in each arm for five hours.
Taylor feels the only reason you had her
was to help Nicole.
We love both of our daughters
and if you had a child who was dying of leukemia
and there was no bone marrow match, what would you do?
We were planning to have more children anyway.
But I am so tired of having to explain
to you people like we did something wrong.
I was just telling you that Taylor feels...
I know how Taylor feels. She's my daughter.
And I love her, okay? I love her.
Now where is X-ray?
Mrs. Walker...
Where is X-ray?
Down the main hall to the right.
Thank you.
Hi.
Hi.
What's his name?
Michael.
Michael Alexander.
Hey, Michael.
( baby cries )
It's okay. Shh, shh.
* Baby mine
* Don't you cry
* Baby mine, dry your eyes
* Rest your head close to my heart *
* Never will part
* Baby of mine.
What'd he say?
I may go to trial.
I thought you were going to be able to settle.
So did I.
Rachel called.
She wants to come out a day early for Christmas.
Mark Greene.
Dr. Burke. Nice to meet you.
You, too.
And you are?
Dr. Elizabeth Corday, Dr. Greene's fiancee.
Oh. Congratulations.
Thank you.
Sorry to keep you waiting.
I met some resistance in tumor board.
Is that good or bad?
The oncologists and radiation therapists
are having trouble embracing the future.
Meaning?
Come over here.
They see a lesion like yours
they jump to the conclusion it's inoperable.
But it's not?
Not in my hands.
There's your tumor.
Now, as you were doing verbal tasks
there was increased blood flow to language centers.
Those light up in orange.
As you can see
while the tumor's adjacent to Broca's
it hasn't invaded yet.
That's not what the neurosurgeon in Chicago said.
That's why you're here.
So you'll operate?
Mm. Yeah.
We'll do an awake craniotomy.
You'll be conscious and talking
while I map out Broca's and resect the tumor.
But the real bonus is my ability to insert
high dosage chemotherapy wafers into the tumor cavity
and use the malignant cells themselves
to create a cancer vaccine.
Thank God for second opinions.
Those idiots on the tumor board
are satisfied with 12-month survivals
where most of the patients on my protocol
are disease free for 24 months and counting.
So when can you fit him into the schedule?
( typing )
How about December 31?
You can ring in the New Year with a load off your mind.
Brain surgeon humor.
Right.
You okay?
Yeah. Sure.
It's good news.
It's very good news.
You came to the right place, Mark.
( beeping )
( pounding on door )
Dr. Carter.
Wake up, Dr. Carter.
Multi-victim MVA coming in.
Hells Angel versus a minivan.
What?
Motorcycle hit a minivan.
Let's go.
Pickman: 40ish-year-old male.
Closed head trauma. Altered at the scene.
No helmet?
You kidding?
This moron was driving a hog
in the middle of winter.
Malik: Whoa. Lost the IV.
Carter: Put another one in.
Cut the Gap Collection off. Get him on a monitor.
Uh, scissors can't cut through this.
Use wire cutters.
Pupils are
poorly reactive.
Check this out.
This ain't his first crash.
Ah, he's got brain fluid in the right ear.
Let's get him in line for a CT.
Malik: Oh, that's a nasty scar.
Dori: Mm. That probably
explains this.
Vicodin for pain, Hyzaar for high blood pressure
and Lipitor for cholesterol.
Yeah. I heard that Hells Angels are on the Pritikin diet.
Jarvik: Carter?
Weaver needs you. It wasn't a minivan.
It was a van van.
About a dozen kids got hurt on the way to a Christmas pageant.
Okay, I'll be right there.
Benton: I just... I don't want to...
Kynesha?
I'm sorry, Dr. Finch.
I didn't take your car
but I think Tiny did.
Your keys was missing, so I lied to you.
I was afraid you was going to kick me out.
I don't have nowhere to go.
Okay, Hank, can you press against my hand?
Is my mom all right?
Abby, have you seen this guy's mom?
Weaver has her.
Seat belt injury.
CBC and UA here.
Woman: Dr. Carter!
Yeah, what do you got?
I'll be right back, Hank.
Nine-year-old MVA head lac from broken glass.
No LOC. 150 of saline in the field.
Open-tib fib fracture on the right.
Hi, sweetheart, what's your name?
Elise.
Elise?
Yeah, does your neck hurt?
Yes.
Okay, let's go to Trauma Two.
What kind of costume is that?
Milk maid.
What? Milk maid.
Oh, yeah. You mean like the "Twelve Days of Christmas."
I'm missing our play.
What is this guy still doing in here?
Oh, CT just called for him.
They had a code on the table.
All right. Take her to Curtain Three
until this room's cleared out.
Come on, come on. CBC, C-spine
Right tib-fib, five of MS for the pain
and a gram of Ancef.
Don't worry, Elise.
Everything's going to be fine, sweetheart.
Oh... God.
Hold still.
You have to let me look.
It hurts! Ow...
I know, I know.
What do you got?
Three more minors from the van.
This is Eddie.
He probably cracked his collarbone.
Be right with you, Eddie.
Morales: Hey, Doc? Yeah.
Piper number one, seat belted.
No obvious trauma
but complains of belly pain.
Give these to Dori in Curtain Area Three.
Take him to Curtain Area Two.
Give me a set of vitals.
I already did.
BP 110/70, pulse 90.
What?
BP 110/70, pulse 90.
Whoa, whoa. Sorry.
Slow down. Are you all right?
Yeah.
Does it need stitches?
I don't know.
I have to get an X-ray and make sure
there's no broken glass in there.
Is my mom coming?
I need to talk to you.
Okay, just a sec. Now.
Is my mom coming?
Yeah. Somebody called her.
Here, can you hold this for me?
And press down, but don't make it hurt.
Lizzie, can you...?
What?
I took two Vicodin.
What?
I took two Vicodin.
I... then I panicked, and ran into the bathroom.
I stuck my fingers down my throat.
You vomited them up?
Mm...
How'd you sign them out?
I didn't. I didn't.
This biker comes in with a full bottle.
Okay, well, good, you didn't actually...
I don't even know what I was thinking.
I didn't want to take anything.
I didn't plan on taking anything.
I just saw them, and I...
It's okay. It's okay.
Are you going to tell Weaver?
I can't.
I think you have to.
Well, then, I'm done.
Oh... I mean, best case scenario
I-I'm back in Atlanta.
I mean, does it count?
It was never in my system.
All right, I'm off in ten minutes.
Let's go to a meeting.
I just started.
Well, you're sick.
You threw up.
Go tell Weaver you have to go home.
You got to be on death's door
before Weaver will...
Well, go convince her.
Corday: So, you'll tell Rachel and Jen now?
Yeah. I'll fly out there Friday.
You like it?
What?
Pizza.
Mm...
You know, it tastes just like it did
when I was eight years old.
It's weird how that works.
I wouldn't have been able to remember it
if I hadn't tasted it again.
It's good though.
You lived in New York?
Couple of months.
Dad taught me how to skate backwards on this rink.
You never told me that.
Well, you never came to see me play hockey.
No, that you lived here, I mean.
Well, I can't tell you everything.
I have to keep you interested.
( chuckles )
You didn't sign up for this though.
It's called marriage, Mark.
We're not married yet.
You really believe that?
Didn't think so.
Hey, check it out.
There's a kid in another one of those hats.
They must be on sale someplace.
Guess it blows your theory.
Yeah.
It was a good day.
Hey, Malucci.
I'll catch you later, Chief.
Yeah, Carter went home sick.
I need you to stay.
Oh, come on, Chief.
It's part of being a resident.
He's not sick, he's just tired.
He stayed up all day with Chen.
All the more reason for you to lend a hand.
I just need you for four more hours.
( hiccups )
These stupid hiccups.
Okay, I got an 85-year-old
with abdominal pain, headache and dizziness.
This sucks, man.
Yeah, it does.
( hiccups )
I saw the patient in Seven.
She agreed to a voluntary admission.
Thank you.
( coughs )
Mm, hiccups.
( sighs )
Does it work?
I don't know.
I'm desperate.
Now I'm listening to Randi.
Did you like it?
Yes.
First edition.
Must have been expensive.
Well, what's the point of working like a maniac
if you can't spend a little money on your friends?
Friends.
( hiccups )
Damn it.
I don't think we're in the same place on this.
On-on what, Christmas?
No. Us.
I don't need any more friends.
Oh.
Okay. Okay.
I understand.
Do you?
No. No, I like you, and I respect you
and I thought that we were really hitting it off.
Well, that's the problem.
You're straight, and I'm not
and I've done this before
and it didn't work out
and I am not going to do it again.
Yeah, but I'm not asking for that from you.
I mean, we're comfortable together.
We have a lot in common.
We have fun togeth...
That's why I can't be your friend, Kerry.
( phone rings )
You want me to get that?
Uh, yeah. Could you?
Room 914.
Yes.
Hold on.
It's your mother.
She's sleeping right now.
Can I take a message?
I don't know.
Okay.
She wants you to call her.
Would you put a "do not disturb" on the phone?
Sure.
Thank you.
