Previously on E.R.:
There's a couple out there
who desperately want to raise a child.
You turned me in?
There's a guy from the Medical Board here
questioning my competency.
I hope you don't mind me spending time with John.
Why would I?
Well, he told me.
Told you what?
About you and him.
I care about you.
I'm not interested in adopting a lifestyle.
I can't believe you just said that.
I love you.
I was hoping you'd give me the joy and honor
of being your husband.
Yes.
Damn it!
Oh! Elizabeth.
Six months ago, this wedding seemed like a good idea.
Look at me.
What the hell was I thinking?
You look beautiful.
Oh, please.
What could be more perfect
than marrying the man that you love
while carrying his child?
Yes, well, this love child also comes with an extra 40 pounds
and hemorrhoids.
There are some things I don't need to know.
Where's Mark?
Oh, why don't you sit down and have some tea?
So I can pee every two minutes instead of every ten?
Elizabeth, listen to me.
You need to stop.
Take a moment. Relax.
Enjoy your day.
You're being awfully nice to me.
It only makes me more nervous.
( phone rings )
I'll get it.
It is not raining.
No, no. A little mist.
I'm sure it'll blow over.
Have you seen my wallet? It's not in the car.
No.
Damn it. It must be in my locker at work.
Uh, everything will be fine, dear.
Well, let... let me get your father.
It's Rachel.
Hey, Rach.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Slow down.
What's wrong?
She missed her flight.
No.
I'm sure she can get another one.
But perhaps she shouldn't have left it until today.
Well, she was starring in her school play last night.
Well, that's why they invented understudies.
Mother.
All I said was that was... Don't.
Everything's okay.
She's, uh, switching airlines
and she's going to fly into Midway.
Give me time to grab my wallet
and then I can swing by and pick her up.
Hey, it's no big deal.
Why does it always have to get so complicated
just at the last minute?
Everything is going to go like clockwork.
In a few hours, we're going to be surrounded
by friends and people we love...
and your mother.
And the three of us...
are going to be married.
I thought you said you were covered. No.
Uh, you told me Malucci was covering for you.
I said he might cover my last few hours.
Well, is he or isn't he?
I don't know.
When will you find out?
When he gets here.
Oh, that's great. Malucci's reliable.
Peter, I have my dress in the locker.
If I'm ready when it's time to go, I'll go.
If not, you can go stag.
Hey, uh, does Malucci have a cell phone?
I don't know. Why?
Well, why don't we call him?
I'm not going to call him.
Three stable, waiting for bed.
Open radius fracture on call for the OR.
Gastroenteritis in Seven is being rehydrated.
What about the renal colic?
Discharged.
If you need to reach me, I'll be at my hotel.
Dr. Weaver, Connie on four.
Okay. Tell her she can speak with Dr. Kovac when she gets in.
Says she has a fever. Too late.
Her co-conspirators have used the last of the backup registries.
Co-conspirators?
The nurses are calling in sick to go to the wedding.
Says she has a temperature of 102.
Give me the phone.
( coughing ): Connie, I need you in here.
Somebody might want to take a look
at the guy in Curtain Three.
He accidentally used Ben-Gay instead of Preparation H.
How are you feeling?
Like a Snuffleupagus on Benadryl.
Go home. Take a nap before the wedding.
We're already down a few nurses.
Hey, we're slow. We'll float someone.
Come on. I saw you yesterday trying to change your shift.
I'm going to wait till she goes home.
She won't see you there.
She has to miss the wedding for a billing conference.
Luka, she wasn't invited.
Okay, okay, fine. Fine, go ahead.
But I want a note from a doctor
and if you show up in any of the wedding pictures, you're fired.
Oh.
Hey, Mark. Shouldn't you be...?
Oh, uh, forgot my wallet.
You going someplace?
Yeah, Reimbursement Strategies conference.
The one in Las Vegas?
Yeah. I missed it last year.
I thought it would be the best way
to put a dent in our deficit.
Uh-huh. Well... play a hand of blackjack for me.
Sure.
Hey, Mark.
I want you to know how happy I am for you and Elizabeth.
Thanks.
Dr. Greene, you're here.
Wow, that's devotion.
You never saw me.
Uh... okay. Got it.
Jing-Mei, that pilondial cyst in Three isn't going anywhere.
Hmm.
Uh, new rule.
Can you see that Mr. Tuttle gets a sandwich?
The unborn twin inside of his stomach is hungry.
Okay.
Uh, can you wait over there, please?
County Base, go ahead on Bravo One.
So, you taking the cheerleader?
What?
To the wedding.
Or are they carding?
Et tu, Deb?
You have to admit
she gives new meaning to the term "girlfriend."
And who are you taking?
I'm not. Someone has to stay here and hold down the fort.
Not invited?
Amira, find Luka now. What is it?
Prison van went over an embankment.
They want to know how many more we can take.
Three major, ten minor.
Tell them.
I should ask Luka.
Three major, ten minor.
Are you sure?
This is County Base.
We can take a total of three major, ten minor. Over.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold on. Whoa, whoa, wait.
That's my van.
You can't read?
I'm a doctor here.
Well, then you should know better.
Look, come on. I'm getting married today.
Give me a break.
Congratulations.
Let me get my tux out.
Dr. Greene, what are you doing?
He towed my van.
Aren't you supposed to be getting ready or something?
I just came in to grab my wallet and he tows my van.
You want to take my car?
This from the prison van?
Yeah, the driver. Blunt chest trauma.
Ah, damn it. What?
Uh, Rachel-- she's stuck in St. Louis.
I got to call her.
No seat belt.
Lost the pulse two minutes out.
Well?
You're getting married.
( sighing )
It's not exactly what I had in mind when I used to imagine it.
I still remember you running around the house
with one of your ballet tutus on your head
pretending it was a wedding veil.
Hmm.
If I'm not mistaken, weren't you going to marry
that little freckle-faced boy who lived down the street?
Tommy Bradshaw.
Oh. I wonder whatever happened to Tommy.
He was indicted for insurance fraud.
( laughing ): Oh! Well, there you are.
Things have already turned out better than you expected.
I wish your father could see you.
Yeah. Well, maybe he couldn't get another flight.
Oh, I'm sure he has some excuse.
He always does.
Mother.
You're right. I'm sorry.
I simply can't believe
that he wouldn't at least have made the effort.
Oh... now, don't start crying.
I'll be doing plenty of that for the both of us.
This is your day.
Your hair is perfect.
Your dress is wonderful.
This color looks fabulous on you.
Yeah, well, I didn't have much choice, did I?
Had I worn white
I'd have looked like I could sink the Titanic.
Only one thing missing.
What's that?
They belonged to your grandmother.
She wore them for her wedding, as did I.
Now I know you're not one for tradition
but if you were thinking of something old, something new
something borrowed...
They're beautiful.
Thank you.
It's okay. It's okay, honey.
Don't worry. We're going to make a video.
You can watch that.
...complains of neck and chest pain.
BP's 124/82, pulse 90.
Miss, are you short of breath?
Hurts when I inhale. Ow!
What is it?
My arm.
Pupils are equal and reactive.
Trauma panel, c-spine, portable chest.
Dip a urine. ( moaning )
Any pain back here?
A lot.
We're going to keep this on until we clear your X-ray.
What's wrong with my wrist?
Which one?
Left.
Can we take these cuffs off?
Not a chance.
Any O-neg in here? Two in the cooler.
My guy's in arrest.
She may have a wrist injury.
She probably did that herself.
She was in a major trauma.
I need to assess her.
GUARD: No way.
I could only get two units.
All right, normal saline wide open; hang the blood.
Amp of epi and 100 of lido.
Whoa. That's weird.
Yeah, badge must've impacted on the steering column.
Okay, clear.
He's got blunt chest trauma, no vitals.
Vasopressin. 40 I.V.
Hey, Doc? Yeah?
What should I tell his family?
Just tell them that we're doing everything that we can.
Charging again to 360.
And clear.
Got a rhythm.
Sinus at 50.
Get a pulse?
Nope.
Shot twice on the job
and now the weather kills him.
Okay, let's run the O-neg again.
I'm going to resume CPR.
He's PEA, Carter.
Yeah, so try another mig of atropine.
I hope you're joking.
Well, would you check again?
What is it?
Then I suggest you do that.
Yes, I'll hold.
Is it the limo?
Apparently they don't have your booking.
Like hell they don't. Give it to me.
You don't need to concern yourself.
I'll take care of it.
No, I'll do it.
I don't want you upsetting yourself.
I won't. Here.
Yes... Yes.
No, well, I booked this limousine months ago.
I gave you a deposit.
Yes, and when you cashed my check
you guaranteed me you'd be here to pick me up.
No.
No, I don't care if it's raining fire and brimstone
you are going to get me to that church
if I have to ride on your back like a bloody donkey.
Perhaps you should eat something.
I do not need to eat.
Nor do I need a spot of tea
or a moment's quiet reflection
on this, my special day.
This is America and sometimes in this country
you have to kick some ass.
We'll take your car and get there early.
Fine. Fine, okay.
But unless you can drive stick shift
on the right-hand side of the road
I am doing the driving.
Elizabeth, you can't possibly drive in your condition.
Get your purse, grab the flowers, and let's go.
( phone rings )
Now listen here, you ignorant bastard...
What's wrong?
Oh, Mark. Sorry.
Uh, nothing, nothing.
Um, where are you?
At the hospital.
Both the airports are closed
because of the storm
and the flights from St. Louis have been canceled.
Oh, no.
Rachel's pretty upset.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Well, what can you do?
Do you want to postpone?
No. Do you?
No. No, but if all the airports are closed
then other guests won't be able to make it either.
Well, if, uh... I mean, if you want to wait...
No, no. I don't want to wait.
Neither do I.
You sure?
Let's get married.
Okay.
I'll see you walking down the aisle then?
I'll be hard to miss.
I love you.
I love you, too.
Smart move.
What's that?
Not telling her about the tow truck.
Don't need to stress out brides any more than you have to.
Especially pregnant ones.
Need an umbrella?
You have one? Yeah.
You transporting them without backboards?
Medics cleared the necks on-site.
Was this a work detail?
No, busy court day.
I'll work for you, honey.
Hey, nice stethoscope.
Let's shut the pie-holes, ladies.
Yosh, can you put them somewhere?
This way.
Hey, we going to play doctor with you?
Not a chance.
What have you got?
Tammy Gabbard, 19, alert, oriented times three.
Complaining of belly pain and a scalp lac.
I need to call Joe.
Vitals?
BP 120/80.
Brief LOC.
Nice umbrella.
Hey, Mark, you still here?
Not anymore.
MAN: Don't bother.
Why? What happened?
Closed. Tree fell on the track near Cermak.
Shorted out the Red Line.
How long is it going to be down?
Hold on.
Let me on.
Wait for the next one, pal.
I-I got to get to my wedding.
That's original.
It's true. Why else would I be carrying this tux?
Look, they towed my car. The El is down.
Right.
Make room! Make room!
Dead man walking!
Thanks.
Second chest tube is in.
Back in V-fib.
All right, charge again. Clear.
C-spine. Type and cross times four.
360. Charge it again. Clear.
Where are you, Carter?
V-fib. Correcting volume loss.
Pulse ox is down to 75.
Did he ever have a rhythm?
PEA for five minutes, then he degenerated back into v-fib.
How long has he been down?
30 minutes.
No response to defibrillation times five.
Okay, call it. Take her.
Head injury and abdominal trauma. BP's dropping.
Charge again to 360. Here we go.
Clear.
Carter, now.
He may have a pericardial effusion or an aortic tear.
You're done, Carter.
He's a cop.
He's brain-dead.
Time of death: 1458.
Let me see the X-ray before you clear her c-spine.
Excuse me.
Another beer.
Shady.
Five down.
Oh.
Yes. Thank you.
Stuck on a layover?
No. My flight's delayed.
Mm, you mean canceled.
No, it still says delayed.
Ah. An optimist.
Where are you trying to get to?
Uh... Las Vegas.
Oh, so you're not an optimist.
It's a compulsion.
What do you play?
Uh, I'm going there on business.
Mm. And whatever the lady's drinking.
Oh, no, thank you.
We may be here for a while.
I'm fine. Thanks.
Well, either he's getting a very big tip or...
you're getting a free drink.
Excuse me.
BP's 90/75.
Has anybody called Joe?
We can't do that, Gabbard.
Who's Joe? My fiancé.
Meth-dealing lowlife.
She got nailed for holding his drugs.
He was set up.
Uh-huh. Ow!
We got some tenderness and some guarding
in the left upper quadrant.
Let's call for surgical consult and get a CT.
Dr. Carter, you got a dislocated shoulder
waiting in Curtain Three. She's in a lot of pain.
I'm off. Grab Chen.
Dr. Kovac asked for you
to take it before you left.
Okay, we're going to get an X-ray of your abdomen
and then another doctor's going to come and assess you.
Okay? Have Surgery see her.
I'll sign her out to Deb.
But you're calling Joe?
I will.
Carter.
IV and oral...
( sneezes )
contrast?
Yeah, check her B.U.N. and creatinine.
I thought you were going home.
We're still short a few nurses
and the storm isn't helping.
Your boyfriend didn't give you permission?
I haven't asked.
Well, you should. You're looking worse.
Excuse me while I complete my penance.
He's not doing that.
Oh, you don't think so?
John. Hi.
Hey. You look... great.
( sneezes ) Thanks.
Yeah, you do. Thank you.
Are you sick?
Um, it's just a cold.
You're not going to the wedding?
No. I don't think I'm going to be able to go.
Can you tell them...
can you tell them I'm sorry and congratulate them?
Yeah.
Are you ready?
Yeah, in a minute.
Uh, want to give me a hand for a second?
All right, sure.
Hi, Veronica, I'm Dr. Carter.
This is Rena.
She's helping out in the ER today.
Well-dressed candy striper.
Yeah. Ow.
Let's take a look at that shoulder, huh?
Okay, okay, okay.
We're not going to do that again.
Have you been given any pain medication yet?
Nurse said you could use a local.
I could, but local anesthesia
is not very effective with this type of injury.
Ahh...
I've been clean for a year.
Heroin.
Okay.
Well, maybe we can try a mild sedative like Valium.
No, man, the taste will bring me back.
I can't be using on the inside.
Ow.
Well, that was almost fun.
I thought I was past morning sickness.
Well, I offered to call a cab.
I've never seen it rain this hard.
Why brides get married in June.
I'll be breast-feeding a four-week-old in June.
( grunts )
Hello?
Perhaps we should've called ahead.
It's not a restaurant, Mother.
They are expecting us.
Then why are the doors locked?
Hello?
I'd recognize that bickering anywhere.
Daddy!
I didn't think you'd be here.
I wouldn't have missed this day for anything.
You look radiant.
Oh.
Belle.
It's been a while.
Yes, ten years I believe.
You popped by for Elizabeth's med school graduation.
I'm so happy you're both here.
I'd prefer it if I didn't have to separate you
so please be at least civil to each other until the reception.
Hopefully, I'll be drunk then.
No doubt.
Good behavior. I'm serious.
Of course.
Do I get to meet the groom before I hand you over?
Mark's not here?
Your umbrella is poking me.
Sorry.
Oh, for Pete's sake, leave it.
The damn things give you brain cancer.
Can somebody ask the driver what the problem is?
Excuse me. Coming through.
Hey, watch it.
Sorry. Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Why isn't the bus moving?
Engine seized.
So, we're broken down?
Another bus on the way.
When?
When it gets here.
Let me out.
Raining like hell out there.
I know. Thanks.
Let me out.
Lungs are fine. Neck is clear.
We can take off the collar.
I think I broke something in here.
I couldn't walk at all.
Hmm. Any pain in your abdomen?
Uh-huh.
GUARD: Yeah, she hurts everywhere.
Okay, tell me if this is tender.
Wait, lower.
Ow. Right there. Right there.
Send her for an AP pelvis.
I want to rule out a ramus fracture.
We're going to get an X-ray, Sara.
She's playing you, Doc.
You've had a C-section?
Yeah. So?
Any chance you're pregnant now?
No. I got fixed... after Diana.
Mm.
I got pictures.
But these cuffs... ow.
Save it, Morris.
I'm missing my visit with her right now.
I don't know when I'll see her next.
Why?
My sister's moving to L.A.
and there's no one else to take care of her.
She's seven.
I got four years mandatory
before I see her again.
You should've thought of that
before you broke parole.
I just wanted to see her today. That's all.
She's probably better off.
Shut up.
You shut up. Ow.
Just shut up.
Sara. Sara, I'm going to come back after the X-ray, okay?
( sobbing )
All right, just keep giving resistance
to the pressure I apply, okay?
Veronica, are you ready?
Do-do it.
Okay, here we go. Whoa.
No, no, no, no.
You've got to keep pulling.
Right. Okay. Sorry.
Okay? Here we go.
That's it. Just hold it right there, Rena.
She needs more sedation, Carter.
She's a former addict. Doesn't want any narcotics.
I gave her a local.
She needs more than that.
I offered; she refused.
Stop.
I almost got it.
Stop.
Abby.
She specifically asked me not to administer narcotics.
Give her ten of morphine.
No...
No. Keep going.
We need to relax you to pop your shoulder back into place.
I'm just trying to respect her wishes.
If we don't, you can end up with permanent nerve damage.
Okay. Okay.
Push the morphine, Abby.
Okay. You know what? I'm off the clock.
She's all yours. I'm out of here.
Let's go.
I had a dream last night
that I'd be in a car wreck, but I'd survive.
My grandmother was like that.
She could predict when her cat would get sick.
In the dream, I strangled a female doctor
with my bare hands.
Hey, Cleo. Is Malucci here yet?
No. We're done.
Someone'll be back to fit you for crutches.
Just... sit tight.
Maybe you should get dressed now.
That way as soon as he gets here, we can take off.
Peter, I'm thinking this might not happen.
Between the storm and how swamped we are
maybe you should go ahead without me.
Are you serious?
Yeah. Malucci only said he'd try.
He couldn't promise.
What? Oh, Cleo, come on.
I mean, that would've been nice to know.
Yeah, well, it would've been nice
if you'd have asked me to go in the first place.
What are you talking about? I did.
No, you RSVP'd and told me to save the date.
Cindy Purcelli?
All right, so what are you saying?
You don't want to go?
I don't have a compelling need
to attend your ex-girlfriend's wedding.
Cleo, come on. I mean, we dated.
It's no big deal. She's getting married.
Peter. All right, hey.
Listen, if you don't want to go
just, just say you don't want to go.
All right.
All right, what?
I don't want to go.
Fine.
Amira, I need a car.
What are you doing back?
A car. I need to borrow someone's car.
Peter, can I borrow your car?
I-I need to get to the church.
I'm on my way now.
Right. Uh, perfect. Can you take me?
Come on.
I'll just change in your car.
Where's Cleo?
Are people arriving?
A few.
Any sign of Mark?
He'll be here.
Where's Isabelle?
Oh, she went off looking for someone
to complain to about the temperature.
( chuckles )
So, I'm going to be a grandfather.
This won't affect my dating, will it?
One can only hope.
Yes, well, maybe I'll be better at it
a generation removed.
Parenting.
Listen, I didn't turn out that badly, did I?
That was luck.
You going to continue to practice...
after the baby's born?
Eventually.
What?
Nothing.
That's good.
I know what you're thinking.
For years I criticized you and Mummy
for all the time you spent working
and now I'm about to do the same.
I'm sure you'll strike a better balance.
You don't believe that.
Actually, I do.
BENTON: No answer?
GREENE: Just the church service schedule.
Elizabeth is going to be on the verge of a meltdown.
BENTON: Yeah, I bet.
Between the weather, and her mother
and her father, who I've yet to meet.
Oh, he's okay.
You know him?
Yeah, I met him.
That's right.
Why aren't we moving?
We should've taken the expressway.
You told me not to take the expressway.
I know, I know.
Is he a nice guy?
Who?
Elizabeth's dad.
Oh, uh, yeah, he seemed nice.
That's good...
'cause her mother can really be a piece of work.
Yeah.
What is it with women and their mothers?
I mean, I got along with my mom.
You?
She was the best.
Must be a chick thing.
And weddings really bring it out.
( sighs )
So, have you met Cleo's mom?
No.
Really?
I thought you guys were, uh...
you know, pretty serious.
What the hell is the problem?!
This isn't going to leave a scar, is it?
Not that you'd notice.
A nurse will be by to put on a dressing.
Hmm.
Jing-Mei, we've got a hypothermic ten-year-old
coming in.
E.T.A.?
Mmm, ten to 15.
Okay, set up some warm saline.
WOMAN: Close the exit!
MAN: Stop!
Morris! Morris!
Now, Morris!
WOMAN: Get some cuffs on her.
Leave me alone! Let me go!
CHEN: What happened?
Jumped off the table and took off running.
She bit me.
The bitch bit me.
You're hurting her! Stop!
I have to see my daughter. Please.
Where are those cuffs?
Stop. Damn it.
( crying ): I'm missing my daughter. No...
MAN: Come on.
Please! I have to see my daughter!
I have to see her!
MAN: How was that wine?
Oh, it was very nice, thanks.
I'm getting a refill. You want one?
No, I really shouldn't.
Oh, come on... You're not driving.
You're tenacious.
Is that a yes?
Okay.
Only if I buy this round.
Even better.
Uh, excuse me. Two more, please.
May I?
Sure.
I'm Mike. Hi, Mike. I'm Kerry.
You working on your novel?
Uh, no.
No, I was just writing a letter to a friend.
E-mail or actual letter writing?
An actual letter.
Lost art.
The last letter I wrote was to Marcia Brady.
Did she write you back?
Nope.
I never really got over it.
Oh, I'm sorry.
So, what do you do when you're not writing letters?
Uh, I'm, uh, I'm a doctor.
Really?
Yeah... Emergency Medicine.
Brains, too.
That's impressive.
Thanks.
Damn it!
What? It's dead.
I dropped it and it must have-- Ahhhh...
All right, calm down.
There's nothing you can do.
I'm missing it.
No, you're not.
It... it started, Peter.
Obviously, it hasn't.
I am screwed.
She'll wait, Mark.
Mark, what are you doing?
Mark!
Hey! Hey!
I'm trying to see what the hang up is.
Mark, get down!
I think I see lights.
Maybe cops... maybe a rig.
Mark, get down now!
Come on, man, get down.
This is ice.
Rain is freezing everything.
Any idea how long he's been down?
Groundskeeper found him down in the soccer field.
No I.D. Guess he was at the game that got rained out.
Where's the rest of his team?
Or his parents?
BP is 70 palp.
Core temp is 86.
Pupils are slow, but reactive.
Set up for re-warming.
Start a second line of warm saline and put in a Foley.
Yeah, he's about 80 pounds, soaking wet.
I'll be right there.
Yeah, let's, uh, get him out of these wet clothes.
She just wants to see you.
Is that so hard?
Yeah, I know it's been a long time.
How many years
has she served for you?
Hello?
Jerk.
Who's a jerk?
Nobody.
You feeling any better?
No.
Why don't you go lie down in the lounge?
I'll take you home when I'm done.
Okay. I just have to finish this first.
Are you mad at me?
Me? No.
You were a little hard on Carter.
He wasn't listening to me.
He's a good doctor.
And, uh, he's been here for a long time.
And I'm his Attending.
I know.
It's just...
he's my friend.
So?
CARTER: I don't know.
He's a nice enough guy
but he's got to let me do my job.
Isn't he your supervisor?
Technically.
So, this has nothing to do
with him dating your ex-girlfriend?
No.
No, actually, Abby and I never really went out.
You said you did.
Yeah, I made that up.
Why would you make that up?
I'll explain it to you later?
So, you'd like to go out with her?
Uh, I-- hey, Dave.
Hey, Carter. Nice weather, huh?
Do you know Rena?
How you doing? Fine, thanks.
I didn't think you were coming.
Um, I called Cleo.
She didn't need me to cover
and a couple of girls from Uncle Sal's party like weddings...
Did you RSVP for them?
I figure with the rain
there's bound to be a couple of no-shows.
And a few extra butts in the pews couldn't hurt.
You know where I could dump this?
Uh... they'll probably have a gift table at the reception.
I'm supposed to lug this around?
It's heavy.
You didn't buy them a crock pot?
No. We got them something off the registry.
Yeah, I'm not into that.
"Here's a list of things to buy me."
It's a little dicky.
Good evening, gentlemen.
What? Didn't think I'd be invited?
So, where's the bride?
Uh, she's in waiting.
Dr. Greene hasn't shown yet.
Really?
Well, if he's smart
he's halfway to Mexico by now.
MAN: ...kept ramming me over and over, completely out of control.
WOMAN: How much control do you have over your zipper, Kevin?
Look at this.
You can take your precious midlife crisis car
and shove it up your ass
along with your midlife crisis slut.
You could've killed me.
COP: Let's everybody settle down.
I want a divorce.
How long before you clear up the streets?
Sir, will you step off to the side, please?
I'm getting married in 15 minutes.
Get back to your car.
Nothing's moving.
We're waiting for a tow truck.
Hey, I'm a doctor at County General.
What's the chance of one of you guys giving me a lift?
You're joking, right?
I heard he's awake.
What are his vitals?
BP's 100/70.
Temp's 97.
Good.
Hey.
Hi. I'm Dr. Chen.
You're in a hospital.
You were very cold
so we had to warm you up through your tummy.
It might hurt for awhile
but you're going to be okay.
Can you tell me your name?
Bryan.
Cooley.
Bryan, do you remember what happened?
I was waiting.
I think I fell asleep on the field.
What were you waiting for?
They were supposed to pick me up.
Who?
Your teammates?
My parents.
They forgot.
Well, there's a pretty bad storm outside.
Maybe they were just running late.
No.
They work a lot.
Sometimes they forget.
Doris...
Dr. Greene, what are you doing here?
I'm stuck.
Can you give me a ride to Northbrook?
Oh, that's outside my catchment area.
I'm trying to get to my wedding.
When?
Now!
Oh, okay, if you help me clear the scene.
Sure. Let's hurry.
Screwing your dental hygienist was an accident?
MAN: You're crazy.
Yeah, I am crazy.
Staying home, having your baby.
Sir, we need to check you over.
I'm fine. Let her check your vital signs.
Let him bleed.
If everything's okay you can take yourself to the hospital.
Who are you? I'm a doctor.
Did you hit your head?
What do you think?
Mark, what are you doing?
I'm going to catch a ride with Doris once we clear these two.
No, I got it. Go wait in the car.
No, check her out.
Ma'am, I'm a doctor.
Are you in any pain?
Where is the little whore?
Getting more ass fat put in her lips?
Yeah, she didn't slam her car into anybody
you psychotic bitch.
Hold still; we need to check your head.
He doesn't think with that head-- ahh.
Ma'am, are you all right?
Okay, come on, come on, come on.
Oh, my God. What is it?
I think my water broke.
When are you due?
Tuesday.
Is this your first baby?
How long was your first labor?
Oh, boy.
What is it?
Oh, the baby's doing somersaults.
Oh... sit down.
What's wrong?
Your grandchild is getting restless.
He's not the only one.
Have we heard anything from the groom?
I'm sure he'll be here momentarily.
We'll let you know.
Make yourself useful, Charles.
Get us a glass of water.
I hope Mark didn't get cold feet.
Oh... no.
Surely he'd have called if there was a problem.
Yes, well, he's not answering his cell phone.
He probably left it at work with his wallet.
Men get just as nervous as women
on their wedding day.
Right, Charles?
Well, to be honest, I was never more... more anxious.
Practically forgot it was our wedding day.
In retrospect that could've been wishful thinking.
In hindsight, it would've saved me several years of grief.
Stop it, please, the two of you, just for one day.
We were teasing.
Well, don't.
It's not funny.
Oh, he'll be here, Elizabeth.
Don't fret.
But I do fret.
Every time he's late, I fret.
Every time he slurs a word
or-or gets tired, or bumps his head, I fret.
I'm about to get married
and I'm afraid.
Not of being with him, but of being without him.
I'm afraid he won't be around to raise this child.
CHARLES: But you told me the last M.R.I.
showed no recurrence.
These new therapies offer a long survival.
We don't know that for sure, do we?
Oh, darling...
don't start crying now
or we'll never get through the ceremony.
Say something, Charles.
You're going to have a wonderful life together.
Your mother and I love you very much, Elizabeth
and we will always be there for you.
You know that.
Breathe! Just relax!
Blow through the pain.
I have to bring her in.
If you come with us I'll give you a ride.
I can't go back to County.
I'm better off riding with Peter.
I have the lights and sirens.
Right. Go, go. Good luck.
Thanks.
Brenna? Don't talk to me.
I-I want to come with her.
We're full. Keep him away.
She's my wife.
Radio County, have them call the church
and tell Elizabeth where I am.
Brenna. Go away.
( groans )
Let's go.
He was found unconscious on a soccer field.
I thought his mother was picking him up.
He was hypothermic, but we managed to bring
his body temperature back to normal.
So, he'll be all right?
We'd like to keep him overnight for observation.
He thinks you forgot about him.
I guess we did.
It's just...
it's been a real bad few months.
Mr. Cooley
Bryan almost died.
He understands you both are very busy
and you work a lot...
His mother and I are going through a divorce.
We haven't told him yet.
That doesn't mean you can forget about him.
Dr. Chen
we've got a mother in active labor following an MVA.
When? Just rolled in.
Excuse me. Is she full term?
Mm-hmm. Contractions every eight minutes according to Dr. Greene.
Who?
32-year-old G-2, P-1, fetal heart tones 140.
BP's 120/80.
I have to push. No, no, Brenna.
You got to wait until we get upstairs.
I can't hold it. Yes, you can.
What happened to you? Oh, nothing. I'm fine.
Mark! We'll take it from here. Go to your wedding.
I need my gurney. Take it later. Go.
ABBY: Good luck, Dr. Greene.
You know, I need a shirt.
ABBY: Luka, give him yours.
What? Give him your shirt.
( knocking )
Is this a private party?
Uh, Mummy, Daddy, I think you know Dr. Romano.
Yes. I believe you were operating on a dog
last time we met.
That's right-- you were in town
attending an astrology conference.
Astronomy.
Well, anyway, I don't want to break up this love fest.
Your guests are getting ready to eat each other out there.
Now, I have 50 bucks Greene'll be a no-show.
Robert... But unfortunately
we just heard from the E.R., and it seems
that your ex-boyfriend and your future hubby have decided
to play paramedic on the way to the church. He's with Peter?
Not anymore. Greene is still out there
saving some pregnant woman or something.
What? Suffice it to say
if you give him a few more minutes
I'm going to lose that bet.
Oh, uh...
You look beautiful, Elizabeth.
Thank you, Robert.
Greene's a lucky man.
I know.
I always wanted to move to Florida.
Just get away from the ice and snow.
Why didn't you?
I don't know, it just never worked out.
I know what you mean.
By this time, I always thought
that I'd be married with two kids and a dog.
Well, you can always get the dog.
( laughing ): That's true enough.
How about you?
You don't live with, like
50 cats or anything?
( laughing ): No.
I didn't think so.
You're too pretty to be one of those crazy cat ladies.
MAN ( over P.A. ): Flight 14.
I guess you were right--
some of those flights were just delayed.
That one's mine.
Maybe when we're both in town again, we could have dinner?
Since we've already had drinks.
Uh... I'm not so sure that that would work out.
Oh, uh... okay.
Well, thanks for the drink.
And thanks for the company. Really.
Um, if you ever change your mind
or you find yourself stranded in an airport...
Enjoy Las Vegas, Kerry.
Thanks.
( groans )
My last jailbird had an ingrown hair on her groin.
How lucky is that? Hey.
What happened to you? Has anyone seen Dr. Finch?
I think she's in the lounge. Oh, great.
Whoa.
Peter, what are you doing here?
There was an accident.
Wh-Where are you going?
On my way to meet you at the reception.
Oh, really?
Yeah. Do you think it's too late?
No, no, no, I don't think it's too late.
Good. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What makes you think I still want to?
Because you like to dance with me.
Oh, I do, do I? Yeah. Let's go.
You know you're looking good, right?
Thanks. You look wet.
You mind if we stop at my place so I can change?
We'll take my car. Okay. Give me the keys.
You're not driving. Of course I am.
Why does a guy automatically think he has to drive?
Hi. Linda?
Yeah, hi. This is Jing Mei Chen.
No, no, everything's fine.
Um, it's just, uh
I thought I'd call and, um... I got your card.
Oh, yeah.
He's beautiful.
Is that him?
He's laughing already?
( laughing ): Oh... wow.
Hmm. Really?
Thanks.
Your jacket.
Your jacket! Oh.
Good luck.
( applause and whistling )
Are you Mark?
Yes.
Glad you could make it.
Sorry.
( music playing )
Good luck.
Nice of you to show up.
It was raining.
Dearly beloved, we have come together in the presence of God
to witness and bless the joining together
of this man and this woman in holy matrimony.
