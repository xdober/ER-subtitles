Previously on E.R.:
You can't throw me out. I'm your mother.
I'll keep taking my medication.
I won't be a burden.
Oh, we got some leaking fluid.
It's just irrigation solution.
It's ten to 6:00.
I know.
I thought procedure had gone smoothly.
It was a success if your desired outcome was paralysis.
Oh, my God...
I'm being sued for malpractice.
Get out! I don't want you here.
You stay away from my son!
Greene: What's my prognosis?
You need to talk to a neurosurgeon right away.
( knocking on door )
Hold on.
( knocking continues )
All right!
Coming.
Sorry. Did I wake you?
Uh, yeah, kind of.
Dr. Kovac ordered breakfast.
( clears throat )
Oh... I'm sorry.
Have a good day.
You, too.
Sorry. I told him to leave it outside.
That's okay.
I had to get up.
Have some if you want.
No, thanks.
You want to take a shower?
I'm almost done.
No. I have to stop home.
Working today?
Yeah.
Are you?
No.
Okay.
See you later then.
( sewing machine buzzing )
Morning.
Morning.
How was your night?
What's all this?
I borrowed a sewing machine from Marge.
Who's Marge?
Marge is your neighbor in 2A.
An adorable woman.
I'll introduce you to her.
Divorced.
Coffee's fresh.
Thanks.
Have you been up all night?
No. I got up early just to finish this.
I have a big interview today.
Where did you get all that fabric?
Sale at the yardage store.
A big sale, and then I talked him into
a bit more of a discount.
Honey, I'm sorry.
I used the money you gave me for bus fare.
I know it wasn't my money.
I will pay you back just as soon as I get this job.
It's a fabulous place. Fabulous.
Very high-end. Big commissions.
I'll buy us all new furniture.
There. Finished.
Tell me what you think.
you know, the skirt and everything.
I shortened the jacket, I changed...
You don't like it.
No, I do.
Do you?
Oh, you know what I got you?!
Something great-- knit jersey fabric.
I love jersey.
Where is it?
I'm going to make you something.
Make that Euro-doctor stand up and take notice.
Euro-doctor?
I've been here long enough to know what's happening.
As far as I'm concerned, he's very handsome
but too old to be playing hard to get.
Well, I thought I had him.
You do. You just don't know you do.
When you're not looking, he stares at you all the time.
( fabric rustling )
Uh! Here it is.
Come here.
Come here, come here, come here.
We're going to make one of those wraparound dresses
with the plunging neckline.
There we go.
He stares at me?
All the time.
I'm going to take some measurements...
Oh, no. I have to jump in the shower.
I have to work this morning.
Uh, honey, my interview isn't until noon.
Maybe we could have breakfast.
Okay. If there's time.
Well, hurry up.
( cabinet creaks open )
( pills rattling )
Honey, have you got any...?
What are you doing?
Counting your pills.
Why? Just checking.
I told you I'd take them.
I know.
Did I pass inspection?
You taking any Prozac?
I'm normal. I'm normal.
I'm a little nervous about this interview...
Prozac, Zoloft, Effexor?
I gave them all to you. Did you get more?
How would I get more? Mom.
I told you; I promised you.
You don't believe me?
Can you do me a favor?
Anything.
Come to the hospital with me.
What for?
A blood test.
A blood test?
Yes.
Would you do that for me?
Sure. Sure. I'd do anything for you.
Corday: There was no epidural.
I was the only one remotely close to the dura.
Answer the questions honestly; you'll do fine.
I had to have punctured it.
It's a known risk.
It does not constitute negligence.
Mark, missing a leak does.
I don't even remember looking
before I removed the endoscope.
You've done a hundred of these; you know the procedure.
There was a bad outcome.
They're looking for someone to blame.
It doesn't mean you did anything wrong.
Do you want me to ride with you there?
No. Go to work.
Are you sure? Mm-hmm.
Hey, don't go jogging into any more street signs.
Hard as a rock.
Apparently not.
How long do these depositions usually last?
Call me if it goes past midnight.
What?!
I'm just kidding.
I hate to go on an interview
with a big Band-Aid on my arm.
What will they think?
You have a suit jacket.
Yeah. Yeah.
I hope I don't have to take it off
if the room gets warm or something.
Tell them you gave blood.
Yeah.
I don't want to be late, though.
Rule number one is do not be late for an interview.
This will just take a minute, I promise.
I'd like to leave early.
What if I go there and then come back
and then if you still want to do this? Hold still.
I just don't understand, Abby.
I mean, you've let me in your home.
We're getting along so well.
This is an absolute gift.
I mean, what will taking my blood accomplish?
Nothing... Wait, wait. Stop, stop, stop.
Listen to me, honey. Listen.
When this test comes back negative or positive
or whatever it's supposed to be
then you're going to feel foolish
and I'm going to be hurt
and then you're going to feel bad.
You can't touch the vein after I've cleaned it.
That can't be what you want. It's not.
Then, honey, let's just not do this.
Need some help in here?
No, we're fine.
Hi, Dave.
Hey. Hello, Miss Lockhart.
Oh, it's Wyczenski.
Right. Right. Are you not feeling well?
No. Why, do I look sick?
No. No.
Actually, you look great.
Oh. Thank you.
You look good, too.
Well, thank you.
Uh, what's the draw for?
I'm giving blood.
What?
That's what you told me to say.
Just go. Go ahead.
What?
Just go, I don't want you to be late. Go ahead.
Really? Yes.
Yes. Honestly?
Sweetie, I love you.
Okay. Thank you.
Bye, Dave.
It's good to see you, Miss W.
Miss W. Oh, I like that, Miss W.
I'll call you.
Let you know how it goes.
( kissing sounds ) Bye.
Must be nice having such good genes.
Knowing that you're going to grow up looking like that, huh?
You got a...
Is this about a patient?
No.
Bye, Randi. Hi, Maggie.
Oh! Love that top.
Oh, thanks.
He's supposed to be working.
Abby, have you seen Dr. Malucci?
He's around here somewhere.
Just tell him Stephanie stopped by.
Your last name?
He knows my last name.
Uh-huh.
I don't get it.
He had some other girl in here looking for him yesterday.
You fire enough shots, eventually you're going to hit something.
Or catch something.
Yeah, don't knock it till you try it.
What?
Abby! Abby!
A girl out here needs help!
She's bleeding!
Some kids, they just threw her from a car!
Honey? Honey, Here you are, take this.
What happened?
They hardly stopped the car.
I'm okay.
No, you're not okay. Mom, step back.
Okay, let's sit down. Come on. Careful.
Okay, okay. Oh, God.
What's your name?
Kynesha.
Okay, Kynesha, lean back. Let me take a look.
Did someone beat you up?
I'm fine.
Nonsense. Who did this to you?
Mom, go to your interview.
Any tenderness?
I'm trying to help.
What about consciousness?
Did you have a loss of consciousness?
I don't know... Aah.
Get a gurney
and page X Ray.
Abby?
Yeah.
Mr. Resnick called from the garage.
He's on his way up now.
Thank you.
We'll wait another five minutes and then we'll leave.
I can stay. I've taken the whole day off.
We shouldn't have to play these kinds of game.
Gordy, good to see you.
Bruce. Sorry to keep you waiting.
There was a pileup on the expressway.
A real mess. I'm sure.
You must be Dr. Corday.
Yes. Bruce Resnick.
A pleasure to meet you. And you.
They didn't tell me you were so stunning.
That's okay. You don't have to respond.
Is the court reporter set up, Fran?
In the library.
Let's get going.
After you.
Hey, Irene, how are you this morning?
Fine, Mr. Resnick. Yourself?
Can't complain.
Please, have a seat.
Ignore the camera.
Thank you.
Everyone was rubbernecking past this accident.
I waited my turn.
So, of course, I take a look--
you know, human nature--
and these firemen are using one of those
big steel, um, things to cut.
What do you call them?
Uh, jaws of life.
Jaws of life!
Right. They looked dangerous to me.
You ever use one of those?
No, not personally.
It was cutting into the car like a can opener.
Anyway, should we start?
Certainly.
Please raise your right hand.
Sit down.
There's no Bible? No.
Do you swear to tell the truth
in this matter
so help you, God?
Yes.
We are on the record in a deposition
on the behalf of the plaintiff, Al Patterson.
Plaintiff's attorney's Bruce Resnick.
Gordon Price, for the defense.
Doctor, could you state and spell your name for the record?
Elizabeth Corday. C-o-r-d-a-y.
Doctor, how long have you been a surgeon?
Including residency? Yes.
Ten years.
Have you ever had a deposition taken before?
No. This is the first.
After ten years. That's pretty good.
Well, only three have been in America.
Touche.
Malucci: Extraocular movements are intact.
Okay, Kynesha, we need to remove your pants
so I can check for injuries, okay?
It's just my face.
I know, but we still need to check.
I'll be right back.
Hey, Peter.
Hey.
There's an inguinal hernia in Curtain Three.
Could you take a look?
Yeah. After the assault victim.
We've got it. Probably just a facial fracture.
Well, then, I'll clear the belly.
She's stable.
There's blood in her underwear.
She says it's her period.
Get a rape kit.
Peter, wait.
You shouldn't take this one.
( sighs )
Why?
It's Jesse's girlfriend.
I can take care of her.
Peter...
Oh, man.
No hemotympanum.
What's that?
That means you didn't crack your skull.
I'm Dr. Benton.
I know.
Is there anyone you want us to call?
Mother, father?
She won't be home.
Man: The ring enhancing lesion
and central necrosis on MRI was suspicious.
The biopsy confirms it.
Another pathologist should take a look.
It could be an astrocytoma.
Two neurospecialists have reviewed the slides
independently.
They concur.
It's a GBM.
What's the survival rate?
Untreated, eight weeks.
But with radiation therapy, the average increases
six to nine months.
So you need to go see a radiation oncologist today.
W-What about surgery?
Uh, I'm afraid the tumor is inoperable.
Why?
It looks like it invaded Broca's area.
Uh, the speech arrest that you were experiencing
was probably the result of a focal seizure.
Even if we remove the entire tumor
you'd most likely be left with the inability to speak
and understand language.
Communication.
More than communication.
You'd lose all ability to comprehend
interact with the world around you--
essentially what makes you human.
Even if you consented
I wouldn't even consider operating.
We'll keep you on Dilantin, uh, 300 milligrams daily.
Do you have disability insurance?
Dr. Greene?
Yeah.
What's going on, Carter?
Why are we so backed up?
I just got here.
Weaver's not on until tonight.
This always happens when she's off.
What happened to your head?
Oh, jogging. I ran into a street sign.
She left you a note.
I'll take the shoulder pain and the vertigo.
Dr. Greene, guy with palpitations.
Tachycardic at 300.
BP is 100/70. Normal mentation.
Well, six of adenosine.
I'll be right there.
Did you say heart rate was 300?
Yeah.
If it's Wolff-Parkinson-White
adenosine could put him into v-fib.
Oh, yeah, right.
100 milligrams procainamide.
IV every ten minutes.
Thanks, Carter.
Sure. You okay?
Yeah, it's just, uh, it's been a long morning.
Listen, we have to do a blood and urine test on you.
It's your three-month mark.
Right now?
Sometime in the next six hours.
Whenever.
Listen, if you want privacy, I'll do the stick.
Otherwise, you can ask a nurse.
Um, yeah, I'll ask Abby.
Randi, what's open?
Exam one.
Meet you there.
Liver and spleen are good.
No peritoneal free fluid.
No lacerations or contusions.
Kynesha, when's the last time you had intercourse?
I don't remember.
Wood's lamp.
I'll get the lights.
What's that do?
Hold on.
There's no semen.
What?
Abrasions, but no stridor.
I need to do a pelvic exam, Kynesha.
Do you know what that is?
No, I'm on my period, I told you.
I still need to check.
( everybody talking )
Hey, hey, hey.
Let me go!
Come on. Hey, calm down.
Kynesha, it's important we give you an exam.
Not down there.
Just fix my face.
We know it's hard
but if someone sexually assaulted you
we have to check.
I didn't get raped.
I got beat up, that's all.
Who beat you up?
I got jumped out. No big thing.
Of a gang.
I did okay.
Some girls get real messed up.
I did okay.
So you concede Mr. Patterson's surgery started at 5:17 p.m.
Corday: According to the chart, yes.
And you sent Mr. Patterson to pre-op at 2:15 p.m.
Approximately, yes.
Expecting to operate within the hour?
Expecting to operate immediately.
But you didn't.
You didn't start Mr. Patterson's operation
for another three hours, did you?
No.
Why not?
I'm on emergency call.
A life-threatening gunshot wound
to a 14-year-old boy came in.
I had to respond.
And were you able to save this boy?
No.
This Jesse Robbins...
uh, did you know him?
By association, yes.
And that association
was through a colleague, Dr. Peter Benton?
He was Dr. Benton's nephew.
And Dr. Benton is your former lover?
Don't answer that.
Was the young boy you were unable to save
the nephew of your former lover?
Move it along, Bruce.
That has no probative value and she's not answering it.
Are you refusing to answer that question?
She's not answering the question.
Fine. She'll answer in front of a judge.
So the death of his nephew
was upsetting to you?
Of course.
How long did it upset you?
I'm not sure.
Well, losing a young boy--
a boy you knew, a boy close to someone you cared about--
it must have been quite overwhelming.
Is that a question?
Was it overwhelming?
At that moment.
So overwhelming and tragic, in fact
that it was still on your mind while you operated on my client
wasn't it, Dr. Corday?
Carter: I guess I should have had
that blood transfusion this morning, huh?
Come on, that was funny.
This is kind of ironic, isn't it?
Check my cholesterol while you're at it?
Hey, you, you're supposed to be watching this.
You better watch.
You think I want to be doing this, Carter?
I don't have better things to do?
Okay.
What should I do with this?
Give it to me.
Are we done? Yeah.
Abby, paramedics called. Your mom's hurt.
She's asking for you.
What happened?
I don't know.
She's outside
a clothing store on Oak Street.
She wants to give names, I'll check it out.
She's afraid. She's not going to give names.
Dr. Benton.
She wants to talk to you.
If she changes her mind, give me a call.
Peter, I said I'd take care of her.
I got it.
Looks like you broke your cheek bone.
I'm going to have to do a CAT scan of your face.
So you're really going to protect the girls
who did this to you, huh?
Protecting myself.
They find out I said something
they're going to kill me.
Like they did Jesse.
You don't know that.
I know he wasn't a gang member, and you are.
Was.
I know that the only reason he was in that neighborhood
is because of you.
He only came there twice.
He said he didn't like me banging.
Kept telling me that I was better than all that.
That he loved me.
He was going to get me out.
You're telling me that's why they killed him?
He ditched school.
Tried to get me to come over.
He told me that his mom was going to figure things out.
We had a fight.
I was walking away when it happened.
You saw who shot him?
That's why I don't want to be a part of it no more.
I loved him, too.
Who shot him, Kynesha?
You just said you loved him.
You'd tell the cops if I told you.
No.
Then why are you asking?
Because I got to know.
You swear you ain't gonna say nothing?
Kynesha.
Who murdered my nephew?
You need to hold still, ma'am.
My daughter is a doctor.
I don't need you to do any of this.
I don't want you to touch me.
She's a doctor. She will be here.
She can do this.
Abby, Abby, this wasn't my fault.
You her daughter?
This man came after me.
She was shoplifting.
I was not shoplifting.
Why would I shoplift a ten-dollar scarf?
It's a $300 scarf.
Well, it looks like a ten-dollar scarf.
I'll tell you that right now.
She ran straight into my door.
Shattered glass everywhere.
You don't want to arrest her, okay?
Believe me, it's not worth your trouble.
What's wrong with her?
I'm a nurse at County.
Nothing's wrong with me.
What's wrong you, huh?
She has a mood disorder.
She was stealing.
She wasn't stealing; she was confused.
You weren't there.
She walked into the store, demanded a job
and when I explained...
Let me tell you something, dearie.
I have better retail skills than you do any day of the week.
Be quiet, mom.
Common courtesy and politeness being two of them.
Can I just give you my phone number?
And then I'll pay for the glass.
Is that cool with you?
What if she comes back?
I mean, I have customers in there.
She's not going to come back.
You'll take care of it?
Yes, I promise.
All right, fine. Just get her out of here.
Up to five of Haldol PRN.
You got it?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
What?
Huh?
You wanted to see me?
Yeah, Carter, your naltrexone level was non-detectable.
My naltrexone level.
The blood test-- you're supposed to be on 50 migs a day.
I just thought it was a drug screen.
I didn't know you were screening for naltrexone.
It's in your contract.
My prescription ran out
and I haven't had time to refill it.
You know it's part of the agreement.
And I'm taking it.
I don't need it and I'm taking it.
What?
You're not the only one
with something at stake here, Carter.
We put ourselves on the line to give you a fresh start.
In any other circumstance
you'd either be dead or in jail.
Fresh start, huh?
I think that I've done absolutely everything
that you've asked of me
and I think I've done it without complaint.
I think that I've obeyed
all these arbitrary and arcane rules and regulations
about what patients I can treat and what patients I can't
and when I can treat them and when I can't.
I think I've peed into cups.
I think you've taken my blood
and I think, at some point
it's going to have to be enough.
I think, at some point
you're actually going to have to trust me.
Dr. Greene!
Hey, Mark!
I need some help in here.
Chuny, get in here and give me some Ativan.
Oh, my God, what happened?
Get the Ativan.
How much? Four milligrams now.
Mark?
Did he hit his head? No.
Does he have a fever?
I don't know.
He just started seizing.
Hold him still.
All right, start him...
Start him on 15 liters of O2.
Get a line going.
And then I need
a pulse ox and a set of vitals.
What do you want for labs?
CBC and a chem 20.
Wright: Carter.
Dr. Greene.
Hey, hey, Mark. Can you hear me?
Squeeze my hands, right and left.
What happened?
You had a seizure.
But your vitals have been stable
and you didn't drop your sats.
We're going to take you for a head C.T.
See if you can follow my finger with your eyes.
Come on, Mark, just lay back.
Dr. Greene, we need to work this up.
I don't want to work it up.
Neuro's coming down for a consult.
That's not necessary.
Yes, it is, you had a new-onset seizure.
I just need a Dilantin level.
I can go to the outpatient lab for that.
You need to sit down and relax.
Come on, I called Kovac in to cover.
You've got a hep-lock on your arm.
I'll handle it.
Mark, Mark...
I'll handle it.
Dr. Greene, are you okay?
I'm fine.
Hey, boss, what are you doing?
I heard you had a seizure.
Yeah?
You heard wrong.
Resnick: Mr. Patterson's condition
needed immediate surgical attention, did it not?
Corday: It depends on what you mean by immediate.
You had to operate that day.
Within the next 24 hours.
And the endoscopic surgery
is certainly the fastest procedure, correct?
Among other benefits.
So it was more convenient for you.
I base my surgical opinions on what
I perceive to be in the best interests of the patient:
the recovery, how...
Let me try again.
Perhaps you didn't hear the question.
The endoscopic surgery was faster
and therefore easier on your schedule
than the alternate open procedure.
Of course, but that... Thank you.
How long does the endoscopic procedure take?
My schedule had nothing whatsoever to do
with my advice to Mr. Patterson.
Please strike that as nonresponsive.
Dr. Corday, how long
does the endoscopic procedure take to perform?
About an hour.
But you performed Mr. Patterson's
endoscopic discectomy in 42 minutes, correct?
I don't know.
I'd have to check the operative report.
Well, if the operative report stated
that you were in the OR with Mr. Patterson
less than 43 minutes, would you say that's correct?
It could be.
Do you have any reason to doubt the veracity
of the operative report?
No.
Would it you surprise you
that of the 87 endoscopic discectomies you performed
before November 16, your fastest time
was 54 minutes, 12 minutes slower
than Mr. Patterson?
Objection. You're testifying, Bruce.
It's a question. Well, she can count.
Would that surprise you, Dr. Corday?
Let's move on.
Did you know that the fastest
you had ever performed this procedure
was 12 minutes slower than Mr. Patterson's surgery?
I do now.
You don't time yourself?
It's not a race.
Then why did the circulating nurse
remind you it was ten to 6:00?
Objection. Assumes facts not in evidence.
Do you recall the circulating nurse reminding you
that it was ten to 6:00
while you were operating on Mr. Patterson?
Yes.
Why did you need to be reminded?
To keep me on schedule.
And what did you have scheduled after Mr. Patterson's surgery?
I had an engagement.
Some place more important that you had to be?
No, and I resent the inference.
What inference is that?
That I rushed Mr. Patterson's surgery
in order to satisfy a personal obligation.
Okay, that's it. We're taking a break.
Did you? Did you rush?
Don't answer that.
Did the nurse remind you it was ten to 6:00
because you needed to leave by 6:00?
Yes. We're taking a break.
Did you get that?
No, we're off the record.
Stop typing.
Now, I said we're taking a break.
Let's go.
Maggie: All I wanted to do
was talk to the owner.
I know if I could just talk to the owner
he'd want to hire me.
What happened?
I don't know.
Dr. Greene had a seizure?
Yeah.
I've never understood people
who try to make themselves feel big
by making other people feel small.
Let me tell you something.
I've got plenty of experience-- plenty.
You know what? Sit down. Sit down.
She was threatened is what she was.
She was threatened. She knew I could outsell her.
She knew it, so she sent that Neanderthal in on me.
You know why? 'Cause she was threatened.
Did you even have an interview?
Of course I had an interview
until she chased me into the window.
Ow. Ow!
Oh, God, this is bad. This is bad.
You need stitches. Here, sit down.
I'm going to get an X-ray, make sure there's no glass in there.
Keep some pressure on it and I'll be right back.
Abby. Abby...
Yeah?
You're mad at me.
No, Mom, I'm not mad at you.
I thought you would be mad.
Sit down.
I have plenty of experience.
Plenty of experience.
Do you think I'm going to put up with that?
Well, I'm not. I'm not.
I'm not going to put up with that.
See if I don't.
I hate people.
I have so much more experience than you.
You can try, but I don't think she'll say anything.
She wouldn't have told you if she didn't want us to pick this girl up.
Right. I gave you the name.
Why don't you just go and pick her up?
I have to get it from her; she's the witness.
What if she doesn't say anything?
It depends. We could bring her to the D.A.
Maybe a judge.
There's fluid in the maxillary sinus
but no depressed fracture.
Good, good. Kynesha...
No. No way!
I told you I don't know nothing.
Looks like you're feeling better.
Yeah.
I got my prescription refilled.
You want to see me take it?
No. Thanks for helping me out.
Sure. You want to tell me what happened?
Not particularly.
You know, I did treat you.
Technically, I am your doctor.
Anything you tell me is confidential.
Okay, doctor, it's quite simple.
I have a brain tumor.
What?
Glioblastoma multiformae.
Bummer, huh?
It gets better.
I found out that it's inoperable.
Oh, Mark, I'm sorry.
Yeah. Well...
You're up.
What are you going to do?
Die, I guess.
After today I probably won't be able to work anymore.
Did you get a second opinion?
They double-checked the biopsy.
No, by another neurosurgeon.
I mean, there's got to be
a clinical trial going on someplace, right?
Yeah. Looking into it.
Well, looks like they need you.
Are you going to be okay?
Stupid question, Carter.
Do me a favor...
Try and keep the rumors from spreading around here
before I get a chance to talk to Elizabeth.
Sure.
Do you know what time it is?
Uh... 2:47.
Correct, but it's not the right answer.
It's not?
No, the right answer is yes or no.
Yes or no when possible. Don't elaborate.
Not all questions have a yes or no answer.
I understand.
Yes or no when possible. Don't elaborate.
We don't win cases in deposition
but we can lose them.
Now at best, this is a stain that follows you
for the rest of your career.
At worst, you lose your license.
We're not here to win an argument.
This is about information.
He's looking to gain information to use against you in court.
We're looking to limit that information.
You mean hide the truth?
I didn't say that.
How many do you think?
Stitches.
Four. Five.
Five.
You're so good at this.
You're so gentle.
Thank you.
It's hard to believe
'cause you have such great, big masculine hands.
Oh-oh... Sit still.
Don't move, don't move... Eyelash. See?
Okay, now you have to make a wish and blow.
That's all right.
Okay. I'll blow for you.
What did you wish for?
Don't tell me. Don't tell me, don't tell me.
I'm sorry.
You're sorry for what?
It's, uh, part of the disease.
Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho!
Oh, yes, we're going to now apologize
for your diseased mother, are we?
Are we?
She's always misbehaving.
You know, Abby never wanted me around her friends.
She was always ashamed. Stop it, mom.
Ashamed and embarrassed.
You think I don't know that?
Sit down, mom, and finish your hand.
You'd walk right by me and pretend you didn't know me.
You'd pretend I didn't even exist.
Sit down and let me finish your hand.
You'd pretend I didn't... Shut up.
Don't you sass me.
I'm your mother. Not by choice.
( screaming )
Okay, Okay. Okay. All right.
Okay, do you want a five of Haldol? No!
Abby. Abby, I'm sorry.
Do you want five of Haldol? I'm sorry.
I don't want Haldol!
Sit still and behave and we won't give you anything.
I don't want your... You let me go!
I'm leaving. I'm leaving.
I'm leaving. I'm leaving.
I'm leaving. I'm leaving.
I'm leaving.
No! No! No!
No! No! No!
No!
Do you want five of Haldol?
Leather restraints now!
Start with two of droperidol, IV.
No! Abby! Abby!
Abby, no.
Don't let them do this to me, Abby!
Abby! Abby, don't let them do this to me.
Here, hard restraints.
Don't let them do this to me!
Okay, both sides, Put her on the monitor.
Please!
Please, don't let them do this. Please.
Come on, Maggie, calm down.
( hysterical screaming )
No! No!
Maggie... Maggie.
No!
No! Maggie.
No! You're my daughter, you little bitch!
Make them stop.
No! No!
No!
They're ready to start again.
You okay? You look a little peaked.
Oh, I'm fine.
Look, we're getting to the critical stage
so if you don't feel like
you can maintain your composure... No.
No, I want to get this over with.
Okay.
What he's doing here?
It's his deposition.
He has a right to be here just like you have a right
to be at our depositions.
Don't they have to tell us?
He's been brought in to rattle you.
Just stay calm, pretend he's not there.
"Pretend he's not there."
Don't let it affect your testimony.
Are we ready to start again, Gordy? Yes.
You removed the restraints?
I can admit her voluntarily
but she doesn't meet a criteria for a hold.
Ran through a plate glass window.
An accident.
She's not gravely disabled.
She's not a danger to herself or others.
That's debatable.
She's rapid cycling.
Probably experiencing a drug-induced mania.
Blood alcohol is .092.
That'll do it.
So do you want me to admit her?
I don't care.
Okay, I'll do it.
She wants to talk to you.
She's remorseful. She wants to apologize.
No, thank you.
Okay.
Abby, I'm sorry.
Hey, Maggie. I'll go in the hospital.
I'll get better.
You have to go back inside the room.
I'll get better. Come on back to bed.
Come on, Maggie.
I'll get better.
I know.
I'll get better.
I want you to go to the supermarket
and get some frozen peas.
Take some ibuprofen for the pain.
I want you to come back for a recheck.
Hey, he was my nephew.
You know I had to do something.
Silva: LOL complains of weakness while sitting under a hairdryer
at the beauty salon.
Finch: Ma'am, were you having any chest pain
or shortness of breath?
No, dear, the dryer was just set too high.
Okay, EKG, CBC, Chem seven, and get a chest.
I'll be right with you, Mrs. Fruhman.
I think they're going to find the shooters.
The one who killed Jesse.
Good. I hope it helps.
Cleo.
I got angry, you know
and I got you angry.
You're the only thing in my life
that makes sense right now.
What I'm trying to say-- I'm, you know... sorry.
Buy me some dinner.
I'll consider your apology.
Well, then in your medical opinion
what caused the meningocoele to cut off the blood supply
to Mr. Patterson's spinal cord?
Leak of CSF, cerebrospinal fluid
from the dura which covers the spinal canal.
Which means you must have punctured the dura
during the procedure?
That seems evident now, yes.
It wasn't evident during the procedure?
No.
It was apparently evident to the anesthesiologist.
Objection. Argumentative.
According to the operative report, Dr. Babcock
the anesthesiologist
drew your attention to spinal fluid
in the surgical field
at ten to 6:00, correct?
No.
The note says ten to 6:00, doesn't it?
Yes.
So the report is wrong?
No. He did draw my attention to fluid.
Fluid we now know to be spinal fluid.
No.
What could it have been, doctor?
Saline.
But you understood that the anesthesiologist
was concerned it might be spinal fluid?
Yes.
All right, how did you satisfy yourself that it wasn't?
I suctioned the irrigation saline
and did not see any persistent CSF.
Did you look?
I can't operate without looking.
Well, given that it was ten to 6:00
that you were in a hurry
the nurse simultaneously reminding you of your date.
Objection.
Can we get to a question, Bruce?
Did you perform
a complete and competent
inspection of the field to ensure there were no CSF leaks?
Sometimes leaks are so small
you cannot detect them visually.
Nevertheless, did you perform
a thorough inspection?
That's procedure.
And you followed procedure
by performing a thorough inspection?
Objection. Asked and answered.
It's been asked, it has not been answered.
What was the question?
Did you perform
specifically looking for possible CSF leaks
before you closed?
Yes.
Hey. Hey.
Where did you go?
I was looking all over for you.
I took a walk, got a cup of coffee.
You didn't get my page?
I knew what it was about.
Legaspi was trying to find a bed for your mom
and she just took off.
I figured. Thanks.
I thought you'd want to check your apartment.
She's not there.
You checked?
No. This is the end of the cycle.
Our cycle.
She disappears and then for months
I don't know where she is
or what she's doing or if she's alive
and eventually she'll turn up somewhere
and I'll have to deal with it.
I'm sorry.
Don't be.
I knew how it would end when she showed up.
It's the dance we do.
We get lost in it for a little while
but it always ends the same.
You ready?
Yeah.
Carter, I forgot to tell Weaver.
Enzymes are pending on Mr. Aube in Four.
I'll tell her. Thanks.
Good night, Carter.
You coming in?
I don't want to intrude.
They're probably just eating. Come on.
Jackie always makes so much food anyway.
They need some time to themselves.
I'll wait for an invitation.
All right, I'll just grab some stuff for tomorrow.
Be right back.
Dr. Benton.
What are you doing here?
I went to the store like you said.
Jackie see you? No.
You can't be here.
The cops was there
hooking up the cousins.
They'll think it was me.
Have you been home yet? No.
They're going to kill me! I'm dead. Shh!
Come on, come on. Get in the car.
I talked to the cops.
I can't go home.
All right, just get in the car.
I'll figure out something.
Mark.
I'm up here.
What are you doing?
Just thinking.
How'd it go?
Terribly.
What happened?
What? What is it?
I lied.
I lied.
The fact is I rushed.
I rushed through, didn't inspect the entire surgical field.
That man will never walk again
because I wanted to get out early for the weekend.
And I, I couldn't even claim responsibility.
I sat there
and I swore to God
and I lied to save myself.
God owes us one.
I think you're allowed to be selfish for a while.
I didn't run into a street sign.
I had a biopsy.
Those, uh, headaches weren't from hockey.
( crying )
