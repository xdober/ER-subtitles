Previously on E.R.:
How much of your brain did they cut out?
He has a mild expressive aphasia.
It's temporary.
Well, I don't like it.
This is going to be between us, right?
Of course.
The only reason you gave me that job is because I'm black.
Lupus is very serious.
I know what it does, Dr. Kovac.
I even know I'm going to die from it.
I need information about evaluating a physician
who's possibly cognitively impaired.
BENTON: You asleep?
Cleo?
Cleo?
Hmm?
You asleep?
Um-hmm...
It's snowing outside.
What time is it?
Almost 6:00.
You know, I was thinking, um...
I have to be in at 7:00.
The alarm's going off in ten minutes.
I'll be quick.
Mmm.
The hell you will.
CORDAY: You feel it?
GREENE: No.
There...
Oh, wow.
She's really moving.
How long has she been going on like this?
On and off all night.
Shh.
Go back to sleep.
I keep thinking about that movie...
Alien, you know.
It's moving around under his skin
and then, all of a sudden
it breaks its way through with its teeth.
Amanda, stop it.
You're scaring your mother.
Amanda?
So the baby's a girl today?
Or Matthew, after my grandfather.
I can't decide.
Last day.
Last day.
What?
It's okay.
Hi, did I wake you?
Hmm-mm.
I was trying to let you sleep.
I should probably get home anyway.
You should bring a few things over.
I could clear out some closet space for you.
Are you sure you can spare it?
I can find a couple of inches.
Somewhere, maybe.
( chuckles )
I need to dry my hair.
Mm-hmm.
Are you going to watch me again?
Mm-hmm.
( hair dryer whirring )
( deep breath )
Mmm...
Hmm...
Are you okay?
Mm-hmm.
Are you?
Mm-hmm.
( both chuckle )
Penny for your thoughts.
Pardon?
It means what are you thinking about.
Nothing, really.
I was thinking about the bishop.
Making love with me
makes you think of a priest with lupus?
You watch me when we make love.
You're beautiful.
What was her name?
Who?
Your wife.
Daniella.
Did you love her very much?
Yeah.
I'm glad.
Carter...
a four-year old boy is coming in from pre-school.
Fever, having trouble breathing.
62 is pulling in.
Okeydokey.
Hey, Frank, is Dr. Greene here yet?
Nah, said he was coming in a little late.
Weaver's upstairs in some big administrative powwow.
Probably suggesting the installation
of pay toilets in the employee bathrooms.
Is Kovac here?
He's got a dead shovel in Three.
They're trying to bring him back.
I guess it's just you and me then
with this four-year-old.
Hey, I can take it.
Welcome back.
Thanks.
How are you feeling?
Oh, pretty good.
Want me to tag along with you?
No, I've got it.
Eight weeks-- could be some cobwebs.
Thanks anyway.
Call me if she gets into any trouble.
Okay.
You look great.
Oh, I still have a few pounds to drop.
Can't tell.
Brr, I should've gotten a coat!
Should go in and grab one.
No, I'm all right.
Zack Woodman, four years old.
Status, post grand mal seizure at his preschool.
We were just finishing arts and crafts
and he started shaking and wet his pants.
Are you his mother?
No, his preschool teacher.
Feels like he's burning up.
B.P.'s 100/60, pulse 120.
Does he have a history of epilepsy?
No, not that I know of.
Zack, open your eyes...
Excuse me, can somebody help me?
Are you hurt, sir?
No, no, no, it's not me...
He's in the car.
He's very weak.
I don't think he can walk on his own. Uh, Abby?
What's wrong with him?
He's having trouble breathing.
Has he been ill?
Yes.
When did this start?
I don't know.
A couple hours ago, I guess.
Hi.
Hello.
Can you walk?
I don't think so.
I need a septic workup, CBC
blood and urine cultures, chest x ray.
Temp's 105.
Sorry, the bishop's back.
I need a weight.
Blue zone, 20 kilos.
360 milligrams of rectal Tylenol.
Pulse ox 82.
Put him on a mask, ten liters.
Do you want to do a spinal tap?
He could have meningitis.
Or it could be febrile seizure and he's going to wake up.
Why don't I get an LP tray?
I want to wait a few minutes.
Give 900 of Cefotaxime after the cultures.
Well, I love what you've done with the place, Peter.
Very Teutonic.
None of the trappings of success
to interfere with your performing your new duties.
Well, I requisitioned some furniture
but I hear the form is still on your desk
waiting for your signature.
Well, you should see my in-box, must be 18 inches deep.
Are those admissions folders?
Yeah, I thought I would familiarize myself with them
before I met with the candidates.
Don't bother-- kids come in...
they're going to toss out a bunch of tired clich√©s
about wanting to help people.
You could ask them their favorite color.
You could ask them whether or not they like cheese.
Doesn't matter.
Step outside a minute, would you?
He, uh, showed up in my office
whining about not getting an interview
so I thought you should shake his hand
since this sort of falls under your purview
before you had the, uh, security toss him out.
( snaps fingers )
Dean Benton?
Dr. Benton.
William White.
Thanks for finding time to see me.
Yeah, well, what can I do for you?
I, uh... I got this letter.
I applied to the medical school
but I didn't get an interview.
Teacher doesn't have a signed emergency consent form.
He's still not waking up.
How long's it been?
40 minutes.
Zack?
Zack, can you hear me?
He needs an LP.
We don't have parental consent.
Get another doc to sign off the chart with you.
Okay, get the tray set up.
Frank, where's Carter?
In Four; granny took a fall.
Dr. Carter, can I see you for a moment?
Sure.
I've got that four-year-old with febrile seizure.
Mm-hmm.
He's still altered.
I want to do a spinal tap
but the preschool doesn't have an emergency consent
and we haven't been able to contact a parent yet.
Any other signs?
Well, x ray looks like viral pneumonia.
I can't assess for a stiff neck, but there is photophobia.
All right, where do you want me to sign?
Oxygen saturation is only 78.
What should it be?
100.
78 sounds like a passing grade.
Barely.
Put him up to four liters.
CBC, blood cultures, ABG, sed rate
and a portable chest.
And hang a gram of Cefotaxime in case it's pneumonia.
Pneumonia?
I don't even feel like I have a fever.
The steroids prevent you from having fevers.
And push 125 of Solumedrol.
You're giving me more steroids?
You could have a flare-up of the lupus
with inflammation in the lung.
There's also a chance that you're throwing blood clots.
Lupus makes your blood coagulate more easily.
Have you called your own doctor?
No.
I'll call him.
No.
Why, because you think I'm easier to manipulate?
I'm not nearly as Machiavellian as you imagine me to be.
I came here because I prefer your care.
CARTER: How's it going?
Easy tap when they're unconscious.
Looks pretty clear.
Cute kid. What's his name?
Zack.
Cell count, glucose, protein, gram stain and culture.
He's got those shoes that light up when you walk.
How do you think they do that?
You want to roll him back over?
What is that?
What?
That.
You didn't tell me he had a macular rash.
It wasn't there half an hour ago.
It must be a viral exanthem.
It could be measles.
Measles?
Well, fever, altered mental status, pneumonia...
Or more likely he has a virus with pneumonia
and had a febrile seizure from the high temperature.
That is a classic measles rash.
Abby, can you hand me a tongue depressor?
Have you ever seen measles?
No, have you?
Of course not, nobody's seen measles.
Can you, uh...?
He's got Koplik spots on the buccal mucosa.
What?
Or he bit the inside of his mouth when he was seizing.
Malik, there's a Nelson's in the lounge.
Can you go grab it, please?
Now.
Is Zack all right?
This is Mrs. Woodman.
I was in court.
I have to turn off my cell
when we're in session.
Oh, my God...
I'm Dr. Chen.
Your son had a seizure
and a high temperature.
We've done a spinal tap to rule out meningitis.
Mrs. Woodman, are Zack's immunizations up to date?
No.
Has he had the MMR?
He hasn't had any immunizations.
None of our children have.
Got it, Dr. Carter.
Abby, put a mask on Zack.
What's the matter?
What the hell is happening?
Oh, my God... We've got to get him
into a laminar flow room.
Call the school.
Don't let anybody leave!
What's the matter with my son?
Your son has measles.
But that's not too bad, right?
One in 500 kids die from measles.
Frank, I'm taking the Luiz kid up now.
Please, send along the films when you find them again.
Yes, ma'am.
Hi.
Hey.
So, how'd it go?
Fine.
"Fine." That's it?
I laid down, they shot a couple billion more rads
into my skull and then I left.
And that's it.
Hopefully my irradiated head
won't screw up any navigational equipment on our next flight.
All right, all right...
( both chuckle )
I have to go.
Uh, lunch?
Uh, if I can. Come find me.
Okay.
So, did I hear right, you're done?
Radiation treatment.
Just two more weeks of immune therapy.
Dr. Greene? Yep.
That's great.
Did they give you the tumor back?
What? Yeah, when they took it out
did they give it back to you?
You know, 'cause my Uncle Al
he's got his on the mantel in a jar.
Guy over there wants to talk to you.
You know, Dave, I don't really want a tumor on my mantel.
Hi. Dr. Greene. Can I help you
Uh, Robert Wilson.
Is there someplace we could talk?
Actually, I'm on duty.
It'd be better if we had some privacy.
I'm sorry, Mr., um...
Dr. Wilson.
Dr. Wilson, what is it?
I work for the Illinois
Department of Professional Regulation.
We've been asked to evaluate your competency
to continue practicing medicine.
FINCH: Where in the hell did he catch measles?
Europe, I think.
Mom was in Paris on business two weeks ago, took the whole family.
She some fringe lunatic, thinks immunizations
are a conspiracy between doctors and drug companies?
Well, I don't think so.
Talk to the mom, find out if there are other kids at home
where the child's been
anyone he's had contact with over the last week.
How is he? They won't let me back there.
We had to move him to a room
with a special ventilation system
so that he doesn't contaminate the rest of the ER.
Is he awake?
He's still unconscious.
He has pneumonia
and in all likelihood, encephalitis.
What's that?
Inflammation around the brain.
Were you able to get in touch with the preschool?
Yes. All the children are still there.
Okay, you need to make sure they've all been immunized;
their parents, their siblings
anyone that they've come into contact with.
There's a phone at the desk.
Okay.
Please.
You have other children?
Yes, a daughter.
I called my husband; he's coming with her.
And she hasn't been immunized either?
No. Is Zack going to be okay?
Well, he's in grave condition
with a highly contagious disease.
I'm not an irresponsible parent.
I read all the literature on the Internet
the parenting magazines
I discussed it with my pediatrician.
And he didn't recommend the MMR?
I breast fed.
Zack's immune system could have been weakened
from too many vaccinations.
The immune system is strengthened by vaccines.
Kids are exposed to foreign antigens every day.
Vaccines aren't completely safe.
I don't want to get into an argument...
They aren't and you know it.
That's not true, look...
The connection between vaccinations and autism?
There is no connection.
Dr. Carter, Zack dropped his sats.
He's at 75 at 100%.
He's getting cyanotic.
I've already started the atropine.
Etomidate and sux.
I need a 5-0 uncuffed ET
and a number two curved blade.
Please, what's going on? The viral infection
caused so much lung damage that no oxygen can get into his bloodstream.
Well, what are you doing to him?
Putting a tube down his throat and get him some more oxygen.
You have to put him on a machine to breathe?
If we don't intubate him right now he's going to die.
I'll do it.
CHEN: No, I've got it.
Not on your first day back.
Step out, doctor.
Step out, doctor.
Give me some suction.
He's throwing PVCs.
Oh, my God...
Come on...
Come on...
Okay, I got it.
Good breath sounds bilaterally.
Pulse ox up to 88.
Tidal volume of 150, AC of 14.
Let's keep him on 100% with three of PEEP.
He's okay now?
Yeah, sure, he's great.
JOE: Is that the bishop's?
He says he's feeling better.
The oxygen and the medication.
So he'll be able to perform the ordination this afternoon?
What?
That's where we were headed
when he became ill in the car.
One of the kids that he baptized at his fist parish
is being ordained as a priest today.
Where do you think you're going?
I feel much better.
Your ABG shows an oxygen level of 58
and your sed rate is 84.
84... is that good?
No, it's not good.
It's an indication of active lupus.
Stop buttoning that damn shirt.
Is Joe still outside?
I think I'm going to need some help
getting into these pants.
You need to be admitted to the ICU for IV Cytoxan.
It'll only take me a couple of hours.
If the inflammation in your lungs continues
you won't get enough oxygen to stay alive.
If I skip the reception, I could be back in here by 6:00.
You'll be dead by 6:00.
It's in God's hands.
God could give a damn!
Is there something I should sign so I can go?
LEGASPI: You're kidding! Stephanie?
Yep, she just up and moved to Seattle.
I thought she was living with Deborah.
No, she met a stewardess on Alaska Airlines.
Another stewardess!
( laughing )
Hey, we were just looking for you.
This is Christy.
Christy... Kerry.
Hi.
Hello.
Christy and I were having coffee...
And I insisted that she bring me down here.
I'm sorry, but a bunch of us
were beginning to question your existence.
We were all thinking about getting together for dinner tonight.
You game?
You know, I don't think I can get off on time
but thank you for asking.
I checked your schedule; you get off at 6:00.
Don't worry, nobody bites.
Uh, Chief, can I get you to sign off on this LOL?
Head CT's clear.
7:30?
Okay.
Oh, great. We'll see you then.
Bye...
That, uh, Legaspi's girlfriend?
Heard she's gay.
I don't know.
What I wouldn't pay to drop in on that little party, huh?
You turned me in?
There's a guy from the medical board here questioning my competency.
Don't walk away from me! I'm not walking away.
I don't want to have this conversation
in the middle of the lobby.
He wants to see my medical records.
He's planning on interviewing the staff
to see if I'm still fit to practice medicine.
Oh, don't be so melodramatic.
He can pull my license.
I've been concerned about the changes
in your personality since the surgery.
I have tried to talk to you about it
but you've chosen to ignore me.
So you call in the licensing board?!
Keep your voice down.
They cut a tumor out of my head, Kerry.
I'm sorry if I seem a little different to you.
I wouldn't come back to work if I couldn't do the job.
What about the aphasia?
It's getting better.
And if you were in an emergency situation
and you couldn't think of the name of the drug you wanted
or do the nurses have to play 20 questions while the patient dies?
Nobody's dying!
You have been insensitive and argumentative.
I have not been argumentative!
You have been shooting from the hip
and I'm not the only one who's expressed concern.
For the safety of the patients
I felt I had to call the Board for an objective assessment.
I want you to pass so that we can all get back to work
confident in your abilities, okay?
FINCH: Rich people think
if all the poor kids are immunized
then they don't have to be.
I thought it stopped snowing.
If everybody stops getting vaccines
then smallpox will be back, polio, measles.
Then they'll be lined up around the block begging us
to stick a needle into precious little Annie's arm.
50-year-old male with non- Hodgkin's lymphoma
persistent nausea and vomiting despite Compazine at home.
B.P.'s 88/58, pulse 130, mucous membrane's very dry.
Gave a liter of saline en route.
He only finished the chemotherapy last week.
Is the cancer back?
No, he's probably just having a reaction to the chemo.
Hey, how'd that little boy do?
Which one?
The febrile seizure from the preschool.
You brought him in?
Yeah. A couple hours ago.
They didn't call you? About what?
He has measles. You transported
an immunosuppressed patient in the same rig?
What does that mean?
Ah, damn it! Nobody told us!
Watch your step.
( grunts )
BENTON: Excuse me.
I need to review a file
of an applicant who wasn't given an interview.
CLERK: And you are...?
Peter Benton, I'm the new Director of Diversity.
Lucky you.
This year?
Yeah.
It'd be in the reject pile.
What's the name?
White, William White.
We had over 3,000 applications for 150 spots.
Big pile.
Director of Diversity, huh?
That position's
a little quixotic around here these days.
My David wouldn't be working for Morgan Stanley
without affirmative action.
William Jackson White.
Thank you.
Excuse me, do you keep files of past
candidates that were accepted?
I need to compare them.
Compared to last year's acceptances.
They're over there by graduating year.
2004 is on the right.
( phone rings )
Student Affairs.
What are you doing down here?
I'm just getting some air.
What's the matter?
How's your bishop?
He just left.
That's good, right?
He's having an acute lupus flare.
He left A.M.A.
So go get him.
Take some oxygen, make sure he's okay.
H-he knew what he was doing.
I'm not his keeper.
( knocking on door )
So this is you, huh?
Yep.
Could use a little something.
What is that back there?
My room with a view-- cafeteria kitchen.
Vending machine only had turkey and egg salad, no veggie.
Ah, thank you.
Hear about our measles kid downstairs?
Four years old, parents didn't vaccinate.
What's all this?
Med school applications.
You thinking about starting over?
Is this your file?
No, that's a black kid
applied and didn't get an interview.
I went to records
to find out why and found that.
Oh, yeah? Anything interesting?
Yeah, my file wasn't with the rest.
It was in the back with three others
filed under "A.A."
Affirmative Action.
That surprise you?
Hell, yeah.
Look, my grades were good
my MCAT scores were competitive.
( sighs )
Yeah, but...
when I compared it to the other applicants
that were accepted that year
I shouldn't have even gotten in.
You're an excellent physician, Peter.
They were right to let you in.
Oh, yeah?
This is the file of the kid
that didn't even get an interview this year
William White.
His grades, his MCAT scores, they're better than mine were.
( sighs )
( knocking on door )
( wheezing )
Bishop Stewart?
( groans )
Oh, damn it!
( weakly ): I'm okay.
How long have you been having trouble breathing?
I'm just... gathering my strength.
You have to go to the hospital.
It's pretty...
isn't it...
the snow?
So much beauty...
Where is the phone?
I need to call an ambulance.
No, please.
I only need a minute.
You're dying.
Evidently.
As I was sitting here, I was reminded of the night
I chose to become a priest.
I'd been struggling with it for a long time
several years.
Anyway, that night I couldn't sleep
so I got up and went out for a walk
in the woods behind my father's house.
It was snowing
like it is now.
I don't have any idea how long I walked
but at a certain point, I suddenly realized
I didn't know which way to go.
I'd gotten lost.
I was frightened.
As I looked up into that dark night
He came to me.
I saw all those millions of snowflakes
drifting down toward me
so still, so peaceful...
Perfect.
And I was filled with the love
of our Lord Jesus Christ.
Like pouring wine into an empty glass.
I'm afraid...
I may have wasted my life.
For some reason, I never accomplished
the things I should've.
What God wanted of me.
And now I'm frightened.
I'm afraid of dying.
There, I said it.
I am afraid to die.
You have to go to the hospital.
"The Lord is my Shepherd
"I shall not want.
"He maketh me to lie down in green pastures.
"He leadeth me beside the still waters...
Is he all right?
No.
Yes.
The procession is forming.
What should I tell them?
Tell them...
I think I have to skip the processional.
When did you lose your faith?
I've found with most people
it comes and goes
like intimacy in a relationship.
Sometimes it's so strong-- a passion, rapture.
And then at other times
it's impossible, distant, lost.
But that's not God.
That's us.
We put up our own barriers
with our egos and our pain.
He's always there.
No matter what.
( church organ plays )
Bach.
I love Bach.
( exhales )
Well, that's my cue.
I've given that question a great deal of thought
and I think it all boils down to one thing.
I really want to help people.
My dad died of lung cancer
and I was 12.
And I vowed I would work for a cure.
My research in molecular biology has been very rewarding.
I expect we'll see gene therapy in our lifetime.
I'm a people person.
The bottom line is, I really want to help people.
I volunteered for the pediatrics ward, I'm very empathetic.
When I saw my kitty suffering like that
I knew that I had a calling...
...to help people in their time of need...
I think you have to combine humanistic skills...
...with a passion for making a difference.
And I-I really just want to help people.
I just want to help people.
I want to help people.
Help people.
How dare you!
Damn it, Kerry, they sawed off half his skull!
Then they inserted high-dosage...
Hello, Elizabeth, how are you?
...chemotherapy wavers into the empty cavity.
It caused temporary swelling right next to Broca's.
Of course he had a little aphasia
but that was six weeks ago.
The swelling's gone down, and he's back to normal.
If anything, I find his honesty rather refreshing.
We could all do with a little more candor around here.
Candidly speaking, then, are you sure that you can be objective about this?
Of course I'm not objective!
Look, I've been with him every moment
and I can tell you, he's making remarkable progress
and is no danger to anyone...
except, perhaps, easily threatened minor demigods.
He may be endangering patients.
I'm not unsympathetic to his circumstances
but I have larger responsibilities.
It's despicable. And you should be ashamed of yourself.
I hope that you end up with a possibly fatal illness
one day, Kerry, so that I can do
absolutely nothing to help you.
What was that about?
Uh, some days I really hate this job.
You, me, and everyone else around here.
Are you ready?
Dinner? Right.
Yes, I just have to drop this off.
Carter, you've still got that leg lac waiting in sutures.
I'm on it.
Get there by Easter, would you, please?
Yeah, I am.
Hey, Malik, is this the measles
kid's post intubation film?
Yeah, Woodman. How come it didn't go up to the PICU with him?
Well, I'll take it up.
No, that's all right, I'll do it.
I want to check on him anyway.
COBURN: Robert Hadl.
Phi Beta Kappa, Yale.
GPA's 3.95.
MCATs in the 97th percentile...
Yeah, sure.
Peter?
All right.
And Carpenter.
University of Georgia.
Wait, was this the, uh, the geek
in the Smashing Pumpkins T-shirt
with the, with the lisp?
Sarah.
Redhead, glasses?
Oh, yeah, right, right.
GPA 3.79, 94th percentile on the MCATs.
Finalist for the Falsberg Science Award.
Whatever the hell that is.
We've got better.
Peter?
No.
Okay, that's it for today.
We are recommending two to the full committee and rejecting 14.
Great, I still might make it home in time for SportsCenter.
Uh, there is another candidate
I'd like to discuss.
William White.
COBURN: Who?
His MCAT scores were only in the 91st percentile
but his GPA was 3.80 and he was class president.
Wait, I don't see him on the list.
We didn't grant him an interview.
I met with him today, and he asked me
to reconsider his application.
Oh, no, is this that whiner I told you to get rid of?
COBURN: Where did he go to school?
University of Illinois, Chicago.
ROMANO: My gardener could've gotten a 3.8 at the U of I.
and he had his head run over by an ice cream truck as a kid.
I went to the University of Illinois.
All right, his MCATs are well below
our admissions standards, Peter.
MCATs don't predict
how good a doctor you'll be.
Just what you'll do the first two years of med school.
This kid is bright, he's dedicated...
He's Black.
Yeah, he's Black.
Affirmative action is against the law, Peter.
Well, you know what, we didn't
interview one Black or Latino candidate today.
We have a colorblind admissions policy.
If he was good enough to get in
he would have been here. Minority kids don't have the same access
to academic opportunities. And what, you want to address that
by advancing underqualified applicants
at the expense of our integrity and theirs?
I want him to have an interview.

In Your sight, we offer this man.
KATE: Not anymore, it isn't.
( laughter )
CHRISTY: Vicki is dating guys now
and Carol is getting married to one.
LEGASPI: Oh, both of those women marched in every gay pride parade
for the past 15 years.
KATE: I don't get it.
I do, you get society's blessing, your family's.
Survivor benefits, tax breaks.
And all you got to do
is lay there a few times a week.
( laughing )
I'm sorry, we're not usually this bad.
Oh, it's okay.
Hey, do you realize
that everyone at this table has slept with Kim?
( gasps )
Oh, my God.
Cut it out, you guys.
I bet she brought a U-Haul
on your second date, right?
( laughter ) I don't understand.
It's a lesbian joke.
A bad one.
( laughing )
Do you want another drink?
Actually, I've got to go.
I have an early shift tomorrow.
Kerry...
It was really... it's really nice to meet you both.
Wait, are you upset?
No.
Well, why are you leaving, then?
I don't belong here.
I don't belong here!
I dated Christy in college.
Kate and I dated for maybe a month ten years ago...
It's not that. It's not that.
It's... this isn't me.
I mean, my experience...
the jokes...your friends, I'm, I'm...
I care about you...
I'm-I'm not interested in, in adopting a lifestyle.
Wow, I can't believe you just said that.
I'll call you later.
Just drive.
JOE: Dr. Kovac!
I was helping him off with his cassock.
He was very short of breath and he just collapsed...
Oh, God.
Bishop Stewart, can you hear me?
Call 911.
Tell them we have a man with impending respiratory arrest.
Mark?
Mark, are you home?
Mark?
Mark?
Are you okay?
He recommended formal competency testing.
( sighs )
Psychiatrists, neuropsychologists
MRI, personality tests.
It's going to take five days.
I'm so sorry.
The good times just keep coming.
Luka?
What are you doing?
I-I couldn't find a forest.
What?
You brought Bishop Stewart back in?
How's he doing?
He's dying.
He might surprise you.
We get enough miracles around here.
Why not one more?
( sighs )
I'm freezing.
You ready to go home?
Yeah.
