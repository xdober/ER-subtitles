Previously on ER.
Saw the baby's a girl today.
You turned me in?
There's a guy from the Medical Board here
questioning my competency?
Minority kids don't have the same access
to academic opportunity.
You want to address that
by advancing underqualified applicants
at the expense of our integrity and theirs.
I want him to have an interview.
Everyone deserves to be comforted in their darkest hour.
Too bad you weren't there
to comfort the little girl he killed.
I didn't need to be.
God was there.
Was He?
Bishop Stewart? Can you hear me?
Call 911.
Again.
It hurts when I breathe.
Could it be my heart?
Something wrong?
Hey?
What?
Is there something wrong with my heart?
No, probably a bruise to your chest wall.
We'll get an X-ray to make sure.
You were lucky.
We'll probably be sifting through the walking wounded until morning
but I think we're over the hump.
Carter just took the last critical.
How many came in?
37. Five in surgery.
Only two ER deaths.
That's not too bad considering.
If you don't count the DOAs.
You did a great job.
You should go home. We got it from here.
RANDI: The board's backing up.
We're fine. Go home.
We'll see you tomorrow.
Hey.
You're leaving?
Uh, no, I-I thought I'd check on the bishop.
Another critical come in?
No.
Th-That's it.
Is she stable?
Yeah.
After three rounds of terbutaline.
Good.
It was scary though.
Yeah.
So, are you heading home soon?
Um... I don't know.
You're okay?
Yeah.
Any change?
He didn't want the breathing mask.
Has he been awake?
Napping on and off.
Hi.
What time is it?
11:30.
You're here late.
You'll have to be intubated soon.
On a ventilator?
Your oxygen level
is down to 65 on 100% oxygen.
I've seen what happens after a ventilator.
If it drops below 50...
Thanks, but no thanks.
Anyway
my bags are packed.
MAN: Water.
I need water.
Mr. Martin. Ooh, it stings.
I told you, just give it a few seconds. No, it stings.
Just give it a few seconds and the pain will fade.
Need some help? No.
Mr. Martin feel asleep under a tanning lamp.
I wasn't tanning.
I was depressed 'cause lack of sunlight.
Tell me about it. I just got back from lunch and it's already getting dark.
UTI in four is gone.
Did the groundhog see its shadow this year?
Seeing its shadow has absolutely nothing to do
with how much of sunlight. Yes, it does.
Six more weeks of winter.
Seven-year-old with diarrhea and wheezing.
Ordered solumedrol and breathing treatment.
Any history of asthma?
Nope.
Fever or cough? Nothing.
Carter, you want to figure this one out?
Bring it on.
Okay, that's it.
Weaver's on at 6:00.
Could you tell her that I'm finished testing tonight, so she can stop avoiding me.
How'd your personality test go?
I scored somewhere between serial killer and talk show host.
I thought they were memory tests.
That was Monday.
What's next? Rorschach? Spelling bee?
Swimwear competition, sudden-death Twister.
Who knows? Maybe a chili cook-off.
The needle goes in
but you can squeeze on the owie ball.
See that? What's up?
Why don't you hold that for me.
Kid freaked out when I tried to start an IV on him.
And then the needle comes out.
Who's, um...? She a new intern from peds.
They hook up this tube to give you the medicine.
Then it won't hurt anymore, okay?
Hey, Jason. Dr. Carter.
I understand you're having a little trouble breathing.
Are you Mom?
Yes. Any history of asthma here?
Uh, no.
Mrs. Fabrone works as a cleaning lady at a church.
She found a bottle of holy water in the sanctuary
and she thought it might help with Jason's diarrhea.
Holy water, huh?
Only it tasted funny.
When Jason started coughing, she checked.
It was lamp oil.
He aspirated... holy oil?
I guess so.
( sobbing )
That's the common duct. We don't cut that.
What time is it?
4:55.
No, no, no, your interview tomorrow.
Oh, 10:00 a.m.
Get there by 9:30.
Right.
So, why do you want to be a doctor?
What?
It's a common question in the interview.
Oh yeah.
Clips.
So, what's the answer?
I want to help people.
Oh.
No?
All right.
Now we dissect the gallbladder from the liver.
What's the right answer?
You tell me.
The money?
I want to be a role model.
You know what, if you're not going to take this seriously?
I am. I just don't know.
I guess I always thought it'd be cool.
Well, at least that's honest.
So, I should say that?
Of course not. SHIRLEY: Dr. Benton
how much longer do you have?
Are you timing me, Shirley?
The Mass-cas called in.
They're going to need you downstairs.
What happened? They didn't give me details.
Let me get some more suction.
I'll be maybe 15 minutes.
Okay.
You should hang out.
You never know what you'll see.
Great job, Jason.
I'll stop by and see you later, okay?
You're admitting him?
Yeah, just for a day.
Keep him on continuous nebs and monitor his stats.
Where's Mom?
She went to go talk to her priest.
I could have used you actually.
She got a little upset after you left.
About her kid or because she stole from the church?
My friend, Tony Cirasollo--
he used to lift communion wine for us.
He just went to confession.
What about you?
Me, I-I just got sick.
So, you're a heathen.
Protestant.
Is there a difference?
Uh, will you sign this for me?
What is it?
It's for my supervisor.
If you think I did a good job with the kid.
Child Life Specialist.
Intern. First day.
Oh, yeah? Hey, welcome.
John Carter.
Rena Trujillo. Nice to meet you.
And you.
Don't forget your voodoo doll.
It's a procedure doll.
Yeah, they make them life-size for really big kids?
Why, you're lonely?
Yeah, I work a lot.
That's too bad.
John, Luka needs you.
This is Rena. Hi.
A train derailed by Lakeshore.
They're declaring an MVI. Set up a triage center.
Excuse me.
Any passenger cars? It was a commuter train.
How many? They don't know.
They're just pulling bodies out.
They need docs on site.
KOVAC: Prep the trauma rooms.
Set up curtain two and three for majors
and call everybody in.
Carter, let's go.
CARTER: Is the chopper already here?
They'll meet us on the roof.
We don't have an attending. Kerry's due in 15 minutes.
Call me on the chopper if you have any problems.
Four units of O-neg.
CHEN: Move all stable patients
into the hall.
Double up the rooms. Anyone walking waits in chairs.
Put all surgical teams on alert and notify the OR.
Already did. We're low on vents.
Well, then grab some from the ICU. Found it.
Randi, call the nursing supervisor
and float some nurses from the unit.
They'll need them up there.
Get them from med-surg.
Oh, my God.
Captain Davis, Incident Commander.
We were evacuating
the first passenger car when it rolled.
I got a man crushed underneath.
KOVAC: Where's triage?
DAVIS: It's right back here.
14 DOAs so far.
We're still pulling them out.
Two middle cars are the worst.
CARTER: What happened?
DAVIS: Automobile stalled on the tracks.
We think the brakes failed on the back passenger cars and the train tried to stop.
HARMS: Blunt chest trauma over here, dropping his pressure.
KOVAC: I've got it. You take the crush injury.
What's on the monitor? Sinus tach.
Vitals? BP 90/60. Pulse is 120.
I was supposed to fly.
My damn flight
was cancelled.
Sir, how do you feel?
My chest feels like something tore inside.
CARTER: Try a 14-gauge and bolus a liter of saline.
LORCAN: Mitch, Mitch, I'm sorry, man.
DAVIS: Don't apologize to me.
I didn't know it was going to tip over like that.
OLBES: BP 85/60; pulse 110.
Doc, I need something more for the pain.
This isn't working.
What did you give him? Ten of morphine.
Had to hold off when he dropped his pressure.
Give him five more, but after the liter.
( gasping )
How long till we can get him out?
We couldn't lift it with the jacks... How long?
How long do you have?
She conscious?
Yeah.
I'm Dr. Kovac. What's your name?
I couldn't get out.
Your name-- do you know your name?
Shannon.
Okay, does your neck hurt? No.
CARTER: Hey, Luka.
What?
We might need a surgeon.
Call it in.
We might not be able to get him out.
I need a surgeon with a field amputation kit.
No, not on standby. Here now.
He's losing a lot of blood.
( helicopter whirring overhead )
( woman groans )
Ma'am, has someone examined you?
They're looking for my son.
H-He wanted to go to the bathroom by himself.
Okay, let's get you out.
I can't move my legs.
Does your neck hurt?
Please, you have to find my son.
Okay, lean forward.
I can't.
Please, you have to find my son.
Please?
Doris!
( sobbing ): Please.
He's wearing a blue sweater.
Doris! In a sec.
I need a line and a set of vitals.
He's seven.
H-He wanted to go to the bathroom by himself.
Saline, wide open.
Nasal 02, and get me if she's hypotensive.
Please, you have to find him.
Hold on.
Are you looking for a little boy?
MAN: He's pinned.
We have to cut him free.
Can you get a BP?
No room. Pulse is thready.
How do I get in there?
The roof.
Systolic's 95. Make it two liters.
Radio the IC.
Did they find him? I think so.
Is he okay?
I don't know yet.
What's his name?
Myles.
( sobbing )
Where is he?
Over here.
( panting )
( panting )
Got an airway?
Breathing on his own.
We're waiting on
a circular saw.
Myles?
Myles, can you hear me?
Pupils are poorly reactive.
Looks like a closed-head injury.
We need to get him out.
I told you: equipment's on its way.
Get it here now!
DUMAR: She's throwing PVCs.
Do you want us to treat? What?
A couple ectopic beats. Can I give lidocaine?
What's the injury?
Train hit her car.
Possible pubic ramus fracture.
No, no, not at her age.
Just get her to County. Where's the amputation?
I don't know. Over here.
We got a crush injury to the legs.
BP's 90/65 with fluids
but I don't know how much longer we can keep it that way.
They can't get him out?
They're trying to, but these things weigh like 40 tons.
( Corday screams )
Oh. You all right?
You okay?
Oh, damn it. Come on.
I'm fine. I'm fine.
What's his name? Who?
The firefighter. Lorcan.
I had to inflate two BP cuffs to use as tourniquets.
Watch your step.
All right.
You okay?
Yes.
Lorcan, I'm Elizabeth Corday.
I'm a surgeon.
You going to cut them off?
Only if I have to.
Now listen, we can't give you much more pain medication
because we need to keep your blood pressure up
so I'm going to give you a nerve block, okay?
Do it fast. Okay.
Prep the groin area.
Betadine. How much fluid in?
OLBES: Three liters saline.
Two of O-neg.
20-gauge for the injection.
These cuffs aren't holding.
I'm going to reinflate them and then clamp them.
Lorcan, you want me to call Patty?
You sure? No.
I'm not dying, man.
All right, buddy.
Who's Patty? Patty's my ex-wife.
Guys and I were going out after the shift
to celebrate my divorce
We'll hammer through this concrete.
Just a second.
Come on. Let's do this.
Hold on, Lorcan. Get me out.
You get it?
Done.
Change.
MAN: That's it.
MAN 2: Okay, on three.
One, two, three.
( groans )
Where's the backboard?
MAN 2: Paramedics are bringing it in.
Is he still breathing?
Yes. Good air entry.
How many did you say we could take? I didn't.
They're transporting all over the city.
Yeah, we're two docs down and a surgeon in the field.
You want me to page Dr. Greene?
He's at his competency testing.
Okay, find out how many they're sending us.
Malucci's on his way down with the first air evac: a possible aortic rupture.
Peter, you're up first.
I got it. No, elevator.
Call CT. Have them cancel all elective cases.
I don't want them jamming up on us.
Stay close to me. If you have any questions, ask.
I might not be able to answer immediately.
Also, don't be surprised if the nurses push you out of the way.
It's their job.
Just try not to knock anything over, okay?
I don't need to stay? Only if you want to.
Blunt chest trauma. Asymmetric BPs.
Dropped his pressure en route. 60 palp.
Tachy at 120. Sir, do you know where you are?
I was taking a plane.
Oriented times one only.
Marked tachypnea. Pulse ox 88.
BENTON: Heart sounds are muffled.
What does that mean? He trashed his aorta.
BENTON: All right, it's the major artery from the heart.
Neck veins are distended. He's in tamponade.
Have the OR prime bypass.
You our new third year?
No, I'm just applying.
BENTON: Come on, get over here.
Move. All right, let's prep for pericardiocentesis.
HALEH: Too late. Lost the pulse.
All right, thoracotomy tray. You better put on a gown.
It's going to get bloody in here.
What have you got? We got abdominal wound. BP's 120/90.
We're taking her to Lakeshore.
What, are you kidding me?
She needs a trauma center.
All right, reroute to County.
Give her ten more of MS and watch the pressure.
Yeah, well, we're supposed to rotate. Just do it.
MORALES: Doc! Doc! Yeah.
Tracheal shift to the left. You need to stick him.
What's his pulse ox?
88 on high flow O-2.
I can't hear
anything with all this noise.
Did you get it?
I don't know.
Are these all ours? No.
It's the damn news.
Okay, he's moving air.
Take him to County, not Lakeshore.
Tell them he needs a chest tube, maybe a vent. All right.
( screaming in pain ) DAVIS: Whoa, whoa. Stop.
No, don't you stop. Are you okay?
I think I may have strained my back.
Go on. Keep digging.
We can't. If we keep digging
the weight of the train will shift on you.
Is that crane coming? From Indiana.
It's on its way, Lorcan. What?!
What's his pressure?
85 palp. Pulse 110.
Four units in.
Can you assist?
Yeah, I can start.
CORDAY: Lorcan, listen to me.
I'm going to have to proceed with amputating
both your legs. No.
No! I've had people trapped for hours before we got them out.
I appreciate that, but you've lost too much blood.
If I don't amputate
and control the bleeding, you're going to die.
Okay, then.
I'm going to start.
Do you understand?
I have to start now.
Prep the area.
Ten blade.
( groans )
Can you tell my fortune with these?
Pick up each card
from your pile
and put it under the card to which it belongs.
Is that the death card?
I'll tell you if you're right or wrong.
Are you ready to begin?
Hit me.
Begin.
No.
No, just try the next card.
No.
Yes.
Third one's a charm.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Look, two hands.
Yes.
No.
No?
No.
No.
Do you ever say anything
besides yes or no?
No.
CORDAY: I've isolated the femoral artery.
Retract distally.
CARTER: I've got some oozing from the SFA.
LORCAN: Mitch?
CORDAY: Can't do much about that in the field.
Mitch! I'm right here, buddy.
I think maybe you should get Patty.
You got it.
I need to dissect this vessel out.
Metz.
Oh!
What? Ah.
What is it? Carter, quick, clamp that.
Clamp it. Clamp what? What, what, what?
Medial to the muscle bed. Clamp it now.
Is it your back?
It's coming and going.
Intermittent pain?
Yes.
How often?
( groans )
What's her pressure? Dropping. 80 palp.
Myles.
KOVAC: Start her on dopamine, titrate to a hundred.
Save him, please.
How long till you're through?
I don't know. Ten minutes maybe.
McMANUS: Pupils are still sluggish.
KOVAC: Okay, .3 of atropine.
Do you have any mannitol?
On board.
Hang 40 grams.
He's hypertensive and bradying down.
I know.
He could have a bleed.
You're not going with us?
Okay, load him.
I'll be right back.
Carter...
I have to take this boy in.
There's a woman back there
impaled with spinal shock
and I want you to stay with...
What is it?
CARTER: She's having contractions. What?!
She's having contractions at 25 weeks!
I need tocolysis and a fetal monitor.
I can keep on going
if I can just get them to stop.
Do you have any terbutaline?
No. In the rig?
We don't carry it.
Okay, you should fly back with us.
What about him? We just opened the anterior compartment.
Call another surgeon.
CORDAY: We're out of O-neg.
We have to finish him now.
If we put you on the chopper, could you monitor this boy
on the flight back?
Yes, but he could exsanguinate
from his left leg.
You were a surgical resident, yeah?
Intern. For a year.
( sighing )
WEAVER: Trauma panel.
WEAVER: Chest and pelvis. Get a hemocue.
Sinus, rate of 95.
Any chest pain?
No. Mild guarding.
WEAVER: No rebound. Set her up
for a CT and put in a foley.
Is that man from the train?
Yeah.
I don't know. Is he dying?
Abby, could you shut the doors?
Type and cross for four, dip a urine.
More O-neg on the infuser.
The heart's not filling.
HALEH: Unit seven going up.
Got it. Cut. Okay, come on, you're done.
We've got to shock him. Hold on, couple more sutures.
Dr. Benton, Dr. Finch needs you. Bad leg injury.
Got it.
Clear.
BENTON: Dr. Malucci, he's all yours.
If you get a rhythm
send him up. White, you're coming with me.
HALEH: Still in V-fib.
MALUCCI: Another amp of epi.
Stand by with lidocaine. Clear.
Set up the slit lamp, tetracaine and fluoroscein.
I'll be right there.
Dr. Benton, blunt abdominal trauma, possible liver injury.
What's the crit?
34, but he's pretty tender.
All right, do an ultrasound.
If you see free fluid in the belly, call me.
Chuni, I need vitals now. Coming.
Traumatic extrusion of the tibia.
You call ortho?
Yes, but it's looking pretty dusky.
Hold on, that's my bone.
All the major vessels seem intact.
Let's try to get him up there.
MARQUEZ: Peter, Carter's on the radio.
Needs to talk to you. Not now.
He's performing a double amputation by himself. What?
Don't worry, sir. That can be reimplanted.
Okay, give another 20 MS.
MARQUEZ: Okay, he's on Bravo Three.
Carter, what are you doing?
Left anterior thigh.
I've incised through the fascia and muscle planes.
I need to isolate the nerve... BENTON: Wait, whoa, whoa.
Hold on, I thought Corday went with you.
She did.
Well, what is she doing?
McMANUS: BP's rocketing. 240/120.
Pulse down to 30.
Another mig of atropine and mix nipride.
He's in respiratory arrest.
I'll intubate.
6.5 ET tube.
Should we stay on the ground?
No. Let's go.
50 of lido, one of pavulon, 50 of sux.
You okay?
No.
( helicopter whirring )
BENTON: Using the dull edge of the Metz or your finger
continue blunt dissection of the artery
from the neuro-vascular bundle.
What?
Blunt dissection.
Is the clamp in place?
You're going to have to shout.
I can barely hear you.
Is the clamp in place?
Do you know what you're doing?
Does anybody know what they're doing?
What's he down to now?
190/100. Pulse 44 after two minutes.
Try 80 of Lasix. Let them take him downstairs.
No, go straight to CT.
There's a case on the table.
( groaning ): He probably has an epidural.
I'll tell them.
How often have you been having back pain?
Every four, five minutes.
When's the last time you felt the baby move?
I don't know.
I haven't.
Okay.
Got it!
Can you call on the radio and see how he is?
We'll be there soon.
BP 95/65. Pulse is 110.
( yells )
Am I going to die?
Am I?
We'll get you out.
If I die before I get there
you have to make sure they take care of Myles.
They will.
He's seven.
I know.
His father's in Kansas City on business.
We were coming back from... visiting him.
I thought it'd be fun for Myles to take the train.
What about the sciatic nerve?!
BENTON ( on radio ): Pull it down as far as possible.
Then apply an Oschner clamp.
That one, third to the right.
Okay, got it now.
All right.
Put a second clamp five millimeters distally.
We're going to get you through this, all right, Lorcan?
We're going to get you through.
You're going to be all right, okay?
Remove the proximal clamp and ligate the crushed area.
O-vicryl?!
No, no, no. Nonabsorbable.
Peter, we need you. This boy is herniating.
Use silk if you've got it.
Okay, done that!
Peter! We've got to drain the hematoma.
Carter, I've to go.
Call me on your cell phone.
I don't have it! It's in my locker!
Well, find one! Peter, now!
CARTER: What do I do about this nerve?!
Dr. Benton?!
Dr. Benton?!
What is it?!
Do you have a cell phone?
No. Do you?
N-No.
Terbutaline's on board.
CHEN: Repeat in another hour.
Are you sure McLucas hasn't answered?
Well, we just paged her. Give her a second.
What about Mark?
He's on his way.
Okay, you're about 25% effaced
but dimpled, not dilated.
Okay? We can control that.
You think so?
An OB resident's on his way...
I don't want a resident!
Elizabeth, you have to calm down and focus, okay?
Give the terbutaline a chance to work.
Mark's on the phone.
What line? Three.
Climbing again. 220/115.
Blown right pupil.
He needs a burhole now.
Where's your perforating drill?
Haleh, is One open?
Yeah, Malucci's calling it.
Connect the chisel bit.
Let's keep hyperventilating him.
Come on, people. Let's move!
Coming through!
No, no, no. Shove him up against the wall!
Move!
All right, let somebody shave his head.
Give me 8h gloves.
WEAVER: Sit him up at 30 degrees.
Peter, Carter's on line three.
He needs to talk to you.
White, get over here. Hold the phone up to my ear.
10-blade.
Pressure's through the roof. 260/140.
All right, good. Up the nipride to three mikes.
Come on, put my glasses down.
All right, Carter.
Talk to me. Where are you?
Sciatic nerve!
All right, good. Cut proximally and let
the muscle retract into the muscle belly.
Lorcan, they found Patty.
They're going to send a truck
to take her straight to the hospital.
Okay, cutting now! No, no, forget it...
Good. Make sure you use a scalpel instead of scissors.
Otherwise, you'll get a neuroma.
She's already on her way.
She wants to come.
No! No! Would you please hold him still?!
Okay, now what?!
Now take two Kellys
and clamp the femoral artery and vein together.
I don't want her to see me like this!
Can you give him something?
Whoa, whoa. He's seizing.
WEAVER: Five of Ativan.
Give him five of Valium.
Put the phone right here.
I don't want her to see me!
You got to hold him still until it kicks in.
You're almost free.
Is that two clamps each, or two clamps altogether?
Two altogether!
Two of Ativan? Five.
Am I clamping the vein
and artery separately?!
Carter, clamp the vessels as one unit at both ends.
Ativan's on board. Still seizing.
All right, you know what. I got to go in.
Just re-paralyze him.
Is that both proximally
distally or one proximally...
Carter, just clamp the damn vessels!
All right, go.
How many liters in?
Two and a half.
Lost the pulse.
She's in V-fib. Charge to 200.
Do you want her to run her inside?
No, here.
Paddles.
Charging.
Clear.
Still in V-fib.
Charge to 300.
Clear.
Mark. Penetrating back injury.
Needs to go straight to the OR.
All right, I'll tell Randi.
Mark.
Feel any more contractions?
I'm so sorry.
Don't be.
I slipped and fell.
I thought it was just backache.
You did you give her terbutaline?
Ten minutes ago.
Fetal heart tones?
155. No decels.
Well, that's good.
They haven't stopped.
You've got to give it some time to work.
Maybe we should try magnesium.
We will if we have to, okay?
Let's just wait and see.
It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay.
Irrigate. More Ativan?
No. Stopped seizing once he relieved
the intracranial pressure.
Suction catheter.
Carter, are you through the tibia yet?
( grunts ) Done. Almost there, Lorcan.
Good. Use the ronguer to bevel the anterior apex.
Where is that?
It's the sharp edge at the end of the bone.
What's his pressure? Down to 170/60.
They're all sharp...
Aah... Damn it!
It's the anterior surface that you care about.
Dr. Weaver, I need you in here.
What patient? The girl who got hit by the train.
I'm sorry. What?!
The anterior surface.
Get him upstairs. Peter, let's go.
Carter, you're almost there.
When you're done, use the ronguer to crack the fibula.
Wait, wait, wait!
Hold on! Hold on!
Dr. Benton?!
Dr. Benton?!
Good luck.
BP's. a little low.
You want me to put the dopamine back on?
No. Wait till she's in the OR. Hold the elevator!
No, this one goes straight up.
Status: post-cardiac arrest.
I just opened up this kid's head.
Did you evacuate the clot?
Yeah, but there's still active bleeding at the site.
He was lucky to get her back the first time.
BENTON: All right, go.
No, take the boy first.
Call neurosurg. Tell them we're on our way up.
I need two units of FFP and ICP monitor.
85 palp.
Start the dopamine.
What is it?
I wanted to ask you something.
He die?
Who?
That man.
They cut open his chest.
But he died.
Yes, he had a fatal injury.
What about the boy?
He went up to surgery.
Is he going to die?
I don't know.
Is there someone we can call for you?
Your mom or dad?
They won't understand.
Won't understand what?
I thought it would be painless.
The train would hit my car...
I'd just be gone.
Don't talk to me about saturated.
You haven't seen saturated.
Chuny, I need a trauma panel--
type four and cross for Four.
What's open? Nothing.
I don't care. I'm admitting them.
They're holding OR Six for you.
There's no surgeon up there. Is he stable?
Yeah, his BP's stable at 100, but I had to sedate him,
Dr. Carter, are you deaf?! What?
I keep shouting, and you keep getting on the elevator? I'm sorry.
Is this the pre-op amputation? No. Post-op.
What, in the field? Yeah. He was trapped.
What did they use, a chain saw?!
Dr. Benton talked me through it.
You did this?
There was nobody else to do it, so I...
By all means, then let's get whoever's available.
You ought to try it next time.
Yeah, maybe if you'd respond to your page...
I can't wear my pager in the dojo.
Brenda knew where I was.
You should have called her.
What the hell happened anyway?
Dr. Weaver, flail chest in four
just dropped his pulse ox down to 81.
By all means give him another surgical procedure.
Maybe I just should have let him die?
Stop crying. I'll clean up after you.
Good work, Carter. I know.
Really. He was lucky that you were out there.
Thank you. Carter!
I'm coming!
LEGAPSI: Kerry?
Yeah.
You have a suicidal ideation?
16-year-old girl in Trauma Two.
She have a plan?
Parked her car in front of a train.
Oh, I suppose that qualifies.
She's also in a major depression.
Flat affect?
No real remorse.
About the suicide attempt?
For the train wreck.
Oh, my.
Do you think that
you're going to get off before 12:00?
Hmm, probably not.
Okay.
Uh, I'll try to be quiet.
No. Wake me.
MAN: Something wrong?
Hey...
What?
Is there something wrong with my heart?
No. Probably a bruise to your chest wall.
We'll get an X-ray to make sure. You were lucky.
We're still sifting through the walking wounded
but I think we're over the hump.
Carter just took the last critical.
How many came in?
37.
Five up in surgery.
Only two ER deaths.
That's not bad, considering.
Yeah, if you don't count the DOAs.
You did great work today.
You should go home. We got it from here.
The board's backing up.
That's all right. We got it.
Go home. See you tomorrow.
Shirley called for you.
What?
OR nurse-- you asked her to call
when the mom and son came out of surgery.
Did they?
Yeah. They're in recovery.
The mom's got sensation in her legs
and the kid's neurologically intact.
That's good, right?
Yeah. That's good.
Okay.
Ah, you still here, huh?
Nurses put me to work.
Thought I was a volunteer or something.
( laughs ): Good.
Now you've got an experience
to talk about in your interview.
I don't know.
Hey, it shows.
You might as well use it.
I mean, I don't know if I want to.
Want to what?
What I saw tonight...
most people go their whole lives without seeing stuff like that:
drilling into a little boy's head;
guys having their legs cut off;
people dying right in front of you...
You get used to it.
Yeah. That's what I'm afraid of
but thanks for helping me find out early.
Go to the interview.
Dr. Benton... Go to the interview.
You might feel differently in a few days.
I know, but...
Hey, give yourself options.
Anything?
No contractions since the third round.
Fetal heart rate looks good.
So, it's over?
Aside from bed rest.
How long do you think?
( clears throat )
You can catch me up on my soaps.
It'll be okay.
When I felt the baby move before--
obviously I knew it was in there--
but suddenly this feels real, you know?
Yes, Mom.
OB's waiting
and transpo promises
they'll be down soon to take you up.
Thanks, Abby.
I'll keep it on until I give birth.
You just have to slow down. ( writing )
No more helicopters.
Right.
Hey.
Hey.
You're leaving?
Uh, no, I-I thought I'd check on the bishop.
Another critical come in?
No. That's it.
Is she stable?
Yeah, after three rounds of terbutaline.
Good.
Yeah, it was scary, though.
Yeah.
You heading home soon?
Uh, I don't know.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
Any change?
He didn't want the breathing mask.
Has he been awake?
Napping on and off.
( snoring softly )
What time is it?
11:30.
You're here late.
You'll have to be intubated soon.
On a ventilator?
Mm-mm.
Your oxygen level is down to 65 on 100% oxygen.
I've seen what happens after the ventilator.
If it drops below 50...
Thanks, but no thanks.
Anyway...
my bags are packed.
How long do I have?
Maybe hours.
Then I'd better hear it now.
Hear what?
Your confession.
Oh, Bishop, I don't think...
That's what you came up here for, isn't it?
I wanted to check on you.
You're searching for your faith.
You think you lost it, but you only buried it.
It's never left you.
In the name of the Father
and the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
Amen.
May God, who enlightens every heart
help you to know your sins and trust in His mercy.
( snickers )
Father, I-I can't... Luka....
Your heart is burdened, Luka.
Talk to me.
Let me take that burden with me.
I don't know. I, uh...
lost my family.
Danijela, my wife, she, uh... wanted to move out of Vukovar
but, um, I had to finish my internship
and, uh...
soon it was too late.
It wasn't safe to move.
I was going to get some supplies
and, um... I made them stay behind.
I was just crossing the street
when the mortar shell hit the apartment building.
Go on.
I ran inside.
There were my neighbors--
hurt, bleeding, dying
but I... but I passed them by.
I-I had to get to my family.
Danijela!
Danijela!
Danijela!
Danijela!
WOMAN: Luka!
Luka...
Marko... Marko...
Marko...
Luka, Marko!
Marko...
( groaning )
( speaking Croatian )
( speaking Croatian )
A piece of shrapnel had torn into Danijela's spleen
and she was bleeding to death.
When I turned back to my daughter
she wasn't breathing, and I, uh... I lost her pulse.
But as long as I, uh, kept doing CPR
and breathing for my daughter, I thought she had a chance.
Danijela...
I could only pray that, uh...
someone would get there to help.
( shouting in Croatian )
If I'd picked up Danijela at that moment
and gotten her to the hospital, she... could have had surgery.
You know, she could have lived
but I couldn't leave my little girl.
( blowing )
Danijela.
( speaking Croatian )
I waited and prayed.
I prayed someone would come.
( shouting in Croatian )
And no one came.
No one came.
Jasna.
Jasna.
I called out for hours as I stayed there...
breathing for her, doing CPR.
I finally had to stop from exhaustion.
I lost them all.
You couldn't sacrifice the one to save the other.
Even if you had, you'd still blame yourself.
( sobbing )
These things can't be explained...
why it happens.
The providence of God and the mysteries of life and death
are the very fiber of our faith.
They were gifts of love and life.
You are a gift of love and life.
Don't turn your back on them.
God...
Father of all mercies
through the death and resurrection
of your only begotten Son...
was reconciled Himself to the world
and sent the Holy Spirit among us
for the forgiveness of sins
through the ministry of Holy Church...
may God give you pardon and peace
and I absolve you of all your sins.
In the name of the Father and of the Son
and of the Holy Spirit.
Amen.
Amen.
