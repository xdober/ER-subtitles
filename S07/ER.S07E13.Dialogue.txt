Previously on ER:
I'll give you the Solu-Medrol if you promise to use a walker.
What, are we negotiating?
Do you want the steroids?
I'll use a cane.
...So screw me! ...Spineless, spiteful ass!
Are you done?
No!
You are in violation of our divorce agreement.
I am hiring a lawyer and I am getting my tuition money.
What's going on?
With what?
With you and Carter?
Nothing.
It seemed like you were fighting.
We were.
Is Mark doing okay?
Very well.
There's no change in personality or...?
He's a little tired. Why?
Have you noticed that he's mixing his pronouns?
It's not a game!
She blew his brains out!
Who is "she"?
What?
You said "she."
He. He's dead.
Hey, Greg.
Hey, Dr. Greene.
Busy day, huh?
Yeah. Sorry I'm late.
Could we skip the gown? I got a shift.
Oh, sure, yeah. Let's go.
You know, they say we're going to hit zero tonight.
Even with the snow?
Yeah, I thought my heating bill was bad last month.
Feel any side effects?
Just the usual fatigue.
Well, in 8 days this will all be a memory.
Believe me, I've been counting.
Okay, hold on, 'cause we're off by about a millimeter or so.
Take your time.
I don't want anything
to get zapped that doesn't have to be.
There we go.
I'm going to lock you in now.
Here we go.
You okay?
Yep.
About three minutes.
Right.
WEAVER: What have we got?
58-year-old male, collapsed at a birthday party.
Intubated in the field.
Whoa! That's a clown.
He aspirated a balloon in front of--
Okay. Malucci, you take it.
Good air entry. BP's 105 over 70.
Carter, will you help Abby with this?
Why can't you do it? I... I just can't.
LOCKHART: What's the matter, Dave?
You afraid of clowns?
Maybe he had a bad circus experience.
How long was he down for?
Three to five minutes.
We found him in respiratory arrest.
Okay, let's hook him up to a vent.
EKG, CBC, lytes, cardiac enzymes.
HALEH: Dr. Carter, will you talk to this woman?
And get a chest film.
I want to check the tube placement.
Yeah, what's up?
I've got this dirty needle. I want a clean one.
We don't do that here. Like I said.
A doctor here gave this to me.
He said if I come back today, I can have a clean one.
There's a van you can call...
I don't want to call the van.
I just want a clean needle.
I'm sorry, I cannot help you.
Dr. Carter. He said I wouldn't
have to wait.
Some girl called you.
Said she can't make it tonight-- flu.
"Some girl"?
So you didn't get a name?
You got more than one date tonight?
Oh, great.
Big date?
It had potential.
So ask someone else.
No, it's this charity event.
It's going to be boring.
Nobody's going to want to go.
Why? Ask someone in the ER. Like who?
I don't know. Chuni?
What? You want to go?
Not me. I've got plans.
Don't even look at me.
MAN: Dr. Carter?
Hey, sorry about that.
I got pulled away there.
You were going to give me something for the canker sores.
Can you give Jeff here some viscous lidocaine?
They haven't taken my blood yet.
No? Someone will be in there.
Do you think it's something serious?
Probably not, but with two weeks of fever
we should check out a few things.
How are we doing in here?
Some spontaneous movement, but he's still out.
So, what are you doing tonight?
I've got an appointment with my couch.
Pulse ox 98 on 50%.
Well, I hate to come between you and your couch
but how does dinner and dancing at the History Museum sound?
Dancing at the museum?
Pressure's down to 90 over 60.
Run a 500 of saline.
Yeah, it's a benefit for an after-school program.
Ah, a charity date.
How's the EKG coming?
Almost done.
Yeah, my grandparents host
this annual event, and I have to go.
But I would think of it as a favor...
Do I owe you a favor?
( chuckles )
At the very least, it's a free meal.
Tombstones on the anterior leads.
Let's push 6000 of heparin and call the cath lab.
BP's only 70 systolic.
Abby, go get Dr. Weaver.
Start dopamine at ten mikes per kilo per minute.
Put him in Trendelenburg.
Doctor Weaver, this clown is crashing.
So what do you think about tonight?
I think it's the least I can do.
No one should be alone after killing a clown.
You killed the clown?
No.
Didn't save him.
Enough flu on the board?
'Tis the season.
Guy in Curtain Three fell off a ladder.
Oh yeah, how far?
He was taking down Christmas lights.
He fell from the top rung.
That's what you get for procrastinating.
I'll take it.
Oh, there he is.
This is my doctor.
Hi, Janice.
They wouldn't give me a needle.
Haleh, take her needle and give her a clean one.
You serious?
We I and D'd the abscess on her forearm yesterday.
I got that.
Well, this will keep it from happening again.
Thank you, Dr. Greene.
Come back tomorrow for a wound check.
I'll try.
MALUCCI: You're not going to fill out
out a chart? Nope.
No prescription?
Waste of time.
I can get behind that.
Excuse me, I'm looking for Dr. Kovac.
I know you.
You're the bishop, right?
Right. Right.
Where's that hat you were wearing the other day?
Oh, I left that one at home today.
Oh, I really liked it.
Me, too.
There he is.
Hello, again.
Bishop, are you all right?
Oh, yeah, sure.
I was just finishing up my visitations.
Do you have a moment?
I don't see a cane.
No, you don't.
Have any more pain?
Not from the fall.
Your arthritis is still a problem?
I was wondering if I could get another prescription
for some prednisone to keep me going.
Did you follow up with your doctor?
No, I keep having to change the appointment.
Well, that should be the priority, Bishop.
I know. Unfortunately, he doesn't work on Saturdays.
What's his name?
Don Frost at St. Mary's.
I should call him.
You'll only get his service.
And frankly, just between us, I'd rather not get him going.
I so much as sneeze
and he wants to poke and prod every inch of me.
I'd have to do some tests
before prescribing anything more.
What kind of tests?
Blood, urine. Check your sugar level.
My sugar is a little high.
I have a touch of diabetes, but I control it with diet.
Okay, let's take a look.
MAN: Ah.
Ah.
Ah. Ah.
Looks good.
It's strep throat, right?
No fever, no swollen glands...
I had the exact thing last year.
It was strep.
You have a cold, Mr. Ramirez.
Antibiotics, ten days, right?
No white spots on your tonsils.
Antibiotics won't help.
Well, last year I took them, and it cleared right up.
It would have cleared up anyway.
Come on, Doc, I've been waiting three hours here.
Plenty of fluids, and get some rest.
Can you just give me the prescription?
LOCKHART: Dr. Greene...
we need you.
You don't have strep throat.
I'll take them just in case.
85-year-old woman, collapsed at her nursing home.
You got a pulse? No.
Found her in fine v-fib.
Intubated, shocked her five times, two rounds of drugs.
How long you been at it? Twenty minutes.
She's pretty blue.
Okay, everybody, nice and easy.
On my count...
one, two, three.
Any medical history?
Emphysema.
She's on home oxygen.
Asystole on the monitor.
When was the last epi?
Five minutes ago.
Push another amp.
What?
She didn't respond to 20 minutes of ACLS in the field.
She doesn't have a chance.
I know. The family wanted us to bring her in.
Why? So we could flog her for another hour?
You want Dopamine?
Nope.
I'm sorry, Dr. Greene.
She should have died in her own bed.
Abby, hold compressions.
Asystole.
Time of death, 14:09.
Family's in Chairs.
Don't worry about it.
Hey.
Hey.
Everything okay?
We just lost a patient.
Sorry.
That singer you like is playing at the hotel tonight.
Really?
10:00.
I told Carter I'd go somewhere with him tonight.
Oh, okay.
It's a fund-raiser thing.
His date stood him up.
It's not a problem.
I have a pile of journals to read.
Well, I'm sorry.
I wouldn't have said yes if I knew that...
Labs back on the bishop.
Blood sugar's high.
Go, have fun.
Okay.
Draw five units.
Take a look at his ANA.
Do you have his BUN and creatinine?
Renal insufficiency.
Hey, Jeff.
You okay?
Just nervous.
Sit.
I've got your blood tests back.
Okay, the bad news is you have mononucleosis.
The good news is if you rest up
you'll bounce back in a couple weeks.
Mono.
Yeah, but you'll be all right.
How is my blood count?
Uh, white cells were a little elevated
but that's consistent with mono.
What about my CD-four count?
Are you HIV positive?
'Cause we only do that if you are.
I think I need an HIV test.
Have you ever been tested before?
Five months ago. I was negative.
That's good.
But since then, I've been exposed.
You've had unprotected sex?
With an infected partner.
You know how unsafe that is?
I guess I just get caught up.
You've got to put a stop to that, Jeff.
Is my sugar that bad?
Three hundred forty-eight.
Maybe I should go back on the glipizide.
Right now, you need insulin.
There was also protein in your urine, so I ordered
an ANA.
That's a test
for a disease called lupus.
I know.
I take plaquenil.
200 milligrams a day.
You lied to me?
I wanted to avoid a debate.
I may have harmed you by giving you those steroids.
The steroids help me.
I can move around, make visits...
do my work.
Without them, I'm stuck in bed.
The steroids raise your blood sugar so high
that the diabetes destroys your body.
I need to continue my ministry.
You understand?
Anyway, thank you for your time.
I need to do a complete physical exam.
Oh! No, I'm sorry.
I've got a lot on my plate today.
I have to make sure I didn't harm you with my treatment.
You owe me that much.
And what is it you think I owe you?
Bishop...
lupus is very serious.
It can attack your kidneys, lungs, your heart...
I know what it does, Dr. Kovac.
I even know I'm going to die from it.
Did I wake you?
No, I was just resting my eyes.
So how's the heart?
EKG looks good.
That's what we like to hear.
Do you want me to call someone to come be with you?
No.
I called the archdiocese, just in case.
What church do you belong to?
I don't.
Haven't found one you liked?
Haven't looked.
How long have you been in Chicago?
I don't go to church anymore.
Really?
Why is that?
I don't remember.
You married?
No.
Haven't found one you liked?
Something like that, yeah.
Dr. Kovac, we've got a kid
with bad congestive heart failure.
The nurse will be in.
What's the pulse ox?
Eighty-one.
16-year-old, collapsed at a basketball game.
Watching or playing?
Watching.
What's his name?
Nick.
Hi, Nick, I'm Dr. Kovac.
Whoa.
Have you had heart surgery, Nick?
Transplant.
How long ago?
Six years.
Okay, did someone call his parents?
SILVA: On their way.
BP 115/72.
Lungs are full of fluid.
He's in pulmonary edema.
Sublingual nitroglycerine and start a drip.
Open your mouth, Nick. This will help.
Okay, titrate up to 10 of morphine.
I need a 12 lead, blood gas, portable chest, and 40 of Lasix.
Pulse ox down to 78.
Notify the transplant team, and order a PICU bed.
They want to give me a new heart?
Yes.
I don't want another transplant.
Malucci, what have you got in Exam Four?
Uh, lady with bronchitis
sending her out with Amoxicillin.
Bronchitis?
Yeah, productive cough, myalgias, arthralgias...
Sounds like the flu.
She's pretty high-maintenance--
she wants antibiotics.
Antibiotics are not indicated.
I told her that, but she still wants them.
Well, you need to educate her about antibiotic resistance.
Do I have to?
Got to break the cycle.
Well, it's easier to just write a prescription.
If you feed the bears, they'll come back for more.
CARTER: Food poisoning gets another liter of saline.
Check a post reduction shoulder on this one.
This is a patient who's waiting on an HIV test.
Okay, Malucci can take it.
This last one's pretty delicate--
he's high-risk.
Well, Malucci can be delicate.
Thank you, Chief.
No, really...
Dave, this one's... going to require some tact.
You got it.
He's a patient with mono.
He's gay, refuses to use condoms.
Think you can talk to him without being insensitive?
Sure, I'll wrap it all up in a nice big bow.
Carter.
A construction worker
had a pane of glass dropped on him.
Could you help with the suturing?
Actually, I'm off, and I've got to get going.
Oh, yeah, the fund-raiser.
Yeah.
Yeah, you know, it's more like a family obligation.
It's nothing really exciting.
What's the charity?
After-school enrichment programs.
Enrichment?
Yeah, it's like, you know, extra education
in arts, music, that kind of thing.
Actually, Abby's saving me
from getting heat from my grandparents.
They kind of insist that I bring somebody.
I hope it's successful.
Thank you.
You're welcome. See you.
Hey, Jeff, I'm Dr. Malucci.
Dr. Carter went off duty.
Do you, uh, have his lab results?
I'd like to talk to Jeff about that.
Would you excuse us, please?
Actually, I'd like to stay.
I'm Sean, Jeff's partner.
Is that okay with you, Jeff?
Yeah.
Okay, well, it's all good, man.
Your HIV antibody test came back negative.
Really?
Yeah, you got lucky.
But now you need to avoid risky behavior
and keep yourself healthy.
Yeah.
Am I missing something here, guys?
I'm HIV positive.
Oh.
Jeff and I are together.
Through everything.
Right.
So what, are you trying to contract HIV?
You a bug chaser, Jeff?
We don't call it that.
Really. Then what do you call it, suicide?
HIV is treatable with medication.
That doesn't mean you should try and catch it.
Look, we both know
that his HIV antibody could be negative
for six weeks after exposure
so you can't really tell us
that he's definitely negative, can you?
No.
We'd have to take
a direct measure of his viral load.
Okay, let's do that.
That's going to take some time.
We'll wait.
Yeah, we'll wait.
Okay.
Flat T-waves in the lateral leads.
Okay, repeat 12 lead in an hour.
Something wrong?
You have some non-specific EKG changes.
And there's a friction rub around your heart.
( chuckles )
I'm creaky all over.
Have you had chest pain?
Occasionally. I'm used to it.
How about today?
This morning.
For how long?
I don't know-- half an hour.
You may have fluid around the heart.
You could be at risk for a heart attack.
I feel fine.
I need to get a cardiac echo
and admit you.
No.
I have to observe your heart
for at least six hours.
Well, I'll stay around six hours then
but I don't want to be checked in.
I'd rather observe you in the cardiac unit.
Look, I don't want my life to end in a hospital.
You're not going to die today.
I will not be admitted.
Are you Nick's doctor?
Yes, Dr. Kovac.
There's no doctor with him, just a nurse.
Well, Nick is stable right now.
WOMAN: He was in heart failure?
Yes, he's responding to aggressive therapy.
He has pulmonary edema.
The same thing happened after his second transplant.
He's had two?
One when he was four, then again when he was ten
and now he's on the list for a third.
They did angioplasty last year, but he's still so weak.
Has Nick ever told you he doesn't want a new heart?
He says that when he's depressed.
He takes 15 medications a day.
He's still so sick.
A lot for a 16-year-old to go through, huh?
Can you call UNOS?
He should go to a higher status.
I was waiting to talk to you
to see if that's what you wanted.
Of course we do.
Okay.
Dr. Greene, my flu patient wants to see someone higher up.
What's the problem?
She wants antibiotics.
Says she gets them every year.
Refuses to leave until she gets a prescription.
Where is she?
Right there-- Curtain One.
Hello, my name's Dr. Greene.
Sara Dell.
I've been sick for three days.
Fever, runny nose
feel like my head's in a vise.
Mrs. Dell, antibiotics don't help the flu.
They always help mine.
I can assure you, they don't.
You're not giving them to me 'cause I'm poor.
If we give antibiotics
to millions of people who don't need them
a resistance builds which eventually makes the drugs
useless to the people who do.
And 'cause I don't have insurance, that's persecution.
You think so?
I know so.
You know what, follow me.
Well, where are going?
Come on, follow me, pay attention.
Excuse me...
( clears throat )
My name is Dr. Greene.
I'd like to see a show of hands
of people who have a sore throat.
Okay, cough.
Muscle aches, fever.
You all have the flu.
People who have the flu
will not be receiving antibiotics today
so consider that while you decide
whether you want to wait or not.
What are you doing?
Clearing the board.
Isn't that an EMTALA violation?
I didn't discharge anyone.
Hey, Greene.
Tell me you are not giving free needles to junkies.
On a case-by-case basis.
No, no, no, no, on no basis--
it's illegal.
Not if there's a public health emergency
which there is.
How much of your brain did they cut out?
This does not put extra needles on the street.
I don't care! We are not going to have a bunch
of low-life junkies parading in and out of here.
So you're not interested in cutting back on HIV and...
And?
What? Sounds like...?
Hep...
Hep?
Hep...
Hep... Heparin?
Heptathlon?
Hepatitis.
Tough one.
Tell you what, you want to start
a needle exchange, do it from your house.
( knocking )
Hi.
You're wearing a tuxedo. Yeah.
You didn't say it was formal.
I didn't?
No. Oh.
Yeah, it's formal.
You tricked me.
It doesn't really matter.
You look terrific.
Well, yet we don't match, though.
I mean, I can't...
I could go change.
I don't even know if I own a dress.
Want to go buy one?
No, can you just...
Just wait one minute.
Are you mad at me?
Yes.
Did you get a haircut?
Yeah.
Who are my parents talking to?
Dr. Corday. She's a surgeon.
I told you I didn't want surgery.
You were in a lot of pain when you said that.
I still meant it.
You won't survive without the transplant.
I was hoping to make it to my prom
but if I can't, I can't.
With a new heart, you will.
Do you know what it's like to have your chest split open?
No.
I can barely walk to class, I get so tired.
I take pills every two hours
and I look like a freak from the side-effects.
It's not worth it.
He's at the top of the list?
Yes, Status 1-A, now it's just a matter of waiting
for a donor heart with a tissue match.
We waited a month on Status 1-A last time.
Well, now that he's a little older
there are more possibilities.
Excuse me, Mr. and Mrs. Stevens
but Nick doesn't want a new heart.
We explained that to you.
He's thought it out.
He has good reasons.
I think you should listen to them.
He's 16.
And he is tired of living like this.
Well, I'm not giving up on him
because he's tired.
I'm only telling you what Nick told me.
I understand.
When do we move him to the unit?
It shouldn't be too long.
Kerry, we have a little personnel problem.
Well, you do-- Mark Greene.
Mark?
Yeah, he's walking around with attitude.
He's handing out needles.
He's blacking out on words.
Yeah, it's swelling from the chemotherapy wafers.
Well, really...
It's temporary.
Well, I don't like it.
Well, I don't think he likes it, either.
Oh, come on, you haven't noticed any personality changes?
Like what?
Like he got very confrontational with me.
You're used to confrontation, Robert.
We're not talking about me.
Isn't that your favorite subject?
Just straighten him out.
Who's this with you at the beach?
Eric, my brother.
You know, I never got the whole concept behind dried flowers.
I mean, they're dead.
They're dead as soon as you cut them.
Yeah, but they look nice.
Dead ones look nice, too.
Right.
Right, no, I was just wondering.
Wondering what?
Wondering, um, why not just buy the, uh... fresh flowers?
Because there's something sad and dark about the dried ones.
Oh, yeah, you like sad and dark?
Yeah.
Okay.
Just give those a couple days.
Wow, you found something.
That looks nice.
It's a bridesmaid's dress.
Oh, well, it works on you.
You're lying.
No, honestly.
I don't think anybody would know that.
It looks like it was, um... made for you.
Okay, now I know you're lying.
Let's just go.
Carter.
What?
What is this?
Oh, come on, what, do you want to take the EL?
You're not going to take me to the airport
and tell me, by the way, this party's in Paris?
No, we stay in Chicago, I promise.
He needs bandages, update his tetanus
and order a six-pack of Keflex.
You lost your cap.
I decided to wear my scar with pride.
It adds character.
It scared a little kid.
He called me Humpty Dumpty.
Well, Humpty, how do you feel about an evening service?
What service? The wedding.
The coordinator double-booked the afternoon
and they want to push us back to 5:00.
That would push the reception back.
Yes. Well, I've already spoken with the caterer.
He says he can do it
but we can't use the patio for cocktails.
What's wrong with the patio?
April, the evening, it would be really chilly.
Well, ask him to move out the, uh...
um, you know, uh...
space heaters.
So it's all right with you?
Yeah, sure.
Okay, then.
Mark?
You're getting better.
The aphasia's fading.
I'm glad you think so.
No, it is.
In a couple of weeks, this will all be gone.
I don't think I can count on you for an unbiased opinion.
No, you can't.
I am biased.
I'm also right.
Dr. Corday, Nick Stevens just arrested.
Whose patient?
Kovac.
I'll grab him.
Oh, God...
What's the rhythm?
Still V-tach.
Charge to 300.
Nick, come on, Nick.
Excuse me, sir, you'll have to stand back.
Okay, I need to intubate.
100 of lidocaine.
Stand by with amiodarone.
Charged and ready.
Clear.
Still no change.
Please save him!
360.
Okay, I need some chrichoid pressure.
I'm in.
Rebolus 50 of lidocaine in five.
Clear.
Got a rhythm.
There's a weak radial pulse.
Mix up the dobutamine.
Open your eyes, Nick.
Come on, Nick, wake up for me.
Good breath sounds bilaterally.
Unresponsive to painful stimulation.
He wasn't down long.
He should wake up.
Maybe.
You got the three separate light settings.
That's an essential amenity.
So I talked to Luca.
Me, too.
He didn't seem to mind about tonight.
No.
He doesn't get... jealous.
Ever.
Do you know, all the years I've lived here
I've never been to the...
Natural History Museum?
Mm-hmm.
Oh, that's criminal.
They've got dinosaurs, cavemen, it's great.
Dinosaurs and dancing?
Yeah. My grandparents like spectacle.
It's not going to be that big of a deal.
A few people.
( laughs )
You are so dead.
It's kind of a scene.
Kind of.
I told you, they like spectacle.
Did you grow up going to these kind of things?
Yeah. This is par for the course.
If you hate it, we can leave in a half an hour.
I won't hate it.
Should we duck around this photographer here?
Can we?
Yep.
Hey, Jeff.
Where's Sean?
He went to move the car.
Well, I don't want to wait to tell you the news.
Your viral test is back.
No virus detected.
So I'm really HIV negative.
Definitely negative.
You and... you and Sean are close, huh?
Been together almost a year.
That's nice.
Yeah.
But nothing's worth dying for, is it?
I'm not dying.
No, you're safe right now, but you have to protect yourself.
I'll get it sooner or later.
Not if you practice safe sex.
I don't want to treat Sean like he's contaminated.
If we use a condom
that's how he feels.
HIV can kill you, Jeff.
I know a lot of people living with it.
Well, I've seen a lot of people
who'd rather be living without it.
How old are you, man?
Twenty-three.
Because you've got 50, 60 years ahead of you.
Look, I love him.
Well, if he loves you
he should want you to stay healthy.
He thinks that this is the only way
that we can really be intimate.
That's easy for him to say, he's got the virus.
I don't have anybody else.
You have yourself.
Whoa.
Yeah, those are the bouncers.
I know them.
Oh, yeah?
Bark is much worse than their bite.
I can see how they keep people in line.
John, there you are.
Hi, Grandpa.
Finally, someone I really wanted to talk to.
Not so loud.
Is this your friend from the auction?
No, no, she had the flu.
And you are? Abby Lockhart.
Jonathan Truman Carter, Sr.
Delighted. We don't get to see too many of Johnny's friends.
No, you got lucky tonight.
You're very good to get all dressed up
and come out on such a cold night.
I'd much rather stay at home
in a bathrobe.
Don't let Gamma hear you say that.
Oh, she knows me by now.
I'd love to meet her. Where is she?
Talking to the keynote speaker, back there.
Go on back.
Shall we?
Nice to meet you.
Have a good time.
Friend from the auction?
The last family event I was at
the daughter of the host, she, um...
Never mind.
No, come on, tell me.
You ever take dance classes?
No. Have you?
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, actually, I have a few moves.
I'm sure you do.
Care to give it whirl?
Um... I don't know.
Come on.
Just follow me.
I'm not sure that I can.
I've got you.
I feel like I'm back at my spring formal in high school.
I went with this guy, Seth
but really I had a crush on this guy, Tim.
I'm feeling for Seth.
Well, when he went to the bathroom
Tim asked me if I wanted to go outside and smoke a cigarette.
And, um...
we never went back inside.
Mmm, that's cruel.
I know.
Is that when you started smoking?
I guess so.
( both chuckle )
See, it's all Tim Stillman's fault.
All right.
( giggles )
I didn't forget you.
Your... CPK is normal.
I watched you work on that boy.
Yeah.
You'll be going for your echo soon.
It was remarkable.
You brought him back to life.
Yes.
It won't do much good if he doesn't have the surgery.
You can't find him a heart?
He doesn't want one.
But he's so young.
There are bound to be medical advancements.
He's got to fight.
One could say the same to you, Bishop.
I am fighting.
Are you?
You say he should prolong his life
but you want to hasten your death?
I'm not looking forward to dying, Dr. Kovac
but I also don't want to be enfeebled or bedridden.
I only wish I was as brave as he is.
I think you've been more than brave.
Have I?
I wanted to set a good example.
Serve my parish, do God's work as long as I was able
and then go to glory... with a modicum of grace.
But there are times when I'm alone
at prayer or trying to get to sleep...
when it just overwhelms me.
I should never feel the way I do sometimes.
How's that?
Frightened.
Yeah.
You should call tomorrow
and make an appointment, you know.
I'll see.
Anyway, thanks.
Yeah.
Uh, Jeff.
Are you going to protect yourself from now on?
Maybe.
Probably not.
Big plans tonight, Malucci?
Uh, nope, no.
I'm just getting out of here.
Go ahead, 104s.
MAN ( over radio ): We're at the home of a 65-year-old male.
Collapsed in the bathroom, found him in v-fib.
Haleh, can I take the mike?
Defibrillated times four, gave epi and Lidocaine
Now in asystole.
He's gone.
This is Dr. Greene. What's the down time?
Been here 15 minutes
probably down another ten before that.
Any medical history?
Two MIs. Status post-bypass surgery.
When was the last doctor's appointment?
Hold on.
If he's seen a PMD in the last month
they can sign the death certificate.
Save us the trouble.
He saw his cardiologist nine days ago.
Still in asystole?
For the last five minutes.
That's it. Stop CPR.
What?
I'm pronouncing him. Time of death 21:18.
Can you do that?
Yeah, you can.
Let the family know that everything was done
under a physician's guidance, but he did not respond.
You want us to transport?
No, have them contact a funeral home.
This is County General, clear with Rescue 104.
I don't know why that was necessary.
What's the point of going through the motions?
I'm looking for Dr. Kovac.
I'm Dr. Frost
Bishop Stewart's personal physician.
CARTER: See? You were great.
I had a good partner.
Well, if we get really motivated
we could enter a contest.
ABBY: Well, that might be too much of a good thing.
Thank you.
Oh, no.
What?
Hello, Abby.
What are you doing here?
What are you doing here?
I'm here with a friend.
John Carter.
Hi.
How you doing?
That's Richard.
So what are you doing at a charity event?
Oh, I'm here with Alexis.
Who?
She went to get us drinks.
Is she old enough to drink?
Rich, who's this?
This is Abby.
Oh. Hi.
Hi.
We should probably head to dinner.
Where have I seen that dress before?
You haven't. I swear...
No, I really don't think
you've ever seen it before.
My sister's wedding; you were a bridesmaid.
Oh, always the gentleman, Richard, thank you.
Rich, let's go sit down.
Okay. Nice meeting you.
Bye.
Am I awake or is that just a nightmare?
Last week I gave him IV solumedrol
and put him on high-dose steroids for his arthritis.
Last week?
Yeah, this is his second time here.
He has diabetes.
Steroids put him in the ICU last year with DKA.
I didn't know that.
Well, which is why you should've contacted his primary physician.
I was going to... What's his sugar?
348.
Oh, great work, Doctor.
You're destroying his vision, his kidneys, his circulation...
Now that I know about his diabetes
I'm checking for end-organ damage.
I've been treating Bishop Stewart for 15 years.
He doesn't need another physician.
Well, maybe you should tell him that
because he came to me.
Underneath that robe, he's just a man
like everyone else.
A man facing death.
And right now, he's drug seeking.
He just wants to feel right again.
Well, that's not possible.
Where is he?
FINCH: Okay, 104, see you at the back door.
This is County base, clear.
What's going on?
104's bringing in a full arrest.
I just talked to that guy.
They called en route, cardiac arrest.
I already pronounced him.
No, no, no, no, no.
We gave him two of atropine en route...
What's your problem? We already did this.
The family freaked; they wanted us to bring him.
Do not unload the patient.
We have to-- we're here.
He's been dead for an hour.
The family wanted him to see a doctor.
They're right behind us.
WEAVER: Mark. Kerry, he's not supposed to be here.
No, resume compressions. Stop CPR.
I said stop. This is the guy who died at home.
Keep going, Cleo.
Set up Trauma Two for a full arrest.
He's dead.
When the paramedics bring us a patient
we have to care for him.
Chuny, want to put a shroud out on the bed.
Shroud?
Yeah, he's dead; it might save some time.
Mark.
You're not going to get him back, Kerry.
We still try. Are you running this or am I?
Fine. What's his rhythm?
Still asystole.
Hmm? What do you think, Kerry?
Another amp of epi might get him back?
Pupils, fixed and dilated.
Hold compressions.
Dr. Finch, would you concur
that the rhythm is asystole?
Yes.
Code is over.
Take out the tubes and clean the body.
That's the family.
I hope this helped them.
I'll go talk to them.
So typical of him to cry poor
and then show up at this fancy party.
And did you think she was even pretty?
I don't think I'm going to answer that.
I don't see it.
I think this is silly.
It's a blue BMW.
What if they took her car?
What do you think she would drive?
A Lexus?
( laughs )
Get it? Alexis?
No, I mean, what do you say we find it--
what are you going to do, key it?
No, maybe I'll just slash the tires.
I think that would be overkill.
Oh, stop, stop!
Wait, there it is.
Do you have a pen?
Yeah, why?
I'm being restrained.
I'm just letting the air out of the tires. How many tires?
Two's fair. One's fair.
Fine. Pen. Thank you.
( air hissing )
Oww!
( alarm blaring )
Uh-oh, now what do we do?
I think we have to run...
KOVAC: He's awake?
Yeah, and oriented, and passed
his mental status exam with flying colors.
Where are you taking him?
He's got no neuro deficits.
He'll go to the ICU and be extubated shortly.
And the heart?
I'm going to recommend surgery
to the transplant committee.
Dr. Romano?
Nick has requested not to have the surgery.
Well, he's a minor.
His parents make that call.
You're going to make him do it?
Knowing how he feels?
Look, Kovac, he's a teenager.
What do they know about life?
He'll thank us for this in a few years.
Mark.
I'm off, Kerry.
We have to talk about this.
And what might "this" be?
The way you've been acting: abrupt, cavalier...
Realistic?
Are you ready to be back?
Yes, I am.
Mark, you are still reaching for words.
I'm fine.
But what happens in a code
if you need a cardiac drug and you can't
think of the name? That won't happen.
I am asking you to take some time off.
And I'm telling you no.
Dr. Frost is arranging for you to have more tests on Monday.
Did he dress you down?
He was pretty mad, yeah.
He's very possessive about my care.
You were on his turf.
Well, as I told him
your EKG's and cardiac enzymes are normal.
Thank you, Dr. Kovac.
For the treatment, and for listening.
You're welcome.
I saw they took the boy away.
Is he going to get the operation, then?
Yeah.
I'm sorry.
Me, too.
You think he should've been able
to choose how he wanted to live?
I think so.
Well, I want to work.
Do you still want the steroids?
I need to work.
LOCKHART: Poor guy doesn't even have Triple A.
So he has to pay for this.
Maybe Alexis will chip in.
She looks about ready to call a cab to me.
I'd say we've successfully ruined their evening.
Mission accomplished.
Now I feel kind of bad. Why?
Because I kind of ruined our night, too.
Ruined? How?
Besides the vandalism... Yeah.
The fact that we're freezing to death. Yeah.
The fact that you never even saw your grandmother.
Oh, she knows I was there, that's enough.
Okay, then I guess nothing.
I had an okay time.
Me, too.
Yeah, this is Kerry Weaver at County.
I need information about evaluating
a physician who's possibly cognitively impaired.
Could we speak first thing Monday morning?
Thanks.
