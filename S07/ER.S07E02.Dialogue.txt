Previously on E.R.:
You're seeing things.
Maybe you're on drugs-- Yeah, I think I saw you
with a needle once.
I'll work it out with the registrar.
Once a clerkship is pulled, it's pulled.
Wait till the next academic quarter.
I lost three months of med school I can't make up.
It's about your tuition.
Yes, it's about my tuition!
If I give you a faculty position, I've got to be sure
that you'll be a part of the team.
You are having a boy. Congratulations.
Thank you.
Did you catch her?
Oh, yes, I caught her.
But once she starts writing, she can't stop--
Heaven forbid.
I should've jammed that pen into her carotid artery.
Mmm. I think they double the fine once you draw blood.
You need a building with guest parking.
Take my spot.
I don't want your spot.
( sighs )
Damn.
What?
No milk.
Want some of mine?
A grown man, you put an empty milk carton
back into the refrigerator.
It's not empty.
Now it's empty.
Not that it chills anything
cooler than room temperature, anyway.
It's just a parking ticket.
It's not just the ticket
it's that I had to go chasing down there
half-dressed, with my hair wet.
I said I'd go.
Yeah, but you didn't, did you?
Well, you didn't give me a chance!
You weren't fast enough.
( laughing )
Look, I'll pay the ticket, okay?
Calm down.
I paid the other ones.
What?
Let's just say it wasn't your first ticket.
You stole parking tickets off my windshield?
Just two.
And paid them without telling me?
Well, I was trying to avoid... this.
Well, that's it, then.
I'm not staying here anymore.
Here we go.
Every faucet leaks; your toilet actually rocks.
I kind of like that.
And there are creatures scurrying about in the walls.
Do you know what scurries about in walls, Mark?
Bunnies?
So, you want to take the el train
or should we drive?
( screaming )
Hey, is this the AA meeting?
How'd you guess?
I'm Brant. What's your name?
Hi, I'm John. Ah, thanks, John.
Welcome.
Woman: "...came to believe
"that a power greater than ourselves
"could restore us to sanity.
"Step Three: Made a decision to turn our will...
( whispering ): That's a lot of coffee.
This is backup.
First time?
Here? Yeah.
It's a good group.
Woman: "...made a searching and fearless
"moral inventory of ourselves.
"Step Five: Admitted to God, to ourselves
"and to another human being
"the exact nature of our wrongs.
"Step Six: We're entirely ready to have God remove
"all of these defects of character.
"Step Seven: Humbly ask him to remove our shortcomings.
"Step Eight: Made a list of all persons whom we have harmed
"and became willing to make amends to them all.
"Step Nine: Made direct amends to such people wherever possible
except when to do so would harm them or others."
Doc, can you take this guy?
He is driving me crazy.
Same here.
Oh, no. Shunt's clotted.
He missed his dialysis appointment yesterday.
Mr. Fletcher. Only one day late, huh?
You? No, not you.
You know him?
He's one of our favorites.
I don't want you.
Hey, Cleo, can you take Mr. Fletcher, please?
I see you called 911 again.
They're faster than the el train.
My arm stopped buzzing.
No thrill. No bruit.
Talk English.
Mark, you ready?
In a second.
Raise your right foot?
I can't.
I don't want to keep him waiting.
I'll be right there.
Okay.
Benton: Have they started teaching rounds yet?
Shirley: No, the residents are waiting for you in the ICU.
Tell them I'll be there in a minute.
And schedule the surgical service committee meeting.
Tomorrow afternoon.
You have a mastectomy.
Well, whenever.
Dr. Benton.
Hey, Carter.
What are you doing here?
I have a meeting. Oh, right.
Hi, Shirley.
Hi, Dr. Carter.
I need you to sign off on last month's
O.R. expenditure report.
I've never done that.
You do now.
I take care of it; you just sign it.
Suit yourself. I need it by 4:00.
It's good to see you, Carter.
Important attending stuff?
Aw, yeah, well...
Congratulations.
Thanks.
Ah, man, you look good.
Couldn't look much worse
than the last time you saw me.
He's gotten big.
Yeah.
Hi, Reese.
Hey.
Well, hey, you're in a hurry.
Yeah, uh...
I'll see you later, all right?
I don't know, maybe. We'll see.
Eh. Good luck, Carter.
Greene: When does he want to start?
Soon as possible.
I don't think that's a good idea.
Dumar: 62-year-old female.
Altered LOC, slurred speech
also weak grip in her right hand.
Any history of stroke?
Yes, a lacunar infarc.
She got much worse this morning.
He's eager to get back to work.
We're throwing him in the deep end?
No, of course not.
We'll start him on half shifts
limited responsibilities, once or twice a week.
In the same place where he started using.
Mark, he's doing the program every day.
Good. Make him take time.
He can afford it.
Okay, we'll monitor his progress
and if he gets into trouble
we'll just cut back.
If he gets into trouble, it's too late.
Woman: Somebody!
Please, somebody!
What is it?
I'm having contractions.
Are you pregnant? Only 22 weeks.
Come here.
Try to relax, okay?
Here, you're going to sit down.
Sit here.
One second, okay?
Dr. Chen, I need you over here.
No, now.
How did you get here?
Taxi. I was shopping downtown.
What is it?
She's having contractions.
How far along are you, ma'am?
22 weeks.
Oh, that's much too early.
You're probably having what are called
Braxton-Hicks contractions.
They're coming every three minutes.
Get a gurney, clear a trauma room
start an IV and call OB.
What's your name?
Regina.
Okay, Regina, don't push.
Whatever you do, don't push, okay?
How much?
Four, almost five.
No, that can't be right.
I was four centimeters two hours ago.
You're doing fine.
Can Dr. Coburn take a look?
She was called in to do a C-section.
How long will that take?
We have plenty of time.
Why don't we roll you back on your side
get you more comfortable.
Abby, they need someone downstairs.
Where?
ER. They have a pre-term labor.
Get a resident.
Simons and Perry are in delivering twins.
Lift your leg?
Where's Dana?
She's on break.
Not back for another five.
You're not leaving, are you?
It sounded urgent.
Do you know where you are, Mrs. Walton?
( mumbling )
Let the doctor check you out first.
What did she say?
She wants to go home. Pulse ox is 92.
She's in A-fib.
Probably triggered a new stroke.
Do you provide 24-hour care?
Yes.
Does she have any family?
No, not that she's in contact with.
Connie, call Psych.
Psych?!
After this stroke, she might not be competent
to make her own medical decisions.
Pre-term labor.
Next door.
EKG, Chem 7, UA.
Culture urine, blood and sputum.
Your husband's on his way, okay?
How far along?
22 weeks.
Let's hope it's a couple more.
Regina: Stop it. Please stop it.
Chen: Where's the resident?
You get me instead.
Okay-- All membranes are intact
but she's fully effaced and dilated to six centimeters.
Can you stop it?
What's her name? Regina.
Regina, did you have any ultrasounds
during your pregnancy?
About a month ago.
My doctor said everything was okay.
Who's your doctor?
He's in Indianapolis.
We're confirming her dates.
Why is this happening?
Sometimes women go into pre-term labor
for no apparent reason.
I shouldn't have come.
I should've stayed home.
This is not your fault.
Point 25 of sub Q terb, monitor her pulse...
This is medicine to stop the contractions.
Your membranes haven't ruptured
which is a good sign, but we're also giving you
something to help your baby's lungs mature.
Oh, no! I feel pressure!
Pressure.
Strong contraction.
She's leaking amniotic fluid.
Make them stop. You've got to stop.
Two grams of amp and a loading dose of gentamycine.
Get a baby warmer in here.
No! It's too early!
Random urine tests.
Yes.
And I get to pay for them, too, I see.
Is that a problem?
No.
In addition to the State Caduceus meetings
we'll require 90 NA or AA meetings
during the first 90 days.
That's not a problem. I'm going anyway.
Good. Good.
And the three of us will meet once a week
just to, you know, check in
make sure you're handling the stress.
All right.
Came prepared.
The naltrexone binds to your opiate receptors...
I know what it does.
It protects you.
It blocks the euphoric effects of the narcotics.
It protects all of us.
You need to, uh, begin today
if you want to begin work next week.
( pouring water )
You want me to take it in front of you?
Yeah, we'll periodically monitor your regimen.
How much?
50 milligrams a day.
Sorry.
Greene: It's okay.
It's going to be...
difficult at first, so we'll work it out.
( pager beeping )
All right, so we'll put you on the schedule for next week--
Tuesday-- start out very light
no trauma.
Whatever you say.
Kerry, I got to go. ( pager beeping )
Yep. Right.
See you next week, Carter?
Welcome back, Carter.
Thank you.
Thank you both.
Sure thing.
( door closes )
Baby's cephalic, normal anatomy.
Progress to eight.
Oh, God, please stop it.
Father's here.
Regina, what... what happened?
I was at the mall.
It started hurting.
I didn't know what to do.
Is she in labor? Yes.
My water broke.
Her OB's office
confirms previous ultrasounds.
Put her at 21 weeks, five days.
That's way too soon, right?
She's got rales.
Okay, pulmonary edema.
No more terbutaline.
What-what-what's wrong?
The medication we're giving you
is causing your lungs to fill with fluid.
I don't care! Stop the contractions!
I can't have this baby!
Okay, I'll try 50 migs of indomethacin.
If the baby's born now
can it survive?
Joseph, it's coming!
Baby's crowning.
Regina, you're going to deliver this baby.
No! No!
Yes-- there's nothing else we can do.
What do we got?
Preemie. Under 22 weeks.
Lockhart: Regina, go ahead and push.
No! No!
Okay, there, Dr. Chen? Uh-huh.
Okay, head's out. Whoa.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! Oh!
It's a boy.
Is he breathing?
Yes, he's breathing.
Can someone... can someone, please, um...
You okay?
Weaver: Come on, clamp.
Regina: I don't hear anything. Is he alive?
Yes.
Let's get a weight.
Joseph: He's so little.
Lockhart: Apgar is three.
Weaver: Okay, let's give the mom 40 of lasix.
Take her temp.
Regina: Please save him.
Please save my baby.
You're doing charts?
Yeah, I needed to catch up.
Look, I'm really sorry about, um... with the baby.
It's all right.
Our reactions can surprise us sometimes.
But you need to go back in there
and manage your patient.
Um, I can't.
Jing-Mei, you should know that you're being considered
for Chief Resident next year.
People need to be able
to look to you for leadership.
I'm pregnant.
I didn't know what to do.
And then eight weeks became 12, and 12 became 20.
So you're 20 weeks pregnant?
Twenty-two.
You know that baby was the size of mine.
Oh, sweetie.
Why did you wait so long to tell me?
My parents are going to kill me.
You should go home. No.
Go home.
We'll cover the rest of your shift.
We'll work out your schedule tomorrow.
Okay.
Ooh.
Not fair, not in the workplace.
I found a soft spot, I'm going to exploit it.
I'll exploit you. Mm-hmm.
You know I will. Bring it on.
Time and place.
Clotted off fistula in Two, needs a new shunt.
( sighs )
Renal failure?
Missed his dialysis.
Mr. Fletcher?
Who else? Uh, nope. Get somebody else.
I got stuck with him. Why shouldn't you?
Last time the man yelled in my stethoscope.
And he grabbed my ass. Suck it up.
Uh-uh. Come on. Be a man.
( chuckles )
That's not right.
Oh, you're crying now?
It's not right.
You guys got a baby down here?
22-week preemie.
Still breathing?
For now. Oh, man.
What took you so long? I need to take a dump.
It's good to see you, too, Mr. Fletcher.
Is he hypothermic?
Yeah.
Order another lamp.
It's on its way down.
What's his pulse?
Down to 90.
This is heated saline to keep him warm
while you hold him.
Did your husband leave?
He went to call a priest.
We want to baptize our baby.
There's a priest on call at the hospital
unless you had someone specific in mind.
No, we're just in town for a few days.
My doctor said I could travel during my second trimester.
Well, Regina, this probably would've happened
whether you were traveling or not.
We tried for, um, almost two years to get pregnant
and finally gave up.
And then suddenly, I was.
Look at him. He's hanging on.
I counted ten little fingers and ten little toes.
He looks perfect.
He's just a little small.
Even if your baby was a few weeks older
and had somehow managed to survive
he would probably be plagued...
I know that's what you say
because that's what you've seen
but maybe he's meant to be a miracle.
Sometimes you have to help a miracle along.
And sometimes you have to let go.
What took so long?
They had eight of us in a holding pattern.
Are we still in Trauma One?
Yeah, sure.
How bad is it?
I'm not sure I should discuss this with you.
Why?
I can't share medical information with anyone
but a family member.
Glenda and I are family.
I thought you were her nurse.
No, I'm...
uh... we're partners.
Oh. Right.
We should sit down.
Hey.
You're safe. I've had my coffee.
Good.
How about a date tonight?
Sure, long as it's at my place.
I was thinking about the "going out" kind.
We're going out Friday.
I moved up the reservation.
What reservation?
It's a surprise.
Mark, I'm fine.
I just had an episode this morning, that's all.
I know. I'm used to them.
6:00. Trust me, you'll like the place.
Hey, by the way, your patient has an abscess
around L-4 and L-5.
Who? Patterson.
I was in radiology when they flagged his film.
Suddenly bored? What?
Poaching my patients?
There can be some improvement
in the first 24 hours after a stroke.
But in Glenda's case
I'm afraid there's too much brain damage.
So she'll never recover? Maybe slightly.
Dr. Kovac.
Her sats are dropping to 86.
Glenda? Yes.
What does that mean?
She's not getting enough oxygen.
8-ET tube, 10cc syringe.
B.P.'s 110/90. Pulse is 110.
Put her on 100% non-rebreather.
This your patient?
Large CVA with dense hemiparesis.
Chest X-ray shows an aspiration pneumonia.
Ma'am, we may have to put a tube down your throat
to help you breathe.
( groaning ) Do you know where you are?
Psych saw her.
Says she's not competent.
I think she's just confused.
Does she have an advance directive?
What do you mean?
Like a Do Not Resuscitate Order.
I don't think she'd want to be on a ventilator
if that's what you're asking.
Suction. I'll put in an oral airway.
Are you a family member?
No, she's her...
They're together.
Do you have power of attorney?
No, I guess I should, but we didn't do that.
Sats are climbing.
Okay
let's keep her on 15 liters by mask.
She's okay?
For now.
But if the pneumonia progresses
we'll have to intubate her
unless a family member directs us not to.
Or a spouse.
One recognized by law.
Can you do it by phone?
Yes. If you can verify an out-of-town relative.
She has a brother in Houston.
I've never seen one so small.
You can practically hold it in one hand.
I delivered a 700-gram baby in med school
had a brain bleed.
I don't even want to look.
Randi, can you page the chaplain on call?
I did. The baby's father already asked.
He's going to be a few hours.
We don't have a few hours.
He needs to get here.
He's helping talk down a jumper ( pager beeps )
from the State Street Bridge.
Okay, then start calling parishes
till you can find someone who can get over here.
You want me to cold call priests?
Yes. Now, please.
Okay.
I got the CBC and lytes. I just need the coags.
Dr. Benton...
I don't care what the computer says.
I'm trying to pre-op him.
Is this about Mr. Fletcher?
I'll tell you what
when they're ready, page me, all right?
Thank you.
Maureen Conway, Financial Services.
We can't admit Mr. Fletcher.
Why not? He's got Medicare.
Which he sold to a bankrupt HMO.
That's not his fault.
True. But in the nine months they've not paid claims
Mr. Fletcher has run up
over $200,000 in avoidable unrecouped charges.
He needs a new dialysis shunt.
Dr. Romano left strict orders
not to admit these patients.
Now you can stabilize in the ER
and then work on a transfer.
Whoa, wait a minute.
Do you have an MD behind your name?
No. Yet, you're telling me how to treat my patients?
I appreciate your frustration...
I've got a pheochromocytoma down the hall.
53-year-old male.
How do you suggest I treat him?
Do whatever you think is medically necessary.
But we won't admit Mr. Fletcher.
Now if you have any concerns
you can take them up with Dr. Romano.
Abby: We took Regina to get cleaned up.
Believe it or not, a shower can help.
She did everything right.
She read that damn expecting book every day.
It's important that she knows it's not her fault.
What happened?
Did he die?
No. Wait here.
Did they find something that might help him?
Someone from neonatology has to examine
every premature baby born in the hospital.
So they might do something?
Wait here, please.
Note how the thinness of the fetal tissue
makes thermoregulation impossible.
The eyes remain closed and non-functional...
What are you doing? We heard you had a preemie...
This isn't show and tell.
No, it's a teaching hospital.
As you can see, the heart
limbs and palate are fully formed.
With the transparent skin, we might even be able
to see the heart beating.
Okay. Put him down.
Excuse me?
Put him down.
He is not a science experiment.
No, but I need to examine every birth for congenital anomalies.
You should have called me.
You've examined him. Now go.
When I'm finished.
The father's standing outside
thinking you're saving his baby.
How long would you like to torture him?
Are there any questions?
No? Good.
Transfer him to the fifth floor.
No.
You can't keep him down here.
I'm not sending those parents upstairs
to see a bunch of nursing mothers.
Fine. The NICU then.
No, he's staying here with his mother and father
so they can have some privacy.
In the ER?
Yes.
Is there anything you can do?
Uh... no.
I'm sorry, he's too young.
Chuny, could you get Mr. Morgan a chair
so he can sit next to his son?
Sure.
I know this is difficult.
Don't be afraid to touch him.
He's not suffering, is he?
No.
Abby, we got to clear the trauma rooms.
We got multiple MVAs coming in.
Yeah, find someplace else.
This is a trauma room.
I don't care, this room's off limits.
Titrate the phentolamine to a MAP of 120, and get him up.
Don't worry, Mr. Robertson, you are in good hands.
Dr. Romano? Hello, Peter.
I heard you were hoarding a pheo down here
and attending for a week
and already you are stealing the fascinomas?
You can have them.
I wasn't asking your permission.
We have a problem with a dialysis patient
who needs a new fistula.
Why do you say "we"?
Because Financial Services
won't let me admit him.
Don't let those geeks push you around, Peter.
Show a little backbone before you come crying to me.
Otherwise, they'll never respect you.
They're blocking him on your orders.
Oh, well, that's different.
Let's take a look.
I've cleared him for surgery.
I could have him out in 24 hours.
Mm-hm. 28 admissions for renal failure?
He frequently misses dialysis.
Yeah, apparently. Well, street him.
I am done carrying these parasites.
That's an EMTALA violation.
No, he's had a screening exam
and he's not emergent.
How do you know?
You haven't even looked at him.
Okay, Peter.
Let's take a look.
Where is he?
Curtain Two.
Too late, Lizzie, I already grabbed the pheo.
What? Nothing.
Listen, have you seen Mark?
He has a spinal abscess patient for me
who's gone missing.
He said something about radiology.
Hi, Mr. Fletcher, I'm Dr. Romano.
How are you feeling today?
Like crap.
Yeah. I'm sorry. Can I take a look at your fistula?
You're the seventh person to "take a look."
What am I, a freak show?
Why'd you miss your dialysis appointment?
I was busy.
Uh-huh. Doing what?
None of your business.
Mm...
More important things to do, I imagine.
I don't like you.
I didn't like you the time you sliced my foot open
and I don't like you now.
Oh, I'm hurt, Mr. Fletcher.
Uh-huh.
What about my pain pill?
I need my damn pain pill!
The nurse is going to bring it, Mr. Fletcher.
She's too slow.
I need a new nurse.
Put him on a bus to Milwaukee.
He's fluid overloaded.
Oh, no, he's got a few crackles.
This guy knows exactly what's going to happen
if he misses his dialysis, and he still blows it off.
He is not going to stop abusing the system
until we draw the line.
What's this? For his bus ticket.
You serious?
Absolutely.
New state, new Medicaid program
and a new set of doctors to piss off.
He lives in Chicago.
Cry me a river.
Oh, man...
Please call back immediately. Thank you.
Machine.
Weaver: Do you have a pager number
or a-a cell phone?
No.
A next door neighbor?
Another relative? No.
Well, her breathing has stabilized for now.
How long have you been together?
27 years.
Kerry?
Could you excuse us for a moment?
Sure.
What are you doing?
She talked to her brother twice in ten years.
Yes, and she didn't grant her partner power of attorney.
I'm trying to find a legal way to fulfill her wishes.
27 years, Kerry.
That should count for something.
The woman has a reasonable chance of survival.
But what kind of life?
Intubation is an appropriate step
unless she has an advance directive.
The only person who can change that
is the next of kin.
She is the next of kin.
They lived their lives together.
We should treat them like a couple.
I agree.
The law doesn't.
If her sats drop below 80 before their brother
calls back, tube her.
No.
What?
If you want to manage it this way
then you should manage it.
Okay. Fine.
( snaps fingers )
Give me the chart.
Thank you.
I just... I need a picture.
I understand.
Should we use the name?
You don't want to?
No, I... think we should.
There's only one boy's name we could agree on.
What's that?
Julian.
That's a nice name.
Yeah.
How much longer?
I don't know.
It could be a few minutes.
It could be a few hours.
Let's take him outside.
What?
We'll take him to a... a lake or a park.
If he's going to die, I don't want him to die in here.
We have to wait for the priest.
Is he coming?
I'll check again.
Abby.
Excuse me.
I'll be right back.
I paged you three times.
We had a 22-week birth. The baby's still alive.
You had a patient upstairs
who needed you. Did she deliver?
Yes, she delivered.
Shoulder dystocia.
Is the baby okay?
Well, apart from a broken clavicle
he'll be fine.
She was really scared
and she was asking for you.
Look, if you want to take shifts as an OB nurse
I need you to work as an OB nurse.
You cannot let these women grow dependent on you
and then walk out when you got an excuse
to come back and work in the ER.
I was not looking for an excuse.
I was taking care of this woman and her baby.
There are other people down here who can do that.
Your job is upstairs.
Janet, I'm sorry, it was my call.
I asked Abby to stay.
These parents are completely distraught.
There's nothing we can do for the baby
but they need support
and Abby's been with them since the birth.
Just don't ignore my page.
Sorry.
Thank you.
No, you're doing the hard part.
Is he still breathing?
Agonally.
Let me know when you need to pronounce.
Okay.
Last time I got heated blankets
and an extra pillow.
( sighs )
What's open, Shirley?
Depends on what you have.
Revision of an AV graft, left forearm.
Patient named Fletcher?
How'd you know?
Dr. Romano warned me
you'd try to bring him up.
Yeah, well, it's my call.
Just, uh, give me a room.
I'm sorry, Dr. Benton, I can't.
I'll be in and out in less than an hour.
He actually said he'd fire me.
Okay. Okay, well, please hurry.
Thank you.
( sighs )
That was the priest.
He finally talked that woman
down from a ledge or whatever
and he's going to get over here and baptize this baby.
How long has it been?
Almost five hours.
Oh. He's really hanging on.
( sighs )
Maybe the mother's right.
Maybe he is a miracle.
In ten, 15 years, we might be able to help.
You know, they wanted to try.
We could intubate him, just in case.
Abby...
I know.
It's his time on earth
and all you can do is make it good time.
I think he stopped breathing.
Here we go.
That's not a respirator?
No. It provides positive pressure
to her lungs so she won't have to work so hard to breathe.
Her father died of lung cancer.
I remember Glenda and her brother
fighting outside the ICU.
Danny couldn't let go
and Glenda couldn't watch her father suffer like that.
You know, all those tubes.
After her first stroke
Glenda made me promise to never let her die like that.
We'll do everything we can to reach her brother.
He doesn't know her like I do.
I love her.
I don't want to lose her, but I know what she wants.
Joseph: His breathing just slowed down
for a second, and then it just...
it stopped.
Please, if you could do anything...
Is there a heartbeat?
No.
Want to call it?
Oh, God.
Abby?
Yeah.
Is-is that it?
Time of death is...
Wait!
His chest moved.
Joseph: Is-is he still alive?
Got a heartbeat.
Yes, yeah, but your sister has an aspiration pneumonia.
If we put her on a ventilator, she may never come off it.
Possibly, possibly.
But she's suffered a massive stroke
from which she probably will not recover.
Mr. Walton, I cannot give you percentages.
Extremely unlikely...
We-We understand your sister's wishes
are not to be kept alive by artificial means.
Ju-Judy. Would you like to talk to her?
Yes, if we don't intubate her, she will die
but the chances of a mean...
The chances of a meaningful recovery are ex...
I understand.
Yes. Good-bye.
Hey, you, uh, Malatucci, come here.
Malucci.
Yeah, whatever.
Have you seen the O.I.G. officer down here?
Who?
Deputy Inspector General--
regulates our Medicare compliance.
I, uh, heard she was snooping around.
Short battle-ax, no sense of humor?
That's her. Curtain two.
Thank you.
Woman: Dr. Benton told you
you needed surgery?
Uh-huh. And he brought me upstairs.
Why didn't he operate?
Nurse wouldn't let him in.
He tried to tell me they didn't have a room ready
but I could tell, she kicked him out.
Romano: Okay, Mr. Fletcher, we're ready for you.
Sandy. Hello, Robert.
What an unexpected, uh, visit.
Well, actually, I'm investigating
a possible EMTALA violation.
Really? What patient?
Mr. Fletcher.
Some sort of spot audit?
No, we got a call that you were trying to bounce him.
From whom?
Anonymous.
Well, fortunately, anonymous does not equal reliable.
I was just coming down to take Mr. Fletcher up to surgery.
O.R.'s ready, Peter. Let's go.
Is that true, Dr. Benton?
I'm sure Dr. Romano has found a room.
This is a consent form, Mr. Fletcher.
I'll explain it to you on the way up...
Yeah, yeah. I know the drill.
Robert, please tell me you don't have policy
to redirect all non-paying Medicare HMO patients.
How could we? We're a county hospital.
Good, I'm glad to hear that.
Always a pleasure, Sandy.
I'm sure.
As long as I'm here, I think you should know
that I will be auditing all of your patient transfers
from the last month.
Audit away. No skeletons here.
I hope so.
Dr. Romano
I thought I had to...
Not a word, Peter. Not a... single word.
You're not going to leave a scar, are you?
The hack that first put this in left a big scar.
Shut up.
I'd have had better exposure and direct visualization
without beaming a gigavolt of radiation
into the poor man's spine.
A gigavolt?
You know what I mean.
And I could've completely evacuated
all the infected tissue.
These guys are going in half blind.
Fine. Whatever.
Next spinal abscess is all yours, I promise.
Where is this place, anyway?
You'll see.
These are houses, Mark.
Uh-huh.
Oh...
Oh, Mark.
Oh, it's beautiful.
See, I have some taste.
( gasps )
Can you afford it?
I've been living cheap.
Besides, I'm going to have a roommate.
That's awfully presumptuous of you.
Well, I could take out an ad.
You will not!
I love it!
Check out the refrigerator.
It's nice and cold.
( gasps )
Look at this deck!
I knew you'd love that.
When can we move in?
When can you pack?
It has an ice-maker.
These floors are gorgeous!
You should check it out.
What?
The ice-maker.
It's lovely.
Yeah, you have to open it.
It has a special ice feature.
What, does the ice come in different shaped cubes
or something?
( giggles )
Oh, my God.
Mark...
I'm a little nervous, so, uh...
Uh, let me say it.
Elizabeth, I love you.
I was hoping you'd give me the joy and honor
of being your husband.
( exhales )
Oh...
Is that a yes?
Yes.
Man: Do you believe in God, the Father Almighty
the creator of Heaven and Earth?
I do. I do.
Do you believe in Jesus Christ, his only son
who was born of the Virgin Mary
suffered, died, rose
and now sits at the Father's right hand?
I do. I do.
Do you believe in the Holy Spirit
the Lord, the giver of life...
Regina and Joseph, is it your will that Julian
should be baptized in the faith of the Church
which we have professed with you?
It is. It is.
I'm sorry.
Julian, I baptize you in the name of the Father
and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.
Amen.
Amen. Amen.
Amen.
Hi. Could I get a coffee with cream, no sugar
to go, please?
Hey.
Hey.
You back already?
No, not for another week.
What, are you just hanging out?
No, I have diversion meeting at 9:00.
You look much better.
Thank you.
I like your hair.
Thank you.
Those are nice scrubs.
You picking up some extra shifts?
No. I was suspended.
Oh?
Didn't kill anybody, did you?
No.
I wanted to.
My-my ex-husband was supposed to pay my tuition
he didn't pay it
so, uh...
Ouch.
I'm on the bench for awhile.
But it certainly didn't seem like that today.
Oh, thank you. Hey, I got that.
That's okay. Would you put that on my bill...?
Hey, it's a cup of coffee.
Sit down.
It's the least I can do
after acting like a complete jerk.
When?
Three months ago.
You know, you might've saved my life.
If you hadn't stopped me when you did
I could be dead now.
I'm working on my steps here.
You're up to nine already?
Well, more or less.
I forgive you.
Do you mind?
I'm sorry.
I really have to quit.
Thank you.
Keep it.
Long day?
Yeah.
22-week-old preemie survived almost nine hours.
I just finished the death kit.
Wow.
Yeah.
I don't know why I do this.
Sometimes, I think I should just
go be an accountant or something.
Hmm. That's an option.
Yeah, if I could balance a checkbook.
What about you?
A lot of waiting.
A lot of meetings.
Yeah, you get kind of meetinged out.
Aren't you going to ask?
What?
What I was doing there this morning?
You only go for one reason.
I figured I'd keep going
and eventually, you'd stand up and share.
It's not that interesting.
I'm a drunk.
How long have you been sober?
Almost five years.
So you could sponsor somebody?
Yeah, I guess. Have you?
No.
'Cause I'm, uh, supposed to find a sponsor.
( laughs )
Don't look at me.
No?
No. I'm barely holding my own life together
right now, trust me.
'Cause it would be...
great to have somebody at the hospital.
And since you did sort of start me on my road to recovery...
And men and women aren't supposed to sponsor each other.
Don't worry about it.
Thanks.
Come on.
You're not going to make me ask
a total stranger, are you?
I mean, the only person I met at the meeting
was the coffee guy.
Okay. Okay.
I will work the steps with you
until you find a permanent sponsor.
Fair enough.
I'll start by setting a good example.
Besides, I don't think coffee and cigarettes
are going to do it for me tonight.
No?
No.
I'm getting... a hot fudge sundae.
Mmm.
Would you like one?
Uh-mm. I got enough vices.
No. I think part of the rules should be
that you have to splurge with me.
( laughs )
Is that how it works?
( indistinct conversation )
