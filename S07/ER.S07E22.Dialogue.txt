Previously on ER:
We had something.
Are you his mother?
Next-door neighbor.
Any way to contact the parents?
He just has a father. I left him a message.
We found some unusual bruising
on your son, Mr. Fossen.
Do you know about that?
No.
Afraid Ben's going to have to stay here
for a few days, Mr. Fossen.
What? You're not doing this!
You're not doing this to us!
No! Dad! Please!
You bastards!
Please!
You're returning my application?
Did you honestly think that
you'd make the first cut?
Shh.
How'd she do?
Up from 3:30 to 6:00
then she wanted to feed at 7:00.
Lie down. Take a nap.
Are you leaving?
Yeah.
Please don't go.
I have to.
( snoring )
I want you to stay.
So do I.
Can't you call in sick?
I wish I could.
Just do it.
I'll leave the van.
( loud explosion )
What was that? I don't know.
MAN: It's 8:00. They're demolishing
the old textile building on State.
That'll wake you up.
Exactly our problem.
They blow up a manufacturing plant to build a mall.
What's wrong with a mall?
50 cents.
All we do is buy and sell.
We don't produce nothing.
See? What do you do?
What? For a living.
I'm a doctor.
Okay. Bad example.
What are you talking about?
You're the guys building the mall.
Not for long.
( sirens wailing )
Freaking Internet.
They can take their information age and shove it up their ass.
Martin Leanly, 12 years old, GSW to the upper left arm.
Distal neuro-circ still intact?
Yeah. Complains of pain and paresthesias.
Can you squeeze my hand, Martin?
It hurts.
Carter, what happened?
Foster care? Yeah. 12 down.
I don't know how many we're getting.
Can you feel this?
A little.
Think about a vascular study.
Got it.
Mark, take that one. Go.
It's still in me. It's still there.
Calm down. We're going to help you out.
Entrance wound only.
Palpable in the sub-Q.
You got this, Dave?
As long as there's no compartment syndrome.
I can't breathe.
Just try to slow your breathing down.
Maria Fredriksson, shot in the right groin
with significant blood loss.
BP's 90 palp, tachy at 120.
Do you have any belly pain, ma'am?
No, my leg is cold.
Foot pulses are diminished.
Did they get him? Who?
The man with the gun.
I don't know. Did you see him?
We were hiding in, in a closet, but they shot through the door.
Foot is pale, poor capillary refill.
Trauma One! Curtain Three!
Who's on for trauma?
Dr. Greene. We're bringing everybody in.
Chen, give her two more saline.
Order pre-op labs.
She's got an ischemic leg?
Get her to surgery first.
Dr. Greene, we have an eight-year-old girl in arrest.
Where was she hit?
Shot in the head.
Intubated for agonal respirations
and lost the pulse.
Pupils fixed and dilated.
It's PEA. Let's get her epi.
You just get here? Yeah.
Nice way to start.
Yeah, well, I was going to call in sick.
Dr. Weaver, gluteal gunshot wound.
He needs a cystourethrogram.
And try a rigid sigmoidoscopy.
Uh, he should see a surgeon.
Yeah, get in line. Where's Benton?!
Charge at 60.
You get a rhythm?
Degenerated into v-fib.
Clear.
Another 120.
It looks like brain stem failure.
Dr. Weaver, 104's on the radio with the last one.
GSW to the chest. Clear.
Is he hypotensive?
No change. 120 again.
No. Fine, bring him in.
Is it the same gunman?
Yeah, he shot the gardener on his way out.
Clear.
I'm surprised he had any bullets left.
Push another .3 of epi.
You want to try mannitol?
Couldn't hurt.
30 grams. Does he need an angiogram?
No, I don't think so.
No bruit or thrill.
120 again.
Is that Helen?
Who?
Helen. She's new.
Her foster mom bailed on her.
Uh... I don't now.
Clear.
No expanding hematoma.
120. No pulse deficit.
They catch the guy yet?
No. Dispatch doesn't know anything.
He was mad at Mrs. Buckley. What's that?
He was waving the gun at Mrs. Buckley and yelling
and then he shot her.
Did we get a Mrs. Buckley?
DOA.
Gram of Cefazolin, follow his neuro exam.
We've also got a GSW
to the lateral malleolus in Exam Two.
Still waiting. Yep.
Portable X ray and a dopler scope.
Let's make sure the bullet didn't damage the bone.
Go ahead. I got this.
Let's get an A.P., lateral and a left humerus, too.
Oh, hey, did you turn it in? What's that?
Weaver said my application was incomplete.
I'm missing my peer reference.
Oh, right, yeah, I'll do that today.
It's due today.
Yeah, I'll do it.
Okay. Thanks.
Peter, I need you here.
Femoral artery's pumping blood.
Can't control it without my finger in it.
Then get me some surgeons.
I got three unstable patients
and a fourth coming in.
Anspaugh's going to take this one.
I'll be right back.
Dr. Weaver? Yeah.
Officer Napalitano.
I need someone to pull out a bullet for the crime lab.
Which patient? Calf wound?
He's stable. We'll get to him as soon as we can.
As long as we get the evidence. Just find the shooter.
We'll get him.
I was in the bathroom.
I heard a loud explosion.
Mm-hmm.
It scared me for a second
but then I remembered
they were tearing down that building.
But then I heard all this screaming, and-and...
BP: 132/78; pulse: 96.
He was out front in the bushes.
Took us a while to find him.
We were working on the people inside.
Kerry, what happened?
A lunatic started shooting at a foster care facility.
Why? Who knows? Go. Curtain Three.
WOMAN: I couldn't get myself to open the door.
LEGASPI: You were right to stay where you were.
I should've gone to help.
I should've done something.
No, you did the right thing.
I'll be right back.
Can I get a cigarette?
I-I need a cigarette.
Yeah. I'll see what I can do.
Kerry, I've got a hypertensive social worker.
Probably just stress, but you should check it out.
Okay, thanks.
FRANK: Hello.
I read your letter.
Good. I was wondering.
Dr. Legaspi
Dr. Romano, line three for you.
Tell him I'll call him back.
She'll call you back.
Anyway, I appreciate the sentiment.
I can't make her call you.
I'll give her the message.
Sentiment?
He says for you to get your ass
on the line now.
He needs to talk about a transfer.
Frank, she's busy. He should be, too.
We could have as many as eight GSWs going up.
Nine-- carjack victim.
We're swamped with this.
Tell them to divert to Mercy.
Mercy said no ETAs 9:00 to 10:00.
Why do they bother calling?
Um, anyway, thank you
um, but I don't think that anything's... changed.
Right. Okay.
Okay. I should get back.
Yeah.
Chuny, grab Cleo.
The kid she's with isn't going to make it.
Clear.
Asystole.
How long has she been down?
At least an hour since the shooting.
Dr. Finch, can you take a carjack victim rolling up?
Go ahead. This is a fatal wound.
What is it?
GSW to the abdomen.
Someone should have told me that today was gun day.
Time of death: 9:12.
This the carjacking?
Yeah, Mr. Jeffries.
GSW to the left lateral abdomen.
You need to be careful.
He has AIDS.
How's his pressure?
140/82.
Okay. Good. That's good.
What do you got?
Entrance wound below the costal margin
in the anterior axillary line. No exit.
Mr. Jeffries is HIV-positive.
I was getting out of the car.
He shot me anyway.
Frank, what's open?
Nothing.
I got a GSW.
Don't make you special today.
Mark called in Trauma One.
All right, that's fine, let's go. Hey!
Let's sit him up and get him a portable chest.
Hey! Hey! Roger.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Stay away from my wife. What?!
You stay away from my wife.
She told me everything.
You had your chance. She's my wife now.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I'll take care of Carla. Stay away from her.
Frank, call Security.
Get him out of here!
Stay away from my wife.
I never touched your wife!
I'll kick your ass! Back it up.
Nothing happened.
Chuny, get a trauma panel
type and cross for four.
He really nailed you.
Shut up and mind your business.
Is this the carjacking?
Yes.
BENTON: Sir, I'm sorry about that.
Sir, I'm Officer Napalitano.
You told the officer on site
that your assailant was Caucasian.
Yeah, that's right.
Did he wear a yellow windbreaker?
Uh, yeah, yel... Uh, how did you know that?
We think he shot some people
at a foster care facility two blocks away.
The same guy?
And... three.
Can you remember your license plate number?
No.
Pressure's down to 90.
Two liters saline wide open.
But-but it's a black Acura Legend, correct?
Uh, what's wrong?
You'll to have to do this later. Check with DMV.
You might be bleeding in your abdomen.
How do you know for sure?
Let's get an ultrasound in here.
It's a black Acura Legend?
What? Yeah.
We have to put a tube in your chest
to help you breathe.
Un tubo en tu pecho para ayundarte.
Prep the chest.
You okay from here?
Got it. Lidocaine.
LOCKHART: Pulse ox is 98.
You almost missed your deadline.
What?
Anesthesia.
Si.
I was eating breakfast
and I saw your med school reinstatement form
on your counter.
What'd you do?
Ten blade.
You were lucky.
The lady in the registrar's office
has a daughter who's a nurse.
The registrar's office?
Yep. I told her you had a bunch of night shifts
and she slipped it in with the others.
32 French.
Wait. You handed it in?
Yep. This morning.
Luka, why'd you do that?
It was due Monday.
I didn't want to turn it in.
I thought you forgot.
No. I changed my mind. Why?
You know, now they're going to come after me
for summer tuition.
I can help you with the money.
I don't want help with the money.
I just wanted to let it go.
Then why did you fill it out?
I'll get you some xeroform.
There. Lesion by the shoulder.
Bullet passed midshaft.
This is much more proximal.
Mm. Look at the lateral.
It's in front of the bone.
Could be soft tissue sarcoma.
Get a biopsy.
Carter, is your kid stable?
Yeah, I just have to do an FNA.
Okay, clear the room.
Next round coming in.
Two more gunshot wounds.
One chest, one neck.
Two more? It's not even 10:00.
It's the same guy again.
What?
CPD tracked a carjacked Acura
to a private residence.
Found the mother and son shot inside.
Did they get the shooter?
Not yet.
Do we have the ORs?
Cleaning two now.
Peter still needs to go up.
That leaves one, and Anspaugh
should be finishing soon.
Psych nurses aren't trained to handle ostomy care.
He doesn't need ostomy care to change his own damn bag.
Robert, we need you!
Two more GSWs rolling up.
In a minute!
Abby, let's go outside.
And when I call you
you get on the damn phone.
She was helping with a mass casualty.
We needed her down here.
And I needed to clear Recovery
for the barrage of gunshot wounds you keep accepting.
I'm not taking responsibility
for post-op complications in the psych ward.
Oh, really? Okay. We'll have to find somebody
who's interested in responsibility.
What is that supposed to mean?
I'll tell Deraad.
He can finish your shift. What?
Nice knowing you.
DUMAR: GSW through the right lateral neck.
Airway's clear.
GREENE: What's his pressure?
110/70.
Hi. What's your name?
Ted.
Hey, Ted. Can you swallow for me?
Where is my mom?
Is all this his?
LOCKHART: Dr. Greene!
No, his mom was wrapped around him.
Looks like the bullet went through her and hit his neck.
Mommy! Dr. Greene!
Get Dr. Weaver to scope him.
He may need an esophagram.
They're going to take you inside.
Okay, Ted?
I think this is the lady
that brought in your abused kid last week.
Single gunshot wound to the back.
BP: 128/74.
Mrs. Shayotovich?
Where's Ted? Where's Ted?
He'll be okay. Another doctor's looking at him.
Please... help him.
He was bleeding.
His neck was bleeding.
Who shot you, Mrs. Shayotovich?
Derek.
I told the policeman. It was Derek Fossen.
Your neighbor. He was looking for Ben.
I told him I didn't know where he was.
And he said if I was going to take his boy away from him
he was going to take mine away from me.
Please, please, help him.
He was bleeding.
We'll take care of him. Get a hemocue and pulse ox.
Whoa, whoa. Roll her.
Roll her. Roll her.
( retches )
God, that looks like about two liters.
Maybe aorta-esophageal fistula.
She's out.
Okay, bag her.
I'll intubate her inside.
Get a thoracotomy tray and all the O-neg that we got.
Hematoma was contained
until it blew through the esophagus.
You have an address?
He lives next door to her.
Can't get a pressure. Ten blade.
Squeeze in two units O-neg.
I'm in.
We put his son into protective custody.
His name is Ben. He should be somewhere in the foster care system.
Lost the pulse.
All right. Rib spreader.
You need to find the son. That's who he's looking for.
Abby, get the infuser.
ROMANO: Start internal compressions.
Pressure's 120 after two liters.
You need this? No.
There's another three liters in here.
Liver and spleen intact.
So maybe I'm not bleeding.
No, you've got a slow leak from a small vessel.
You're going to need surgery.
I don't want surgery.
Well, you know, look.
We'll make a mid-line incision, we'll find the bleeding artery
and then we'll tie it off.
Doc, I'm already dying.
Your infection might slow your recovery
but it's routine surgery.
People live with HIV.
I know that.
I've been fighting this disease since 1986.
I responded to the AZT.
And the protease inhibitors were a miracle.
They gave me an extra five years.
But my T-cells have been dropping since July
and my viral load's going right through the roof
even with all these antivirals.
Mr. Jeffries, I, uh, I need your consent.
No.
I had pneumocystis three months ago.
If we don't operate, you'll die.
I'm already dead, Doc.
This may just allow me to skip a very painful end.
Another Satinsky.
Unit number eight is up.
Heart's not filling. Clamp the aorta.
Greene, the injury is high and posterior.
You want me to clamp the arch?
Let's try an atrial line.
Oh, that'll help.
Can't you get your finger in the hole?
If I could see it. More light.
Let's call for FFP and platelets.
All right, forget it, forget it.
I can't close this defect. Another amp of epi.
She blew out her thoracic aorta
We are not going to get her back.
Let's try bypass.
It's too late for that. Call it.
Time of death: 11:40.
0 for two, and it's not even lunch.
( sighs )
CARTER: We pull a sample out with a needle
and then we look under a microscope.
You think it's cancer?
No, it could be scar tissue.
Could be a cyst.
Cancer's only one possibility.
My mom died of cancer.
How old was she?
Thirty-five.
I'm 12.
Okay, well, let's do the biopsy first.
That way we can talk about what we know
as opposed to what we don't know.
Do you have anybody that you'd like me to call?
I'm in foster care.
Yeah, I know. Foster parents?
No, I'm between homes.
Right.
Did she make it?
No. It's scary.
This guy's on a rampage.
They didn't catch him yet?
I don't know; they're going to go to his house.
So much violence, huh?
Were you going to tell me?
Tell you what?
Heard a rumor.
Oh, yeah? A good one?
Dr. Rosen called.
You know, from the Emergency Department at Northwestern.
You took the message?
Yeah, he wanted to set up an appointment.
Just looking at options.
You're leaving?
I still have to make up three months of my residency.
Well, after that?
I don't know.
I'm not even being considered for Chief Resident.
I have to write this damn peer review for Chen.
They're not even telling me about an attending position.
Sometimes you've got to read the writing on the wall.
Well, have you talked to Weaver about an attending position?
No. Why not?
Cause if she wanted me, she would've asked me about it.
Maybe she doesn't think you're interested.
Maybe I'm not.
Carter, is your cirrhosis patient ready
to go to the floor?
No, I have to do a paracentesis first.
We need the bed. Got it.
What's the, uh, chest tube output on the gardener?
300cc's.
He's third in line for tele.
Still angry at me?
I wasn't angry. You seem angry.
No, it's my fault. I should've ripped it up.
I thought you wanted to go back to school.
Well, maybe I do, just not now.
What happened?
Nothing.
You don't want to be a doctor anymore?
I don't know.
You don't know?
I don't know.
It's $40,000 in tuition.
It's lost wages.
It's another six years of me killing myself.
When it's over, you'll be doing what you want.
Maybe I'm doing what I want right now.
Yeah, if that were true, you would've never started.
Maybe I realized being a nurse is good enough for me.
Is it not good enough for you?
No, no. It's fine.
Okay.
You did great, Ted.
The bullet went through a muscle in your neck.
But you're going to be okay.
Can I see my mom now?
Uh, let me find out.
Now do you know your dad's phone number at work?
No.
Okay, do you know where he works?
Abisco.
Abisco. Is that... is that a company?
He makes binders.
He makes binders. All right.
You want to draw some more?
Yeah.
I'll be right back.
The mom didn't make it?
Her proximal aorta was shredded.
I have to track down his father.
What do you want to tell the boy?
I'll stall.
NAPALITANO: Dr. Greene?
Is this him?
Yeah.
He has a record?
One arrest: domestic dispute.
He hit his girlfriend.
He wasn't at his house?
I'll let you know when we have him in custody.
What about his son?
We tracked down the foster parents.
A patrol car's picking him up now.
You think he's coming here?
What?
Well, he was pissed at the neighbor
for bringing him to the ER.
I mean... you took his kid away from him, right?
Right.
Thanks, Frank.
I'll send in some extra units.
57 to Dispatch.
Mark, he couldn't come here.
He knows there's too many cops around.
He hasn't displayed a lot of sound judgment so far.
What is he shooting with?
Semiautomatic pistol, 13-round clip.
He's been reloading.
Probably picked it up at K-Mart on the way over.
It's not the guns.
People kill people. ...kill people.
Yeah, right. Only not as fast.
He would've found another weapon.
Fourteen shots so far, Frank. Six deaths.
You can't effect mass murder
with a Chinese throwing star.
Rescue 78 coming in with an injured cop.
Motorist dragged him for half a block.
See? There you go. He hit him with a car.
That's assault with a deadly weapon.
Frank, shut up. Shut up.
Free air under the diaphragm.
Must've nicked the bowel, too.
His crit's down to 23.
I can't dilute him much further.
I checked his viral load.
It's over 50,000.
He'll die of an opportunistic infection within a year.
Well, that doesn't mean we should help him commit suicide.
He didn't shoot himself.
If we let him refuse surgery, it's the same thing.
Get a court order, then.
Cleo, he'll be dead by the time I get it approved.
Then it's his choice.
All right.
I went over there.
She was upset.
She was crying.
She came on to me.
I didn't do anything.
I didn't want to do anything.
Now, maybe she felt guilty
and she told Roger and she put a spin on it.
You wouldn't put a spin on it? No.
Then why didn't you tell me?
To avoid this. What?
You looking at me like I did something wrong.
I see. You didn't trust me, and I'm supposed to trust you?
I didn't think it was worth getting into.
Good. At least I know where I stand.
Cleo... that's not what I meant, and you know it.
Peter, his pressure's dropping.
Go.
Run in another liter of saline.
Any chest pain or dizziness?
No.
All right, let's get two units from the blood bank
and transfuse each over an hour.
No, no, no, I don't want a blood transfusion.
Your hematocrit is drifting to a dangerously low level.
I understand.
And no... thank you.
What about your family?
I mean, if you don't care about yourself, what about them?
I haven't spoken to my mother in over 30 years.
I outlived the two people that I loved in the world.
I've lived longer than I expected.
Just let me go.
I'm ready.
Hi.
Hi.
( clears throat )
How are you feeling?
My neck hurts.
I'll ask one of the nurses to come give you some medicine.
Can I see my mom?
Not yet.
We're trying to reach your dad.
Can I stay with her until you do?
I don't think so.
She's having an operation right now.
Is she okay?
We're having a little trouble
trying to get the bleeding stopped around her heart.
She was hurt bad.
I know.
PICKMAN: Lots of road rash on the right side.
You hungry? No.
Looks like he dislocated an elbow.
Where's all this blood coming from?
Tore off part of his ear.
He needs more pain medicine.
Titrate ten of morphine. Did you lose consciousness?
I don't think so.
Got him, Luka? Yeah, trauma panel, portable
chest, pelvis, right elbow.
Get a good look at him? Not really.
Was he in a yellow windbreaker?
Yeah, Colby saw blood on him.
Wait a second. Fossen did this?
Give us a minute, please.
Colby asked him to exit the vehicle. He opened the door.
Guy punched it in reverse, smashed our unit and took off.
Colby's jacket must've got snagged.
He was screaming. He got dragged forever.
But the son of a bitch didn't stop.
Where did he get the car?
Probably boosted it off the street.
Jeep Grand Cherokee, first three license numbers G74?
BERGER: That's all I got down. Could be G79.
You got him? Shots fired at 823 Piedmont.
Jeep Grand Cherokee parked at the corner, license number G79-6L5.
Woman found down inside.
GREENE: Oh, God.
Here we go.
NAPALITANO: Is-Is she dead?
WOMAN: Called in the paramedics.
We're all overworked, Robert.
But you can't insinuate
that you're going to fire someone
every time you get frustrated.
I wasn't insinuating. She's fired.
She's cleaning out her locker right now; so I'm told.
Robert... you can't do that.
I just did.
This is a county facility.
Employees cannot be summarily fired.
Well, Dr. Legaspi was already on probation, for that other matter.
Yeah, and she was exonerated.
And since then, she's had a history
of violation of institutional policy.
Like what? What do you care? It's not your department.
I deal with that department, and she's a good doctor.
A good doctor who's had as many as 30 delinquent charts
awaiting discharge summary.
And so does half the staff.
She used the County Telephone WATS line
for a personal long-distance call.
Oh, you've got to be kidding me?
She yelled at a patient in a public setting.
You're trying to find a way to fire her.
There's plenty of written documentation
reviewed by the disciplinary committee.
Dr. Weaver. Give me a minute.
It's Adele. She's been shot.
What? Adele Neuman.
That maniac shot her at her house. The social worker?
GREENE: Chest x-ray.
"T" and "L" spine.
Let's set up the ultrasound.
Can you feel this? Yeah.
Miss, did you get a look at the man who shot you?
Yeah, he-he looked familiar.
He said something about his son.
We put his son, Ben, into protective custody last week.
Oh, my God.
Okay. Now, can you feel this?
No.
Adele.
GREENE: She was shot mid-back.
She can't move her legs.
NAPALITANO: White male, late 30s, yellow windbreaker?
Uh, yeah, I-I think so.
Any pain in the belly?
BP: 92/65; pulse: 110.
Adele, any pain in your belly?
Not really. Could be a pneumothorax.
Lungs sound good, pulse ox is 99.
Or an intra- abdominal bleed.
Or spinal shock.
How did he know where I lived?
What?
How did he know where I lived?
I only saw him at the hospital.
Find anything on the Internet now.
Mark.
Get someone over to my house.
What?
Send someone over to my house now.
1211 Dupont Drive.
( tires squeal )
MARQUEZ: She's still hypotensive.
You want dopamine?
Start it on five mikes.
Come on, Elizabeth, pick up.
Pick up.
Yes. What's her crit?
Working on it. How about here?
Yes.
Do you have voice mail or a machine? Machine.
Would she hear you leaving a message? I don't know.
How about here?
No.
Were you already home or was he waiting for you?
He came in, and I was sitting at my desk doing my bills.
Patellar reflexes are absent.
Dr. Greene, no one's answering the door.
You want them to search the house?
Yeah. They'd have to force entry.
Search the house!
All right, 42, go ahead...
Still hypotensive.
Up her to ten mikes. She needs volume.
I'm not in yet.
Adele, can you bend your knee?
I can't. I can't move it.
Look, I don't care. We may have an emergency laminectomy.
Fine. Check. Go.
Doc, they'll call it in when they have it secured.
Am I paralyzed?
Hopefully, it's only temporary.
That's it. Give me a new kit.
Check for sacral sparing. Come on, now. Now.
All right, good. Set up the microscope. We're coming up.
Maybe she went out, went to the store?
Did you page her?
What? Did you page her?
No. I need you to page Dr. Corday.
I don't... I know that! Page her!
Mr. Jeffries... Mr. Jeffries...
What's his hemocue? Down to five.
Barely responds to painful stimuli.
Hang two units of blood.
He doesn't want that.
Call the O.R. Where's the surgical consent form?
On the cart.
You can't take him up; he didn't give it.
Well, he's unable to give consent now.
I just need two physician signatures for emergency surgery.
No. You would have him die?
I'll respect his wishes.
( pager beeping )
Good, Adele.
The spinal injury is incomplete. We can operate.
I need an emergency signature. Not now, Peter.
I.J.'s in. Let's get another test.
BENTON: He's bleeding out.
WEAVER: Run the Solu-Medrol at 325 an hour.
Gunshot wound to the belly. He's hypotensive...
Yeah, yeah, whatever. Go.
Systolic's up to 100.
All right, let's get him up.
Can you get a repeat CBC?
Whatever you want, Peter.
I've got my two signatures.
He made himself clear.
Look, he has advanced AIDS.
He probably has an HIV encephalopathy.
No, he was alert and oriented.
You should have called Psych.
I did; they never showed up.
OR called; they're stacked up.
Ow! Damn it.
Oh, God. I'm sorry.
Did you cut yourself?
I don't think so.
Glove just tore there.
Peter... Hold on. Hold on.
Let me get some gauze pads. Come on.
Let me see it, all right?
Oh, God.
BENTON: Keep irrigating it.
LOCKHART: Lily, where are the zerowets?
Bottom left drawer.
Pharmacy. Yeah, this is Dr. Benton.
I need you to pull a PEP kit for me.
All right. And use two liters.
What? No, no, no, no.
Look, I'm on my way up there right now.
What about the patient?
Keep transfusing him.
What's up with Neuro?
They're doing a craniotomy.
Watch it, Peter. Tell them I need some help
with a thoracic decompression.
Adele, there's a piece of bone
from your ninth vertebrae, mid-back
that's pressing on your spinal cord.
That's why I can't move my legs?
Yes. But if they remove the fragment, you may recover.
Doc, no one's at your house.
They did a thorough sweep.
Check my garage? Yeah, yeah. Nothing.
There's still a chance I'll be paralyzed?
Not if I can help it.
I still need to talk...
Drop it, Kerry. It's over.
Is my van still there?
What? The garage-- was my van there?
Yeah, yeah.
But you have two cars, right?
Hers is in the shop.
Does she take the baby out?
She's been going for walks, usually around 3:00.
It's 1:05.
It depends on the baby's schedule.
Can you keep a unit there until she gets home?
Nick. Yeah.
POLICE ( over radio ): ...shot in the head, from the back.
Looks like the guy was riding in the backseat.
Cab driver on Roosevelt.
DISPATCH: Roger that, 27. Rescue's en route.
Okay, that'll be us. Can you give it to Luka?
I have to go upstairs.
You think it's him?
Yeah, it's him.
Dr. Greene, I can't reach this boy's father
and I think he's figuring it out.
Who? The neck wound. His mother died.
You need to talk to him.
I'll be right there.
Carter, we got a GSW to the head coming in.
I want you to prep Trauma One.
Get some, uh, Dilantin, mannitol and Decadron.
ETA?
Check with dispatch.
Ewing's seems pretty aggressive.
He'll need a chest and abdominal CT
to rule out metastatic disease.
You sure? It's a soft-tissue mass.
Extraosseous Ewing's. It's rare.
You might want to write it up.
Yeah. Thank you.
You want me to talk to the parents?
He doesn't have any parents.
Where is she? Where is my mom?
Where is this operation?
( sighs )
The bullet...
Um... she was shot in the back.
The bullet passed through her heart.
She lost so much blood
that her heart stopped beating.
We opened up her chest for an emergency surgery.
Gave her blood transfusions.
The best surgeon in the hospital did it.
She wasn't in any pain.
She didn't suffer.
We worked on her for a long time.
We couldn't stop the bleeding.
We couldn't get her heart to beat again.
Ted, your mother died.
I'm sorry.
Here.
You need to take these now.
Shouldn't we draw baseline labs first?
No, now. The sooner, the better.
Peter, two units are in.
I can't get his pressure above 80.
All right, hold on.
He's already drug-resistant.
You don't have a large viral load.
He does. Cleo, listen to me.
The conversion rate with meds is less than three in 1,000.
Peter, crit is 14.
If he's going, he has to go now.
Okay?
All right.
Uh, get another two units.
I'll meet you at the elevator.
Uh, call Infectious Disease.
See if they need to modify the postexposure regimen.
All right, go ahead.
( taps lightly )
( taps harder )
I'm surprised my code still works.
It's not going to happen, Kim.
What isn't?
They-they can't let you go, not legally.
No, they always intended to fire me.
They would've done it sooner if they could have
but they needed to build up
a nice thick Human Resource file first...
Which is completely bogus.
They'll never get away with it.
They already have. Only if you let them.
It's not worth the effort.
I'm really not interested in working for a place
that doesn't want me here.
No, you have the right to due process.
We-we can find a civil rights attorney.
We?
It's not right, Kim.
You know why they're firing you.
You have to fight it.
You have to fight this.
I'm supposed to fight?
You're hiding
but I'm supposed to fight.
Well, I'm sorry
but I don't want to fight.
I just want to move on.
So should you.
GREENE: Hi, Chris and Hillary.
It's Mark Greene from down the street.
I'm looking for Elizabeth.
If you see her... Dr. Greene!
could you ask her to give me call?
Thanks. Dr. Greene.
We've got him. Where?
He opened fire in Lincoln Park.
He shot three people before being taken down
by a civilian packing a nine-millimeter.
Is he still alive? So far.
What's he had?
Two amps of epi and atropine.
Is this the cabbie?
Yeah. Point-blank range at the base of his skull.
Asystole since we found him.
Cleo, why don't you jump in on this.
KOVAC: High cervical injury
probably blew out his brain stem.
Uh, uh, any vitals in the field?
No, just lots of gray matter.
Darcy, Darcy, any witnesses?
1211 Dupont was the last entry
on the driver's log, at 1:14 p.m. What?
The house you had searched.
Fossen must've been on his way over there.
Cabbie probably heard his description
on the radio or something...
Dr. Greene... Bang. Fossen blew his brains out.
Dr. Greene... Don't worry, Doc.
That means he never got there.
Dr. Greene!
He's coming in.
for one shift?
By the same guy, absolutely.
He has a good chance.
Like you said, you found it early.
Nah, it's more that he has to go through it alone, you know.
As if having cancer as a kid wasn't bad enough.
He could get passed over for Chief Resident.
That's true. Or he could get kicked out of med school
and be forced to work as an ER nurse.
I was not kicked out.
And what would you call it?
Suspended for being a deadbeat.
Do you know he offered to pay my tuition?
Who?
Luka.
And I know he means well.
It's just frustrating for me sometimes
'cause I have to explain my every feeling to him
and normally when you're with someone for a while
they get to know your moods, but he doesn't do that.
You know what?
Stop it.
What?
Don't talk to me about Luka.
I'm not your girlfriend
and I shouldn't really even be here with you.
Why not?
Because I don't want to wish bad things for you and Luka
and I don't want to sit on the sidelines
waiting for you two to break up.
and I don't want to be your friend.
It might be convenient for you, but it's not doing much for me.
What are you... what are you talking about?
Where did you put him? Where did you put my son?
HALEH: How much O-neg do you want?
KOVAC: Four units.
You can't take me from him.
Quiet! So we can listen.
Two entrance wounds on the right.
One on the left.
Another two on the belly.
A total of five.
You... you did this.
Set up for bilateral chest tubes and a central line.
You took him.
HALEH: Systolic's low at 80.
I'll intubate. This is your fault.
Wait for the chest tubes.
Now. Paralyze-- one of pavulon, 100 of sux.
You stole my son. You destroyed my family.
Ambu bag.
He's my son.
What gives you the right?
( muffled ): You can't take my...
You can't take my son from me!
It starts with one bad cell
that multiplies and then grows out of control.
Usually, you don't even know that it's there
until the mass of bad cells is big enough that it causes pain.
We're very lucky that we found it today.
So you're saying I'm lucky I got shot.
In a way, yeah.
It's just going to take longer to die.
No, that's what I'm telling you.
Since we caught it early
there's a good chance that you're not going to die.
What's a good chance?
70 percent.
Do you know what 70% is?
Yeah, it leaves 30.
Well, let's concentrate on the 70, okay?
Dr. Carter.
GSWs are rolling in.
Okay. I'll be right there.
So what happens to me now?
Now, I'm going to have a cancer doctor--
an oncologist-- come down and take a look at you.
No, I mean, where do I live?
Oh.
I don't know.
I'll find out.
CHEN: When was your last tetanus booster?
I don't know. Do I need an X ray?
No, it looks like just a graze.
Is that the guy?
Hmm? Yes. Multiple GSWs to the chest and abdomen.
At the range, they teach you
to shoot for the center mass.
It's not always fatal, but it takes them down.
You shot him?
I got mugged last year
same park.
I don't go there now
without protection.
He started shooting people. Someone had to do something.
Yeah, we should arm the whole city.
Hey, I stopped him.
He would've kept going.
You were lucky.
Lucky I was packing.
WEAVER: Carter, you free?
Um... sort of.
GSW to the right flank.
Vitals are stable
but I need you to check for gross hematuria.
Okay. I-I'll be right there.
I handed it to her.
What?
Your reference.
Should put you over the top. All fives.
Wow, thanks.
I had to lie.
WEAVER: Now, Carter.
Coming.
HALEH: First two are in.
I've got the subclavian.
Put the next two on the infuser.
How's your chest tube output?
A couple hundred cc's.
Only 50 on my side.
Is he going to make it?
Probably. Didn't hit any vital structures.
After five shots?
Some guys get lucky.
19 shot, eight, maybe nine dead.
He's lucky we didn't take him down.
Dr. Greene, Dr. Corday is on line four.
Could you get it for me?
Pressure's up to 85.
3-0 nylon. What's in the foley?
HALEH: 70cc's.
Dips are negative for heme.
WRIGHT: Dr. Corday, hold on.
Can you cut this?
Elizabeth.
Mark, what's going on?
Where were you?
I was at the Farmer's Market. I came home.
There are police in the house and the front door's been kicked in.
Yeah, I told them to.
Why?
Uh, long story.
Vaseline gauze.
You're not going to tell me what's happened?
Nothing.
It's just, uh, a bit of a scare.
You're all right?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Uh, call you later.
I told the policemen to stay with me till I called you.
Yeah, yeah. He can go now.
You're not going to tell me what's going on?
Not right now, but everything's okay.
Okay, then.
You'll be off at 7:00?
Yes. I'll be there.
Okay. I love you.
Me, too.
Elastoplast.
( clears throat )
He's ready for a portable chest.
Keep the dopamine at ten mikes.
I want neuro checks Q 30 minutes and a CBC in an hour.
Any cord contusion?
No, mainly an extrinsic hematoma.
Did they find Elizabeth?
She's fine. Oh, good.
What about her paralysis?
Ask me in 24 hours. What's this?
GSW to the renal parenchyma.
Marge, clear O.R. Two.
We got another customer.
I'll be right back.
Robert, I need to talk to you.
Yeah, sure. Anything but Legaspi.
You're making a mistake.
Look, my main mistake was not firing her
three months ago when I first found out.
Found out what?
That she's incompetent.
That's not what you were going to say.
Oh, really? Wow, in addition
to your finely honed diagnostic skills
you're a mind-reader now?
You're trying to get rid of her because she's gay.
Oh, of course I'm not.
That would be wrong or at least politically incorrect.
I want to get rid of her because she's a pain in the ass.
Like Maggie Doyle was?
Okay, Kerry, let's stop right there.
And avoid your history of discrimination.
If you don't rethink this, Robert
there's a good chance you'll be the one out of a job.
Dr. Legaspi has demonstrated not only poor judgment
but a reckless attitude toward her patients
contempt for her colleagues
and a blatant disregard for authority.
She's out. She's fired.
End of discussion.
If she goes, I go.
What?
You heard me.
Are you giving me an ultimatum, Kerry?
I swear to God, Robert Because that sounded
I will walk out that door like an ultimatum to me
if you don't back off. and I don't respond well to ultimatums!
You had better choose your battles very carefully.
You're the Chief of Emergency Medicine
not the County's lesbian advocate.
That's where you're wrong, Robert, because I am both.
I am the Chief of Emergency Medicine and I am a lesbian
and if you pursue this matter any further
I will take it to the County Board of Supervisors
the ACLU, the press and anyone else who will listen.
So I suggest you choose your battles very carefully.
HALEH: BP's 100/60.
KOVAC: Going in the right direction.
Last hemocue?
Nine point five.
KOVAC: Do you want me to bring him up?
Mark? What?
Do you want me to bring him up?
No, no. I got it.
KOVAC: They're sending
cross-matched blood to the O.R.
Good.
Can you bring a copy of the chart back down
so I can write my note?
Sure. ( groaning )
He's going to need some more pavulon.
Damn it.
I forgot the drug box.
Be right back.
Oh...
( alarm beeping ) ( groaning )
( groaning continues )
Shock.
( gasping )
( groaning )
