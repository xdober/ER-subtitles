Previously, on E.R.:
I was hoping you'd give me the joy and honor
of being your husband.
I can't find a decent position here.
Stay local or you give up custody.
I am willing to offer you a per diem position.
Per diem?
Yeah.
Give me the purse!
Lockhart: Stop.
Luka, stop! Stop it!
What can I tell you?
I'm short-staffed.
I can't go on a transport.
Connie, can you clear this TIA in six?
She's waiting for her daughter.
Yeah, well, that's what chairs are for.
And give a gram of unasyn to the dog bite in four.
Mark, they need you at the MICN.
Why don't you try Mercy Air?
Maybe they can pick him up.
Mark? What?
Paramedics have a guy with chest pain
won't get in the ambulance.
Well, explain the risks and make sure he signs out AMA.
What are his vitals?
He's refusing to sign the form.
Mark, you gave my patient cefoxitin.
Who?
Bovard. Uh, appy.
Hold on.
Uh, yeah, listen, he needed antibiotics.
Yeah, cefotetan's a better drug.
Peter, I'm a little busy.
I know, that's not my problem.
You should've at least called me.
Did you get through?
No, no answer at his hotel room and I stat paged him twice.
Well, try his cell phone.
Any response to Lasix?
Mark, the AMA?
Get him on the radio and try and convince him.
What about a nitro drip?
Greene, I need you to buff up a recurrent bowel obstruction
I have on the way.
What are we, Jiffy Lube?
I need a sugar tong splint in Three. Kovac still MIA?
Uh-huh.
Kovac missed his shift?
I'm sure he's on his way.
Where's, uh, Kerry?
It's her day off.
She's at a chrysanthemum show.
Great, the one day I need her
she's playing Martha Stewart.
All right, hold on just a second, I'm sorry.
Uh, listen, I've got a helicopter transport.
We're going to have to call in backup.
Uh, why don't you wait till 8:30? He's never late.
Peter, what's this?
Hot appy. O.R.'s ready.
Great, I'll take him.
Dr. Greene needs your help here.
Trauma coming in?
No, you're going to cover the whole E.R.
What?
Yup, this'll get you started:
Diarrhea, ear pain and weak and dizzy all over.
Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute.
Weak and dizzy wasn't a part of our per diem agreement.
Sure, it is. Per diem means "per my discretion."
Greene: Okay, I'm on my way.
I haven't done primary care since med school.
Don't worry, Peter.
You just got to cover until Kovac gets here.
When's that?
Uh, I hope soon.
Andrazak in Four-- check his lytes in an hour.
Oh, and look at
a post-reduction shoulder film on Quintano.
How long's your flight?
I don't know.
Well, where are you going?
Grass Creek, Indiana.
The wedding coordinator's coming at noon.
I know.
Mark, we canceled her once already.
Well, go ahead and talk to her. You can handle it.
I don't want to handle it.
I want you to share in what kind
of invitations, menu, flowers.
I'm stuck, I'm sorry.
Well, at least try to get back on time.
I'll call you.
Have a safe flight.
What?
Nothing.
All right, I've got the earache.
That's a pedes case.
Yeah, well, Romano has me seeing everything today.
And that's a complete waste of your brilliance.
Look, I've apologized.
If you can't accept it
let's at least call a truce so we can work together.
You are amazing.
First you dump me, then you expect me...
Whoa, whoa, whoa, I did not dump you.
Then what do you call it?
You were going to move to Philadelphia
without saying a word to me.
Yeah, but I didn't, did I?
I stayed here and I took this damn per diem job.
And I'm supposed to believe you did that for me?
That's what I thought.
Hi, I'm Dr. Benton.
So, uh, Jason-- how long has he been sick?
Well, it started last week with an earache
and then he had a fever and now he's coughing.
Well, let's take a look here, okay?
You think he's got pneumonia?
One thing at a time.
Get away from me!
Hey!
Jason. Be nice. The doctor wants to help you.
Ow! Hey, whoa, hey. I said be nice.
All right, Jason, look
this isn't going to hurt, okay?
Just, uh... just be still. Here we go.
No, no, no! I want to go home!
Okay, it's okay. It's not going to... Jason.
That's right, Jason, go to mommy.
Why don't you put him on your lap
and give him a nice big hug
and if Jason is real still
I'm going to give him a sticker.
Greene: How are his sats?
Up to 98, but his ejection fraction's
less than ten percent.
Mr. Coggins? Call me Tom.
I'm Mark Greene.
We're going to have to lie you down
to load you on the chopper.
My first helicopter ride, I'm going to miss the scenery.
What's his BP?
90/70.
It's always that low.
There's not much heart muscle.
Can you keep trying Janet? Sure, Tom.
That's my fiancee. She's flying in from Montreal today.
Let me know if you feel dizzy or have any shortness of breath.
I'm okay as long as I lie still.
Bright side is I get bumped up
on the transplant list, right?
You bet.
Gordon, how are we for oxygen?
Four E cylinders, all full.
Ready.
Let's go. One, two, three.
Let's get a full trauma panel. Type and cross for eight.
Get the bypass team on standby. Move.
Oh, somebody stabbed him?
No, he tripped near a pencil sharpener.
Yeah, Mr. Zuckerman, our office manager
wanted to pull it out, but I wouldn't let him.
Decreased breath sounds on the left.
Set me up with a chest tube.
I'll do it.
No, I'll do it.
Excuse me, excuse me, this is a teaching hospital.
Exactly. Go find another patient to learn on.
Pulse ox down to 91.
Okay, let's get one percent with epi.
Peter, heard you had a good one.
Oh! And indeed, you do.
He needs a CT. Let me get a ten blade.
No, no, no, don't bother.
I'll throw the tube in and take him right up to the O.R.
Don't worry, sir, you are in excellent hands.
That's okay, I've got this.
No, no, this is a surgical case, Peter.
You are an E.R. doc today, remember?
A guy's puking in the hall. See what you can do.
Excuse me.
How are you, sir? You with me?
Patient: Yeah.
Romano: Good.
Sir, are you okay?
Aah, whoa, whoa!
What does it look like?
Let me get some compazine here.
Sir, you're going to have to aim for the basin.
I heard it, but I didn't believe it.
Carter, get me some gloves.
Dr. Peter Benton, E.R. attending.
It's got kind of a nice ring to it.
You want this?
Oh, no, no, no. Looks like you're doing just fine.
Trent?
Yeah.
I'm Dr. Carter. What happened to your hand?
I have this stupid art class.
We were carving some duck decoy.
Huh.
Most exciting thing that we ever did
I think, was macrame.
Um, how many stitches, you think?
How many do you want?
Enough to get me out of art class.
Well, ten ought to do it.
Dr. Carter, can you step out for a second?
Yeah, after I suture this.
No, it's important.
I'll be right back.
Don't pick your nose.
What?
The boy's grandmother-- she wants to talk with you.
Why don't you just bring her in?
No, no, she asked to see you alone.
All right.
Hello, I'm Dr. Carter.
Oh, I'm sorry, I came as soon as I could.
Is Trent all right?
Oh, yeah. Just a few stitches, he'll be good as new.
Um, Doctor, there's something you need to know.
Trent's mother died of AIDS when he was two.
He tested HIV positive.
You need to be careful.
He didn't say anything.
He doesn't know.
We never told him.
What?
We just wanted him to be normal like other kids.
What do you tell him about the medications?
Oh, he thinks he has a vitamin deficiency.
And your doctor plays along with that?
Well, he understands.
Trent needs to know.
Yes, when he's older
when he can better understand.
Well, your grandson could be sexually active right now.
He's not. I've asked him.
Are you sure that he's telling you the truth?
Doctor, I know my grandson, you don't.
Mrs. Larson, I have a legal right
to tell Trent that he's HIV positive.
You have no right to interfere in our lives.
HIV's a sexually transmitted disease
and if he's having unprotected sex
he could be putting others at risk.
Well, I think we better leave.
Well, he can't leave.
Let me by. Chris?
Doc? Let me by.
Could you please escort Mrs. Larson to the chairs?
This way, ma'am.
Don't touch me.
Don't do this.
Eddie: Pulse ox 94 on two liters.
What's your hurry?
Huh?
You keep checking your watch every ten seconds.
I'm just charting.
I don't think so.
You're late for something.
I'm supposed to meet my fiancee.
You got a lunch date?
Well, we're meeting the wedding planner.
You're taking the plunge.
It's a great feeling.
Yeah.
What's your fiancee's name again?
Janet.
I'm calling the E.R.
see if they can get ahold of her and she can meet us there.
That'd be great.
Hi, Randi? Yeah, it's Mark Greene up in the helicopter.
Who's around?
Dr. Corday's right here.
It's Dr. Greene.
I don't care. I need to speak to him right away.
Hi, Mark, is everything all right?
Yes, Dr. Dietrich, this is Dr. Carter at County General.
Listen, I just repaired a laceration
on your patient, Trent Larson.
Yeah, certainly, I'll try and get ahold of her.
No, yeah, he's a great kid.
Uh, listen, if I was to get a needle stick
is there anything I should know?
Randi, did you get in touch with the hotel?
There's still no answer in his room.
Could you call the manager's office
and see if they could send somebody up there?
( pager beeping )
Detective.
Oh, you keep coming by
I'm going to have to get you a badge and gun.
So, is there anything...?
Oh, Dr. Kovac, now you know
the minute there's anything new, I'm going to call you.
We take photos for the medical record.
I thought it might help.
His morgue photo's already on the police bulletin.
Maybe you could go back to where it happened
show this around.
We've done our interviews, doc.
No one knows him.
What about fingerprints?
Have a seat.
Have a seat, doc.
Look... I understand how you feel, okay?
But the fact is, you're probably better off
if no one ID's this guy.
No family member's going to come crawling out of the woodwork
with some wrongful death suit.
I don't care. I just need to know who he was.
Take my advice, doc.
You were defending yourself.
Dedicate yourself to believing that.
All right, keep that clean and dry.
All right, cool.
Hey, Dr. Carter, is my grandmother here yet?
Um... yeah, but first we need to talk.
Why? It's just a cut.
Uh, yeah... Actually, I need to ask you something.
All right.
Um...
it's about your mother.
How much do you remember about her?
Nothing.
You sure?
Yeah, uh, she's... she's dead.
She was a loser, a heroin addict.
She died of AIDS
and she had the virus when she was pregnant with you
and the virus can pass
from the mother to the baby.
Wait a second. So...
I have AIDS?
No, you have HIV, and you're healthy
because you've been taking medication.
Uh, no, no, no.
See, I just take a bunch of vitamins, that's it.
No, you've been taking medication to combat the virus.
No, no, they're just vitamins, man.
No, your grandmother told me
and I confirmed it with your doctor.
Well, why wouldn't she tell me?
I think she wanted to protect you
and, um...
but you need to know.
So, my whole life, everybody's lied to me.
I'm not lying to you.
Coggins: How much longer, do you think?
Gordon, what's our ETA?
Well, there's the Kankakee River.
About 20 minutes.
You all right?
It's just a little chest pain.
I'll be okay.
Greene: Nitro spray.
Open your mouth.
Under your tongue.
On a scale of one to ten, how bad is the pain?
Big time ST elevation on the monitor.
Find the tenecteplase.
I'll do the heparin.
Wha-what's going on?
You're having a heart attack
but we're giving you clot-busting medicine.
Pulse ox down to 82.
Do you want to intubate?
Not if I don't have to.
Let's get him on a mask, 15 liters.
Maybe we should land.
No, Dr. Greene.
Dr. Greene, you'll get me there, right?
Yeah, I'll get you there.
Do you have a girlfriend?
Because, if you've slept with anybody
they'll have to be tested.
It's important, Trent.
You have to use condoms.
Yeah.
Can I go now?
Yeah.
Yup, your grandmother's waiting.
So, a case manager's going to phone you tomorrow.
See how you're doing.
You've got an appointment
next week with the Teen HIV Center.
And you can always reach me here.
ER always knows where to find me.
All right? All right.
Yeah.
Trent?
Thank you, doctor.
Coggins: "Hog butcher for the world, toolmaker, stacker of wheat
Player with railroads..."
"City of the Big Shoulders."
You know Sandburg's poetry.
Just that one.
After teaching English for ten years
I know them all.
Looks like you're feeling better.
ST segments are back down.
( phone rings )
Hello.
Yeah, we're about five minutes out.
Well, that's good.
Hold on.
Janet's on her way in.
Thanks.
Listen, we're going to need a gurney and...
What the hell's that?
It's the main rotor.
I got metal fragments in the gearbox.
What's wrong?
Corday: Mark!
Mark, are you there? Mark!
Gordon: Mayday, Mayday, Mayday.
This is Lifeguard 9-7-Kilo
on emergency descent.
Cinch him in tight.
I'm shutting down for auto rotation.
Crash?
No, we're going to make it.
Hold on, everybody.
Mark, can you hear me?!
What's going on?
I don't know.
There were horns, shouting, now there's nothing.
Mark?
VFR position.
industrial area...
a scrap yard near 95th and Commercial.
Now, when I get enough rotor speed
I'm going to pull on the pitch.
That should cushion our landing.
We're falling.
Hang in there, Tom.
Gordon: Here we go.
All right, everybody out.
Come on, get out now.
Okay, get the monitor.
Got it.
Pumps are down.
Let's go. Move away.
You got the feet?
I got the feet.
Let's go together.
All right, we got to move.
How far?
Just keep going.
I'll tell you when.
( yells )
You all right?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Let's go, come on.
Tom, how you doing there?
SATs are down to 78.
All right, I got to tube him.
All right, all right. This is far enough.
This will shield us if the fuel tank goes.
Give me four of versed.
100 of sux.
Right.
Tom, we need to stick a tube down your throat.
Help you breathe.
Do they know where we are?
Yeah, yeah, I called it in.
They'll find us.
I got it.
Do they know anything?
ATC's got a Mayday call with location.
EMS and fire are rolling.
Are there any injuries?
They didn't say.
Well, call them back, damn it.
What's going on?
Mark's chopper went down.
What?
They crashed?
It was an emergency landing.
We don't know that.
We don't know anything.
Randi, call County Dispatch.
They don't know anything more...
I don't care!
Whoa, whoa. Hey, hey, look.
I can't have this place fall apart now.
Elizabeth, get on and stay on with CDO and keep us posted.
Randi, how are we doing?
You've got 19 patients waiting to be seen.
All right, Malucci, grab some charts.
Abby, draw some labs
start some IVs for anyone who needs one
get Carter to order X rays from triage, all right?
Let's move, people, now.
Where the hell is Kovac?
We're still trying.
( playing "I Got It Bad and That Ain't Good" )
Very nice.
Appreciate it.
You play here a lot?
Yeah, I work here and the Navy Pier.
What about at night?
Yeah, sometimes for the after-dinner crowd.
Have you... ever seen this man?
No, I would remember a guy like that.
You don't seem like a cop.
I'm a doctor.
Try the tour boat ticket guy.
He's here all the time.
I did. Thanks.
Sorry I can't help you.
Greene: Good breath sounds.
Keep him on high flow oxygen.
15 more minutes and we suck the tank dry.
Where's EMS?
They sound close.
Yeah, but they can't see us.
They're going to have to call in a police chopper.
Well, we can't wait.
Do you have any flares?
There's a Verry pistol in the chopper
but I can barely walk.
I'll get it.
Left side behind the pilot seat.
If you smell fuel leaking, stay away.
Luka, it's Abby.
Um, could you call me when you get this message
'cause I've been trying to reach you everywhere
and I'm getting a little bit worried, so...
Abby.
Call me.
Miss Skye here complains of abdominal pain.
Well, it's not really my abdomen.
I can't believe I'm actually embarrassed.
Well, we see everything here.
Okay.
I got a roll of money stuck up my...
birth canal?
Look, could you hurry up?
I got a cab waiting
with the meter running, okay?
Dr. Benton, I need you right now.
Six month baby boy, respiratory distress.
Abby.
Uh... just hold on one second.
Temp's 103.
Coarse crackles bilaterally.
Pulse ox is only 75.
Let's take a look.
Sounds like pneumonia.
Let's get a pediatric intubation tray.
Move now, people.
We got a line.
I'll draw CBC and blood cultures.
Damn, I don't even do pediatric intubations.
Where's Cleo?
She took a kid to PICU.
Get her down here now.
What size tube?
We use two and a half in the delivery room.
I think I need something bigger.
Uh, three, three and a half?
I don't know.
Abby: Got the labs.
Move.
He's clamped down.
I can't get the blade in.
Paralyze him.
What's the dose?
You need his weight.
He's vomiting. Suction. Come on.
Pulse ox is dropping.
What do we have?
Difficult intubation.
I can't dose him without a weight.
That's what the Broselow tape is for.
Okay, we're in the red zone.
2.6 of etomidate, 18 of sux.
Premedicate with .17 of atropine, 14 of lido.
Bag him. Keep some crichoid pressure.
I couldn't see the cords.
That's because you had
the wrong blade and the wrong tube.
Thanks for coming down.
Drugs are on board.
He's loose.
Okay, here we go.
Haleh: Dr. Benton?
Hold on, hold on.
Finch: Okay...
I'm in, bag him.
Dr. Benton, do you want to close
to paramedic traffic?
I've got this.
Hang 400 of ceftriaxone.
Vent settings will be tidal volume and 90 cc's...
No monitored beds and we're boarding five ICU patients.
All right, close to paramedics.
You sure you want to do that?
We've been getting a lot of bad press lately.
Media's been tracking all of our closures.
What would you do, Carter?
I don't know. Tough call.
Dr. Benton, South Side Urgent Center wants to send a patient.
Haleh says we're closed to transfers.
It's just a backache.
Their X-ray machine's down.
I got the other doc...
Fine, fine! Send him.
So, do we close? And don't ask me.
They don't pay me enough to run this place.
Paramedics found them on the south side.
No casualties, thank God.
Thank you.
Uh...
Thank you.
Trent?
Hey, they told us to wait because you were busy.
Is she a friend of yours?
Uh... she's my girlfriend.
Your girlfriend?
Thought you said you didn't have one.
I brought her here. You think that was easy?
You got to be honest with me.
Is she the only one?
Yes, the only one.
I've kissed other girls though.
Is-is that a problem?
No sex with anyone else?
No, no.
And you didn't use condoms?
I love her, man.
All right, okay.
Let's run some tests.
We'll see where we are.
You want to ride up front, Doc?
No, I'm staying with Tom.
Nearest facility's Oakdale Community, seven minute ETA.
Nope, we're going to County.
That's 20 minutes away.
Dispatch doesn't want us to leave our catchment area.
I'll take responsibility.
Roy, the doctor says we go to County.
Can't. County's closed.
What?
They just closed to ER saturation.
That's okay. I'm an attending there.
They'll take us. Let's go.
Can you patch me through to the ambulance?
Dr. Corday, surgical consult in exam four.
I'll be there.
Just give me the number.
Excuse me.
I'm looking for Dr. Corday.
Are you Janet?
Yeah.
Elizabeth Corday.
Oh, hi.
We expect them very soon.
How's Tom doing?
Quite well, I understand.
Apparently, no one was hurt in the landing.
What landing?
Just something minor with the helicopter.
So, how long have you two been engaged?
Three years.
So, he's not in the helicopter?
No, in an ambulance.
My goodness, three years.
That seems like a long time.
Right after he gave me the ring, he got the flu.
We thought it was no big deal
but then the virus went to his heart.
We spend a lot of time in hospitals.
Have you seen the incarcerated hernia yet?
In a minute.
No, no, no, no-- now.
EKG on a new chest-pain patient.
Let me see it.
I got a guy on a backboard.
He's been there for two hours.
When you going to clear his neck?
When I get there.
You want me to call Weaver in? No.
Are you ever going to sew me up?
You know what, we're busy.
Just wait right there.
What's this?
Second board. We're totally backed up.
Four patients just left without being seen.
Oh, oh, oh, I know what the solution is.
We see them, send off labs and X rays
and have them wait in chairs.
Come on, are you crazy?
We need monitoring, IVs, medication...
The problem is, you doctors order too many damn tests.
You should be reviewing their charts, keeping things moving.
Stroke patient needs a monitored bed.
We don't have them.
Tell them we'll put him in the hall.
And none of my nurses have even had lunch.
Ambulance dropped off a stab wound to the belly.
All right, all right, all right.
That's it, that's it.
Get me the phone.
Eddie: Heart rate is 40 after two of atropine.
What do you want now?
Amp of epi.
He needs a pacemaker, Dr. Greene.
We should be in a hospital right now-- any hospital.
( phone rings )
Rescue 82.
BP is down to 60 palp.
Open up the dopamine. It's for you.
Hello. Yeah, we're almost there.
No, he can't talk right now.
He's out.
I can't feel a pulse.
I got to go.
Starting chest compressions.
We could have been at Oakdale ten minutes ago.
I'm going on record that you overrode our policy.
There's going to be an incident report on this.
Shut up
and get back to work.
Hang in there, Tom.
You're going to make it.
Janet's there.
She's waiting for you.
How long's he been down?
He never arrested.
He just needs help maintaining a pulse.
You look exhausted.
He wouldn't let us relieve him.
Come on, I'll take over.
Coming through, we're coming through here.
This is Janet Wei, his fiancee.
Tom had a heart attack.
We need to put in a pacemaker.
You can take his hand.
Tom, it's me, I'm here. Can he hear me?
Greene: Keep talking to him.
It's Janet. He's squeezing my hand.
Corday: What's his BP?
Uh, 70 systolic
on 20 mikes of dopamine.
How about a intra-aortic balloon?
Not a bad idea. Oh, what's going on? We need the room.
Everything's backed up. We're supposed to be closed to paramedics.
Chuny, get that patient out of there.
Wait, the rapid infuser.
Greene: Clamp the central line.
Corday: Turn it off!
What the hell's going on?
I just got back from transport.
I left Benton in charge.
Benton?
Mortimer goes to X Ray.
Put the rectal bleed in Exam Three.
I got a patient who says her tongue is too smooth.
Tell her to get a life.
A smooth tongue can be a sign
of pernicious anemia, iron deficiency.
I can't leave for a day
without this place going to hell in a handbasket.
Benton: I've never seen it this busy before.
It's like this every day.
Peter, tell me we're not closed to trauma.
We're not. As of now, we're open.
How can we? We can't see another critical patient.
Abby, get me the nursing supervisor.
Move every remotely stable patient out of the ICUs.
Romano: I was under the mistaken impression
you could manage an ER.
Clear out Exams One and Two and fast track them.
I was the only attending. Kovac never showed up.
He didn't show?
He might have switched his shift with someone.
In 20 years, I have never been late for surgery
but I guess you people work on a different standard
and, Peter, based on your performance today
maybe you're not the guy for the per diem job.
Oh.
Dr. Carter?
Yeah.
Lab results on Emma Miller.
Oh, man.
That's tough.
She's 15 years old.
Pacer is capturing well.
Setting the rate at 80.
I got your transducer here.
Greene: How you doing?
Passing a 40cc balloon.
I need to check position with fluoro.
Janet, why don't you come talk to me outside?
( whispering ): I'll be right back, okay?
This pump should bring his blood pressure up.
Will he live long enough to get the heart transplant?
I don't know.
I want to marry him.
I don't know if he's going to be able to leave the hospital.
Can we do it here?
We could try and arrange it.
I think if we got married, it might help.
What if they made a mistake?
I wouldn't tell you if I wasn't certain.
But I don't feel sick.
You should do the test again.
Emma, if you start taking medication
right now...
you could stay healthy.
No, I know what happens. Everybody dies.
That's not true.
That's not... Look at Trent.
He's had HIV his whole life. Look at him.
I wish we'd never had sex.
Emma, I didn't know, I swear.
Dr. Carter tell her, please.
This is a lot.
This is a lot for you to handle
and you're both going to need some help
so before you go, I would like you both
to talk to a counselor.
Emma, Emma.
Hold on, you two. Hold on.
I'll leave you two alone for a little while
but before you do anything... talk it over.
Definitely, thanks.
Hey, hey, come on.
Come on, shh. It's okay.
Why is Mr. Chang still here?
He's waiting for a second CBC.
Okay, do another hemocue.
If it's over 11, send him home.
Torelli's cardiac enzymes.
Great. All right, she's out of here.
Clears up another monitored bed.
You know, Romano was out of line.
When isn't he?
It's wrong to throw you into the deep end and expect you to swim.
Nobody masters E.R. management on their first day.
What's this?
Malik: Back pain. Collapsed at triage.
Both trauma rooms are full.
Send him to Curtain Two.
Move him out of there. Go!
I need a central line kit now.
BP 60 palp.
Could be a ruptured aneurysm.
All right, CBC, coag, type and cross for eight
four units of O-neg. Let's prep the neck. Move.
I feel a pulsatile mass.
Hey, Malik, is there any history on this guy?
I need a trauma kit.
This is a triple lumen CVP. Here.
History of hypertension and high cholesterol.
Give me an NG and a Foley. I need a Sonosite.
Dr. Benton, it says here that you accepted
this patient from an urgent care center.
What, and he's been waiting in chairs?
For two hours.
I can't find the subclavian.
Put him in Trendelenburg.
Look, they said it was just a back sprain.
The doctor told you that.
Well, I, uh... I didn't exactly talk to the doctor.
Oh, great, and now he's bleeding out.
Greene: Take a deep breath.
MAP is 78 with the pump.
Is that good or bad?
It took you out of heart failure
and got you off your breathing tube.
Sats are up to 99.
Okay, let's get him on five liters, nasal cannula.
Connie, why don't you grab a blood gas kit?
Where's Janet?
She's trying to get a clerk from City Hall
to come issue a marriage license.
( chuckling ): That's crazy.
People in love do crazy things.
I wanted to wait for a transplant
so I could chase her down the aisle.
I didn't want her to marry a cardiac cripple.
If you get a heart, she won't.
If one's available, if the tissues match.
How long can I last on this pump?
Couple weeks.
Pretty lousy odds.
They were worse when you were having a heart attack
and the chopper was going down.
See any zephirin?
Yeah, top shelf.
Hey, I heard about your teenagers.
They're so young.
It's pretty rough.
Are you okay?
Yeah, I think so.
Do you want to take a break?
I'm going to plug in two new patients.
I'll come find you.
Talk to Kovac?
Not yet.
Woman: Dr. Kovac?
Yeah?
We finished the autopsy.
I can review some of the pertinent findings.
Mm-hmm.
There were multiple contusions
to the occipital cortex
with herniation to the foramen magnum
and if you'll take a look here
you'll see numerous fractures
consistent with repetitive blunt trauma.
I know how he died.
Well, I can tell you that he was a smoker
based on the lung findings.
Also, he probably once lived in Central California.
There were foci of pulmonary fibrosis
consistent with coccidioidomycosis.
It's endemic to the San Joaquin Valley.
That's an agricultural area.
Maybe he grew up on a farm.
Well, I don't know.
There's grease under the fingernails
and a biker club tattoo.
He could be just a drifter, but we'll probably never know.
Happens all the time.
Not such a smart idea
to take your Razor down a flight of stairs, huh?
Were you wearing a helmet?
Yeah, what do you think I am, stupid?
Ooh. Well, we'll see after the X ray.
Right wrist film; something for the pain, maybe half of a...
It happened so fast.
We were having a fight
and he ran into the street and a car hit him.
We're doing everything we can.
Half a what?
Weaver: Flaccid paralysis.
Looks like a high C-spine fracture.
Haleh: Dr. Carter?
Weaver: What's the rhythm?
Marquez: V-fib.
Charge to 360.
Emma: Please don't let him die.
Get her out of here, please.
Marquez: Ready.
Weaver: And clear.
Emma: I need to be with him.
Marquez: Still V-fib.
Weaver: Charge again.
Hey, Doc. Hey, thanks for coming down.
Sure. What do you need?
31-year-old patient, end-stage heart failure.
He may not make it to transplant.
What denomination?
I don't know. Can he speak?
For last rites, I really need to know that.
No. He and his fiancee want to get married.
Tonight?
He's too sick; we can't move him.
We got to do it here.
Were you able to get a license?
I tried, but City Hall's closing.
You don't have a marriage license?
Can you do it anyway?
I'm sorry. A marriage isn't legally binding without a license.
How about tomorrow?
He may not make it till tomorrow.
Can't you help these people?
They want your blessing.
They have very little time.
Well, as long as everyone understands
it won't hold up in court.
Yeah, yeah.
Are you ready to tie the knot?
Come on, let's go talk to Tom.
Dr. Kovac, did you trade your shift?
No.
Hey, where have you been?
I heard they couldn't reach you
and you didn't answer your page.
What's the problem?
That I had to come in today
and cover for you.
I thought I was on tonight.
No. You were on today.
Then-then I'm sorry.
There must've been some mistake.
There was no one with enough experience
to cover for you.
We almost lost two patients.
Luka, this is grounds for dismissal.
Fine, Kerry, fire me.
I'm...
Look, I know that you've been through a lot.
If you need to take some time off
you should tell me.
But you can't miss anymore shifts.
I can work tonight.
We don't need you tonight.
You should go home.
Go on. Go.
Luka, wait.
What?
Wait a minute. Don't walk away.
Where have you been?
Abby, please.
I-I want to help.
Just talk to me.
There's nothing to say. Okay?
"To have and to hold, to love and to cherish
"as long as you both shall live.
"The union of husband of wife in heart, body and mind
"is intended by God for their mutual joy
"for the health and comfort given to one another
"in prosperity and adversity
"and, when is God's will, for the procreation of children
and their nurture..."
You can stay as long as you want, okay?
Emma, I am so sorry.
Get out of here.
Emma...
It's your fault...
By the power vested in me
I pronounce you husband and wife.
Go ahead and kiss your bride, Tom.
( chuckles )
Congratulations. Congratulations.
I'm going to break all the rules
and allow you to have one sip of champagne.
Thanks.
Well, since this is the honeymoon suite
I think you're entitled to a little privacy.
We're very grateful.
Thank you.
Tom: Yeah.
For everything.
Nice folks.
Tell them to get a license and I'll do it again. No charge.
Thanks.
Hey, what about our wedding coordinator?
I totally forgot to call and cancel.
Oh, she'll be furious.
Well, blame it on me.
I mean, it was a medical emergency.
Oh, the hell with her.
Excuse me?
This is all so silly.
I don't want a rose-entwined arbor
with trained doves.
I don't want champagne served out of crystal flutes.
I understand.
Who cares about a bloody ice sculpture?
Not me.
I just want to get married
in a simple ceremony.
I don't know.
I was looking forward to those doves.
( both laughing )
So, I spoke to the O.R.
The aneurysm repair is going well.
I'm glad to hear it.
I think it's best for now
if you just see patients.
Here.
If that's what you want.
Peter, you're an excellent surgeon
but E.R. management is not the best use of your skills.
Leave that to us.
( sighs )
Hello, Mrs. Barnwell.
I'm Doctor Benton.
So, I understand you have a pain in your hip.
That's right. And I've been lying here for three hours.
Oh, well, I'm very sorry about that.
Pardon me for asking, but are you an intern?
No, no, no.
I'm a faculty physician.
Oh. Your mother must be very proud.
Yeah, she was.
So, how long have you had this pain?
Before we get much further
I'd like to say that I would be more at ease
with another doctor.
Excuse me?
You look like a fine young man
but, uh, I've always had white doctors.
I've always felt more comfortable that way.
So, you're saying that you only want to see a white doctor?
( chuckles )
If it's all right with you.
It's fine.
You'll just have to wait another three hours.
What happened to him?
I don't know.
Hey, uh, have you seen Abby?
I saw her punch out.
Hey, Carter, you got a minute?
Uh, actually
I'm just on my way out.
Carter, wait.
John, you had a bad day.
We all have bad days.
Look at me.
You have to make tough choices
do what you think is right
and accept the outcome.
I shouldn't have told him.
You had to.
See you tomorrow.
Hey.
I'm off in 20 minutes, uh...
You want to get some dinner?
I got an A.A. meeting at 9:00.
You'll make it.
Can I join you?
It's a counter, Peter; you can sit anywhere.
So you survived.
( chuckles )
Weaver said I was incompetent.
Really?
Well, I mean, that's what she implied.
The per diem job is just temporary
until you get back into surgery.
Yeah, but I need to show them
that I can run the E.R.
Why? It has no bearing on your surgical career.
Yeah, but it reflects on me.
You know, I should've been able to handle it.
Can't be perfect at everything.
Yeah, but, Cleo, I can learn the job; I can do it well.
So do you feel better
having said this to a sympathetic ear?
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, I guess so.
Thanks.
You know, I've had some problems
and I haven't had anyone to talk to.
Are you ever going to be there for me?
Because you sure as hell haven't been.
( sighs )
Kovac: Who is it?
It's me.
Can I come in, please?
Sure.
Abby...
You don't have to talk.
