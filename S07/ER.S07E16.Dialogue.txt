Previously on E.R.:
GREENE: No contractions since the third round.
Fetal heart rate looks good.
And the monitor stays on for at least 24 hours.
Intern, first day.
Oh, yeah? Hey, welcome.
Rena Trujillo. Nice to meet you.
And you.
He recommended formal competency testing--
MRI, personality tests.
16-year-old girl in Trauma Two.
She parked her car in front of a train.
She's also in a major depression.
No real remorse.
About the suicide attempt?
For the train wreck.
Oh, my.
Do you think that
you're going to get off before 12:00?
I'll try to be quiet.
No, wake me.
Dr. Legaspi?
No.
I'm Detective Graham.
This is Detective Watkins, Chicago PD.
We have this listed as Doctor Legaspi's address.
Is everything all right?
Does Doctor Legaspi live here?
Yes, she does. She's inside.
Who are you?
I'm Doctor Weaver.
You live here, too?
No. I... I don't, I'm just...
You know, I don't want to be rude, but I'm... I'm freezing.
Oh, I'm sorry. By all means.
We just need to speak to Dr. Legaspi.
Luka
I think one of the kids from the coffee shop
broke into the apartment.
I got breakfast.
I don't believe in breakfast.
It's the most important meal of the day.
That's never been medically proven.
Why are you up?
It's morning.
I got coffee, bagels and a real estate paper.
I'm thinking I should get a new place.
What, did the hotel fire you for getting up too early?
No.
Well, somebody should.
Hey.
Look, there's an entire warehouse in here
for the price of some condos.
That is very nice...
especially in the summer
when all you smell is dead flesh.
It's the slaughterhouse district.
It's still a good deal.
You know, first you live in a boat, then a hotel
and now a meat plant.
What's next, a tree house?
You're really not a morning person, are you?
( chuckles )
Hey, boy.
Hey.
Good morning.
Nice toga.
Yeah, I seem to have lost my clothes.
Oh, your pants are on the couch
and Norman had your socks
so I put them in your shoes.
You named your dog Norman?
That was his name when I got him from the shelter.
He likes you. You think?
Yeah, otherwise he would have bit you.
You want some eggs?
Oh, yeah, sure.
Sorry.
( door slams )
My roommate.
I think we kept her up last night.
She seems a little angry.
More jealous than anything.
You want some tea?
Uh, do you have any coffee?
No, sorry. I don't drink coffee.
That's okay.
I don't usually do this... bring somebody home.
Trust me, I... I don't, either.
I really had a lot of fun last night.
Me, too.
Maybe we could do it again some other time?
What about, um...?
Oh, well, you'll just have to be a little quieter.
Me?
Yeah, I think you yelled "stat."
I did not.
( laughs )
Are you working today?
I got a lecture in the morning, but I'll be in around 1:00.
You want to have lunch?
Okay.
These are good eggs.
Oh, thank you.
LEGASPI: I was called down to assess for suicidal ideation.
It was my job to determine
if the patient needed to be admitted.
WATKINS: For a psych hold?
Yes.
GRAHAM: And it was your professional opinion that she did?
Doctor Legaspi?
Yes.
She was, um...
confused about her sexual identity.
She was clinically depressed and had spent
a considerable amount
of time planning
to hurt herself.
You're awfully quiet this morning.
Just thinking. About?
Oh, nothing important.
I hope you're not worrying
about this silly competency evaluation.
This "silly" evaluation will determine
whether or not I keep my license.
They're merely a formality.
NASA astronauts take fewer tests.
You know if I don't score above...
Mark, stop. You're a brilliant doctor
regardless of whether you put a round peg
in a square hole.
Where'd you hear I put a round peg
in a square hole?
Hey, hey, easy.
You don't want to shake up that kid
more than he has to be.
Listen, our baby's fine.
I've taken every necessary precaution.
I've been extremely careful.
I haven't had a contraction
in two weeks, you know.
You still need to take it easy.
I'm medicated, I'm monitored
and I'm more than able to go back to work
so stop being such a nervous Nellie.
Okay, one: don't ever call me Nellie
and two: if you overdo it, you can go into preterm...
Yes, yes, yes. I am a doctor, too, you know.
Well, this doctor's orders are to slow down.
I seem to remember
giving you similar orders after your surgery
and I don't think you listened to me, either.
Meet me for lunch.j
If you're not in labor.
Is that decaf?
Some guy swallowed a couple dozen on a bet.
Now he's got tummy trouble.
No doubt. Any suggestions?
Yeah, why don't you get some colored rocks
and maybe one of those
deep-sea divers that bubbles.
LOCKHART: Carter, want a pet?
No, thanks.
How about some coffee?
What's this?
Some guy dropped it off a few minutes ago.
You want me to read the card?
No, thank you.
Too late. It's from Rena.
Oh, who's Rena?
Child Life Specialist.
Helped me with an unruly kid last week.
Really?
So, what's she look like, Carter?
Um, you know, I don't know.
She's blond, that tall
kind of cute in her own way, right?
Don't ask me. I didn't get a gift basket.
Now, if she helped you, Carter
why are you getting all the goodies?
Because I gave her a good assessment on her internship.
Actually, the card says...
Thank you very much, Amira.
"Thanks for a great evening.
You can bring your own coffee next time."
Must have been one hell of an assessment, Carter.
( all chuckling )
We're going to move you to your own room
okay, Mary?
What if Jesus comes for me and I'm not here?
I'll have one of the nurses send Him upstairs.
Will you? Yeah.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Hey.
Got a minute?
So, Bloody Mary's back, eh?
She's harmless.
I tried to page you.
Yeah, well, it's been pretty crazy upstairs
not just because of the patients.
So what was this thing with the police?
Oh, you should have stuck around.
It was quite a little party.
Yeah, I had to be on at 7:30.
So did I.
Look, I didn't abandon you on purpose.
I didn't say you did.
Okay. What did they say?
They were following up on Shannon Wallace
the attempted suicide who caused that train derailment.
They probably want to talk to you.
Why?
The patient has accused me of sexual harassment.
What?
Yeah, she told the police
that I came on to her and I touched her.
Why would she say such a thing?
Well, she caused over 30 deaths.
She's probably trying to divert the heat off of herself.
Yeah, but why-why would she accuse you of that?
How would she even know that you were...?
Gay?
I... I told her.
You what?
I was trying to help her.
Oh, no, Kim...
Kim, what were you thinking?
I don't know, Kerry. That she needed help?
Yeah, so you disclose your personal life
to an unstable patient who you don't even know?
I-I...
Mr. Hollis is crashing.
Okay.
I'll see you later.
Yeah.
BABCOCK: Elizabeth, I thought you were
on bed rest.
Hardly.
Is this another one of my patients, Peter?
What?
Well, you seem to have taken on
several additional responsibilities
during my absence.
Well, I didn't have really much choice.
Oh. So, you had to organize the educational conferences
for the next two months and do my interview?
Well, I thought you were on medical leave
for preterm labor.
Romano told me to keep this place running.
Well, I was on medical leave, but now I'm back
and I am ready to resume all of my responsibilities
as Associate Chief of Surgery
and if anyone has a problem with that
they can come and see me.
Think Greene developed that brain tumor
after she got pregnant?
Can I help you?
Oh, a glass of water would be nice.
My throat's a little dry.
Has anybody seen you?
Oh, no. I didn't want to bother anybody.
That's why we're here
but you need to check in
with the receptionist at the Admit Desk
and then you can speak with a nurse.
I'm afraid there's nothing they can do for me.
I'm dying.
Who's your doctor?
I don't have one.
Never did.
Then how do you know you're dying?
Oh, it's in the cards, dear.
Ah, you read tarot cards?
Mm-hmm. Cards, palms
tea leaves. Give me your hand.
Come on. I won't hurt you.
Mmm.
Oh, my. You do have a bit of a black cloud
hanging over you, don't you, dear?
See, there's a crack in your life line.
Probably dry skin.
Listen, while I'm here
why don't you let me check you over?
Well, you can if you want to.
The cards have already told me.
I will be dead by sundown.
Bolus a liter of saline and call animal control.
How's our old friend Super Larry doing?
He's got a fever of 100.8
but no source of infection.
You might want to check for an aspiration pneumonia.
He had one last year.
Hey, wake up, Super Larry.
Get a head CT. He's got abrasions.
He might've fallen.
You would, too, if you slept on the sidewalk.
Hey, Dr. Weaver. This is Detective Graham.
You ran off before I got a chance to talk to you.
Why would you want to talk to me?
You saw a patient by the name
of Shannon Wallace that Dr. Legaspi also treated?
Yeah, I called for the psych consultation.
But you didn't stay with her?
No. We had a mass casualty situation.
She only had minor injuries.
So you effectively left Dr. Legaspi alone with the patient?
I suppose.
Are you aware that the patient said
Dr. Legaspi sexually assaulted her?
Yes, and it's ridiculous.
The young woman had psychological problems.
I mean, she tried to kill herself.
Nonetheless, you know, we have to follow up the accusations.
What exactly is your relationship with Dr. Legaspi?
We're colleagues.
Do you live together?
No.
But you were at her house early this morning
and by the look of things...
To be honest, I really don't have time
for this right now. I'm sorry.
County is hard-core blood and guts
but I guarantee you you'll rack up
more surgical hours here than anywhere in the country.
I must admit I'm intrigued, Dr. Romano.
I'll be in touch.
I look forward to that.
Is she another one of my replacements?
Lizzie, my, how you've grown.
How are you feeling?
I was doing wonderfully until I got into work.
What work? I thought you were on bed rest.
See, I wish people would stop saying that.
I took a little time off to recoup some energy
but now I'm fine.
Oh, that would explain
the, uh, baby monitor I see strapped to your belly
or are you just glad to see me?
I spent 48 hours in the hospital.
Yes, I've been doing home monitoring
but I can assure you, I'm ready, willing
and more than able to return to work.
Mm-hmm. For how long? A week?
Look, I appointed you Associate Chief so that I'd have
a lieutenant on the front lines that I could count on.
Now, you want to be barefoot and pregnant in the kitchen
you have my blessing; go forth and multiply
but this is why surgery's an Old Boy's Club.
Have you any idea of the hospital's policy
on sexual harassment and discrimination?
We still have one of those?
Yes, we do, and I'd be so happy
to reacquaint you on the section of maternity leave.
Well, I'd rather do a bowel resection, thank you.
Do you know, Robert, I read somewhere
about a pregnant woman who killed her husband
and got off on a temporary insanity defense
because of her hormone imbalance.
Okay, you want to work?
Fine. We're presenting three cases for M and M tomorrow.
Pull the charts from Medical Records
track down the X rays in radiology
and get the slides from pathology.
No, no, I want back in surgery.
Uh, uh, uh. First things first.
Then you can set up the projection microscope
and make 35 millimeter slides of the gross pathology specimens.
Anything else?
Make sure there's coffee and donuts for 100
especially the ones with the little sprinkles.
MAN: Give 'em back
give 'em back, give 'em back.
Shh. Mr. Perkins, keep it down. Shh, shh, shh.
This bitch stole my teeth.
You call me that one more time
I'm going to put that foley back in you.
Okay, here. You might want to, uh, wash these off before...
before you put them back in.
Abby, can you help me with this?
Sure.
So, how long has she been sick?
A few days. I thought it was just a cold.
Any fever?
I don't think so.
Any problems at birth?
History of lung disease?
No. No, she's been a really healthy baby.
Dr. Kovac, can I speak with you for a minute?
Yeah.
Get a quick set of vitals and put her on a pulse ox.
So, have you figured out
what's causing Super Larry's fever?
No, no, not yet.
I'm still waiting on the lab for his blood work.
Maybe something will turn up.
Okay.
Luka, wait.
Uh, you're probably wondering
what that police detective was all about today.
Not really.
There were some charges filed against Dr. Legaspi.
Oh.
I'd-I'd like to keep to the rumors to a minimum
for Dr. Legaspi's sake.
I understand.
I only bring it up
because this place seems to feed on gossip
and-and in light of an invest...
Dr. Weaver? Dr. Romano's looking for you.
Says he wants to see you up in his office immediately. Thank you.
He also said if you didn't come up the the moment you heard
this message, he was going to fire both of us.
The temp is 100.2.
Pulse is 120
with a pulse ox of 94.
That's not too bad.
No wheezing.
I appreciated some retractions.
A little.
We'll get a chest film just to make sure.
In the meantime, put some saline
in her nose for a few minutes
and, uh, use the bulb syringe.
See if that helps.
Is she going to be okay?
Well, she doesn't have a fever
and her lungs are pretty clear, which is good.
Yeah, but she still seems to have trouble
catching her breath.
Well, babies tend to breathe through their nose
so they can have some difficulty when they're stuffed up
but I'm sure she'll be fine once I help her with that.
He knows that I'm here, right?
Yes.
And he is aware that I'm working
in the E.R. today?
I would imagine so.
Well, he made this sound
like it was some kind of emergency.
Well, I'm sure he won't be much longer.
Okay, he can page me when he's ready.
Dr. Legaspi.
Kerry.
What are you waiting for, Dr. Weaver
a written invitation?
( screaming )
Is that it?
Is it fixed?
Can I go?
No, we have to put a splint on you
and check another X ray.
Just try and relax, okay?
Malik, why don't you finish this splint
and order up a chem seven, cholesterol and a tox screen.
You got a skin infection on your forehead
and it could move into an infection
around your brain. How's it going, Dave?
It turns out the Weasel here is suffering
from a self-inflicted wound.
Weasel?
That's my ring name.
Yeah, Todd's a basement wrestler.
I had an uncle who was a closet ballerina.
So, is your friend there a wrestler, too?
James is awesome.
Calls himself Mr. Midnight.
How'd you manage to do this?
He sliced himself with a razor blade.
It's called blading. Fans love it.
Yeah, I bet. You got this, Dave?
Yeah. I'm just trying to convince Superfly here
that slicing open his scalp?
Not such a good idea.
Update his tetanus if he needs it.
See, there's another risk-- tetanus.
Then of course there's nerve damage, hepatitis.
You could put your eye out, you know?
And don't forget about scarring.
Scarring, that's... that's not a good one.
Chicks don't dig scarring.
They don't dig that Frankenstein look
if you know what I'm saying.
Right, Dr. Greene?
What's that?
Never mind.
You could've at least given me a heads up.
Yeah, this is the first I've heard
of these allegations.
But you must have had some indication
that she was a lesbian.
What has that got to do with anything?
It seems to me that's the crux of the problem, don't you think?
No. The problem seems to be a false accusation
from a patient with psychological problems.
She could have just as easily made
a similar indictment against one of the male doctors.
But she didn't, did she?
Have you had any other complaints
against Legaspi in the E.R.?
Of course not.
And, uh, she's never displayed
any unacceptable sexual behavior that you've witnessed?
Well?
What do you think?
I'm getting a sneaking suspicion that you're holding out on me.
Oh, please, Robert.
I think you're trying to protect her.
Of course I'm trying to protect her.
You should be, too.
She is a damn good doctor.
I'm calling for an emergency disciplinary hearing today
with you and Anspaugh.
Why? You know these charges are a joke.
No one's laughing, Kerry.
This is a witch-hunt.
No, this is damage control.
Okay. Are we finished?
For now.
Can I give you some friendly advice?
No.
You know, we spent, like, an hour hooking up
two of my grandfather's polo ponies
to this old pushcart.
Were you insane?
We were... we were, like, nine.
We didn't know any better.
Anyway, it was so cool.
It was just like Spartacus, you know?
Right up until the part where my grandmother sees us.
Oh, no. She screams, the horses spook.
My cousin, as usual, bails.
The horses go one way, I go the other
and I'm left holding onto the reins.
Actually, I'm still working on that. Thanks.
Thank you.
How was your...?
How was the seminar today?
It was a lecture on Developmental Psychology.
Freud, Piaget, Kohlberg. It was boring.
Blast from the past, huh?
It's like being back in college.
Well, I am in college.
No, I meant as an undergraduate.
I am.
Hmm...
Excuse me.
I thought you said you were a peds intern.
No. I'm doing a Child Life internship in the peds department.
I need 480 hours of clinical experience
to certify, and I figured if I start now
I'll be done by the time I graduate.
Graduate?
How old are you?
20. Well, in September.
You're 19?
Yeah, are you okay?
Oh, my God.
Hi.
Is she doing better?
Well, she's still not getting
as much air into her lungs as we'd like.
It might just be her cold
but we're going to get a chest X ray just in case.
Can I go with her?
Of course.
Are you all right?
Yeah.
She just hasn't let me get much sleep
in the last couple days.
Why don't you get a cup of coffee while we wait?
Okay.
Hey.
Hey.
You got a minute?
Sure.
What's up?
I just had, uh...
I just had lunch with Rena
and, uh, I think that there's a problem.
What? She, uh, chews with her mouth open?
She's young.
So? You're not exactly an old man yourself.
You could use someone to loosen you up a little bit.
She's really young.
What is she like... 23, or something?
Twenty-two?
Is she 20?
In September.
She's a teenager.
Carter? I didn't know.
You didn't ask?
Women don't like to tell you their age.
Well, she's not a woman. She's a girl.
She's a woman, believe me.
Did you sleep with her?
Oh, my God. You did.
I didn't know.
You couldn't tell?
Did you break up with her?
Not yet.
What are you waiting for? Going to call your lawyer?
Well, she's very mature for her age.
You know, she's cool, she's fun.
She's Britney Spears' little sister.
Thank you.
DIERDRE: Excuse me.
Yeah.
Did they bring May to radiology?
No, not yet.
Then where is she?
Oh. They must have picked her up
when I was in the hall talking to Dr. Carter.
Darrel. Hey, Darrel.
Did you take the little girl in Exam Four?
Not yet.
You didn't take her?
No, she's my next pickup, okay?
If, if he doesn't have her, then who does?
She might've been moved to another room.
Just, um... Hey, hold that elevator.
Is that May Jeffries?
FINCH: Who?
Uh, May Jeffries.
She's a four-month-old in Exam Four. Sorry.
Please tell me what's happening.
Okay, just a second.
Haleh, did you move a four-month-old baby
out of Exam Four?
No.
I can't find her.
Where is she?
I need Security.
Where's Security?
I need somebody to lock down the E.R. now.
Dr. Greene?
Uh, just a second. Can you call...?
Dr. Greene, I'm missing a patient-- a baby.
I think someone took her from Exam Four.
I was waiting for transport to take her down to radiology
and I just stepped outside to talk to Carter for two...
Where the baby? Where's my baby?
Could you alert Security? Call the police, grab some nurses.
We'll do a room-by-room search.
Hey! Hey!
Look... Look out!
Hold it, hold it, hold it. Wait.
DRIVER: What's your problem, lady?
Sorry.
You didn't see anyone enter the room?
Did you?
What?
See anybody? A doctor, a nurse, an orderly.
No, no.
I feel like I should be helping them look.
Look, we've-we've got that covered, okay?
We're searching the hospital.
How long were you out of the room?
Like a minute, maybe two.
Maybe the person that took her is distraught
over recently losing their own baby.
I could check the hospital records.
We'll let you know if that's something we want to pursue.
Did you see anyone unusual in the vicinity?
Someone you didn't recognize?
This is an E.R.
It's filled with strangers.
I've told you everything I know.
I feel like I'm wasting my time here.
I-I should be doing something.
Just a few more questions.
It's okay, dear.
Sometimes God calls little babies home
to be His angels.
LEGASPI: Is there someone
that you would like me to call to be with you?
Your husband, maybe?
I'm divorced.
What is his name?
Ed.
Ed Jeffries...
but he lives in Boston now.
Okay.
The police would like to ask you some questions.
Do you feel up to that?
Okay. I will be back when they're done and we'll talk.
Okay.
Hey. Hey.
How's she doing?
Better than I would be.
Um, how was your meeting with Romano?
Homophobic, misogynistic.
The usual.
Degrading.
What'd you tell him?
The truth. That Shannon Wallace was a young woman
experiencing a severe sexual identity crisis
that she needed to know that being gay is not an affliction.
Yeah, and what did you tell him about us?
Oh...
Oh, I see.
Don't worry, Kerry.
Your secret's safe with me.
That's not what I meant.
No? No? What did you mean?
No, no.
You think that I am the only one
who has problems with this
that-that it's universally accepted
but that is not true.
So what? So we're supposed
to skulk about in the shadows
because some narrow-minded individuals disapprove?
No, no, I just think
you are fooling yourself if you...
How many openly gay women do you know
in hospital administrative positions?
Kerry. None.
It doesn't happen.
What does that have to do with anything?
I'm trying to explain to you
why this is difficult for me.
Well, guess what, Kerry? This isn't about you.
This is about a confused and frightened young woman
who would rather kill herself
than deal with the stigma of being gay.
Maybe it is about you.
CARTER: Abby, what are you doing?
Nothing.
I, um, I heard about a baby
that got scooped up
with the laundry in another hospital.
I know it's stupid. I just... I don't know what...
Can you give me a hand with a squirmer?
Sure.
WOMAN: Sit still, Jason.
I just need to look into your ears.
Do you think it's his adenoids?
His brother had them
taken out with his tonsils.
Abby, can you hold him still, please?
Uh, Haleh, can you help Carter?
Sorry.
Hey!
Excuse me.
Did you find her?
Not yet.
Okay, I was thinking.
She's sick, right?
So, whoever took her might
might take her to a pharmacy
to get some infant Tylenol
and they'll need diapers
It also seems to me she's not in the hospital anymore
so shouldn't you guys be setting up a roadblock
or checking the neighborhood?
We're doing everything we can.
But shouldn't we have heard something by now?
I mean, the chances of finding her
get worse every, every passing second, right?
FINCH: Abby.
Abby, did you get the labs back
on the jaundiced guy in Curtain Three?
Who?
Jagadeeshan.
No.
Well, could you try and find them? No, sorry.
( Dierdre crying )
These are the most recent photos I have.
Can I have them?
Look, I... I promise
to return them, ma'am.
Please.
Thank you.
Mrs. Jeffries, I know I can't say anything
to change the situation.
I just wanted to tell you how sorry I am.
She's my only baby.
I know.
I'm sure she's going to be fine.
Why would somebody take my baby?
Mr. Kinney can go home.
There's no known cure for being a pain in the ass.
Any news on the baby?
Nothing yet.
Dr. Greene, labs are back on that wrestler.
Anything show up?
I don't know. What were you looking for?
Nothing on the tox screen.
Cholesterol level's a little high for a teenager.
Too much fast food.
I think he's on steroids.
He's got acute acne, hirsutism, aggression.
What teenage boy doesn't?
What's the turnaround time on a steroids test?
Five days?
At least.
Hey, look, if you think he's using, just ask him.
He might cop to it.
I thought you forgot about me.
Look, man, I need to go home, all right?
I ordered some tests.
What kind of tests?
The kind that show that you're using steroids.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I think you do
but what you might not know
is that you're putting yourself at risk
for kidney failure, stroke, impotence.
You're crazy.
Where are you going? Home.
Sit back down, James.
Screw you, man! I'm leaving.
No, you've got to stay here
until your parents come and get you.
You called my parents?
Todd left. Somebody's got to get you home.
Man, forget this! Come on.
Leave me alone.
( groaning )
Dr. Greene.
I'm okay, I'm okay.
Just go get him.
Don't let him leave.
Hey. Hey, man, what are you doing?
Leaving. Why?
What are you afraid of?
I'm not afraid of anything.
I just had enough of this place.
We weren't finished working you up.
We're only here to help you.
Then let me go. What's the big rush?
Hey, hey, look, look.
Just take it easy, all right?
God! Stay out of my way, man!
Look, I don't want to hurt you.
Look, look.
Just relax, all right?
Come back inside. I mean it, man!
You can't keep me here.
My old man'll be pissed off if you don't let me leave.
Your father would want us to take care of you.
No. That doc is going to tell him I'm using steroids!
Look, my old man will kill me if he finds out.
He doesn't have to find out, all right?
But he said he was going to tell him.
James, you need to just settle down and come inside.
Okay?
Look.
You don't know my father.
He'll kill me if he finds out.
You're right, I don't know your father
but I know the type.
Trust me, okay?
Okay?
We'll work something out, right, Dr. Greene?
Sure, come on.
You have my word on it.
Deal? Come on.
Hey, who's got the guy in Exam Two? Carter.
Yeah, he's been restrained
in there for hours.
I hope so. Did you see all those bite marks?
Those are self-inflicted.
That guy practically ate himself alive.
Get somebody from Psych down here.
Let's get rid of him.
We've been waiting.
Psych's been slower than usual
answering their consults.
I hear they got a shake-up going on up there.
Dr. Legaspi's being fired.
Let's keep gossip to a minimum, Haleh.
That's not gossip.
The gossip is she's a lesbian.
Legaspi?
That's what I heard.
Really? Mm-hmm.
Follow my finger.
What happened?
MALUCCI: He got whacked in the head by a patient.
Show me your teeth.
I'm fine.
You should get a head CT.
I'm sorry about that, man.
I got a little worked up.
That's what steroid rage will do to you.
Cleo, could you, uh, find James a bed, please?
Sure. Come on.
Mark, you should get a head CT.
He didn't mean it.
He's just scared.
Scared he's going to get busted.
No, scared he's going to get the crap beat out of him.
The kid's petrified of his old man.
I got a feeling he's an abuse case.
Abuse? The kid's a tank.
No. The steroids, the aggression
the whole tough-guy routine.
It's a... it's a defense mechanism.
Trust me.
I don't think you should tell his parents.
Too late. They're on their way.
What? I said we'd work something out.
I gave him my word.
Well, you shouldn't have.
He's not your patient.
( coughs ): Tumor.
What was that?
The old Dr. Greene would've helped this kid.
I am.
Maybe there's something
to this competency stuff, huh?
Keep it up, Malucci.
You'll be looking for a new job.
DIERDRE: Her name's May
and she's really got a pretty bad cold
so if you could just please return her.
She's just a baby.
It doesn't matter why you took her.
It's just that she really needs medication.
You could just bring her back.
Have somebody bring her in.
Drop her off at the Police Department.
Call an ambulance.
She's just sick.
You should have your coat on.
And she needs medicine.
She's a baby. I'm okay.
Why don't you come back inside?
Come on, you can help me
cast the twins who rolled their wagon
down the basement steps.
You should get someone else.
I want you.
Um, uh...
could you just leave me alone, please?
I can't do that.
I lost that woman's baby.
No, you didn't.
Yes, I did.
No, you didn't.
Real nice, James.
You can't take notes in class.
Dad, it's not that bad.
How we doing in here?
You a nurse?
Doctor.
You Greene?
Malucci.
They told me I'm supposed
to wait here for Dr. Greene.
I was assisting Dr. Greene.
Yeah, fine, whatever.
So, he's going to be okay or what?
He dislocated his hand, but it'll heal.
What about his head?
He didn't injure his head.
Oh, no? Jumping around in a costume like an idiot
seems like a sign of brain damage, if you ask me.
Uh, can I speak with you outside, please?
Yeah.
Get your stuff together.
We're leaving right after this.
What are you doing?
What?
Your son, you know, hurt himself.
He needs a little compassion
and you come in here and you humiliate him.
You don't know him.
He needs discipline. He's always doing stupid stuff.
You ever wonder why? Maybe there's a reason he behaves this way.
Yeah, it's called being crazy
and the cure for it's a good kick in the ass.
Around here we call that abuse, man.
Get out of here.
Hold on, where you going?
Go work on your golf game, Doc.
Golf?
What the hell is going on? Son of a bitch!
I'm going to sue your ass.
Kiss it while you're at it.
Malucci, get out of here.
What, the guy's abusing his son!
Malucci, out, now!
Let's go!
Let me take a look at that.
Get away from me!
Ahh!
Are you sure you've done this before?
Yes.
Ow!
I'm sorry, I'm having
a little trouble finding the vein.
Can I get another nurse over here, please?
Shh! Let me just take a little break.
Yeah.
Is there anything I can get you?
Just my baby.
Maybe you should go home.
I'm sure someone will call you if we hear anything.
I don't think I can leave without her.
Okay.
Oh, not you again.
MALIK: This is County.
( over radio ): County, this is Rescue 62
en route to your facility with what appears to be
a three to four-month infant girl
found abandoned on the El platform.
MALIK: What's her status?
Pulse 120, resps 60.
She's got a weak cry and is cold to the touch.
Is there any sign of trauma?
No.
Is she alert?
Hard to say. She's a baby.
Is she making eye contact?
No, not really.
What's your ETA?
Less than five.
Did you talk to Rena?
What?
Your... that Child Life...
No, not yet, but I'm...
Where are they?
It's been like, almost ten minutes.
I think I hear an ambulance.
Oh, God, I hope it's her.
I'm sure it is.
It's got to be, right? Yeah.
I mean, how many kids can they find in one day?
Open up!
Okay, okay.
Pulse ox is down to 89.
Abby, is that her?
It's her.
I need a core temperature.
Put the monitors on her
and get me a 24-gauge angiocath.
Where did they find her?
El station. She's freezing.
Everything's going to be fine. Malik?
Whoever stole her probably panicked and dumped her.
Let the doctors work.
No, I want to stay with the baby. May!
Abby, I got it from here.
I got to start an IV.
I think you should step out.
Let me do this, Luka, please.
HALEH: Hypothermic, core temp 93.
Put her on heated humidified O2
get a warm blanket
some warming lamps and set up heated
D5h at 30cc's per hour.
Anything else?
No, that's good.
Okay.
You're okay, May.
Shh, you're safe now.
You're going to be okay.
Shh.
( talking baby talk )
You're going to be okay.
This is pathetic.
Not a single trauma in the bunch.
Oh! Hello.
That's mine. What're you doing?
Go home, Dave.
I'm on till 8:00.
No, you're not.
As a matter of fact
you're not on for the rest of the week.
What, says who? Says me.
Does Weaver know about this?
She will.
Is this because I defended myself?
CORDAY: Mark!
Good-bye, Dave.
I just heard that you were attacked.
Why didn't you call me?
No big deal, I just ran into an elbow.
Did you get a CT?
No, I'm fine, really.
I'm just glad I didn't opt for the surgical Velcro
when they put my skull back together.
How are you doing?
Well, Romano's trying to replace me
he wouldn't let me into surgery
so I spent the day doing wedding stuff.
I'm not wearing a kilt.
You'd look handsome in a kilt.
Dr. Romano's looking for you again.
Oh, wonderful.
Hey, uh, Mark, this came for you today.
I'm going to be in Romano's office.
These are my competency results.
You waited till the end of the shift?
I'm sorry, I forgot.
I've been busy.
You forgot? How could you forget?
You want to open them?
No.
Oh, Mark.
I passed!
Don't look so surprised.
Stop it!
You had your doubts, didn't you?
You had your moments.
Dr. Greene, Dr. Corday, Good night.
Good night, Carter.
Hey, where you going, Georgia?
Home.
I guess you're not
dying today after all, huh?
John?
Hey.
What're you doing down here?
Looking for you.
I'm off. You almost finished?
Actually, I got about
two hours of chores to finish up here.
Can you do it over garlic noodles?
I don't think so.
Come on, I'll get some take-out
a bottle of wine.
You can do your charts.
I don't drink
and it's illegal for you to purchase alcohol.
The age thing again.
I like you a lot, Rena, I just...
You wish I was older.
I guess I should enjoy this while it lasts.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...
No, please.
Forget it.
I'm young. We heal fast.
I'll see you around.
Are Dr. Romano and Dr. Anspaugh still here?
They're waiting for you in the conference room.
Dr. Weaver
better late than never.
Let's cut to the chase, shall we
so that we can all get out
of here and go home.
Okay, Dr. Legaspi recently-- for whatever reasons--
had what I hope
was a momentary lapse in judgment.
I take offense to that.
Really? Well, I take offense
to you having come out to your patient
which was grossly inappropriate.
Dr. Legaspi is a valuable asset
to the psychiatry department as well
as this hospital as a whole.
I think that her instincts were correct
and her intentions very honorable
considering the situation.
Honorable, perhaps; stupid, definitely.
Oh, come on, Robert.
Patients with psychological problems
falsely accuse their doctors of all sorts of things.
I had a guy today blame me for hypnotizing him
in order to drink his blood.
Well, we'll have to look into that another day, Donald
but the fact is, to the best of my knowledge
you are not actually a vampire.
Dr. Legaspi, however, is a lesbian, am I right?
I've never hidden that fact
from this administration or my colleagues.
Or from your patients, for that matter, wherein lies the problem.
There's a difference between being gay
and being a child molester.
Okay, my recommendation is administrative leave
pending a criminal hearing.
That's premature.
No, it's preemptive.
If we get lucky, there won't be any charges
and you can come
right back to work having learned a lesson
albeit the hard way.
Do you have anything to add, Dr. Weaver
considering you are one of them?
Them?
A female physician, dealing
with female patients. No.
Yes, I think that Dr. Legaspi...
is a wonderful doctor
and I don't think that she did any of the things
that she is accused of doing.
Well, that's well-spoken, Kerry.
That's very convincing.
Please remind me never to ask you to testify on my behalf.
Okay, meeting is adjourned.
I have dinner plans.
Pay no attention to him.
This, too, will pass.
I'm sorry.
I'm sor... Kim...
Kim, please don't, Kim...
Please, please, please stop.
I'm so... I'm so sorry.
Let's just get out of here and talk about this.
There's really nothing to talk about.
What did you expect me to say?
I am so sorry, Kim.
Me, too.
Go back to your life, Kerry.
No, don't.
You can't do this.
We have something good...
What? What do we have?
A relationship that you're ashamed to acknowledge in public?
I know. You're right. I wish I could be like you.
I wish I could be
as confident and secure with this as you are
but I am not you.
I have been on the outside my whole life
fighting for acceptance and respect
and now you're asking me to do it all over again?
I'm not asking you for anything.
I-I need more time.
I can't... I can't do this right now.
Please, Kim.
Kim.
I missed you.
Hi.
She's smiling.
All her tests came back normal.
She wasn't hurt.
She's going to be fine.
( gurgling )
But I would like
to keep her overnight for observation.
Is that necessary?
You just said she's going to be okay.
Just a precaution.
I pulled some strings and got her a private room
and I'm having them set up a bed for you.
Oh, okay, thanks.
Is there anything else you need?
She's all I need.
( clears throat )
