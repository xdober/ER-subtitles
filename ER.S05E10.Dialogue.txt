PREVIOUSLY ON E.R.
WE'D BE BETTER OFF AS FRIENDS.
MARK, THANKS AGAIN FOR DINNER LAST NIGHT.
GOD FORBID YOU SHOULD LISTEN TO ME AND LEARN SOMETHING.
YES, I WAS ENGAGED ONCE.
OH.
TO A REALLY LOVELY MAN, AND HE WAS KILLED
IN A FREAK HORSEBACK RIDING ACCIDENT.
( sighing )
THERE...
SHH, SHH, SHH.
YOU BRING A CHILD INTO THIS WORLD
AND YOU THINK THAT THEY'RE HELPLESS
BUT, ACTUALLY, I THINK IT'S US.
I THINK WE'RE THE ONES THAT ARE HELPLESS.
Ross: HEY, CAROL, WHAT TIME'S THAT BIG DO AT YOUR MOM'S?
Hathaway: RIGHT AFTER CHURCH.
I PROMISED HER WE'D BE THERE
FOR CHRISTMAS CAROLING WITH UNCLE TED.
THAT THE OLD GUY WITH THE BANJO?
IT'S A FAMILY TRADITION.
YOU KNOW, KIND OF LIKE
GOING TO MASS ON CHRISTMAS EVE.
I TOLD YOU, IF I GO, I FEEL LIKE A HYPOCRITE.
ALL THAT KNEELING AND STANDING AND...
YOU COULD JUST SIT THERE.
EVERYBODY LOOKS AT ME WITH THE DIRTY LOOKS
LIKE I'M A PAGAN.
YOU ARE A PAGAN.
OH, WHAT A GLORIOUS DAY.
DID YOU SEE THE SKY?
OH, YEAH, IT'S LIKE A PAINTING.
MAKES YOU GLAD TO BE ALIVE.
UNLESS YOU'RE BEING PERSECUTED.
PERSECUTED?
HE'S UPSET ABOUT
DR. LEE'S NEW CHARTING SYSTEM.
WHAT NEW CHARTING SYSTEM?
EACH PATIENT GETS TWO CHARTS.
ONE FOR THE DOC, ONE FOR THE NURSE.
THAT WAY WE GET TO DO OUR NOTES THE SAME TIME YOU GUYS DO.
ORDERS GET IN QUICKER, PATIENTS GET MEDS FASTER.
DOCS DON'T WASTE TIME CHASING DOWN CHARTS.
SO, WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?
THE PROBLEM IS THAT SOMEONE
HAS TO KEEP TRACK OF TWICE AS MANY CHARTS AS NORMAL
THEREBY DOUBLING HIS WORKLOAD, NOT THAT ANYONE CARES.
GOOD MORNING, GANG.
OH, MY GOD, AMANDA, WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?
ASSORTED CHRISTMAS NIBBLIES--
DRIED FRUIT, MIXED NUTS, SOME LITTLE CHOCOLATE REINDEER.
OH, DON'T MIND IF I DO.
OH, OH. JUST WAIT. FIRST DIBS GO TO JERRY.
IT'S ONLY FAIR, SINCE HE'S THE ONE
BEARING THE BRUNT OF THE NEW CHARTING SYSTEM.
NO, THANK YOU. I'M NOT HUNGRY.
OH? WELL, AS YOU WISH.
BUT SERIOUSLY, JERRY
IF YOU FIND YOURSELF IN THE WEEDS, CALL ME.
I'LL MAKE SURE YOU GET THE SUPPORT YOU NEED, ALL RIGHT?
SURE.
EXCUSE ME.
THAT'S A CHRISTMAS CARD IMAGE--
"SURGEON WRAPPING A BOOK."
WHAT IS IT, SOMETHING EDUCATIONAL
FOR ONE OF YOUR NIECES?
NO, ACTUALLY, IT'S FOR YOU.
T.S. ELIOT.
YOU SAID YOU LIKED HIM, SO I, UH, GOT IT LAST MONTH
WHEN WE WERE STILL, YOU KNOW.
PETER, THAT'S SO SWEET.
AH...
I CAN'T THINK OF A MORE THOUGHTFUL GIFT.
THANK YOU.
PLEASE. FORGET IT.
LISTEN, UM, I WAS WONDERING
IF WE COULD FINISH OUR ROUNDUPS AROUND NOON.
I WANT TO GET OUT OF HERE EARLY TONIGHT.
YOU'VE GOT BIG CHRISTMAS EVE PLANS.
YEAH. MY SISTER'S HOSTING A DINNER.
CARLA'S GOING TO BRING REESE BY.
I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM ALL WEEK.
DON'T WORRY. I UNDERSTAND.
I ABSOLUTELY HATE BEING
AWAY FROM MY FAMILY DURING THE HOLIDAYS.
IN FACT, I'M SO DESPERATE
NOT TO BE ALONE THIS CHRISTMAS EVE
THAT I BOUGHT A TICKET TO THE SURGEON SOCIETY GALA.
OH, GOLLY.
YEP. AND YOU WON'T BELIEVE WHO'S SITTING NEXT TO ME.
HEY, THERE SHE IS!
SO I CHECKED AROUND.
WE DEFINITELY HAVE THE COOLEST TABLE
AND, UH, IT'S REALLY KIND OF LUCKY
THAT WE WERE BOTH ABLE TO MAKE IT TONIGHT.
A LITTLE TROUBLE IN PARADISE, HUH?
ANYWAY, SO TONIGHT'S DINNER IS SEMIFORMAL
SO ANY SLINKY BLACK NUMBER WILL DO
ALTHOUGH, IF I MAY VOICE A PERSONAL PREFERENCE
SOMETHING SHORT AND OFF THE SHOULDER
WOULD BE IDEAL.
PETER, BY THE WAY, THAT REMINDS ME.
I HAVE ABOUT A WEEK'S WORTH OF CHARTS TO REVIEW
AND I'M REALLY TRYING TO GET OUT OF HERE EARLY
SO I NEED YOU TO COVER MY TEACHING ROUNDS.
THAT'S GOING TO MESS UP MY MORNING.
WELL, LOOK AT IT THIS WAY-- I GET TO HAVE A LIFE
MY PIECE-OF-CRAP CAR DIED ON THE VAN RYAN.
ON CHRISTMAS EVE? GOOD LUCK.
LYDIA, IS THAT...?
CHRISTMAS CARD FROM JEN.
MY EX-WIFE SENT YOU A CHRISTMAS CARD?
NO, SHE SENT ONE TO ME.
YOU?
YEAH. JEN AND I HAVE EXCHANGED CARDS FOR YEARS--
CHRISTMAS, BIRTHDAYS.
I WAS JUST READING THE NEWSLETTER.
MERRY CHRISTMAS FROM THE SIMONS.
WHAT?
THAT NEW HOUSE THEY BOUGHT SOUNDS AMAZING.
I KNOW. 5,000 SQUARE FEET?
SIX BEDROOMS, THREE BATHS.
SOUNDS JUST LIKE JEN TO BE BRAGGING ABOUT HER HOUSE.
I WOULDN'T CALL IT BRAGGING EXACTLY.
MORE LIKE SHARING GOOD NEWS.
YEAH, JEN MADE PARTNER.
PARTNER? JEN MADE PARTNER?
THE FIRM EVEN BOUGHT HER A NEW BEEMER.
I LOVE THOSE CONVERTIBLES.
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT?
MACK'S GARAGE ON WACKER IS OPEN.
THEY'LL TOW YOUR PIECE-OF-CRAP CAR.
THANKS, JERRY.
"DEAR DR. CARTER, I'M SURE YOU DON'T REMEMBER ME
"BUT I WOULDN'T BE AROUND THIS CHRISTMAS IF IT WEREN'T FOR YOU.
YOU'RE A LIFESAVER-- THE LORD'S INSTRUMENT ON EARTH."
PACER PADS?
THIRD DRAWER ON THE LEFT.
"MAY GOD BLESS YOU AND KEEP YOU.
MERRY CHRISTMAS, EMILY ROPELLA."
DO YOU REMEMBER HER?
NOT A CLUE. THAT IS A NICE CARD THOUGH.
DOES IT BOTHER YOU THAT THE LORD GETS ALL THE CREDIT?
ONE CAN BE CALLED WORSE THINGS THAN "AN INSTRUMENT OF GOD."
SO YOU BELIEVE IN...?
I GIVE HIM THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT.
YOU?
I DON'T KNOW.
SOMETIMES I CAN'T HELP BUT THINK
THAT GOD IS JUST THIS COMFORTING ILLUSION.
WE ALL WANT EVERYTHING TO MEAN SOMETHING
SO WE CREATE THIS ALL-KNOWING PUPPET MASTER IN THE SKY
WHEN REALLY EVERYTHING IS JUST ARBITRARY--
LIFE, DEATH, NATURAL DISASTERS... OH!
OW.
THE MASTER IS DISPLEASED.
I'M SO SORRY, PETER.
I CAN'T BELIEVE HE FOISTED THIS ON YOU.
AW, THERE'S NO USE IN WORRYING ABOUT IT NOW.
WELL, LOOK, I'LL START ON THE PRE-OP.
THAT SHOULD SAVE YOU SOME TIME.
WHATEVER.
HELLO, MR. GARDNER.
I HAVE THE RESULTS OF YOUR M.R.I.
GREAT. SO, HOW'S IT LOOK?
GOOD NEWS.
IT APPEARS THE CANCER
HASN'T SPREAD BEYOND THE CAPSULE.
GREAT. SO, UH, DOES THIS MEAN
I CAN HOLD ONTO MY PROSTATE?
WELL, I'M AFRAID NOT.
DR. ROMANO DOES WANT TO CONTINUE
WITH THE RADICAL PROSTATECTOMY
TOMORROW MORNING AS SCHEDULED
BUT WITH THE SURGERY
YOU STAND AN EXCELLENT CHANCE
OF BEATING THE CANCER.
IT REALLY IS VERY GOOD NEWS.
IS, UH... IS DR. ROMANO AROUND?
HE'S IN SURGERY.
IS IT SOMETHING I CAN HELP YOU WITH?
WELL, HE'D MENTIONED THAT THE OPERATION
COULD RESULT IN MY LOSING SEXUAL FUNCTION.
I TAKE IT THAT'S STILL THE CASE.
WE'LL TRY OUR BEST TO DO A NERVE-SPARING PROCEDURE
BUT THERE IS THAT POSSIBILITY, YES.
HOW STRONG A POSSIBILITY?
WELL, ACCORDING TO DR. ROMANO'S NOTES
AS HIGH AS 75% TO 80%.
80%.
HAS DR. ROMANO DISCUSSED YOUR OPTIONS
ABOUT HAVING CHILDREN IN THE FUTURE?
UH, NO.
WELL, YOU MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER
PAYING A VISIT TO A SPERM BANK.
THAT WAY, IF THERE IS A LOSS OF FUNCTION
YOU'LL STILL BE ABLE TO FATHER CHILDREN
THROUGH ALTERNATIVE MEANS.
RIGHT.
DR. LEE.
YOU STARTLED ME.
UH, SORRY. DR. ANSPAUGH WOULD LIKE YOU
TO CALL HIM.
IS THERE SOMETHING WRONG WITH DR. GREENE'S LOCKER?
WELL, I FOUND IT AJAR, SO I THOUGHT
I'D BETTER SHUT IT BEFORE SOMETHING WALKED AWAY.
THANKS FOR THE MESSAGE.
SURE.
I'VE GOT SUPERVENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA.
IT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME.
RATE'S 160. B.P.'s 100 PALP.
JUST CARDIOVERT ME AT 50 AND I'M ON MY WAY.
LET'S PUT HIM ON A MONITOR
AND GET A STRIP.
I'M TRYING TO TELL YOU
I GOT S.V.T.s.
JUST CARDIOVERT ME AT 50.
IT WORKS EVERY TIME.
OKAY, I APPRECIATE THE TIP
BUT I NEED TO EXAMINE YOU MYSELF.
I'M JUST TRYING TO SAVE SOME TIME HERE.
UH-HUH. STOP TALKING.
WOULD YOU TELL HIM THAT I HAVE S.V.T.s?
I'VE GOT S.V.T.s!
LET GO.
I GOT S.V.T.s.
I HEARD YOU!
I NEED TO EXAMINE YOU MYSELF.
I'M GOING TO BE LATE FOR WORK.
LET GO.
ARE YOU ONE OF SANTA'S HELPERS?
THE HELPERS JUST PASS OUT THE GOODY BAGS.
I'M AN ELF, A SINGING ELF.
PART OF A CHOIR?
THERE'S FOUR OF US.
BUT THANKS TO "SUPERDOC," HERE
IT LOOKS LIKE THE ELF TONES
ARE GOING TO BE A TENOR SHORT.
HERE YOU GO.
SAYS I'VE GOT S.V.T.'s, RIGHT?
I KNEW IT!
YOU WANT TO SHOCK ME AT 50 NOW, SMART ASS?
GOT AN 18-YEAR-OLD KID FLATLINE.
HOW LONG DOWN?
UNKNOWN. MOTHER FOUND HIM IN HIS ROOM.
WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON HIM FOR 15.
GAVE HIM TWO ROUNDS EPI, TWO OF ATROPINE.
ANY SIGNS OF LIFE?
GOT HIM BACK ONCE, THEN WE LOST HIM AGAIN.
LET'S GET HIM ON A MONITOR.
CARTER, CHECK HIS VENTILATION.
WHAT CAN I DO?
RECTAL TEMP.
GREAT.
ALL RIGHT, ON MY COUNT.
WATCH YOUR HAND, THERE.
ONE, TWO, THREE, GO.
ALL RIGHT, ANY SIGNS OF DRUGS, SUICIDE?
NO. HE TOLD HIS MOM HE HAD A KILLER HEADACHE
WENT FOR A NAP, NEVER WOKE UP.
SOUNDS LIKE A SUBARACHNOID HEMORRHAGE.
KILLER HEADACHE IS RIGHT.
MONITOR'S UP.
NO FEMORAL PULSE.
ASYSTOLE.
NO SPONTANEOUS RESPIRATIONS.
NO RESPONSE TO PAIN.
ANYBODY GOT ANY GOOD NEWS?
PUPILS ARE... FIXED AND DILATED.
NO CORNEAL REFLEX.
HE'S ONLY 18.
WELL, ZADRO GOT HIM BACK ONCE.
MAYBE WE CAN DO IT AGAIN.
START WITH A HIGH DOSE EPI
PUT HIM ON A PULSE OX, AN END TITLE CO2 DETECTOR.
PADDLES, PLEASE.
ALL RIGHT, CRANK IT TO 50. LET'S GO.
LET'S START AT 20.
20? WHY?
BECAUSE I SAID SO, THAT'S WHY.
OH, THAT'S MATURE.
CHARGED TO 20. CLEAR.
AAH!
HOW'D WE DO?
NO CHANGE.
50, DO I HEAR 50?
OKAY, LET'S GO TO 30.
OH, FOR CRYING OUT LOUD...
MARK, WHY NOT JUST GO TO 50?
BECAUSE HE HAS A SENSITIVE RHYTHM--
I DON'T WANT TO OVERSHOCK HIM.
ALL RIGHT, CHARGED TO 30. CLEAR.
AAH!
ANYTHING?
NOTHING.
UH... YOU KNOW, I DON'T WANT TO QUESTION
YOUR MEDICAL GENIUS, DOC, BUT CAN WE GO TO 50
WHILE I'VE STILL GOT SOME HAIR ON MY CHEST?
LET'S GO TO 50.
IT'S ABOUT TIME.
CHARGED.
CLEAR. AAH!
THAT DID IT.
BACK TO NORMAL SINUS.
WATCH HIM FOR 15 AND THEN LET HIM GO.
THANKS... FOR NOTHING, DR. MENGELE!
TIME?
12 MINUTES.
ALL RIGHT, LET'S CHECK HIS RHYTHM.
STILL NO PULSE. ASYSTOLE.
KEEP AT IT.
TEN OF EPI ON BOARD.
DR. ROSS, THE BOY'S MOTHER IS OUT IN CHAIRS.
SHE'D LIKE TO TALK TO SOMEONE.
ALL RIGHT. CARTER, YOU WANT TO DO THAT?
DON'T GET HER HOPES UP.
ALL RIGHT, GIVE ME ANOTHER EPI-- SEVEN MILLIGRAMS.
MRS. RICHARDS...
MY SON?
HI, I'M DOCTOR CARTER.
YOUR SON'S HEART STOPPED BEATING
AND WE ARE DOING EVERYTHING THAT WE CAN
TO GET IT STARTED AGAIN.
WE ARE GIVING HIM MEDICINE, AND WE ARE DOING C.P.R..
WHY WOULD HIS HEART STOP?
HE'S 18 YEARS OLD.
THERE'S A SIGN THAT HE HAD A BRAIN HEMORRHAGE
WHICH COULD HAVE CAUSED THE CARDIAC ARREST.
HOW?
HE'S THE PICTURE OF HEALTH.
IT COULD BE A WEAK ARTERY
POSSIBLY SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN THERE SINCE BIRTH.
THE THING IS, HE'S BEEN DOWN A LONG TIME...
AND THE LONGER THAT HE GOES WITHOUT OXYGEN
THE LESS LIKELY IT IS
THAT WE CAN BRING HIM BACK.
YOU AND I MIGHT NEED TO HAVE CONVERSATION...
PLEASE... DON'T GIVE UP ON HIM.
HE'S ALL THAT I HAVE.
PLEASE.
OKAY.
I'LL BE BACK.
OKAY.
ALL RIGHT, HOLD IT, HOLD THE COMPRESSION.
ANY SIGN OF A RHYTHM?
FLATLINE.
ALL RIGHT. LET'S CALL IT.
NOT YET. KEEP BAGGING.
YOU GOT SOME REASON TO KEEP FLOGGING THIS KID?
YEAH, HE'S 18
HE'S HIS MOTHER'S ONLY CHILD
AND IT'S CHRISTMAS.
LOOKING FOR A MIRACLE?
HE'S BEEN DOWN FOR 40 MINUTES.
SO WHAT'S FIVE MORE?
OKAY, DOCTOR, LET'S GO.
I'M RESUMING CHEST COMPRESSIONS. LET'S KEEP BAGGING.
LET'S GIVE ANOTHER ROUND OF HIGH-DOSE EPI.
START A DOPAMINE DRIP-- WIDE OPEN.
GET THOSE PADDLES READY.
PADDLES WON'T WORK; HE'S IN ASYSTOLE.
HE COULD BE IN FINE V-FIB.
CHARGE TO 300...
NO, 360. CHARGING.
ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY
LET'S HOLD A REALLY, REALLY POSITIVE THOUGHT.
READY.
CLEAR.
WAS THAT A BEAT? OH, MY GOD.
A FEW AGONAL BEATS DOES NOT A RHYTHM MAKE.
LET'S SLAP SOME PACER PADS ON HIM, RIGHT NOW.
ALL RIGHT, HERE YOU GO.
CAN YOU ROLL HIM?
SET IT AT 80.
YOU'RE ON.
IT'S NOT CAPTURING.
DIAL UP THE GAIN.
COME ON, WE JUST GOT TO GET IT TO CAPTURE.
HE'S THROWING P.V.C.s.
NO, HOLD THAT LIDOCAINE.
MAXIMUM GAIN.
COME ON... COME ON.
WE GOT IT.
HE'S GOT A RHYTHM!
CHECK HIS CAROTID.
PULSE?
STRONG AT 120. B.P. IS 100.
LET'S SEND HIM TO C.T.
FIND OUT WHERE THIS BLEEDING IS COMING FROM.
HOW DID YOU DO THIS?
I AM BUT AN INSTRUMENT.
NICE SAVE. HOPE HE'S GOT SOME BRAIN LEFT.
DO YOU WANT CONTRAST?
NO, BUT CALL RESPIRATORY.
MAKE SURE THEY GOT A VENT IN THE SCANNER.
WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE WE GOT OUR MIRACLE.
IF HE WAKES UP...
EVEN IF HE DOES, HE'LL PROBABLY HAVE BRAIN DAMAGE.
CARTER...
YES, MA. OF COURSE WE'RE COMING.
UNCLE TED WANTS DOUG TO PLAY "SILENT NIGHT"
ON THE TAMBOURINE?
HA-HA!
I THINK HE'D LOVE IT.
( giggling ): YEAH.
HEY, DO YOU HAVE ANY, UH...
VIDEOTAPE LEFT IN THE VIDEO CAMERA?
( chuckling )
YES, I AM COMING TO MASS. NOPE, HE'S NOT.
BUT, UM, YOU KNOW WHAT?
WE SHOULD PROBABLY RESPECT HIS CHOICE.
IT WOULD BE LOVELY IF WE COULD ALL GO TOGETHER, I KNOW.
JERRY, IF ANYBODY NEEDS ME, I'LL BE OUT AT THE ROACH COACH.
OKAY. I'LL BE HERE SUFFOCATING
UNDER A MOUNTAIN OF CHARTS.
THAT'S ODD. I COULD SWEAR I HAD MY GLOVES IN MY POCKET.
DR. LEE TOOK THEM.
WHAT'D YOU SAY?
I SAW HER AT YOUR LOCKER EARLIER.
THAT IS RIDICULOUS, JERRY.
WHAT'S RIDICULOUS?
JERRY'S ACCUSING AMANDA OF STEALING MY GLOVES.
I'M TELLING YOU, SHE HAD YOUR LOCKER OPEN
AND SHE WAS VERY SUSPICIOUS.
JERRY, I KNOW YOU'RE ANGRY AT AMANDA FOR THE NEW CHART SYSTEM
BUT TO ACCUSE HER OF BEING A THIEF...
NO, YOU DIDN'T SEE HOW WEIRD SHE WAS ACTING.
( groaning )
CAN IT, JERRY.
PETER, I FINISHED THE WORK ON LANDIS.
HOW ARE YOU DOING?
TWO MORE PRE-OPS, THEN ON TO POST-OPS.
SO, YOU MAY MAKE YOUR DINNER AFTER ALL.
LIZZIE, WHAT'LL IT BE--
GOOSE IN CHESTNUT SAUCE OR ROAST LOIN OF VENISON?
WE GOT TO CALL IN OUR ENTREES.
DR. ROMANO, MR. DeMISA'S COMING BACK IN
WITH POSTOPERATIVE PAIN.
DeMISA...
OH, WHAT A PAIN IN THE ASS.
OH, PETER, YOU ASSISTED
ON HIS GASTROPLASTY, DIDN'T YOU?
WHAT? UH, YEAH.
GREAT. WHEN HE COMES IN, YOU TAKE HIM.
UH, DR. ROMANO, I'M ALREADY PILED UP WITH WORK HERE.
I'M TRYING TO MAKE IT HOME TO MY FAMILY FOR DINNER.
WHAT CAN I SAY, PETER?
SOMETIMES BEING A RESIDENT JUST SUCKS.
SO, WHAT'LL IT BE-- MOTHER GOOSE OR BAMBI?
ARE THESE LEADS ON?
THE LEADS ARE ON.
NOTHING IN THE ALPHA
THETA OR DELTA FREQUENCIES.
HE'S BRAIN-DEAD.
WELL, MAYBE HE CAN BE AN ORGAN DONOR.
NOT TOO LIKELY.
HE HAS TYPE A-B BLOOD
AND THAT'S, WHAT, TWO PERCENT OF THE POPULATION?
I DOUBT YOU'RE GOING TO FIND MANY COMPATIBLE CANDIDATES.
IT'S WORTH A TRY.
SURE, IT IS. TALK TO THE MOTHER.
IF SHE WON'T GO FOR IT, SEE IF YOU CAN PERSUADE HER
INTO PULLING THE PLUG.
SO MUCH FOR MY MIRACLE.
DR. CORDAY, THE FERTILITY CLINIC JUST CALLED.
YOUR PATIENT DAVID GARDNER IS HAVING AN M.I.
HIS E.K.G. WAS NORMAL THIS MORNING.
UM, IS HE UPSTAIRS?
THEY'RE TAKING HIM TO THE E.R.
UH, OKAY.
HEY, I JUST TOOK AN UNUSUAL COMPLAINT.
AN ELF WITH AN ATTITUDE
CLAIMS YOU TRIED TO TORTURE HIM
WITH THE CARDIOVERSION PADDLES?
UH, WE DIFFERED OVER TREATMENT STRATEGIES.
I WOULDN'T QUITE CALL IT TORTURE.
I KNOW. I READ THE CHART.
HE'S CLEARLY A NUTCASE.
I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU WERE ALL RIGHT.
I'M OKAY, ALTHOUGH, TO BE PERFECTLY HONEST
I COULD HAVE HANDLED IT BETTER.
I'M A LITTLE OFF MY GAME TODAY.
BLAME IT ON THE HOLIDAYS.
IS IT A ROUGH TIME OF YEAR FOR YOU?
NOT USUALLY.
BUT MY EX-WIFE, SHE SENT OUT THIS NEWSLETTER
SAYING HOW HAPPY SHE IS.
I CAN'T HELP BUT SEEING IT AS HER WAY OF SAYING
"HEY, LOOK HOW WELL I TRADED UP."
( chuckling )
I GOT IT.
THANKS. YEAH, IT'S A TOUGH TIME OF YEAR FOR ME, TOO.
REALLY?
THIS IS THE FIRST CHRISTMAS
SINCE MY BROTHER COMMITTED SUICIDE.
AW, GEEZ... I-I-I'M SORRY.
YEAH. IT WAS ONE OF THOSE APOCALYPTIC CULT THINGS--
YOU KNOW, THE GUYS WITH THE SNEAKERS?
OH, YEAH...
I THOUGHT THAT WAS A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO.
WELL, HE MISSED THE BIG EVENT
SO HE DECIDED TO FOLLOW ON HIS OWN.
WOW. I'M SORRY, I...
I GOT TO SAY, YOU'RE HANDLING IT BETTER THAN I WOULD'VE.
WELL, I CREDIT THAT TO MY GRANDMA LEE.
SHE ALWAYS SAID, "WHATEVER LIFE THROWS AT YOU
"YOU HAVE TO GREET IT WITH A SMILE.
"THERE'S NOTHING AS CONTAGIOUS
AS A POSITIVE ATTITUDE."
YOU KNOW, I THINK WE'D ALL BE BETTER OFF
IF WE FOLLOWED GRANDMA'S ADVICE.
HERE WE GO. COMING THROUGH.
OKAY, LET'S TAKE HIM INTO TRAUMA ONE.
MR. GARDNER. MR. GARDNER, HOW ARE YOU?
MY CHEST... FEELS TIGHT. I CAN'T BREATHE.
IS THIS... IS THIS YOUR PATIENT?
YEP. AND HE'S HYPERVENTILATING LIKE CRAZY.
OKAY, HOOK HIM UP TO A 12-LEAD E.K.G. AND A PULSE OX.
START A LINE. LET'S GET A MASK ON HIM.
WE NEED TO GET YOUR BREATHING UNDER CONTROL
SO CONCENTRATE ON THE BREATHS.
( gasping )
LET THE BREATH OUT SLOWLY.
( exhaling )
SLOWLY...
MONITOR'S UP.
ALL RIGHT, YEP, PULSE IS UP TO 99.
THAT'S A GOOD SIGN.
YOU'RE GOING TO BE FINE.
BREATHE IN ON THE COUNT
OF FIVE.
ONE...
TWO...
OH, MY...
YOU-YOU'RE DAVID...
YOU'RE DAVID GARDNER, RIGHT?
THE TRUMPET SOLOIST?
I SAW YOUR GUEST PERFORMANCE WITH THE CHICAGO SYMPHONY.
OH, I'M SORRY.
I-I'M KERRY WEAVER, SEASON TICKETHOLDER.
( chuckling ): OH...
BREATHE OUT...
I JUST LOVED YOUR FEATURED PERFORMANCE
IN MAHLER TWO.
IT-IT-IT GAVE ME SHIVERS.
SLOWLY...
WH-WHERE DO YOU GO NEXT?
BOSTON.
AH... THE B.S.O.-- IN...
YES!
I GOT THE 12 LEADS. BREATHE OUT...
Weaver: DAVID, YOUR HEART LOOKS JUST... FINE.
OKAY, WE'LL RUN A FEW TESTS JUST TO MAKE SURE
BUT I THINK THAT YOU WERE JUST HAVING AN ANXIETY ATTACK.
ARE YOU A LITTLE NERVOUS ABOUT PLAYING FOR OZAWA?
( mumbling )
BREATHE IN...
SO, HOW LONG HAVE YOU HAD THE PAIN?
( groaning ): EVER SINCE THE SURGERY.
WISH I'D NEVER HAD IT.
THEY TOLD ME THAT STAPLING MY STOMACH WOULD HELP ME REDUCE?
BUT I HAVEN'T LOST A POUND YET.
SO, HAVE YOU BEEN STICKING TO THE ALL-LIQUID DIET?
YES.
WHAT'D YOU HAVE TODAY?
A LITTLE BLENDED TEA.
WHAT WAS IN IT?
BACON AND EGGS.
MR. DeMISA...
BUT I BLENDED IT UP!
WHAT ELSE DID YOU HAVE?
A SMOOTHIE.
AND WHAT WAS IN THAT?
LOW-FAT MILK...
( sighing ): SOME BUTTERNUT SQUASH
SWEET POTATO PANCAKES, A HONEY-GLAZED HAM
AND A CARAMEL-ORANGE BOUCHE DE NOEL.
THAT'S A FULL CHRISTMAS DINNER.
OH, ALSO, I'M A LITTLE BACKED UP.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, A LITTLE BACKED UP?
MMM, CONSTIPATED.
OKAY. HE PROBABLY BUSTED A STAPLE.
SET HIM UP FOR A GASTROGRAFIN X-RAY
AND GIVE HIM A LAXATIVE.
OOH! I LIKE THE CHOCOLATE ONES...
IF THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
DR. CARTER, I WAS TALKING TO STEVEN...
AND HE MOVED HIS ARM.
HE'S HAVING INVOLUNTARY MUSCLE SPASMS.
I THINK HE WAS TRYING TO TELL ME SOMETHING.
MRS. RICHARDS, I'M AFRAID THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE.
WE DID A TEST ON STEVEN
TO, UH, CHECK FOR BRAIN ACTIVITY.
WE DIDN'T FIND ANY.
WELL, THEN... IT'LL TAKE SOME TIME, AND...
TIME ISN'T GOING TO HELP.
STEVEN IS BRAIN-DEAD
WITH NO POSSIBILITY OF RECOVERY.
I KNOW THIS IS
A REALLY DIFFICULT THING TO THINK ABOUT RIGHT NOW
BUT ONE WAY TO SALVAGE SOMETHING POSITIVE OUT OF THIS
IS TO DONATE STEVEN'S ORGANS.
NO, I... I CAN'T LET YOU TAKE OUT HIS ORGANS
WHEN HIS HEART IS STILL BEATING.
MRS. RICHARDS, IF THAT'S THE CASE
I'D ASK YOU TO CONSIDER SIGNING A "DO NOT RESUSCITATE" ORDER.
THAT WAY, IF STEVEN'S HEART FAILS AGAIN
WE WON'T SUBJECT HIM TO OVERLY AGGRESSIVE PROCEDURES.
BY PROLONGING HIS LIFE IN A VEGETATIVE STATE...
I CAN HOPE FOR A MIRACLE, CAN'T I?
( cheerfully ): WELL, WHO DO WE HAVE HERE?
UH, MRS. HUTTON FAINTED
WHILE SHOPPING AT LAKEWOOD MALL.
OH, I'M SORRY TO HEAR THAT, BUT DON'T YOU WORRY.
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE YOU BACK ON YOUR FEET IN A JIFF.
ALL RIGHT...
( softly ): HAVE YOU BEEN HITTING THE NITROUS?
COME ON, LYDIA, YOU GOT TO GREET LIFE WITH A SMILE.
I DO?
YEAH. A POSITIVE ATTITUDE IS CONTAGIOUS.
SO, MRS. HUTTON, WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED?
I WENT TO FIELD'S NIGHT-BEFORE-CHRISTMAS SALE.
IT WAS CROWDED, IT WAS HOT, IT WAS STUFFY. I PASSED OUT!
VERY NICELY PUT.
THANKS.
( still cheerful )
WHY DON'T WE ORDER MRS. HUTTON
SOME CARDIAC ENZYMES, A C.B.C. AND A CHEM SEVEN?
HOLD IT! HOW MUCH DO THOSE THINGS COST?
GOSH, I.... DON'T KNOW.
YOU WON'T TELL ME?
NO, I MEAN I-I REALLY DON'T KNOW.
PLEASE SIT UP.
OH, I GOT YOUR NUMBER NOW.
EXCUSE ME?
YOU THINK YOU'RE PRETTY SMART, DON'T YOU, DOCTOR?
SWEET-TALKING ME INTO BUYING
ALL THOSE EXPENSIVE TESTS I DON'T NEED.
OKAY...
I'M JUST TRYING TO MAKE A DIAGNOSIS.
WELL, I'M TRYING TO SURVIVE ON SOCIAL SECURITY.
WE CAN'T ALL MAKE A DOCTOR'S SALARY.
I'M SURE YOUR INSURANCE COMPANY WILL PAY FOR THE TESTS.
OH... SO THAT'S YOUR RACKET--
RIPPING OFF INSURANCE COMPANIES.
IT'S CROOKS LIKE YOU THAT KEEP MY PREMIUMS SO HIGH!
GIVE ME ANOTHER DOCTOR!
DR. GREENE'S THE BEST WE HAVE.
Mrs. Hutton: WELL, I DON'T LIKE THE LOOK OF HIM.
THE WAY HE SMILES, THE WAY HE TALKS...
I WANT ANOTHER DOCTOR!
ANY DOCTOR--
AS LONG AS IT ISN'T HIM!
MR. GARDNER, YOUR LABS LOOK STUNNING.
WE SHOULD PROBABLY WAIT ON THE CARDIAC ENZYMES
BEFORE LETTING YOU GO.
WELL, AT THIS RATE
I MIGHT AS WELL CHECK IN FOR THE NIGHT, HUH?
WELL, IT WOULD CERTAINLY SAVE YOU THE DRIVE IN
FOR SURGERY TOMORROW.
NO. NO, THE LESS TIME I SPEND HERE, THE BETTER.
NO OFFENSE.
( chuckling ): NONE TAKEN.
( sighing )
SO, HOW YOU FEELING?
OH, LIKE AN IDIOT.
HERE I THOUGHT I WAS HAVING THIS BIG HEART ATTACK.
IT TURNS OUT I'M JUST A NERVOUS WRECK.
YOU KNOW, IF YOU WANTED TO, YOU COULD POSTPONE SURGERY.
NO. I HAVE TO BE RECOVERED BY JANUARY 15.
I'M DOING A TELEVISED SPECIAL
WITH THE BOSTON SYMPHONY.
WELL. I'LL HAVE TO MARK MY CALENDAR.
SYMPHONY FAN?
( scoffs )
I KNOW VERY LITTLE ABOUT ORCHESTRAL MUSIC.
SO, WHAT DO YOU LIKE?
WELL...
I'M...
I'M EMBARRASSED TO SAY.
( chuckling )
HOW BAD CAN IT BE?
( chuckling )
( whispering ): I'M IN A DISCO PHASE AT THE MOMENT.
( whispering ): YES, WELL, I CAN SEE WHY YOU WOULD BE EMBARRASSED.
( laughing )
YOU PAGED ME?
WE'VE GOT A PROBLEM. HE'S STUCK.
STUCK?
HE'S WEDGED IN SO TIGHT I CAN'T GET HIM OUT.
SO, WHAT DO YOU EXPECT ME TO DO?
COULD YOU HELP ME GET HIM OUT?
UH-UH. I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THAT.
HAVE MAINTENANCE TAKE THE CHAIR APART.
UH-OH. WHAT NOW?
I HAVE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM.
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO HOLD IT, SIR.
HELP! HELP ME GET HIM OUT, PLEASE?
PLEASE?!
OKAY, OKAY, COME ON, COME ON, GRAB HIS ARMS.
( groaning )
ALL RIGHT, ON MY COUNT.
ONE, TWO...
THREE.
( both grunting )
( groaning )
WHAT A WASTE.
( sighing ): WHY DID I DO IT? OH, WHY DID I DO IT?
I KNOW... I KNOW BETTER.
YOU WERE TRYING TO SAVE A KID'S LIFE.
I LET THAT "INSTRUMENT OF GOD" STUFF GO TO MY HEAD.
MAYBE IT IS ALL ARBITRARY.
I MEAN, WHAT DID THIS KID DO
TO DESERVE A BRAIN HEMORRHAGE
AND WHY DOES IT BLOW ON CHRISTMAS EVE?
WHAT'S THE POINT?
ON THE TEENAGER IN ONE--
A CHRISTMAS PRESENT FROM THE STORK.
ALL RIGHT. WELL, I'D BETTER GO
AND GIVE THE GOOD NEWS.
OH, MY GOD.
OH, DR. WEAVER...
DR. WEAVER, YOU HAVE TO READ THIS.
READ WHAT?
A XXX SEX FANTASY.
EXCUSE ME?
I FOUND IT IN ONE OF DR. LEE'S CHARTS.
IT'S HER HANDWRITING.
"I TOOK M.G.'s GLOVED HAND
AND PLACED IT ON MY HEAVING, PINK-STIPPLED BREAST."
WHY AM I READING THIS?
DON'T YOU GET IT?
"M.G." IS "MARK GREENE."
COME ON.
WHAT ABOUT THE GLOVE REFERENCE?
WHOSE GLOVES ARE MISSING, HUH?
JERRY, YOU HAVE COMPLETELY LOST YOUR MIND.
OH! YOU FOUND MY NOTES ON MRS. CONDRELL.
I'VE BEEN LOOKING UP AND DOWN.
MRS. CONDRELL?
THAT PSYCH PATIENT.
IT'S A SAD CASE.
SHE'S PSYCHOTIC, EXTREMELY HYPER-SEXUAL
AND SHE HAS THESE OBSESSIVE FANTASIES
ABOUT MERV GRIFFIN, OF ALL PEOPLE.
ANYWAY, THANK YOU.
JERRY, NEXT TIME YOU WANT
TO MAKE AN ASS OUT OF YOURSELF
LEAVE ME OUT OF IT, OKAY?
COULD THERE BE A MISTAKE?
NO, THERE'S NO MISTAKE, LAURA.
YOU'RE PREGNANT.
OH, GOD.
WHAT DO I DO?
WELL, IS THERE ANYONE YOU CAN TALK TO? YOUR MOTHER?
NO WAY. SHE'LL KILL ME.
WHAT ABOUT YOUR DAD?
NO.
THANKS.
I HAD TO SNEAK OUT EVEN TO COME HERE.
MM-HMM.
ARE YOU GOING TO TELL THEM?
NOT IF YOU DON'T WANT ME TO.
I DON'T.
WELL, YOU HAVE SOME CHOICES:
YOU CAN HAVE THE BABY, KEEP IT;
HAVE THE BABY, GIVE IT UP FOR ADOPTION;
OR YOU CAN HAVE AN ABORTION.
I CAN'T HAVE A BABY.
THERE'S NO WAY.
CAN YOU HELP ME?
YES, I CAN.
BE RIGHT BACK.
STEPHANIE, CAN I...?
THANK YOU.
HEY, CAROL...
WE GOT A PREGNANT 13-YEAR-OLD IN THERE
WANTS TO HAVE AN ABORTION ON THE HOLIDAYS.
GOD. 13.
THINK YOU CAN ARRANGE IT?
MERRY CHRISTMAS. YEAH.
YEAH. GOING TO TAKE IT FROM THERE?
SURE.
I KNOW HIS BEDTIME IS AT 8:00, BUT I'M GETTING SLAMMED HERE.
I MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO MAKE IT UNTIL THEN.
YEAH, I KNOW. LISTEN, LISTEN. LISTEN. OKAY, OKAY.
IT'S CHRISTMAS EVE.
I'M JUST TRYING TO SEE MY SON, ALL RIGHT?
OKAY. THANK YOU SO MUCH.
YEAH, I PROMISE. I WILL. YEAH. BYE.
HOW'S IT GOING
DON'T ASK.
DID YOU CALL THE E.R. FOR DeMISA?
SAID HE'S STILL ON THE TOILET.
LIZZIE, IF YOU'RE READY, WE CAN GO TOGETHER.
LOOK, I HAVE A COUPLE OF PATIENTS
TO FINISH WITH, OKAY?
IS PETER TRYING TO RUIN OUR EVENING?
NO, NOT AT ALL.
IT WAS A JOKE.
LOOK, I'LL SEE YOU THERE.
PETER, I WASN'T ABLE TO FINISH THESE DICTATIONS
SO I LEFT THEM FOR YOU.
THEY NEED TO BE IN BY 8:00.
APPRECIATE THE HELP.
SEE YOU LATER.
16-YEAR-OLD, UNCONSCIOUS
HISTORY OF BILIARY ATRESIA.
HEPATIC COMA?
YEAH. LOOKS LIKE IT.
SHE WAS DOING FINE UNTIL SIX MONTHS AGO.
WHAT MEDICATION IS SHE ON?
AMPICILLIN, TOBRAMYCIN, VITAMINS A, D AND K.
SKIN'S JAUNDICED.
SAME WITH SCLERA.
HER BREATH SMELLS SWEET.
FETOR HEPATICUS? YEP.
WHAT'S THAT?
LIVER HAS SHUT DOWN.
LET'S DIP A URINE.
IT'S GETTING CROWDED IN HERE.
CAN YOU DEAL WITH THE PARENTS?
START LACTULOSE, 30cc's PER M.G.
WE'LL GIVE HER SOME MEDICINE TO CLEAN HER BLOOD.
WHY DON'T YOU COME IN HERE?
SHE'S BLEEDING INSIDE?
HER LIVER FAILURE IS CAUSING HER BLOOD NOT TO CLOT.
OH, GOD.
IS SHE ON THE TRANSPLANT LIST?
SHE'S BEEN STATUS 2-A FOR SIX MONTHS
BUT WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO FIND HER A MATCH.
WHY NOT?
WHAT'S HER BLOOD TYPE?
A-B.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
ARE YOU HIDING BACK HERE?
EXACTLY.
I TRIED YOUR GRANDMOTHER'S
"GREET THEM WITH A SMILE APPROACH" ON A PATIENT
AND SHE THREW ME OUT.
NO.
YEP.
I'VE DECIDED TO RESTRICT MYSELF
TO THE UNCONSCIOUS FOR THE REST OF THE DAY.
NOW, NOW.
I'LL TELL YOU, THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT ME
THAT JUST BRINGS OUT THE WORST IN PEOPLE.
I'VE NOTICED THAT.
I'M LIKE A MAGNET FOR NEGATIVITY.
PEOPLE GET TOO CLOSE
I'LL PULL THE POSITIVE RIGHT OUT OF THEM.
OH, MY GOD. WHAT?
I SUDDENLY FEEL DEPRESSED.
LOW BLOOD SUGAR?
NO. IT'S DEFINITELY YOU.
HEY, SHUT THE HELL UP.
I'M TRYING TO SLEEP HERE.
OH, ANOTHER SATISFIED CUSTOMER.
TWO KIDS COME IN ON CHRISTMAS EVE--
ONE ENDS UP BRAIN-DEAD
THE OTHER NEEDS A LIVER
AND THEY BOTH HAVE A-B BLOOD.
TELL ME THAT'S NOT A GODSEND.
IT'S NOT. THE MOTHER WON'T CONSENT...
SHE WILL WHEN I GET THROUGH WITH HER.
WHERE'S HIS MOTHER?
SHE'S NOT HERE.
IS HE THROWING P.V.C.s?
WHY DIDN'T YOU CALL ME?
LET'S GET THE PACER PADS ON HIM.
CAN'T-- D.N.R.
HIS MOTHER SAID YOU TALKED HER INTO IT.
THERE GOES YOUR GODSEND.
DID SHE SAY WHERE SHE WAS GOING?
NOT TO ME.
IF SHE COMES BACK, KEEP HER HERE.
LAURA, DR. SARAFINI CAN TAKE YOU.
WHAT'S WRONG?
I JUST KEEP THINKING
IT'S A MORTAL SIN.
DO YOU BELIEVE THAT?
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT I BELIEVE.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
I DON'T KNOW.
IS THERE SOMEONE IN YOUR FAMILY YOU CAN TALK TO?
A SISTER? NO.
WHAT ABOUT YOUR MOM?
SHE'LL KILL ME.
LOOK, LAURA, THIS ISN'T GOING TO BE EASY
BUT IT IS A VERY BIG DECISION.
AND I DON'T THINK YOU'RE SURE OF WHAT TO DO.
I THINK YOU REALLY NEED TO TALK TO SOMEONE.
CAN YOU CALL MY MOM?
YEAH, I CAN.
I'LL CALL HER. I'LL CALL HER.
SHE'S NOT BACK YET?
NOPE. HE JUST WENT INTO V-TACH.
DAMN IT!
I GOT A THIN PULSE.
GET ME ANOTHER 50
OF LIDOCAINE AND GET THE PADDLES READY.
I TAKE FULL RESPONSIBILITY.
YEAH, AND I'LL LOSE MY LICENSE.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
I'LL CODE HIM MYSELF IF I HAVE TO.
YOU CAN'T CODE HIM AGAINST HIS MOTHER'S WISHES.
SHE WANTED A MIRACLE?
THESE TWO KIDS ARRIVING
ON THE SAME DAY IS AS CLOSE AS IT GETS.
THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT TO BELIEVE; SHE MAY NOT SEE IT THAT WAY.
I'M WILLING TO BET SHE DOES.
YOU'RE THINKING OF YOURSELF.
AND A DYING 16-YEAR-OLD GIRL.
CHARGING AT 200.
MOVE THEM.
MOVE THEM!
CLEAR!
YOU'RE BOTH CRAZY.
BACK IN SINUS.
NOW YOU DID IT.
PAGE ME IF HE GOES SOUTH.
I'M GOING TO FIND HIS MOTHER.
SO, WHICH SECTION OF THE ORCHESTRA
ARE YOU GOING OUT WITH NOW?
NO, I'VE BEEN UNATTACHED
SINCE I STARTED THE TOUR-- SIX MONTHS NOW.
THAT'S A LONG TIME TO BE ON THE ROAD.
YEAH, IT SURE IS.
SWARMS OF GROUPIES IN EVERY CITY.
WELL, A CLASSICAL SOLOIST
DOESN'T QUITE LEAD THE LIFE OF A ROLLING STONE.
THOUGH IF I'D KNOWN
I WAS GOING TO LOSE MY PROSTATE
I WOULD'VE MADE MORE OF AN EFFORT, BELIEVE ME.
ARE YOU STILL ANXIOUS
ABOUT THE SURGERY TOMORROW?
I WAS NEVER ALL THAT ANXIOUS
ABOUT THE SURGERY, PER SE.
IT WAS MORE THE...
WHAT?
YOU REALLY WANT TO KNOW?
YES.
WELL, I...
I WENT UP TO YOUR CLINIC TO DEPOSIT MY...
DNA...
AND, OF COURSE, THEY DIRECTED ME TO THE CUBICLE
WHERE THEY'D SET OUT THE...
THE SPECIMEN JAR AND THE...
MEN'S MAGAZINE...
AND I... AND I JUST KEPT THINKING
WELL, THIS IS IT.
THIS IS MY...
MY LAST SEXUAL EXPERIENCE.
AND I... WELL, YOU KNOW THE REST.
MUST BE THE FIRST TIME IN HISTORY
THAT SOMEBODY'S HAD PERFORMANCE ANXIETY
WHILE BY HIMSELF.
DAVID, WOULD YOU LIKE
TO GO HAVE A BITE TO EAT SOMEWHERE?
YES, ELIZABETH, I'D LIKE THAT VERY MUCH.
ALL RIGHT, MR. DeMISA.
WE GOT YOUR X-RAYS BACK.
THEY'RE CLEAR, SO YOU ARE...
MR. DeMISA?
MR. DeMISA?
TAKATA, YOU SEEN OUR 400-POUND PATIENT?
UH-OH. WHAT?
I'M MISSING FIVE PATIENT DINNERS.
OH, DAMN IT.
MR. DeMISA?
MR. DeMISA?
MR. DeMISA?
MR. DeMISA?
OVER HERE.
WHAT IS IT?
CAKE CRUMBS.
LOOKS LIKE GERMAN CHOCOLATE.
MR. DeMISA?
AW, DAMN IT.
MR. DeMISA?
HE'S UNCONSCIOUS.
HE VOMITED.
THERE'S AT LEAST A HALF A GALLON HERE.
OKAY, NO BOWEL SOUNDS, ABDOMEN'S RIGID--
HE REALLY DID IT THIS TIME.
HE BLEW A STAPLE?
NEED A GURNEY!
PREP AN O.R.! GET AN X-RAY AND PAGE ROMANO.
TELL HIM TO GET HIS ASS BACK HERE.
MRS. RICHARDS...
I'M SORRY TO BOTHER YOU
BUT AN EXTRAORDINARY THING HAS HAPPENED.
A 16-YEAR-OLD GIRL
WITH THE EXACT SAME RARE BLOOD TYPE AS STEVEN'S
CAME INTO THE E.R. IN LIVER FAILURE.
NOW, I CAN'T HELP BUT TO THINK
THAT IF GOD MEANT FOR STEVEN TO DIE TONIGHT--
AT CHRISTMAS--
THEN IT MUST BE SO THAT THIS GIRL CAN LIVE.
I'M SORRY, BUT I CAN'T THINK
ABOUT ANOTHER CHILD'S PROBLEMS RIGHT NOW.
ALL I WANT IS FOR MY SON TO DIE PEACEFULLY
AND TO BE BURIED WHOLE.
EXCUSE ME.
YEAH. HE'S PERFED HIS STOMACH.
STILL NO ROMANO?
I PAGED HIM FIVE TIMES.
ALL RIGHT, WHO'S ON CALL?
GUTHRIE. JUST STARTED A TRIPLE "A."
B.P.'s DROPPED TO 80 PALP.
WE CAN'T WAIT MUCH LONGER.
HE'S GOT A FEVER.
ALL RIGHT, GIVE HIM A GRAM OF CEFOTAXIME
500 OF FLAGYL AND HAND ME A SCALPEL.
LET'S MOVE.
YOU'RE STARTING WITHOUT AN ATTENDING?
HE'S SEPTIC. I DON'T HAVE ANY CHOICE.
WE KEEP HIM ON THE TABLE, HE'S GOING TO DIE.
Ross: WHAT THE HELL...?
CAROL. HEY, YOU SEE THERE'S A PRIEST IN THERE WITH THAT GIRL?
UH-HUH.
WELL, HE'S GOING TO PRESSURE HER
INTO HAVING THE KID.
MAYBE HE'S GOING TO COUNSEL HER, TOO.
HOW'D HE FIND OUT ABOUT IT?
SHE ASKED ME TO CALL HER MOM.
THE MOM BROUGHT THE PRIEST.
WELL, I WISH YOU'D TOLD ME ABOUT IT.
WHY?
BECAUSE I WOULD'VE TRIED TO KEEP HIM OUT OF THERE.
ARE THOSE BAKED BEANS?
YEAH. AND FRENCH FRIES.
PHEW, THAT'S RANK.
WHAT'S THIS?
COLE SLAW.
AH, HERE'S A GOOD ONE.
WHAT IS THAT? MYSTERY MEAT?
WHAT THE HELL DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING
OPERATING ON MY PATIENT?!
SAVING HIS LIFE! YOU JERK.
GET ME A GOWN AND GLOVES, NOW!
AND, PETER, GET YOUR HANDS
OUT OF MY PATIENT.
OKAY, GIVE ME A LITTLE SUCTION HERE.
SUCKER'S CLOGGED.
YEAH, IT'S A CRANBERRY.
( chuckling )
LET'S GO, SHIRLEY! GLOVES!
WHERE THE HELL IS SHE?
WHO?
WHO DO YOU THINK?
WHAT'D YOU DO, GIVE HER EXTRA WORK TO HANG HER UP HERE?
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.
STEP AWAY.
FINE.
WHO GAVE YOU PERMISSION TO START WITHOUT ME?
HE WAS GOING INTO SEPTIC SHOCK.
YOU ARE A RESIDENT, PETER.
YOU DON'T TAKE A PISS
WITHOUT GETTING PERMISSION.
AND WHERE THE HELL'S LIZZIE?
OFF DOING YOUR SCUT?
SHE LEFT AN HOUR AGO.
WHAT THE HELL DID YOU USE
TO MAKE THIS INCISION, A CHAINSAW?
HE'S BEEN DRINKING.
WHAT?
HE'S DRUNK.
GO. CALL ANSPAUGH. NOW.
RETRACT THE BOWEL.
RETRACT THE BOWEL, PLEASE.
DR. ROMANO, HAVE YOU BEEN DRINKING?
ARE YOU QUESTIONING MY SURGICAL FITNESS?
HOW MANY DRINKS HAVE YOU HAD?
GO TO HELL.
DR. ROMANO, I'M GOING TO HAVE
TO ASK YOU TO STEP BACK, PLEASE.
SPONGE.
DR. ROMANO!
TOUCH ME AGAIN AND I'LL DECK YOU.
LOOK, YOU'RE DRUNK.
ALL RIGHT, SHIRLEY, GET ME
SOME CLEAN GLOVES AND A GOWN.
COMING RIGHT UP.
HEY, WHO ORDERED ALL THIS STUFF?
WHAT IS IT?
PIZZA, BEER, BRANDY.
A WHOLE BUNCH OF SPICES.
AH, THE PROVISIONS HAVE ARRIVED.
HOW MUCH DO I OWE THE MAN?
$212 PLUS A TIP.
WHAT'S GOING ON?
STAFF CHRISTMAS PARTY.
I DIDN'T KNOW THERE WAS ONE.
THERE IS NOW. MY TREAT.
ALL RIGHT.
YOU KNOW WHAT? IT'S REALLY CROWDED.
CAN WE TAKE THIS STUFF INTO THE LOUNGE?
GROUCH.
THANKS, GUYS.
REMEMBER TO PUNCH OUT BEFORE BOOZING. THANKS.
WHAT DO YOU NEED BRANDY AND SPICES FOR?
HOT TODDIES.
THE SULTAN OF JOHORE'S FAVORITE.
AH, WELL, IF IT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR THE SULTAN...
YEAH, MAKE MINE A DOUBLE.
JERRY, WHERE'S MY LAB COAT?
UH... IT WAS HERE A MINUTE AGO.
WHERE'D IT GO?
YOU KNOW WHAT? I DON'T EVEN WANT TO HAZARD A GUESS.
THAT'S A WISE CHOICE, JERRY.
I ADMIT IT-- THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS MIRACLES.
YOU DON'T REALLY BELIEVE THAT.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I BELIEVE.
I WAS SO SURE THAT I WAS RIGHT.
THAT I HAD THE BIG KAHUNA ON MY SIDE.
THAT'S PRETTY ARROGANT, HUH?
VERY.
WHAT'S GOING ON?
APPARENTLY, MRS. RICHARDS
BUMPED INTO THE MIKAMIS IN THE HALLWAY, AND THEY
GOT TO TALKING.
SHE CONSENTED TO THE LIVER TRANSPLANT.
OH, MY GOD.
OH, MY GOD.
WAIT. BEFORE YOU GO GIVING HIM TOO MUCH CREDIT
THERE'S SOMETHING YOU OUGHT TO KNOW.
WHAT?
I INTRODUCED THEM.
WHAT DO YOU KNOW?
YOU'RE AN INSTRUMENT OF GOD.
OH, PLEASE.
( sighs )
SORRY.
HOW SORRY?
WELL...
HUH...
NOT SORRY ENOUGH TO GO TO MASS TONIGHT
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU MEAN.
HMM. YOU KNOW WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND IS
HOW I COULD CARE SO MUCH FOR A HOT-TEMPERED
PIG-HEADED HEATHEN.
I PREFER "PAGAN."
HEATHEN.
I'M JUST FINISHING UP MY DISCIPLINARY REPORT
RECOMMENDING THAT YOUR RESIDENCY
BE TERMINATED FOR OPERATING
WITHOUT AN ATTENDING.
YOU TURN THAT IN
I'LL BE FORCED TO DEFEND MYSELF.
GOOD LUCK, PETER.
I MEAN, I'LL HAVE TO TURN IN THESE LABS
SHOWING THAT YOUR BLOOD ALCOHOL LEVEL WAS .12.
YOU SHOULDN'T EVEN HAVE BEEN DRIVING
LET ALONE OPERATING ON SOMEONE.
DON'T BLUFF ME, PETER.
YOU DIDN'T DRAW MY BLOOD.
NOT FROM THERE.
MARK, LOOK HERE.
GOTCHA.
AMANDA, THESE HOT TODDIES ARE DELICIOUS.
I WANT THE RECIPE.
NO PROBLEM.
HEY, JERRY, YOU WANT TO TRY
ONE OF DR. LEE'S HOT TODDIES?
NO, JUST GIVE ME A BEER.
DEPART, O CHRISTIAN SOUL, OUT OF THIS WORLD
IN THE NAME OF GOD, THE FATHER ALMIGHTY, WHO CREATED YOU
IN THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST, WHO REDEEMED YOU
IN THE NAME OF THE HOLY SPIRIT, WHO SANCTIFIES YOU.
MAY YOUR REST BE THIS DAY IN PEACE
IN YOUR DWELLING PLACE IN THE PARADISE OF GOD...
( yelps )
( laughs )
HEY, YOU.
HEY.
HEY.
HEY.
THANK YOU.
MRS. RICHARDS?
( humming "O Come, All Ye Faithful" )
MERRY CHRISTMAS, AMANDA.
