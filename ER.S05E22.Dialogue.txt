PREVIOUSLY ON E.R.:
BE GOOD, SON.
Doctor: WE TYPICALLY ONLY DO AMNIO
UNLESS YOU HAVE GENETIC DISORDERS IN YOUR FAMILY.
NO.
NO, REGGIE.
I'M SEEING SOMEONE ELSE.
Antoine: DR. CARTER?
CAN I HANG AROUND AND SEE HOW THIS GOES?
ABSOLUTELY.
THANK YOU BUT I'M TAKING THE TRAUMA FELLOWSHIP, OKAY?
FINE. WHATEVER, PETER.
I THOUGHT THAT BELONGED TO PETER.
RITALIN IS FOR HYPERACTIVE CHILDREN. YOU'RE 24.
AND MY DOCTOR STILL PRESCRIBES IT.
SO I'M NOT DOING ANYTHING WRONG.
( siren bleats )
DID I DO SOMETHING WRONG, OFFICER?
I WAS JUST TRYING TO GET YOUR ATTENTION
WHICH HAS NOT BEEN THAT EASY TO DO OF LATE.
I'VE BEEN BUSY WORKING.
AND SEEING SOMEONE ELSE.
I HAVE TO GET TO WORK.
I'LL GIVE YOU A LIFT. IT'S TWO BLOCKS AWAY.
YOU DON'T WANT TO BE RESISTING AN OFFICER, DO YOU?
OH, WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO, ARREST ME?
I'M A COP. IT'S WHAT I DO.
( laughing )
OKAY, YOU WIN.
OH... WHOA... OH...
UH-OH.
LET'S PICK UP THE DOGGIE.
CAN YOU SAY DOGGIE, REESE?
DOGGIE.
DOGGIE.
( barking )
I DON'T THINK HE'S GOT THAT ONE YET.
HE WILL SOON.
HE'S DOING GREAT.
HE'S RESPONDING TO VOCALIZATIONS
REPEATING BACK MORE.
I JUST WISH WE HAD MORE TIME.
IN ABOUT A MONTH, I'LL BE ABLE TO ADD
A COUPLE MORE SESSIONS A WEEK.
CUTTING BACK ON YOUR SCHEDULE?
THIS TRAUMA FELLOWSHIP THAT I'M GOING TO BE DOING
WILL GIVE ME MORE FREE TIME.
THAT'S GREAT.
ON TOP OF THE THREE SESSIONS WE'RE DOING NOW
REESE IS GOING TO MAKE REAL PROGRESS.
THREE? IS CARLA COMING TWICE A WEEK NOW?
NO, JUST ONCE.
BUT HER FIANCE'S
DOING A SESSION ONCE A WEEK NOW, TOO.
ROGER'S WORKING WITH REESE HERE?
I ASSUMED YOU KNEW.
NO, NO, NO, I MEAN...
IT'S NOT A PROBLEM, YOU KNOW.
THE MORE WE WORK WITH HIM
THE BETTER, RIGHT?
RIGHT.
EXCUSE ME. IS THAT YOUR SON?
WHAT?
NAH, HE'S NOT MINE.
WHERE'D HE COME FROM?
ARE YOU WITH THIS CHILD?
NO.
HEY...
HI, THERE.
WHERE'S YOUR MOMMY, HUH?
WHERE'S YOUR MOMMY?
YEAH?
WHERE'S YOUR MOMMY, HUH?
IS HE OKAY?
NO.
SOMETHING'S NOT RIGHT WITH HIM.
DO YOU FEEL OKAY?
WHAT'S YOUR NAME, HONEY?
HONEY, CAN YOU TELL ME YOUR NAME?
HUH?
OKAY.
ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT.
YEAH, WE'RE GOING TO TAKE GOOD CARE OF YOU.
DON'T WORRY. YOU'RE GOING TO BE OKAY.
BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO PUNCH IN THE CODE FIRST.
CODE? YES.
A ROCKET ROMANO INNOVATION.
WHAT FOR?
UH, MAKE THINGS MORE DIFFICULT
IS THE ONLY REASON I CAN IMAGINE.
JERRY, HAVE YOU SEEN DR. GREENE?
YEAH, HE'S ON ROUNDS WITH HIS HIGH HOLINESS.
HAVE YOU HEARD ABOUT THIS NEW CODE?
UNBELIEVABLE.
IF YOU SEE MARK, I NEED TO SPEAK WITH HIM.
SURE.
HEY, HEY, CARLA. THIS IS ME.
LISTEN, UH, WE NEED TO TALK.
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO. REESE IS FINE.
YEAH, BUT, UH... WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT SOME OTHER STUFF, OKAY?
YEAH, I KNOW, I JUST, UH...
WELL, CAN YOU GET AWAY FOR LUNCH?
GREAT. COOL.
I'LL MEET YOU THERE. BYE.
YOU JUST FOUND HIM?
HE WAS WANDERING AROUND
ABOUT A BLOCK FROM HERE.
RESPS 11.
PUPILS STILL PINPOINT AND NONREACTIVE.
LACERATIONS ON THE FEET. LOOK INFECTED.
OKAY, HALEH, LET'S GET AN O2 MASK ON HIM.
C.B.C., LYTES, TOX SCREEN
E.K.G. AND BAG A URINE.
SO YOU THINK HE WAS JUST LOST?
LOST OR NEGLECTED.
WITH THE DECREASED RESPS
AND CONTRACTED PUPILS...
LOOKS LIKE HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN GIVEN OPIATES.
WE NEED TO GIVE HIM NARCAN, .1 MILLIGRAMS.
STAND BY WITH AN INTUBATION TRAY.
HE'S DEHYDRATED.
I CAN'T GET A LINE.
BLEW THE HAND AND THE ANTECUBITAL ON THE ARM.
CAN'T USE THE FEET, THEY'RE INFECTED. PAGE SURGERY.
WE NEED TO GET I.V. ACCESS.
Hathaway: RESPS ARE DOWN TO EIGHT.
YOU WANT TO INTUBATE?
Weaver: NO, UH... GIVE ME NARCAN IN A SYRINGE.
HOLD THE MOUTH OPEN.
I WILL INJECT SUBLINGUALLY INTO THE VASCULAR BED.
Haleh: I PAGED DR. CORDAY.
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO INTUBATE?
NOT IF THIS WORKS.
COME ON, LITTLE GUY.
LET'S HEAR SOMETHING.
( boy crying loudly )
SECOND E.K.G. WAS NORMAL
SO WE'LL HOLD FOR ANOTHER HOUR AND THEN RELEASE.
Romano: THANK YOU, DR. CARTER. MS. KNIGHT...
WOULD THAT BE YOU CATCHING YOUR BREATH TO GET HERE
BECAUSE YOU'RE 20 MINUTES LATE?
SORRY.
LET'S PROCEED.
...WITH PRESENTING MR. DAVID CHAMEIDES.
COMPLAINS OF BACK PAIN.
YEP, UH...
THIS IS A 68-YEAR-OLD MAN.
HE COMPLAINS, UM, HE PRESENTS
WITH BACK PAIN
AND HE SAID IT STARTED TWO DAYS AGO...
WHEN HE WAS HELPING HIS DAUGHTER MOVE INTO HER NEW APARTMENT.
AND SHE WAS LIVING IN DUBUQUE BUT SHE GOT A DIVORCE
SO SHE HAD TO MOVE BACK HERE TO CHICAGO.
DID I MENTION THAT
THE PAIN WAS CONSTANT?
NOT YET.
WELL, IT IS.
UM, AND UPON PHYSICAL EXAMINATION...
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA
WHOA, WHAT ABOUT PERTINENT NEGATIVES?
UH, NO FEVER...
NO, UM, TRAUMA
NO ABDOMINAL PAIN, NO, UM...
( sighs )
NO, UH...
NO...
UH, HE'S A HEAVY SMOKER.
AND, UM...
THE B.P. IS ONE... SORRY...
B.P. IS 170
OVER...
95... UM...
NO... NO, NO...
HIS, UM...
HIS B.P. IS, UM, 175/100.
PULSE 95.
NEURO EXAM NORMAL?
YES.
AND COULD YOU APPRECIATE
A PULSATILE ABDOMINAL MASS?
NO.
BUT THE ULTRASOUND REVEALED
AN ABDOMINAL AORTIC ANEURYSM.
HOW'D YOU KNOW THAT?
DR. CARTER.
PATIENT HAS ALL THE RISK FACTORS.
MS. KNIGHT, PRESENTING A CASE
IS LIKE TELLING GOOD STORIES:
SUCCINCT, FOCUSED AND TO THE POINT.
YOU LOST ME SOMEWHERE AROUND DUBUQUE.
MS. KNIGHT IS A STUDENT OF YOURS, IS THAT RIGHT?
YES.
WORK HARDER.
THANK GOD I'VE GOT A SMALL BOWEL OBSTRUCTION
WAITING FOR ME UPSTAIRS.
GENTLEMEN. MS. KNIGHT.
I THINK WE CAN ALL THANK GOD FOR THAT SMALL BOWEL.
IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE LATE, AT LEAST BE PREPARED.
ANY IDEA AS TO THE SOURCE OF THE FEVER?
PROBABLY CELLULITIS.
KERRY, REGGIE'S STILL HERE.
GOOD.
WE NEED A PHOTO.
WE'VE GOT A CAMERA BY THE DESK.
LET'S GET HIM SOME JUICE AND SOMETHING TO EAT, OKAY?
SURE.
COULD I HAVE A KELLY? YEP.
WHAT SORT OF PARENTS WOULD JUST ABANDON THEIR CHILD?
WE'RE NOT SURE THAT'S WHAT REALLY HAPPENED.
IF THERE ARE DRUGS IN HIS SYSTEM
PARENTS COULD BE DRUG ADDICTS
NOT EVEN KNOW HE'S MISSING.
OKAY. THAT'S LOVELY.
I'VE EXPOSED THE SAPHENOUS VEIN.
18-ANGIO.
IS THIS BABY JOHN DOE?
YEAH. TWO-YEAR-OLD. KERRY FOUND HIM.
Greene: MM-HMM. LOOKS GOOD.
JERRY SAID YOU NEED TO TALK TO ME?
OH, NO, IT'S NOTHING IMPORTANT.
UH... I'LL FIND YOU.
OKAY.
OH, UH... I REMEMBERED TO BRING MY TUXEDO
BUT I LEFT THE TICKETS AT HOME.
SO CAN WE STOP BY ON THE WAY?
SURE. SOUNDS FINE.
OKAY. CATCH YOU LATER.
MM-HMM.
OKAY, I.V.'s IN.
LET'S START HYDRATING HIM
WITH A BOLUS OF 100cc's NORMAL SALINE
250 MILLIGRAMS I.V. OXACILLIN
AND PUT HIM ON A NARCAN DRIP.
TUXEDO?
YES, JUST SOME, UM, FUND-RAISER THING WE AGREED TO GO TO.
UH-HUH.
DR. WEAVER, I HAVE STILL NOT FOUND THAT CAMERA. IT'S HERE SOMEWHERE.
JUST FIND IT, JERRY.
HAVE YOU SEEN MY PALMTOP COMPUTER?
IS EVERYTHING MISSING? NO, I HAVEN'T.
THAT'S WHY YOU'RE SO SCATTERED THIS MORNING?
YOU LOST YOUR ELECTRONIC CHEAT SHEET?
HEY, WHEN DID ANTOINE BELL COME IN?
OH, YEAH, UH, HE ASKED FOR YOU. I'M SORRY.
I PUT HIM IN TRAUMA ONE.
JUST GIVE ME A BREAK.
I WAS LATE AND I GOT MY CARDS ALL MESSED UP.
I'VE DONE 100 PRESENTATIONS
WITHOUT NOTES OR COMPUTERS OR SLEEP
SO WHY DON'T YOU GET YOURSELF A CUP OF COFFEE
AND PULL YOURSELF TOGETHER?
I AM TOGETHER.
WHEN? I WENT OFF THE RITALIN.
TWO DAYS AGO.
THAT'S GREAT.
LOOK, I GOT A PATIENT.
MAYBE WE CAN TALK MORE LATER.
SURE.
ANTOINE... EXPECTED TO SEE YOU TODAY.
JUST NOT LIKE THIS.
ANTOINE DOES NOT ASSOCIATE WITH ANY OF THOSE GANGS.
HE KNOWS THAT, MOM.
THIS IS ONE OF THOSE BAD BOYS FROM THE NEIGHBORHOOD.
I HATE THAT YOU GO TO SCHOOL WITH THEM.
PLEASE LET DR. CARTER DO HIS JOB.
DR. CARTER? MM-HMM.
ANTOINE HAS SO ENJOYED ALL YOU'VE BEEN TEACHING HIM.
THANK YOU FOR SETTING UP THIS INTERVIEW FOR HIM.
OH, YEAH. THAT'S, UM... THAT'S THIS AFTERNOON, RIGHT?
YEAH.
SUMMER SCIENCE LAB.
MAYBE I WON'T GO NOW.
OF COURSE YOU'RE GOING.
LOOKING LIKE THIS? WHAT WILL THEY THINK?
HEY, LET'S WORRY ABOUT THAT LATER, HUH?
WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED.
GOT MUGGED. TOOK MY WALLET.
FOLLOW MY FINGER WITH YOUR EYES.
WANT AN ORBITAL SERIES?
UH...
YEAH.
LET'S CHECK FOR A RIM FRACTURE.
NO SEPTAL HEMATOMA AND YOU DIDN'T BREAK YOUR NOSE.
BUT YOU MIGHT HAVE AN ORBITAL FRACTURE.
WHAT DO WE DO ABOUT THAT?
JUST APPLY ICE.
KEEP HIS HEAD ELEVATED WHEN HE SLEEPS.
WE'LL WAIT ON THE X RAY
TO SEE IF YOU NEED ANTIBIOTICS.
MOM! CAN HE GO TO THE INTERVIEW?
AW, COME ON, ANTOINE.
IT'S NOT THAT BAD.
YOU'VE WORKED HARD FOR THIS.
WE'VE WORKED HARD FOR THIS.
YOU'LL BE THE CANDIDATE THEY REMEMBER.
THERE WAS A MAN WAITING DOWN IN THE ULTRASOUND PLACE.
I THINK HE'S GOING TO BE
PARTING WITH HIS GALL BLADDER LATER TODAY.
REALLY TALL GUY? RED HAIR?
YOU'RE RIGHT-- THEY TOOK HIM OUT TO SURGERY.
HOW DID YOU KNOW?
WHAT A SWEET LITTLE FACE.
HE'S NOT GOING TO BE CRYING.
OH, NO, DON'T WORRY.
UH, I THINK HE'LL BE PRETTY QUIET.
NO, THAT'S WHAT I MEAN:
HE'S NOT GOING TO BE DOING ANY CRYING.
THIS IS CELINDA RANDLETT
IN FOR A RULE-OUT APPY.
SHE'S MEDICALLY EMPATHETIC.
MMM... I CAN TELL WHAT'S
GOING ON WITH PEOPLE.
INSIDE THEM.
Wright: KIND OF LIKE A PSYCHIC.
NO, I DON'T PREDICT THINGS.
I JUST FEEL WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE PRESENT.
IT STARTED WHEN I WAS A GIRL; BEEN WITH ME EVER SINCE.
BUT SHE CAN'T TELL ABOUT HERSELF--
MAYBE APPENDICITIS, MAYBE NOT.
IT'S NOT LIKE I CAN TREAT ANYBODY FOR ANYTHING.
BY THE WAY, WHEN ARE YOU DUE?
EXCUSE ME?
UH, YOU KNOW, I MEAN
WHEN'S YOUR DUE DATE?
OH, RIGHT. THAT.
UM... WELL...
WE'LL BE EXPECTING IN EARLY NOVEMBER.
LYDIA, YOU WANT TO HELP ME WITH THIS I.V.?
SURE.
HAVE YOU CALLED PSYCH YET?
YEAH. UH-HUH.
HI THERE, HUH?
HOW ARE YOU DOING?
YOU KNOW, HE'S DOING PRETTY GOOD.
HE'S SETTLING IN.
GREAT. YOU GOT A STUFFED COW.
THAT'S PRETTY NEAT.
JERRY FINALLY FOUND THE CAMERA.
CAROL, CAN YOU, UH...
PROP HIS HEAD UP A LITTLE BIT?
COME ON, LITTLE GUY, LET'S SIT YOU UP.
HE'S BEEN THROUGH QUITE A LOT.
Wright: OH, YEAH.
WANDERING AROUND BY HIMSELF
ABOUT A BLOCK FROM HERE, LOST.
NO, HE DOESN'T LOOK LOST.
HE LOOKS FOUND.
ALL RIGHT, LET ME JUST GET ONE MORE.
OKAY, HONEY.
HEY, WHERE'S THE ROACH COACH?
OH, LET'S GO OVER TO DOC MAGOO'S.
SO YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT SOMETHING?
YEAH, ABOUT TONIGHT, ACTUALLY.
I'VE NEVER BEEN TO THIS FUND-RAISER BEFORE
BUT IT'S A DINNER CRUISE AROUND THE LAKE, SWING BAND.
NO, SOUNDS WONDERFUL. I'M REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO IT.
IT'S JUST WE'VE NEVER ACTUALLY TALKED, YOU KNOW.
OH! ELIZABETH!
( Corday gasping )
YOU ALL RIGHT?
YEAH.
YOU OKAY IN THERE?
YOU ALL RIGHT?
IT'S OKAY. IT'S ALL RIGHT.
WE'RE GOING TO HELP YOU.
MY DAD... PLEASE HELP MY DAD.
IT'S OKAY. IT'S ALL RIGHT.
HE'S HAD FOUR OF ATIVAN.
ALL RIGHT, GIVE HIM ANOTHER TWO.
GOOD BREATH SOUNDS.
B.P.'s 125/75, PULSE 100.
NO SIGNS OF ABDOMINAL TRAUMA.
LET'S GET THE ULTRASOUND ON HIM AND SEE IF THERE'S ANY BLEEDING.
PUPILS ARE EQUAL AND REACTIVE.
HERE WE GO.
OKAY, MALIK, LOAD HIM WITH A GRAM OF DILANTIN.
HE'LL NEED A C-SPINE AND A HEAD C.T.
YOU GOT IT.
NO EVIDENCE OF INTRA- ABDOMINAL BLEEDING.
I'M GOING TO GO TALK TO HIS DAUGHTER.
HI.
I'M DR. GREENE.
HOW ARE YOU DOING?
OKAY.
WELL, YOUR DAD'S DOING OKAY, TOO.
MS. KNIGHT, WON'T YOU FILL ME IN?
UH, THIS IS SARAH, UH... SORRY.
UH, SHE HAS FACIAL LACERATIONS, BRUISE TO HER FOREHEAD
NORMAL CRANIAL NERVE EXAM, NO LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNESS.
SHE WAS IN A CAR ACCIDENT RIGHT OUTSIDE THE E.R.
SHE WAS DRIVING.
I KNOW ABOUT THAT PART, DON'T I?
SO DID YOU ASK HER
WHAT HAPPENED?
CAR ACCIDENT.
A-AND SHE SAID SHE HIT
CALL ME CRAZY, BUT YOU'RE TOO YOUNG TO DRIVE, AREN'T YOU?
YEAH. NOT THAT YOU'RE NOT A GOOD DRIVER.
I MEAN, THAT EL STANCHION JUMPED RIGHT OUT
IN THE MIDDLE THERE, DIDN'T IT?
SO DID SOMETHING HAPPEN TO YOUR DAD?
WELL, HE HAS EPILEPSY.
HE HASN'T HAD A SEIZURE IN TWO YEARS.
WHEN THAT HAPPENS, I KNOW WHAT TO DO.
HE AND MOM TAUGHT US.
THIS TIME, HE WAS DRIVING SO YOU HAD TO GRAB THE WHEEL.
IT WAS KIND OF HARD TO REACH THE PEDALS.
BUT YOU THOUGHT FAST ENOUGH TO GET HIM TO THE E.R.
YEAH, WELL, WE BROUGHT MY BROTHER HERE LAST WEEK.
HE FELL OUT OF HIS BUNK BED AND BROKE HIS COLLARBONE.
YOU DID A GREAT JOB, SARAH
AND WHEN I TELL MY TEN-YEAR-OLD
THAT YOU GOT TO DRIVE, SHE IS GOING TO BE SO JEALOUS.
YOSH, WHY DON'T YOU GET THAT CUT CLEANED UP
AND GET HER IN TO SEE HER DAD.
SURE, NO PROBLEM.
LUCY, COME WITH ME.
I WAS GOING TO ASK HER WHAT HAPPENED.
I JUST DIDN'T GET A CHANCE, AND THEN YOU WALKED IN...
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
HOLD UP, OKAY? HOLD UP!
WHAT'S GOING ON?
ARE YOU OKAY?
I'M FINE. I'M DEFINITELY FINE.
YOU DIDN'T SEEM DEFINITELY FINE
PRESENTING THAT PATIENT TO DR. ROMANO
AND I'VE SEEN YOU HANDLE KIDS
MUCH BETTER THAN YOU DID JUST NOW.
DR. GREENE, I DIDN'T GET MUCH SLEEP LAST NIGHT.
JUST GIVE ME A... YOU'LL GET EVEN LESS
WHEN YOU'RE A RESIDENT.
YOU GOT TO LEARN TO DEAL WITH IT, HMM?
JEANIE... I WAS LOOKING FOR YOU.
HEY, DID THEY FIND ANYTHING?
NO KIDS REPORTED MISSING IN THE PAST WEEK.
WHAT ABOUT THE NEIGHBORHOOD?
BUT I'LL LET YOU KNOW IF I HEAR ANYTHING ELSE.
I'LL FILL KERRY IN.
YOU GOT TO GET BACK TO WORK?
YEAH, THEY CALLED IN ALL THE P.O.'s IN THIS DISTRICT.
SOME LUNATIC IS STANDING ON TOP OF A VAN DOWN ON MADISON
WAVING A .45. SHOOTING AT PEOPLE?
NO, THREATENING TO KILL HIMSELF.
HMM.
CATCH YOU LATER.
HEY, UH... THANKS FOR THE RIDE THIS MORNING.
MY PLEASURE.
WE HAVE TO USE THIS CODE FIRST?
AND ALL CALLS GET CHARGED TO IT?
RIGHT.
SO IF I USE THE CODE ON MY PHONE AT HOME...
I COULD USE A LITTLE HELP HERE.
HELLO. E.R.
NO, SHE'S NOT HERE.
OKAY. McLUCAS HAS TO CANCEL.
CALL TO RESCHEDULE.
OKAY, I'LL TELL HER.
ANYONE SEEN CAROL?
SHE'S IN CURTAIN THREE.
HER DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENT WAS CANCELED.
SHE NEEDS TO CALL McLUCAS.
I KNOW HER. SHE WAS CONNIE'S O.B. WHEN SHE HAD HER BABY.
DID YOU SAY "BABY"?
YOU DON'T THINK SH...?
POP TART'S IN THE TOASTER?
THAT EMPATHETIC WOMAN DID ASK
ABOUT HER DUE DATE.
THAT WHAT WOMAN?
YOSH, DID YOU HEAR ANYTHING
ABOUT CAROL BEING PREGNANT?
YEAH, I'M SURE IT WOULD BE DOUG.
MAYBE CAROL'S JUST GOING IN FOR A CHECKUP
OR... A YEAST INFECTION?
WHAT IS IT, JERRY?
THEY THINK CAROL'S KNOCKED UP.
WOW. SHE HAPPY ABOUT IT?
SHE HASN'T TOLD ANYONE.
SHE MUST HAVE TOLD SOMEONE.
WHAT?
Weaver: HOW'S HE DOING?
Hathaway: HE'S DOING GREAT
BUT I STILL CAN'T GET HIM TO TELL ME HIS NAME.
HE'S DEFINITELY NOT A TALKER.
YEAH, THE POLICE HAVEN'T COME UP WITH ANYTHING YET.
HOW CAN YOU NOT KNOW WHERE YOUR CHILD IS
UNLESS YOU ABANDONED HIM?
LABS CAME BACK.
HE TESTED POSITIVE FOR OPIATES.
GREAT. DRUGS LYING AROUND THE HOUSE.
I MEAN IF HE WAS CRYING A LOT
MAYBE THEY GAVE HIM SOMETHING TO QUIET HIM DOWN.
I DON'T KNOW.
I'LL LOOK IN ON HIM LATER, OKAY?
OKAY.
HE'S ALL RIGHT NOW
ALTHOUGH THERE'S STILL SOMETHING INSIDE OF HIM.
I JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS.
WELL, HE HAS AN INFECTION, CELLULITIS.
NO, THAT'S NOT IT.
SO ANYWAY, HAVE YOU STARTED THINKING ABOUT NAMES?
THAT'S THE HARD PART, YOU KNOW.
EVERYBODY'S GOT AN OPINION.
YOU ARE IN A FAMILY WAY, AREN'T YOU?
AS MY GRANDMOTHER USED TO SAY.
HOW COULD YOU TELL?
LIKE I SAID... I'M SENSITIVE TO WHAT'S GOING ON WITH PEOPLE.
OVER THERE, I'M SAD TO SAY, HAS LEUKEMIA.
YOU COULD HAVE LOOKED AT HIS CHART.
THAT'S RIGHT.
I COULD HAVE.
THE ODD THING IS, I CAN'T TELL
IF YOU'RE HAVING A BOY OR A GIRL.
OH, WELL, I'M JUST BEGINNING MY SECOND TRIMESTER, SO...
NO. I CAN USUALLY TELL LONG BEFORE THAT.
SO... YOU'VE HAD THIS GIFT YOUR WHOLE LIFE?
WELL, IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE MUCH OF A GIFT
WHEN I SEE A GENTLEMAN LIKE THAT.
WHAT?
NOTHING.
HEY, CARLA. LOOK, I'M SORRY I'M LATE.
IT'S OKAY.
GLAD YOU CALLED.
I NEEDED TO TALK TO YOU.
YEAH. I-I-I, UH...
LOOK, UM... I KNOW I HAVEN'T...
I HAVEN'T SPOKEN TO YOU
ABOUT ROGER WORKING WITH REESE ON LANGUAGE
AND MARTHA CALLED AND...
TOLD ME ABOUT THIS MORNING.
OKAY, LOOK.
I WAS ANGRY AT FIRST, BUT, CARLA, I KNOW, YOU KNOW
THE MORE ANYBODY WORKS WITH HIM
THE QUICKER HE'S GOING TO LEARN, SO... IT'S OKAY.
PETER...
ROGER AND I GOT MARRIED LAST WEEKEND.
WELL...
THERE'S A LOT YOU HAVEN'T TOLD ME.
HIS COMPANY IS TRANSFERRING HIM
TO GERMANY-- HAMBURG.
I'M GOING TO SELL THE RESTAURANT
AND WE'RE GOING, AND I'M TAKING REESE WITH US.
OH, BUT HE...
WE'RE NOT GOING TO EVEN HAVE THIS CONVERSATION.
PETER...
NO WAY IN HELL AM I GOING TO LET THAT HAPPEN.
HE'S GOING TO HAVE TO BE
WITH ONE OF US AND I'M HIS MOTHER.
THIS WILL HAPPEN.
OH, MARK, DO YOU HAVE A MINUTE?
YEAH. YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT SOMETHING?
YEAH. I'VE MOVED MR. BENGOSSI
AND HIS DAUGHTER SARAH TO EXAM FOUR.
THAT'S WHAT YOU WANTED TO TALK ABOUT?
UH...
NO TIME LIKE THE PRESENT.
ALL RIGHT.
I WANT TO TALK ABOUT, UH...
YOU KNOW, WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON BETWEEN US
OVER THE PAST FEW WEEKS.
SOMETHING BEEN GOING ON?
COME ON, WE'LL TALK IN HERE.
LOOK, MARK, IT'S NO BIG DEAL OR ANYTHING.
IT'S JUST THAT... CAROL.
AH, DAMN, I THOUGHT I LOCKED THAT DOOR.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
UH... ULTRASOUND.
ON YOURSELF?
YES, MARK. MY, UH...
MY DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENT CANCELED
AND NO ONE WAS USING THE EQUIPMENT.
WELL, WHY DON'T YOU LET US DO IT?
OKAY.
IF YOU MUST.
LET ME GET IT.
YOU THINK IT'S TOO EARLY TO TELL IF IT'S A GIRL OR BOY?
IT'S NEVER TOO EARLY TO BE INACCURATE.
THERE'S THE HEARTBEAT.
ANY TURTLE SIGN?
I'M LOOKING.
OKAY.
THERE'S THE, UH...
MARK?
UH-HUH.
WHAT? MARK?
WHAT?
HEARTBEAT.
YES, MARK, ELIZABETH ALREADY SAID THAT. WHAT?
WHAT HE MEANS IS, THERE'S ANOTHER HEARTBEAT.
JERRY, WHAT'S UP WITH MALIK?
HE'S GOT A BIG GRIN ON HIS FACE.
HE KNOWS NOTHING.
I MEAN, UH, HE'S JUST A NATURALLY HAPPY PERSON.
YEAH, THAT MALIK.
DOWNRIGHT INSPIRING.
AND INFECTIOUS.
I'M HAPPY, TOO.
EXCUSE ME.
COULD SOMEBODY PLEASE TELL ME
WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON WITH THESE PHONES?!
DR. ROMANO HAS INSTITUTED A CODE SYSTEM
SO THAT PEOPLE DON'T MAKE SO MANY PERSONAL CALLS.
Anspaugh: A CODE SYSTEM?
Jerry: YES, SIR.
ONLY TO RIDE HIS BIKE INTO THE SIDE OF A BUS.
LIFE IS NOT FAIR. LUCY?
X RAY DEFINITELY SHOWS A FRACTURE IN THE ANKLE.
WHAT KIND?
COMMINUTED.
TRIMALLEOLAR. WHICH NEEDS?
OPEN REDUCTION AND INTERNAL FIXATION...
MARK, WE GOT A DOUBLE TRAUMA COMING IN.
TWO G.S.W.s; POLICE OFFICER AND THE MAN WHO SHOT HIM.
Boulet: WHAT HAPPENED?
SOME GUY WAS WAVING A .45 AROUND.
POLICE GOT HIM.
OKAY, FIND CARTER OR WEAVER
AND LET'S GET SET UP.
CAROL, DID YOU...
DID YOU NOTICE THIS BEFORE?
HERE.
LOOKS LIKE A SMALL SCAR FROM SURGERY.
Weaver: HEY, WE'RE JUST LOOKING YOU OVER.
YES.
ALL RIGHT, YOUR EAR.
LET'S JUST LOOK YOU OVER.
HE'S GOT A SHUNT.
FROM THE VENTRICLES IN HIS BRAIN
TO HIS PERITONEUM.
HE WAS PROBABLY BORN WITH HYDROCEPHALUS.
WHAT'S A SHUNT?
IT'S LIKE A SMALL TUBE THAT RUNS THROUGH THE BODY.
IT DRAINS EXCESS FLUID.
THAT MUST BE WHAT I'VE BEEN FEELING INSIDE HIM THEN.
CAROL, PLEASE.
NO PROBLEM.
MYSTERY SOLVED.
HE COULD HAVE A SHUNT INFECTION.
WE NEED TO DO A TAP.
GO BYE-BYE?
YEAH, YOU WANT TO GO BYE-BYE, DON'T YOU?
WHERE'S THE OFFICER?
WHAT?
THE COP... HE SHOT A COP.
ANOTHER UNIT TOOK HIM TO MERCY.
APPROXIMATELY 40 YEARS OLD
G.S.W. TIMES TWO TO THE LEFT CHEST.
FULL ARREST. TWO LINES IN.
WEAK PULSE IN THE FIELD
AND THEN HE LOST IT.
AGONAL RHYTHM ON THE SCOPE.
HI. THIS IS JEANIE BOULET AT COUNTY.
I NEED TO CHECK ON AN OFFICER
WHO WAS JUST BROUGHT IN.
Carter: LUCY, I'LL SHOW YOU HOW
TO PUT IN AN ATRIAL LINE.
THORACOTOMY TRAY.
LUCY, I GOT A CALL FROM PSYCH.
WERE YOU SUPPOSED
TO SEE SOME KID?
OH, SETH WILLOWS. YEAH.
Greene: WELL, YOU BETTER GO.
THEY SAID MERCY. COULD YOU CHECK AGAIN, PLEASE?
ASYSTOLE ON THE MONITOR.
I'LL TAKE OVER BAGGING.
SQUEEZE IN THAT O-NEG AS FAST AS YOU CAN.
OKAY, RIB SPREADER.
I NEED SUCTION.
Greene: WHOA!
OH, GOD.
LAP PAD.
LEFT VENTRICLE'S SHREDDED.
GIVE ME A SPONGE STICK.
SECOND SHOT TRANSECTED THE ASCENDING AORTA.
TWO UNITS IN. STILL ASYSTOLE.
OKAY, THAT'S IT.
THERE'S NOTHING WE CAN DO HERE.
I'M CALLING IT.
TIME OF DEATH: 1509.
REGGIE...
HE DIDN'T MAKE IT?
NOT EVEN CLOSE.
WE HEARD THAT
AN OFFICER WAS SHOT.
BULLET GRAZED HIS SHOULDER.
HE'LL BE OKAY.
WELL, COULD HAVE BEEN MUCH WORSE.
CARTER, LET'S GO TALK ABOUT YOUR STUDENT.
SO WAS IT YOU WHO SHOT HIM?
HEY, SETH.
I'M SO SORRY I'M LATE.
UM, A TRAUMA CAME IN TO THE E.R.
AND I GOT DELAYED.
OKAY, THAT'S NOT TRUE.
I FORGOT.
AND I'M REALLY SORRY.
SETH?
SETH?
WHAT?!
WHAT?! WHAT?! WHAT?! WHAT?! WHAT?! WHAT?!
PLEASE.
CAN WE JUST TALK ABOUT THIS?
I DON'T FEEL LIKE TALKING RIGHT NOW.
I KNOW YOU'RE ANGRY
AND YOU HAVE EVERY RIGHT TO BE.
YOU KNOW, I DO NEED TO GET ON THERE AT SOME POINT.
IN A MINUTE, JERRY.
JERRY, DON'T WE HAVE A LOST-AND-NOW-IT'S-OURS BOX
AROUND HERE SOMEWHERE?
YEAH, RIGHT HERE.
OH, THANKS.
THE POLICE FIND OUT ANYTHING ABOUT THAT LITTLE BOY?
I HEAR HE HAS A SHUNT.
I'M E-MAILING ALL HIS INFO AND A SCANNED PHOTO
TO ALL THE BOARD-CERTIFIED NEUROSURGEONS.
THERE'S ONLY 380 THAT SPECIALIZE IN PEDIATRICS.
HOPEFULLY, SOMEONE WILL RECOGNIZE HIM
SO WE KNOW WHERE HE BELONGS.
380? AND WHICH ONE ARE YOU ON?
ELIZABETH, ARE YOU ABOUT READY TO TAKE A BREAK?
I WISH.
I'VE GOT A VEGETECTOMY AND A VALVULOPLASTY WITH ROMANO.
HOW ARE YOU TAKING THE NEWS?
I'M IN DENIAL.
BUT THANKS FOR ASKING.
MARK, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
I HAVE A WOMAN WHO HAS ARTHRITIS
AND SO I HAD TO CUT HER WEDDING RING OFF
AND SO I THOUGHT I'D GLUE IT BACK TOGETHER
AND HANG IT ON A CHAIN
SO SHE COULD WEAR IT AROUND HER NECK.
THAT'S VERY SWEET OF YOU.
YEAH, I THOUGHT SHE'D LIKE IT.
I'LL CATCH YOU LATER.
UH-HUH.
( titters )
MARK, WHAT'S THAT MOVIE CALLED
WHERE ALL THE PEOPLE TURN INTO SOME KIND OF A POD?
WHAT?
HIS LIFE WAS IN HIS OWN HANDS, NOT YOURS.
THERE MUST HAVE BEEN 20 OTHER COPS OUT THERE.
I DON'T KNOW. MY PATROL CAR WAS CLOSEST.
IT'S JUST RANDOM, I GUESS.
YEAH.
I DON'T THINK I BELIEVE IN RANDOM ANYMORE.
WHEN I TOLD YOU THAT I WAS SEEING SOMEONE ELSE...
THAT WASN'T THE COMPLETE TRUTH.
I JUST FOUND OUT THAT I HAVE HEPATITIS C.
I'M RESPONDING TO MEDICATION.
IT'S UNDER CONTROL.
YOU DIDN'T THINK I COULD HANDLE THAT KIND OF NEWS?
I COULDN'T HANDLE THAT KIND OF NEWS.
I JUST KEPT THINKING, WHY ME?
WHY THIS ON TOP OF EVERYTHING ELSE?
BUT AFTER A WHILE
I CAME TO SEE THAT I WASN'T SICK.
I WAS HEALED.
I DON'T THINK I'M GETTING THIS.
I THINK THAT GOD KEPT THROWING THINGS AT ME
UNTIL FINALLY I REALIZED
THAT IT'S NOT ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS TO US--
IT'S ABOUT HOW WE DEAL WITH WHAT HAPPENS TO US.
WE HAVE CHOICES.
OUR LIVES ARE IN OUR OWN HANDS.
SO YOU THINK WHAT HAPPENED TODAY WAS SOME KIND OF MESSAGE FOR ME.
MAYBE WHAT HAPPENED TODAY DIDN'T HAPPEN TO YOU.
MAYBE IT HAPPENED FOR YOU.
YEAH, I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.
I'M NOT SURE IT MAKES ME FEEL ALL THAT MUCH BETTER.
SITTING HERE FEELS PRETTY GOOD.
( chuckles )
YEAH, IT DOES.
( birds crying )
Romano: YOU'RE AWFULLY QUIET, PETER.
BAD MOOD?
AH, THE NIMBLE FINGERS OF A SURGEON TOILING AWAY.
SUCTION, PLEASE.
I KNOW YOU DIDN'T EXPECT TO BE ASSISTING TODAY
BUT I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND.
OF COURSE NOT.
THIS MIGHT VERY WELL BE
DR. BENTON'S LAST CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY...
LET'S CLEAN UP THE VEGETATIONS.
6-0 PROLINE.
Romano: IT'S A SHAME YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO USE
ALL THAT HARD-EARNED KNOWLEDGE WHILE YOU'RE DOING TRAUMA SCUT.
LIZZIE, I THINK
YOU'VE ACTUALLY BEEN SPARED.
PETER WAS CHOSEN FAIRLY.
I'VE MADE MY PEACE WITH IT.
Romano: AN EXCELLENT ATTITUDE
WHICH IS WHY WE SHOULD KEEP YOU ON HERE AT COUNTY.
WHETHER IT'S WITH THE CARDIOTHORACIC
FELLOWSHIP OR SOMETHING ELSE.
BUT I KNOW THAT'S SOMETHING
YOU'RE STILL THINKING ABOUT
AND YOU SHOULD.
AFTER ALL... IT'S WHAT
ANY GOOD CANDIDATE WOULD DO.
SOMEONE'S CALLING ABOUT THAT LITTLE BOY.
THANKS, JERRY.
CARTER, I NEED YOU TO LOOK AT THAT PATIENT.
YEAH, OKAY.
ANTOINE?
THAT SAME KID JUMP YOU AGAIN?
NO.
SOMEBODY ELSE?
NO, IT WAS THE SAME DUDE.
I JUMPED HIM.
WHAT?
THE KID FROM THIS MORNING?
YOU WENT AFTER HIM?
HE TOOK MY WALLET, MAN.
I CAN'T BE LETTING THAT GO DOWN.
WHY NOT? WHAT'D YOU LOSE? TEN, 15 BUCKS?
HE SOUNDS LIKE MY MOM.
B.P.'s 128/74.
PULSE 96.
DID YOU GET KICKED OR PUNCHED IN THE STOMACH?
NO, HE ONLY GOT ME IN THE FACE.
Carter: LOOKS LIKE A COLLES' WITH DORSAL ANGULATION.
IT'S GOING TO NEED A CLOSED REDUCTION.
WHAT'S THAT?
IT MEANS YOU BROKE YOUR LEFT WRIST.
CAN YOU FEEL THIS?
WHAT KIND OF SUTURES DO YOU WANT?
5-0 VICRYL, 6-0 NYLON.
I GOT TO HAVE STITCHES?
FIFTH METACARPAL FRACTURE
WITH ROTATIONAL DEFORMITY.
YOU BROKE BOTH YOUR HANDS.
LET'S GET AN ORBITAL SERIES.
LEFT HAND, RIGHT WRIST. CALL ORTHO.
THAT ONE'S GOING TO HAVE TO BE PINNED
IN THE O.R.
GOT TO HAVE AN OPERATION?
THAT'S RIGHT.
YOU WANTED TO BLOW OFF YOUR INTERVIEW.
MAYBE I CAN GO
YOU'RE NOT GETTING INTO ANY SUMMER SCIENCE LAB.
NOT NOW.
YOU HAVE TO GO TO SURGERY
AND HAVE A PIN PUT INTO YOUR RIGHT HAND.
THEN YOU GET A CAST THAT GOES FROM YOUR ELBOW
ALL THE WAY DOWN TO YOUR FINGERS.
I CAN STILL GO TO CLASS.
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE USE OF YOUR HANDS.
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO DRESS YOURSELF
OR TIE YOUR SHOE.
YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO BLOW YOUR OWN NOSE
FOR THE NEXT SIX WEEKS.
SO WHAT? IT'S NOT YOUR PROBLEM.
NO? I'M THE ONE WHO'S BEEN SPENDING TIME WITH YOU
AND SHOWING YOU AROUND FOR THE LAST MONTH
JUST TRYING TO TEACH YOU SOMETHING.
BY GOING TO GO BEAT DOWN SOME PUNK IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.
CARTER...
YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT IT.
FROM THE BEST OPPORTUNITY THAT YOU'VE EVER BEEN GIVEN.
NO ONE GAVE ME ANYTHING.
I EARNED THAT CHANCE MYSELF.
WELL, YOU JUST BLEW IT...
ALL BY YOURSELF.
DR. CARTER... YES, CHUNY?
DON'T FORGET
UH, JUST ONE CALL FOR DR. WEAVER.
YEAH, IT WAS THE GROCER I MET THIS MORNING.
HE CALLED TO SEE WHAT HAD HAPPENED.
SHUNT'S NOT CAUSING THE INFECTION.
MAYBE IT'S THE CELLULITIS.
DO YOU THINK HIS PARENTS ABANDONED HIM
BECAUSE OF THE SHUNT?
WHAT?
I MEAN, YOU KNOW, BECAUSE... HE WASN'T BORN NORMAL.
THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WITH HIM.
WELL, I WOULD HATE TO THINK SO
BUT ANYTHING'S POSSIBLE.
I'M GOING TO GO CHECK ON HIM.
( computer beeping )
OKAY, SETH, WE'LL SEE YOU NEXT WEEK.
IS YOUR MOM HERE?
SHE'S MY FOSTER MOM.
OKAY.
SEE YOU.
BYE, SETH.
I'M SORRY I HAD TO CALL YOU IN.
DON'T BE. I'M GLAD YOU RECOGNIZED YOU WERE IN OVER YOUR HEAD.
A LOT OF STUDENTS DON'T WANT TO ADMIT THAT.
I REALLY BLEW IT.
ALCOHOLIC FATHER, BEEN BOUNCED AROUND A LOT--
YOU CAN EXPECT A LOT OF SETBACKS.
THEY'LL HAPPEN AGAIN AND AGAIN.
WELL, I CAUSED THIS SETBACK.
I WAS 20 MINUTES LATE FOR OUR MEETING TODAY.
WELL...
THAT IS SOMETHING THAT CANNOT HAPPEN AGAIN.
IT WON'T.
I WON'T LET IT.
NOW, FROM THE SUBLIME TO THE UTTERLY MUNDANE
BUT, THEN, THE APPENDECTOMY IS
OUR BREAD AND BUTTER, ISN'T IT?
MAYBE NOT, IF I DO CARDIOTHORACIC.
YEAH, SO...
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
I THINK YOU'RE AN UTTER BASTARD
FOR MENTIONING IT TO ME IN FRONT OF PETER.
HE'S A BIG BOY.
IT WAS MEAN.
( imitating child ): OH, WELL, HE WAS MEAN TO ME FIRST.
HE LED ME ON TO THINK THAT HE WANTED THE CARDIOTHORACIC
AND THEN HE TOOK TRAUMA.
NEVERTHELESS, IT WAS BAD FORM
TO SPEAK TO ONE COLLEAGUE IN FRONT OF ANOTHER
GEEZ, TALK ABOUT BEING SENSITIVE.
ROBERT...
DONALD, HOW WAS YOUR WHIPPLE, YOU LUCKY DOG?
A LONG SIX HOURS, THAT'S HOW
WHICH IS WHY I WASN'T ABLE TO FIND YOU EARLIER.
YOU INITIATED THIS, UH, CODE PHONE SYSTEM
DOWN IN THE E.R.?
Romano: YES, SIR.
FOR WHAT PURPOSE?
PATIENTS' FAMILIES CAN'T SNEAK IN CALLS
TO THEIR RELATIVES IN HOBOKEN.
( chuckles ): WHICH I BELIEVE IS NOT A BIG PROBLEM.
NO-NO, BUT YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT IS?
EMPLOYEE PERSONAL CALLS.
THIS ALLOWS US TO TRACK ALL THE OUTGOING CALLS INTERNALLY.
THAT WAY, WE DON'T HAVE TO WAIT FOR THE PHONE BILLS TO ARRIVE.
I SEE, A...
BIG-BROTHER-IS-WATCHING KIND OF THING.
"MONITORING" MIGHT BE A BETTER WORD.
HAVE YOU SO LITTLE RESPECT
FOR THE PEOPLE
WHO WORK HERE, SOMETIMES VERY LONG HOURS
AND NOT A GREAT DEAL OF PAY?
I DON'T SEE IT THAT WAY.
SO, IF YOU'D BE SO KIND AS TO TAKE YOUR
CODE PHONE SYSTEM AND PUT IT WHERE THE SUN...
GOT IT.
GOOD.
( door swinging )
POINT TAKEN.
YEAH, A NEW LITTLE VOICE IN THE WORLD.
CAROL ACTUALLY HASN'T TOLD ANYONE YET
SO WE'RE PRETENDING LIKE WE DON'T KNOW.
OKAY, I WON'T SAY ANYTHING.
OKAY.
OOP! SORRY!
AW, MAN!
UH, CARTER...
LOOK!
COME HERE. I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THIS...
I THINK IT'S GREAT YOU WENT OFF THE RITALIN.
I REALLY DO.
I THINK IT'S THE RIGHT DECISION
BUT I CAN'T BE HOLDING YOUR HAND THROUGH THIS.
I WOULDN'T BE SO STUPID AS TO ASK YOU TO.
YOU'RE NOT CAPABLE. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
YOU HAVEN'T LIKED ME FROM THE GET-GO.
I'VE NEVER BEEN UP TO YOUR STANDARDS.
I JUST WANT YOU TO BE A BETTER STUDENT.
I WANT YOU TO SUCCEED.
BUT I THINK THAT YOU'RE THE ONE WHO WANTS TO SUCCEED
AS A TEACHER, AND... ( stammers )
I WOULD HAVE TO BE THE PERFECT REFLECTION OF YOU
AND THAT'S NOT WHO I AM.
I HAVE A PATIENT.
I'M DROPPING THESE OFF FOR DR. WEINTRAUB.
HEY, PETER, I JUST WANT TO TELL YOU
I THINK ROCKET WAS A COMPLETE ASS
FOR DOING WHAT HE DID IN THE O.R. TODAY.
HE CAN DO WHATEVER HE WANTS.
YEAH, WELL, NOT ENTIRELY, BUT...
IT DOESN'T MATTER, ELIZABETH.
CARDIOTHORACIC, TRAUMA--
I DON'T THINK I CARE ABOUT ANY OF IT ANYMORE.
HANG ON.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
( sighs )
CARLA CAME TO SEE ME TODAY.
SHE MARRIED ROGER.
SHE WANTS TO TAKE REESE AND, UH, MOVE TO GERMANY...
SOMETHING ABOUT ROGER'S... JOB.
WELL, SHE CAN'T.
I MEAN, LEGALLY, SHE CAN'T DO THAT, CAN SHE?
YEAH, WELL... SHE WON'T GET THE CHANCE TO.
HEY, CAROL... THIS FAX JUST CAME IN FOR YOU.
THANKS, JERRY.
BY THE WAY...
I KNOW YOU KNOW.
KNOW WHAT?
I KNOW NOTHING.
I'M... A COMPLETE WALKING
LACK OF INFORMATION.
OH, MAN.
CAROL, IT'S FOR YOU.
THIS IS CAROL HATHAWAY.
YEAH, YOU'RE DOING SO MUCH BETTER, HUH?
IT'S KIND OF A BIG DAY.
YOU WANT SOME JUICE?
YOU'VE GOT SOME APPLE JUICE HERE.
MY NAME IS KERRY.
CAN YOU TELL ME YOUR NAME?
HMM?
Hathaway: JACK.
JACK TOBEREN.
SO, THAT'S YOUR NAME, LITTLE GUY-- "JACK."
WOW.
WHAT A GREAT NAME, "JACK," HUH?
SO, YOU GOT A RESPONSE?
PEDIATRIC NEUROSURGEON ON THE NORTH SIDE.
HE RECOGNIZED THE PHOTO.
HE PUT THE SHUNT IN.
HE SAW JACK ABOUT TWO MONTHS AGO FOR A FOLLOW-UP.
HE CALLED THE PARENTS.
THEY'RE COMING IN?
OH, YEAH, IN A BIG HURRY.
I JUST SPOKE TO THE MOTHER ON THE PHONE.
JACK WAS KIDNAPPED
THREE WEEKS AGO.
WHAT?
UNREAL, HUH?
BY THE NANNY AND THE DRUGGED-OUT BOYFRIEND.
MUST'VE BEEN THE ONES WHO ABANDONED HIM.
I GUESS SO.
THERE YOU GO. OOP.
I CALLED THE POLICE.
THEY'RE ON THEIR WAY IN.
SO NOW WE KNOW WHO YOU ARE, JACK.
YOUR MOM AND DAD ARE COMING IN AND YOU GET
TO GO HOME.
YEAH.
ALL RIGHT.
( knocking )
HEY, PETER.
CARLA WON'T BE HOME UNTIL 7:30.
YEAH, I KNOW.
ACTUALLY, IT MIGHT EVEN BE LATER
UH, MAYBE NOT TILL 10:00.
HEY, MAN.
HEY.
SHE DIDN'T TELL ME SHE'D BE LATE.
I TOLD HER I'D TELL YOU WHEN I GOT HERE.
YOU KNOW, I DON'T HAVE TO TAKE REESE.
IT'S JUST THAT CARLA WAS PRETTY SURE
YOU WOULD HAVE SOME PLANS TONIGHT.
OH, I WAS PLANNING TO GO TO THE QUARTZ LOUNGE.
UM, I-I KIND OF HAVE BEEN SEEING THIS TRUMPET PLAYER.
OH, A MUSICIAN, HUH?
YEAH, WELL, YOU BETTER WATCH YOURSELF.
SAY, "BYE," REESE.
BYE-BYE, REESE.
SAY, "BYE."
BYE-BYE.
BYE.
SO... IS YOUR MOM MORE OR LESS PISSED OFF
THAN I IMAGINE SHE IS?
THAT'D BE MORE OR LESS THAN YOU?
THAT'S FAIR.
I'LL NEVER PLAY THE VIOLIN AGAIN.
( snickering )
THAT'S PRETTY FUNNY.
I HEARD IT IN A STUPID TV MOVIE.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING WATCHING TV WHEN YOU GOT HOMEWORK?
( laughing ): OH, MAN, YOU ARE MY MOM.
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT.
SEE, I THINK I WANT THE BEST FOR YOU...
BUT I SUSPECT
THAT SHE'S... DOES A BETTER JOB
OF APPRECIATING YOU FOR WHO YOU ARE.
AS LONG AS I GROW UP TO BE JUST LIKE HER.
MY FAMILY WANTED ME TO GROW UP TO BE A RICH, WHITE GUY.
DAMN, THEY MUST BE DANCING.
YOU DON'T MAKE THAT KIND OF MONEY
I THINK THEY FIGURE THEY'D SETTLE ON TWO OUT OF THREE.
I WISH I HADN'T BLOWN THAT SUMMER THING, DR. CARTER.
YOU'LL GET ANOTHER CHANCE.
NOW I'LL BE SPENDING MY TIME BAGGING GROCERIES.
ACTUALLY, I'M NOT EVEN SURE YOU'RE GOING TO BE DOING THAT.
I'LL BE RIGHT HERE WHEN YOU GET OUT.
YEAH, WE'LL STILL MAKE IT.
DOESN'T MATTER. THIS IS WORTH STAYING FOR.
OH, WOW, YOU TWO LOOK GREAT.
I'LL WALK OUT WITH YOU.
I HAVE TO CHECK ON A CHART.
OH... RETURN A PHONE CALL.
OKAY.
GOOD NIGHT.
Man: HEY!
All: SURPRISE!
OH, MAN. Wright: WE GOT YOU.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
YOU HAVEN'T OFFICIALLY TOLD US ABOUT THE BABY...
BUT WE COULDN'T SIT ON IT ANOTHER MINUTE.
Haleh: WE JUST WANTED YOU TO KNOW HOW HAPPY WE ARE.
AND WE'RE GOING TO GET YOU SOMETHING BETTER...
BUT FOR NOW...
OH, MAN!
( laughing ): GOD!
( laughing )
HEY, CAROL, NEED A LAMAZE COACH?
YOU'RE IT, MALIK.
ALL RIGHT.
YEAH.
I, UM... I'VE JUST BEEN OVERWHELMED
WITH THIS NEWS MYSELF
AND, UH, TODAY I FOUND OUT I'M... I'M HAVING TWINS.
HEY!
Carol: SO...
( laughs )
I DIDN'T KNOW
WHEN OR HOW TO TELL PEOPLE
AND I'M... I'M REALLY GLAD
THAT I CAN SHARE THIS WITH YOU NOW.
CONGRATULATIONS.
THANK YOU.
Carter: WONDERFUL.
Hathaway: THANKS.
Hi. You've reached Peter.
If you want to leave a message, please do so after the tone.
( tone beeps )
Carla: Peter, are you there?
Is Reese there with you?
Peter...
Peter, what are you doing?
Reese is supposed to be here tonight.
Peter...
If you're there, please pick up.
SO, WE MISSED THE BOAT.
OH, WELL, CRUISES ARE OVERRATED ANYWAY.
( chuckles )
SHALL WE?
SO, ABOUT WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON...
SEE, THE THING IS
I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE WHAT HAS BEEN GOING ON.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
LOOK, PETER AND I... JUMPED INTO SOMETHING RATHER QUICKLY
AND WHEN IT WASN'T WORKING, WE BOTH... JUMPED OUT.
IS THAT STILL UNRESOLVED?
NO-NO, NO, IT IS.
UH...
THE THING IS
YOU AND I HAVE BEEN SEEING A LOT OF EACH OTHER
AND IT'S, UH...
IT'S BEEN GREAT...
BUT, UH, IT'S NOT ANYTHING THAT I WAS LOOKING FOR
AND IT'S CAUGHT ME OFF BALANCE, RATHER
WHICH I'M NOT USED TO.
IT MAKES ME...
RATHER NERVOUS.
ELIZABETH, I DON'T...
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN...
BUT I DO KNOW HOW I FEEL...
AND I FEEL LIKE...
I FOUND SOMETHING...
AMAZING...
AND I WANT TO BE HERE.
I WANT TO GET TO KNOW YOU...
AND NOT BE SCARED.
I WOULD HATE TO MISS ANOTHER BOAT.
MMM.
