PREVIOUSLY ON E.R.:
THAT WAS A GREAT SAVE.
ACTUALLY, I MEANT BEING YOUR FULL-TIME P.A.
GREAT. I'D LOVE THAT.
THIS IS MORE OF A FORMALITY THAN ANYTHING ELSE.
MAYBE FOR YOU, BUT YOU'RE THE ONLY INTERN I HAVE.
I ADMIRE YOUR FORTITUDE.
I COULDN'T HANDLE TAKING ORDERS FROM A WEASEL LIKE DALE.
YOUR PRESENTATION WAS EVERYTHING WE EXPECTED.
THIS IS RIDICULOUS, LUCY.
EVERYONE THINKS YOU CAN.
I'M GOING TO TALK TO DR. CARTER.
I HAVEN'T STARTED AN I.V. I DON'T KNOW HOW.
I NEVER HAVE.
IF YOU EVER LIE TO ME AGAIN
YOU CAN LOOK FOR ANOTHER ROTATION.
AAH! SORRY.
SHE'S IN ACTIVE LABOR.
WATER BROKE IN THE RIG.
PROBABLY HAVE TO PLAY CATCH.
JERRY, SCARFING A LITTLE EARLY DINNER BACK THERE?
WHAT?
OH, NO. GOOD ONE, CHUNY.
( chuckles )
BABY, BABY, BABY.
THIS OUR MOTHER-TO-BE?
GOOD GUESS. FIRST NAME'S COCO.
NO LAST NAME, NO ADDRESS.
COLLAPSED IN A CROSSWALK.
WALK, DON'T WALK, DON'T TALK.
HER VITALS ARE STABLE.
OOH, I CAN FEEL THE HEAD.
STARTED A LINE. WE TOOK A PEEK DOWN SOUTH
AND SHE'S NOT CROWNING.
CROWN ME, I'M THE QUEEN, AND THE PRINCE IS COMING.
* COMING 'ROUND THE MOUNTAIN... *
WHEN'S YOUR DUE DATE, COCO?
I DON'T LIKE DATES. TOO SWEET. OH!
BIG ONE. BIG PAIN.
OH... OH.
HAVE YOU DELIVERED A BABY BEFORE?
NO DELIVERY.
LET'S GO TO CURTAIN AREA THREE.
B.O.A. KIT, FETAL MONITOR.
BABY WARMER. TAKE IT OUT!
HEY, JERRY, PAGE O.B. FOR ME.
YOU GOT IT. DUDE, THE EAGLE HAS LANDED.
OH, LYDIA, I GUESS YOU DIDN'T GET MY MEMO.
THE P.M. SHIFT IS NOT WEARING COSTUMES THIS YEAR.
IT SCARES THE PATIENTS.
A LOT OF THINGS HAVE BEEN SAID OVER THE YEARS
ABOUT THIS SET OF GAMS, BUT "SCARY" ISN'T ONE OF THEM.
WELL, YOU KNOW, IT ALSO ISN'T VERY PROFESSIONAL
SO IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND CHANGING...
I ACTUALLY GOT SOME OF THESE LITTLE JACK-O-LANTERN PINS
FOR THOSE WHO WANT TO SIGNIFY THE HOLIDAY.
FUN.
I'M GLAD MY NO-COSTUME MEMO MADE IT TO SOME PEOPLE.
THIS IS MY COSTUME.
I'M DRESSED AS A TOTAL STIFF.
SO... I GUESS I CAN MAKE AN EXCEPTION.
FOUR-YEAR-OLD CHILD WITH SEVERE PUNCTURE WOUNDS TO THE NECK.
WHY ISN'T THIS KID IN THE TRAUMA ROOM?
YOU SAID YOU WANTED TO SEE ALL THE CHILDREN IN PEDES...
I WANT AN INTUBATION TRAY NOW, ALL RIGHT?
AND I WANT FOUR UNITS OF YOUR BLOOD.
( laughs )
OH, COME ON. THIS IS FUNNY.
I JUST DIDN'T THINK IT WAS APPROPRIATE, THAT'S ALL.
BUT PUTTING SURGILUBE ALL OVER EVERY PHONE IN THE E.R., THAT'S OKAY?
BUT I WASN'T IN CHARGE OF THE WHOLE E.R.
I AM IN CHARGE OF THE PEDES E.R.
WELL, THE JOKE WAS ON YOU, DOUG, NOT ON THE PEDES E.R.
BUT THAT SEEMS TO BE ONE AND THE SAME THESE DAYS.
WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?
THE MEMO I GOT IN MY BOX THIS MORNING--
I THOUGHT IT WAS YOUR HALLOWEEN PRANK.
WHAT'S WRONG WITH THIS? WHAT?
DOUG, "ALL PEDIATRIC PATIENTS
"MUST BE SEEN BY DR. ROSS PRIOR TO DISCHARGE.
DR. ROSS WILL CONDUCT A DAILY REVIEW ON ALL PEDIATRIC PATIENTS."
RIGHT. WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT?
MEANS YOU HAVE TO SIGN OFF ON KERRY WEAVER'S CHARTS.
YEAH, AND MARK.
YEAH, SO YOU'RE PSYCHED.
WELL, IT'S TIME FOR A CHANGE, THAT'S ALL.
YEAH, KIND OF LIKE ME.
I WOKE UP THIS MORNING, I WAS A TRANSYLVANIAN BAT.
ALL RIGHT, ENOUGH, OKAY?
GOOD LUCK.
CAROL, COULD YOU COME IN HERE?
( woman moaning )
WHAT'S UP?
COCO HERE CLAIMS TO BE NINE MONTHS' PREGNANT.
TRY FOR FETAL HEART TONES.
I COULDN'T FIND THEM.
FIND THEM.
DON'T LOSE THEM.
LOOK IN THE... LOOK IN THE LOST AND FOUND.
LOOK IN THE...
CERVIX ISN'T DILATED.
NO ADNEXAL MASSES.
SHE SURE LOOKS PREGNANT.
I'M HAVING A BABY.
ALL I CAN APPRECIATE
IS A NORMAL UTERUS AND ABOUT TWO LITERS OF URINE
IN HER BLADDER.
COCO, WE'RE GOING TO GIVE YOU
A BEDPAN.
CAN YOU TRY AND RELAX AND RELIEVE YOURSELF?
SHALLOW BREATH.
NATURE'S WAY.
WANT ME TO GET A FOLEY?
YEAH. AND A URINE TOX SCREEN.
CALL PSYCH WHILE YOU'RE AT IT.
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE GOING TO WEAR THAT ALL DAY.
IT HAS GOTTEN ITCHY, BUT IT'S MY FIRST HALLOWEEN IN THE STATES.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN? YOU WERE HERE LAST YEAR.
YEAH, BUT I WAS STUCK IN THE O.R. ALL NIGHT
SO NO TRICK-OR-TREATING, APPLE BOBBING, HAYRIDES...
HAYRIDES?
YEAH, ISN'T THAT HOW YOU CELEBRATE HALLOWEEN--
RIDING IN A CART FULL OF HAY
WITH YOUR SWEETIE UNDER THE STARS?
ELIZABETH, THERE ARE NO HAY CARTS IN CHICAGO.
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.
IT'S ALL ABOUT CELEBRATING THE NIGHT.
CELEBRATING WHAT, HUH?
KIDS ROTTING THEIR TEETH OUT, GETTING SICK TO THEIR STOMACH
PEOPLE WEARING THESE STUPID...
I HAVE A THING AGAINST COSTUMES, YOU KNOW?
THERE MUST'VE BEEN SOMEONE YOU WANTED TO BE.
I'M A DOCTOR. THAT'S WHO I WANTED TO BE.
YES, BUT AS A CHILD.
YOU MUST'VE WANTED TO BE A SPACEMAN OR A FOOTBALLER.
NOPE.
YOU REALLY ARE EXTRAORDINARY, PETER.
HOW ABOUT A KNIGHT IN SHINING ARMOR?
NO. A COWBOY.
NO. LISTEN, IF YOU WANT TO CELEBRATE
WHY DON'T WE GO TO DEMPSEY'S?
THEY GOT GREAT FOOD AND, UH, WHAT IS THAT?
SWING DANCING.
ELIZABETH, THERE YOU ARE.
MY SIGMOID VOLVULUS IS RED-LINED TO THE O.R.
AND THE PRE-OP LABS AREN'T ON THE CHART.
I JUST CHECKED THE COMPUTER.
EVERYTHING'S BACK EXCEPT THE ELECTROLYTES.
CHECKING THE COMPUTER ISN'T GOOD ENOUGH.
I JUST CALLED THE LAB AND THE SPECIMEN WAS HEMOLYZED.
I'LL CALL PHLEBOTOMY.
TAKES TOO LONG.
I WANT YOU TO REDRAW YOURSELF
AND HAND-CARRY IT TO THE LAB.
YES, SIR.
EXCUSE ME.
JUST A MINUTE.
YEAH?
I'M LOOKING FOR DR. GREENE.
OH, DAMN!
I NEEDED TO SAVE THAT.
SO I CAN FIND DR. GREENE WHERE?
YEAH, YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO WAIT IN CHAIRS.
OKEYDOKE.
JERRY, HAS THE SYSTEMS GUY TAKEN A LOOK AT THIS YET?
HE LOOKED, BUT HE DIDN'T TOUCH.
THE WORK ORDER WASN'T CO-SIGNED.
LILY, WHAT DO YOU GOT THERE?
THIS WAS JUST SITTING OUT IN THE AMBULANCE BAY.
LOOK, THERE'S ALL KINDS OF STUFF IN THIS BAG, TOO.
FOUR BY FOURS, STERI-STRIPS, I.V. TUBING.
YEAH, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'LL TAKE CARE OF THIS.
REALLY? YOU SURE?
YEAH. NO WORRIES.
THANKS. SURE.
HEY, JERRY.
HI.
SO YOU CAN'T BLOW IT OFF?
OH, DON'T GET ME WRONG.
I WOULD LOVE TO ATTEND YOUR SHINDIG
BUT THIS IS A TEAMSTER PARTY.
AH, YOUR EYES ARE AGLOW WITH THE FIRE OF DISABILITY POLICIES.
WELL, IT'S RARE THAT A POLICY UNDERWRITER
HAS AN OPPORTUNITY AT A WHOLE ROOM
FULL OF DRUNKEN MANUAL LABORERS.
SOUNDS BETTER THAN CHAPERONING A DORM PARTY.
EVERYBODY KNOWS THE BEST PART OF A BAD PARTY IS SNEAKING OUT
PREFERABLY NOT ALONE.
SO I MIGHT SEE YOU LATER.
OR I'LL MAKE IT UP TO YOU.
DR. CARTER, HI.
UM, I GOT THE ELBOW FILMS BACK ON...
LUCY, CAN YOU GIVE US A SECOND, PLEASE?
SURE.
WHAT? WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?
I GOT THE ELBOW FILMS BACK ON MR. CAHAN
AND THE C.B.C. AND CHEM PANEL ON HIS NICOLORA.
THANKS. LOOKS GOOD.
YEAH, I WAS THINKING ABOUT YOU AT DINNER
AND I REALIZED THAT I LEFT THIS IN MY CAR.
IS THAT FOR THE PARTY?
NO. I THINK THAT YOU SHOULD START PRACTICING YOUR I.V.s.
I HAVE BEEN PRACTICING.
THEN THIS SHOULD BE OLD HAT FOR YOU.
DR. CARTER, GOOD. HEY...
THOSE SUCKERS ARE HEAVY.
WHAT ARE THESE?
TOMORROW'S DEPARTMENTAL CONFERENCE:
"THE ACUTE ABDOMEN IN THE ELDERLY."
I PULLED AN ISCHEMIC BOWEL YOU HAD A FEW MONTHS AGO.
I WAS HOPING THAT YOU COULD PRESENT.
I'VE NEVER DONE THAT.
WELL, IT'S GREAT EXPERIENCE
IF YOU'RE SERIOUS ABOUT BECOMING CHIEF RESIDENT.
OH, I'M SERIOUS.
OKAY. I LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR PRESENTATION.
CHIEF RESIDENT. PRETTY COOL.
YEAH, PRETTY COOL.
INCOMING.
I GOT IT.
WHAT DO WE GOT? JOE CHATTAROWSKI, 40.
WAS DRINKING A QUART OF VODKA IN FRONT OF LUCKY LIQUOR.
CALLED 911 WHEN HE WAS TOO DRUNK TO WALK.
I NEED HELP, DOC. EXAM TWO.
DO YOU DRINK EVERY DAY, MR. CHATTAROWSKI?
YEAH. BUT I WANT TO QUIT.
ARE YOU SERIOUS?
I'M DEAD SERIOUS.
YOU'RE NOT JUST LOOKING
FOR A PLACE TO SLEEP IT OFF?
ON MY MOTHER'S EYES.
CAN YOU ADMIT ME FOR DETOX, PLEASE?
DR. CARTER?
I THINK MISS KNIGHT CAN HELP YOU WITH THAT.
SEE IF YOU CAN FIND HIM A DETOX BED.
THEN YOU CAN PRACTICE ON THAT TEACHING ARM.
ALL RIGHT, LET'S TRANSFER HIM.
READY? ONE, TWO, THREE.
AVERAGE DAILY CENSUS IS 150.
WE SEE 275 A DAY AT BELLEVUE.
IMPRESSIVE.
WE'RE THE SECOND-LARGEST EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT IN THE WORLD.
I'LL SHOW YOU THE TRAUMA ROOMS.
PSST, HEY, JERRY.
HMM. WHO'S THAT?
WITH DR. GREENE? YEAH.
THAT IS DR. LITVAK FROM NEW YORK.
DAN LITVAK?
YEAH. I THINK HE'S HERE INTERVIEWING TO BE E.R. CHIEF.
OH, MY GOD.
DAN LITVAK-- HE'S NATIONAL CHAIR OF THE ACEP PANEL
FOR PRACTICE GUIDELINES.
LEAD ARTICLE IN LAST MONTH'S ANNALS.
WELL, THAT'S GOOD, RIGHT?
HEY, BUDDY. I'M DR. ROSS. WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
JARED.
PRURITIC RASH RIGHT AFTER PUTTING ON HIS HALLOWEEN MAKEUP.
HE'S COVERED WITH HIVES.
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT HIM.
HAS HE HAD HIVES BEFORE?
NO.
ALL RIGHT.
ANY SWELLING IN YOUR MOUTH?
ARE YOU HAVING TROUBLE BREATHING?
MY TONGUE FEELS BIG. OKAY.
B.P.'s 90/60, PULSE 72.
OKAY, LET'S GIVE HIM .2 OF SUB Q EPI, BENADRYL 25 I.V.
IS HE GOING TO BE OKAY?
HE HAS A BAD ALLERGIC REACTION.
WE NEED TO TREAT HIM WITH I.V. MEDICATION
AND JUST WATCH HIM FOR A FEW HOURS.
CAN I STILL GO TRICK-OR-TREATING?
I DON'T THINK SO, SWEETIE
BUT WE CAN FIND YOU SOME FUN STUFF
TO DO AROUND HERE.
FUN STUFF AROUND HERE SUCKS.
WHAT DID YOU DO WITH MY BABY?
WHAT DID YOU...?
WHERE'S MY BABY?
SHOULD I ASK?
2,200cc's OUT SO FAR. BELLY'S FLAT.
OH, I LOST MY BABY.
HALDOL, FIVE MILLIGRAMS I.M.
Kerry: MARK, I'M LOOKING FOR YOUR CHART REVIEWS
ON LAST MONTH'S UNSCHEDULED RETURNS.
UH, YEAH, I PUT THEM IN YOUR BOX.
KERRY, THIS IS DR. DAN LITVAK.
THIS IS DR. KERRY WEAVER, OUR INTERIM CHIEF.
NICE TO MEET YOU.
WHERE YOU FROM, DR. LITVAK?
NEW YORK, BELLEVUE.
JUST HERE TO GET A FEW TIPS?
NO. I JUST HAD MY SECOND INTERVIEW FOR THE CHIEF POSITION.
DR. GREENE IS BEING KIND ENOUGH TO SHOW ME AROUND.
SECOND INTERVIEW.
YEAH, THEY WANTED TO, UH... MEET WITH DR. LITVAK
ONE MORE TIME BEFORE TONIGHT'S VOTE.
YEAH, I THOUGHT THE VOTE WASN'T UNTIL NEXT WEDNESDAY.
I HAVE TO HOP A PLANE TO A CONFERENCE IN BERMUDA TONIGHT.
THEY THOUGHT IT WOULD BE BEST
IF I COULD KNOW BEFOREHAND.
WELL, THAT'S GREAT.
THE SOONER THE BETTER, HUH?
I GUESS I'LL JUST CHECK MY MAILBOX.
THAT'S THE COMPETITION, HUH?
DID YOU HAVE ANY LUCK WITH THAT DETOX BED?
NO ONE CALLED ME BACK YET.
GOT A FLASH... AND I AM IN.
YES, YOU ARE.
I THINK I'M READY FOR THE REAL THING NOW.
WELL, LET'S FIND OUT.
I'LL TALK YOU THROUGH MR. CHATTAROWSKI.
OKAY.
MAKE SURE WE DON'T REPEAT OUR LAST I.V. FIASCO.
THAT DEFINITELY WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN.
NO. IT WAS MY FAULT AS MUCH AS IT WAS YOURS.
OH, I WOULDN'T EXACTLY SAY THAT.
WELL, I SHOULD'VE SUPERVISED YOU A LITTLE BIT MORE CLOSELY.
SHOULD NEVER HAVE LET YOU GET TO THE PLACE THAT YOU DID.
FROM NOW ON, WE'LL JUST TAKE IT
ONE STEP AT A TIME.
CARTER, YOUR DRUNK ELOPED.
CHATTAROWSKI?
DOES THAT MEAN HE LEFT?
YEP.
DOES ANYONE ELSE NEED AN I.V.?
I'VE GOT IT.
YOU WANTED TO BE A SUPERHERO--
TIGHTS, CAPE...
( laughs )
YEAH, WRONG.
WELL, THERE WAS SOMEONE, WASN'T THERE?
HEY, LOOK WHO'S HERE.
BYE-BYE, CUTIE PIE.
HEY...
HEY, LITTLE BEE.
GOSH, HE'S GETTING SO BIG.
HE'S EATING ME OUT OF HOUSE AND HOME.
I DIDN'T EXPECT YOU.
WE JUST LEFT WALT AND JACKIE'S.
THE ANNUAL BLOWOUT?
I TOLD WALT
HE SHOULD PUT ON ONE OF HIS SUPER DUPER FLY OUTFITS
HE USED TO WEAR IN THE '70s...
NAH, DON'T ENCOURAGE HIM.
THAT BROTHER STILL THINKS
POLYESTER'S GOING TO MAKE A COMEBACK.
SPEAKING OF COSTUMES
DO YOU HAVE ANY FILM LEFT IN THAT CAMERA?
YES. WE SHOULD HAVE HIM WITH HIS DADDY.
ABSOLUTELY.
WOULD YOU DO THE HONORS?
YEAH, SURE.
OKAY.
READY?
FEELING ANY BETTER?
I'M ALL RIGHT... I GUESS.
WHAT DID YOU...?
WHAT DID YOU GIVE ME?
UH, HALDOL...
TO CALM YOU DOWN.
I CAN'T TAKE THAT.
IT'S NOT GOOD FOR MY BABY.
COCO, YOU DON'T HAVE A BABY.
BUT I WILL, REALLY.
I'M IN MY FIRST TRIMESTER.
COCO... YOU'RE NOT PREGNANT.
YOU WERE JUST RETAINING URINE.
CAROL...
YOU DID DO A PREGNANCY TEST, DIDN'T YOU?
STARTING TO WISH I HAD.
UM, I'M-I'M SCHIZOPHRENIC
AND I HAD BEEN TAKING RESPIRADONE
BUT WHEN I FOUND OUT I WAS PREGNANT
( voice breaking ): I WENT OFF THE MEDICATION SO THAT THE BABY WOULD BE OKAY.
WHAT WILL THE HALDOL DO TO THE BABY?
IF, IN FACT, YOU ARE PREGNANT
THERE ARE REPORTS OF LIMB MALFORMATION.
OH, MY GOD.
I'M SO SORRY, BABY.
ALL RIGHT. LOOKS LIKE THE HEART IS STILL EMPTY.
LET'S GET TWO MORE UNITS.
CHEST TUBE'S GUSHING. IT'S OVER TWO LITERS.
COULD BE A HILAR INJURY. ALL RIGHT, PEOPLE.
LET'S SET UP FOR A RIGHT-SIDED THORACOTOMY. LET'S MOVE.
TEN BLADE. WE'LL DO A CLAMSHELL.
MALIK, CALL THE BLOOD BANK. WE NEED MORE O-NEG
AND TYPE SPECIFIC WHEN IT'S READY.
OKAY. RIB SPREADER. PETER, CUT ACROSS THE STERNUM.
ALL RIGHT. I NEED A LEBSHKE KNIFE.
A WHAT?
A LEBSHKE AND A MALLET. LET'S MOVE!
Weaver: LOOK. TOP DRAWER BY THE SINK.
WHAT YOU REALLY NEED IS A STERNAL SAW.
A STERNAL SAW IS A TOOL FOR THE O.R., NOT THE E.R.
THE RIGHT CHEST IS FULL OF BLOOD.
VASCULAR CLAMP. MORE SUCTION.
Benton: LOCATE THE SOURCE?
AHH.
MOVE YOUR HAND, MOVE YOUR HAND.
HEART'S STILL EMPTY.
FOUR UNITS IN.
HE'S LOSING IT FASTER THAN WE CAN PUT IT IN.
DAMN!
TYPE SPECIFIC'S HERE.
HANG TWO-- RAPID INFUSER.
I'M ALMOST THERE.
LOOKS LIKE RIGHT ATRIUM.
O-VICRYL NOW. LET'S MOVE.
THERE WERE FASTER WAYS TO DO THAT.
I AM PREGNANT.
THE TEST CONFIRMED IT.
WE DON'T KNOW IF THE HALDOL AFFECTED THE FETUS.
WE'RE GOING TO MONITOR THE PREGNANCY WITH ULTRASOUND.
MAYBE I SHOULDN'T HAVE A BABY.
BECAUSE OF THE HALDOL?
I DIDN'T EVEN TELL MY MOM, YOU KNOW.
SHE WAS SO PROUD
THAT I WAS IN THE HALFWAY HOUSE.
I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE OKAY.
I THOUGHT I COULD GO OFF MY MEDS, BUT I...
CAN'T, CAN I?
YOU'LL PROBABLY HAVE MORE INCIDENTS LIKE THIS ONE.
I SHOULDN'T GO THROUGH WITH THIS.
YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH A LOT IN A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME.
MAYBE YOU SHOULD JUST WAIT.
I SHOULDN'T DO THIS.
( softly ): I SHOULDN'T DO THIS.
I SHOULDN'T DO THIS.
SO YOU THINK SHE'LL TERMINATE HER PREGNANCY?
THAT'S THE IMPRESSION I GOT.
PROBABLY BE THE BEST FOR HER AND FOR YOU.
YEAH. GETS ME OFF THE HOOK.
YOU WANT TO HAVE A DRINK LATER? DECOMPRESS?
I WOULD, BUT JEN'S BACK IN TOWN
AND WE HAVE TO HAVE ONE OF OUR TALKS.
OH. SOUNDS LIKE IT'S NOT YOUR DAY, MARK.
YOU CAN TAKE OFF NOW IF YOU WANT, LUCY.
WE'RE PRETTY CAUGHT UP AROUND HERE.
WHAT ABOUT THE PEDES E.R.?
IT'S STANDING ROOM ONLY IN THERE.
DOUG ROSS IS IN A GROOVE, HUH?
NO. YOU'D PROBABLY JUST SLOW HIM DOWN.
RIGHT. WELL, THAT GIVES ME MORE TIME
TO GET READY FOR THE PARTY.
I'M SORRY. I DIDN'T MEAN TO UPSET THE...
FOUND THIS GUY RIGHT BACK CHILLIN'
WITH A BOTTLE OF NIGHT TRAIN IN FRONT OF LUCKY'S.
YOU ALL NEED A REVOLVING DOOR ON YOUR EXAM ROOMS.
WELL, WELL, WELL. LONG TIME NO SEE, MR. CHATTAROWSKI.
SO, YOU KNOW THIS GUY?
YEAH. HAD HIM IN EARLIER.
HE CAME IN LOOKING TO BE DETOXED
AND THEN ELOPED BEFORE WE COULD GET THE BLOOD WORK DONE.
WELL, NEXT TIME, I'M JUST CALLING THE COPS.
WE CAN TAKE HIM FROM HERE, OKAY? YOU'RE OFF, ANYWAY.
THANKS.
CURTAIN AREA TWO.
MR. CHATTAROWSKI, I'M DR. GREENE.
THIS IS NURSE HATHAWAY.
WE'D LIKE TO WELCOME YOU BACK.
I KNOW I SCREWED UP, DOC.
I'M A SCREWUP BY NATURE.
I WANT TO MAKE A CLEAN START.
I REALLY DO.
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE A CLEAN START, MR. CHATTAROWSKI
WITH A BOTTLE OF BOOZE IN YOUR HAND.
THAT WAS MY LAST DRINK.
I'M NOT GOING TO POISON MYSELF
NO MORE, I PROMISE.
OTHER THAN BLOODSHOT, THE EYES LOOK OKAY.
LEAN FORWARD.
I'M GOING TO GET CLEAN AND SOBER.
YOU GOT TO BE QUIET SO I CAN HEAR YOUR LUNGS.
GET A JOB AND A HOUSE AND A PICKET FENCE...
SHH, SHH, SHH! SHH, SHH.
B.P.'s 130 PALP.
MR. CHATTAROWSKI
I'M GOING TO TRY AND GET YOU A DETOX BED
BUT YOU HAVE TO PROMISE ME YOU'LL STAY.
I PROMISE.
I REALLY DO.
I'M GOING TO GET CLEAN AND SOBER.
OKAY. IF YOU COULD JUST SCOOT OVER TO THIS BED.
YOU THINK HE'LL STAY?
WELL, I WAS A CYNIC WITH MS. COCO
AND WE SAW HOW THAT WORKED OUT
SO KARMICALLY, I HAVE TO BELIEVE THIS GUY.
OKAY, DR. KARMA, BUT IF YOU DON'T MIND
I'M GOING TO LOCK UP HIS CLOTHES SO IT MAKES IT
A LITTLE HARDER FOR HIM TO ESCAPE THIS TIME.
GOOD IDEA.
( screaming )
AMANDA, YOU HAVE TO STAY STILL FOR ME.
IT WILL ONLY HURT FOR A SECOND.
NO, DADDY!
I'LL GIVE YOU SOME STICKERS WHEN SHE'S DONE.
I DON'T WANT STICKERS, DADDY.
IS THIS REALLY NECESSARY?
UNFORTUNATELY, IT IS. WE HAVE TO TAKE BLOOD
TO DO THE TEST.
DADDY, I WANT TO GO HOME.
IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT IN HERE?
DOCTOR, MY LITTLE GIRL'S AFRAID OF NEEDLES.
IS THERE A WAY TO TEST HER WITHOUT ALL THIS?
AS A MATTER OF FACT, THERE IS.
WHAT DO WE GOT?
BARBIE KLIGMAN, 11-YEAR-OLD M.V.A.
BACKSEAT PASSENGER WITH A LAP BELT.
COMPLAINS OF ABDOMINAL PAIN.
B.P. 105/70, PULSE 95.
LET'S GET A C.B.C., CHEM 20
TYPE AND HOLD, AND DIP A URINE.
BARBIE, DOES YOUR NECK HURT?
NO, JUST MY STOMACH.
PULSE OX IS 98 ON ROOM AIR.
CHEST IS CLEAR.
DALE OKAY WITH YOU BEING HERE?
SHOULDN'T BE A PROBLEM.
PUPILS ARE FIVE MILLIMETERS
AND REACT TO LIGHT.
IS SHE GOING TO BE OKAY?
WE'RE TAKING CARE OF HER.
Jeanie: PRETTY GOOD SEAT BELT CONTUSION.
YEAH.
BOWEL SOUNDS ARE ABSENT.
HEMOGLOBIN'S 14.1.
OKAY. LISTEN, DOES THIS HURT?
OW!
WHAT'S GOING ON?
SHE HAS A SEAT BELT BRUISE WHICH CAN INDICATE
SMALL BOWEL INJURY.
WE'LL DO A CAT SCAN.
EVEN IF IT'S NEGATIVE
SHE MAY NEED EXPLORATORY SURGERY.
OH, MY GOD.
LOOK, YOU'LL BE OKAY, BARBIE.
MOMMY AND DADDY WILL BE HERE FOR YOU, OKAY?
THAT'S ALL IT TAKES?
YEAH. THE MACHINE DELIVERS LIDOCAINE
TO THE SKIN BY IONOPHORESIS
SO NO NEEDLES.
HEY.
DR. WEAVER, WE MEET AGAIN.
I THOUGHT YOU HAD A PLANE TO CATCH.
FLIGHT DELAYED. I FIGURE HANGING OUT HERE
BEATS WATERED-DOWN AIRPORT COCKTAILS.
MIND IF I PLAY FLY ON THE WALL?
IT'S DR. ROSS' PEDES ROOM.
SURE. HANG OUT.
HERE WE GO, SWEETHEART.
HOW ARE YOU, AMANDA?
OKAY.
YOU'RE OKAY?
NOW, THIS PAD PUTS YOUR SKIN TO SLEEP, ALL RIGHT?
SO YOU'RE NOT GOING TO FEEL ANYTHING.
CLOSE YOUR EYES, SWEETHEART.
DO YOU FEEL ANYTHING?
NO.
OKAY.
Weaver: IT'S AMAZING.
WE TRIED NUMBING IT WITH A CREAM BUT IT TAKES AN HOUR.
THIS IS GREAT, DOUG.
IT REALLY IS. WHAT'S IT CALLED AGAIN?
"NUMBY."
WE DID THE PHASE THREE CLINICAL TRIALS AT BELLEVUE.
WE'VE BEEN USING IT FOR OVER A YEAR NOW.
( clears throat )
HEY, DR. CARTER.
NICE COSTUME.
I FEEL KIND OF LAME.
NOBODY ELSE DRESSED UP.
WELL, IT'S EARLY YET. PEOPLE MAY STILL SHOW.
THE FLYER SAID 8:00.
YOU GOT TO REMEMBER THESE ARE MED STUDENTS.
THEY'RE BUSY.
DO YOU WANT SOME PUNCH?
UH, LATER.
I GOT TO GO PULL ARTICLES AT THE LIBRARY
FOR THIS CONFERENCE TOMORROW
THAT IS, IF YOU THINK THIS PARTY CAN CHAPERONE ITSELF.
I'LL LOOK AFTER THINGS.
YEAH. WHY DON'T YOU DO THAT?
HOW OLD IS THIS GIRL?
Benton: ELEVEN.
WHAT'S WITH THE GLITTER ON HER FACE?
SHE'S SUPPOSED TO BE A PRINCESS.
DALE, GET A CLAMP ON THAT.
BABCOCK, PLEASE.
OKAY. THERE'S A LITTLE BLEEDING AROUND THE DUODENUM.
LET'S KOCHERIZE AND EXPLORE THE RETROPERITONEUM.
BOVIE.
WHAT DO YOU HAVE PLANNED FOR HALLOWEEN?
NOTHING SPECIAL.
I KNOW A MOTEL ON ROUTE 22; JUNGLE THEME ROOMS.
METZ.
ROOM 14. HANGING VINES-- YOU TARZAN, SHE JANE
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
NO. I THINK WE'LL JUST STAY IN TOWN.
ALL RIGHT. THE PANCREAS LOOKS GOOD.
NO RENAL INJURIES HERE.
HOLD ON. THERE'S AN INFRARENAL MASS.
LUMBAR NODE?
NO. IT DOESN'T FEEL RIGHT.
IT'S... IT'S TOO RUBBERY.
THERE'S ONE ON THIS SIDE, TOO.
COULD BE LYMPHOMA.
LET'S SEND FOR A BIOPSY.
NUMBER 15.
EVERYTHING OKAY ON THE WARDS, ELIZABETH?
YES. WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO SCRUB IN?
YEAH. WE COULD USE YOUR HELP.
WONDERFUL.
WE JUST BIOPSIED AN ABNORMAL
LYMPH NODE ON BARBIE HERE.
WHY DON'T YOU RUN THIS SPECIMEN DOWN TO PATHOLOGY
AND WAIT ON THE FROZEN SECTION RESULTS.
OUR PATIENTS ARE STACKED TO THE RAFTERS.
WE'RE GETTING TO THEM.
YOU NEED TO LET THE MAIN E.R. HANDLE THE OVERFLOW.
I HAVE TO SEE THESE KIDS. YOU SAW WHAT HAPPENED WITH KERRY.
IT'S A BUSY NIGHT, DOUG.
ONE DOCTOR CAN'T SEE THEM ALL BY HIMSELF.
( exhaling ): ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
SEND THE OVERFLOW TO THE MAIN E.R., BUT SEND ME THE KIDS' CHARTS.
OF COURSE.
AND THE SICKEST ONES, SEND THEM TO ME.
I WOULDN'T DO IT ANY OTHER WAY.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING BACK SO EARLY?
ME AND ARIEL, WE WERE SICK OF TRICK-OR-TREATING
AND MOM'S RUNNING LATE.
WHAT ARE YOU WATCHING?
FAMILY LOVE TRIANGLES.
EDUCATIONAL TV, HUH?
YEAH. MOM SAYS
THAT WHEN WE MOVE TO ST. LOUIS
SHE'S ONLY GOING TO LET ME WATCH
AN HOUR OF TELEVISION A DAY.
WHEN YOU MOVE TO ST. LOUIS?
YOU DIDN'T KNOW?
I THINK THAT'S WHY
MOM WANTED TO SEE YOU.
SO IT'S A DONE DEAL THEN?
MY ROOM'S GOING TO BE TWICE AS BIG
AND THERE'S A PARK ACROSS THE STREET FOR THE DOGS.
IT SOUNDS NICE.
IT'S REALLY PRETTY THERE.
PLEASE DON'T TELL HER I TOLD YOU, OKAY?
HEY, MY LIPS ARE SEALED.
Dale: PREPARE TRANSVERSELY WITH RUNNING VICRYL.
THREE-OH.
GENTLEMEN, I HAVE THE RESULTS OF YOUR BIOPSY.
CARE TO GUESS WHAT WE SAW UNDER THE MICROSCOPE?
GOT TO BE HODGKIN'S.
NO.
METASTATIC ADENO?
WRONG AGAIN.
SEMINIFEROUS TUBULES.
WHAT?
YOU'RE KIDDING?
YOU BIOPSIED TWO TESTICLES.
IT SEEMS THAT BARBIE IS A BOY.
WHO KNEW THERE WERE SO MANY TEXTS ON THE BOWELS?
YEAH. THIS IS JUST WHAT I COULD GET MY HANDS ON.
I SUPPOSE WITH ALL THIS INTENSE INTEREST...
( raucous party sounds )
MEANS OUR BOWELS ARE IN GOOD HANDS FOR MANY YEARS TO COME.
THAT'S A NICE THOUGHT.
HEY, SOUNDS LIKE THE PARTY'S UP AND RUNNING.
Man: PARTY!
YEAH!
( hooting and hollering )
( whooping and laughing )
DR. CARTER.
RIGHT THERE.
NICE AIM, DUDE.
YOU ALMOST PUT OUT THE FIRE WITH THAT ONE.
HEY, DR. CARTER!
( music stops )
( all groaning )
OKAY, KIDS, PARTY'S OVER.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO HOME
BUT YOU CAN'T STAY HERE.
WHAT'S UP? WERE WE TOO LOUD?
NO, THE FURNITURE WAS TOO ON FIRE.
REALLY? I'M SORRY.
I'LL BE IN MY ROOM, STUDYING.
HAPPY HALLOWEEN.
SHE DID IT TO ME AGAIN.
SHE'S IN ESCROW
AND I HAD TO HEAR ABOUT IT FROM RACHEL.
MAYBE SHE WAS GOING TO TELL YOU TONIGHT.
MAYBE. OR MAYBE SHE WAS JUST GOING
TO SEND ME A POSTCARD FROM ST. LOUIS.
YOU REALLY HAD A GOOD TIME WITH RACHEL, DIDN'T YOU?
YEAH. YEAH, I DID.
HOW'S CHATTAROWSKI'S DETOX SEARCH GOING?
THEY WERE ALL OUT OF BEDS IN FOUR EAST
BUT I STOOD MY GROUND
AND INSISTED THAT HE WAS A GOOD DETOX CANDIDATE
AND FINALLY, THEY CAVED IN
AND GAVE HIM A PLACE ON FOUR WEST.
WOW. YOU MUST OWE THEM SOME FAVORS.
A COUPLE, BUT IT WAS WORTH IT.
WELL, YOU TRIED, YOU KNOW?
Dale: WHEN WE EXPLORED THE RETROPERITINEUM
WE DISCOVERED
TWO SMALL MASSES.
MASSES. WHAT KIND OF MASSES?
WE WERE CONCERNED, TOO
SO WE SENT DOWN A FROZEN SECTION OF THE BIOPSY
THAT REVEALED TESTICULAR TISSUE.
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
BARBIE HAS A CONDITION
CALLED TESTICULAR FEMINIZATION.
GENETICALLY, SHE'S A MALE
WITH X-Y CHROMOSOMES
BUT DURING DEVELOPMENT
THE FETAL TISSUE WAS RESISTANT TO TESTOSTERONE
AND THE EXTERNAL GENITALIA
DEVELOPED AS FEMALE.
THERE'S GOT TO BE A MISTAKE.
NO MISTAKE.
THE VAGINA'S NOTHING BUT A BLIND POUCH--
NO UTERUS NOR OVARIES.
SHE'LL NEED TO BE ON ESTROGEN REPLACEMENT THERAPY.
MY LITTLE GIRL HAS TESTICLES.
ACTUALLY, WE HAD TO REMOVE THEM
BECAUSE OF THE HIGH INCIDENCE OF MALIGNANT TRANSFORMATION.
I-I-I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
I... I CHANGED HER DIAPERS.
I KNOW EVERY INCH OF HER.
SHE'S A BOY?
THE GENETICS DON'T MATTER.
YOU'VE RAISED HER AS A GIRL.
BARBIE IS A GIRL.
IT'S WHAT SHE LOOKS LIKE.
IT'S HER IDENTITY.
NOTHING WILL CHANGE THAT.
BUT YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT SHE'LL NEVER MENSTRUATE
OR BEAR CHILDREN.
( stifled sob )
( sobbing softly )
OBVIOUSLY, THIS HAS COME AS A SHOCK.
YOU'LL NEED TIME TO ADJUST.
BARBIE'S RECOVERING.
WE'LL REFER YOU TO A GENETIC COUNSELOR.
THEY'LL HELP YOU DECIDE WHEN AND HOW TO TELL HER.
THANK YOU, DOCTOR.
NICE JOB.
THANK YOU.
OF COURSE, YOU FORGOT TO MENTION
THEY'LL HAVE TO CHANGE BARBIE'S NAME TO KEN.
AFTER THE DAY I'VE HAD, JUST LINE THEM UP.
WORD. THAT'S HOW YOU GOT TO DO IT, MAN.
WORK HARD, PLAY HARD.
I DESERVE TO PLAY HARD.
I HAD TO CHECK ALL THOSE STOOL SAMPLES
FOR FECAL LEUKOCYTES, DUDE.
YOU THINK THAT'S BAD?
MY RESIDENT HAD ME GIVE PHYSICAL EXAMS
TO THESE HOMELESS SHELTER GUYS.
ONE HAD MAGGOTS CRAWLING ALL OVER AN ABSCESS.
( groaning )
AT LEAST YOUR RESIDENTS ACKNOWLEDGE YOUR EXISTENCE.
MINE DON'T EVEN KNOW I'M HERE.
I GET MORE RESPECT FROM THIS RUBBER ARM.
( whooping and laughing )
WE MIGHT HAVE SAVED THIS GUY IF WE HAD THE SAW.
WE COULD HAVE CUT ACROSS THE STERNUM IN TWO SECONDS
INSTEAD OF CHISELING FOR CLOSE TO A MINUTE.
KERRY, THE GUY WAS DEAD.
ANOTHER FEW SECONDS WOULDN'T HAVE BROUGHT HIM BACK TO LIFE.
BUT IT WOULD'VE GIVEN HIM A CHANCE.
WE ARE NOT GOING TO WASTE TIME AND MONEY
TRAINING E.R. DOCS ON SURGICAL EQUIPMENT
THAT WILL GET USED ONCE A YEAR.
BUT IF WE HAD THE SAW
WE COULD GIVE MIDLINE THORACOTOMIES
FOR ALL PENETRATING CHEST TRAUMA WITH FULL ARREST.
BUT THAT IS NOT THE STANDARD OF CARE.
THE STANDARD OF CARE GIVES MISERABLE RESULTS.
IF THEY ARREST IN THE AMBULANCE, TEN PERCENT SURVIVE.
IF THEY ARREST IN THE E.R., 30% SURVIVE.
I THINK MIDLINE THORACOTOMY
GIVES US BETTER EXPOSURE TO REPAIR CARDIAC INJURIES.
KERRY, IF YOU'RE SO DAMNED INTERESTED IN THIS
WHY DON'T YOU DO A STUDY?
ALL RIGHT, I WILL.
GOOD. I KNOW EXACTLY THE GUY FROM SURGERY
TO COORDINATE WITH YOU. PETER?
KERRY AND I WERE JUST DISCUSSING A JOINT STUDY
BETWEEN THE E.R. AND SURGERY.
LATERAL VERSUS MIDLINE THORACOTOMY
FOR PENETRATING CHEST TRAUMA WITH FULL ARREST.
IS THIS BECAUSE OF THIS MORNING?
KERRY, WHY DON'T YOU DRAW UP A PROPOSAL, INCLUDING A BUDGET
AND HAVE IT ON MY DESK IN THE NEXT TWO WEEKS?
LISTEN, I DON'T THINK E.R. DOCS
SHOULD BE PLAYING AROUND WITH A STERNAL SAW.
NEITHER DO I.
WELL, THEN, WHY DID YOU SUPPORT HER?
I'M NOT. I'M LETTING HER SPIN HER WHEELS.
SHE'LL WRITE A PROPOSAL, AND IT WON'T MAKE IT
THROUGH THE HUMAN SUBJECTS COMMITTEE
IN ABOUT A MILLION YEARS.
M & M?
OH, NO, NO.
HEY. OH!
LISTEN, I MADE RESERVATIONS AT DEMPSEY'S FOR 10:00.
PETER, I DON'T KNOW.
I'M PRETTY SWAMPED.
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
IT'S HALLOWEEN.
BUT DEMPSEY'S ISN'T REALLY HALLOWEEN-Y.
YOU KNOW, IT'LL KEEP.
( sighing )
HEY, WALT, WHAT'S UP, MAN? IT'S ME.
LISTEN, I, UH, I NEED TO ASK YOU A FAVOR.
SEE THIS ONE?
THAT'S THE BLUE RIDER.
ALL RIGHT, THE "CUTE" COWBOY.
DAD!
RACH, DID I HEAR YOUR ORDER RIGHT?
YOU HATE RHUBARB AND WALNUTS.
I LIKE IT NOW.
DAD MAKES GOOD PIE.
HE ALWAYS DID.
JEN, YOU TRYING TO BUTTER ME UP?
NO, I JUST REMEMBER
YOUR MOM'S FAMOUS RHUBARB PIE RECIPE.
SORRY YOU HAVE TO WORK LATE WITH A COLD.
ARE YOU HOLDING UP?
YEAH, IT'S JUST MY SINUSES.
RACHEL, WHY DON'T YOU GO WASH YOUR HANDS?
OKAY.
ST. LOUIS, HUH?
SHE TOLD YOU.
IT SLIPPED OUT.
IT'S A GREAT JOB, MARK.
THE SCHOOLS ARE TOP RATE, AND...
IT SOUNDS GOOD.
I WAS READY FOR A FIGHT.
I THINK WE'VE DONE ENOUGH FIGHTING FOR A LIFETIME
DON'T YOU THINK?
YEAH.
IN A PERFECT WORLD
WE COULD BOTH SPEND 365 DAYS A YEAR WITH HER
BUT WE CAN'T.
ST. LOUIS ISN'T VERY FAR.
NO.
I'LL HAVE HOLIDAYS AND SUMMERS.
SPENDING THIS TIME WITH HER THIS SUMMER HAS...
MADE ME THINK ABOUT HOW...
WE SPENT WAY TOO MUCH TIME THINKING ABOUT OURSELVES.
SHE TOLD ME YOU GUYS GOT ALONG REALLY WELL.
YEAH.
YEAH, IT WAS, UH...
IT WAS A LOT OF...
IT WAS A LOT OF FUN.
THANK YOU.
IS IT STILL HALLOWEEN?
UH... YES.
YOU HAVE A FEW MORE HOURS LEFT.
I GUESS I WON'T BE ABLE
TO GO TRICK-OR-TREATING.
NOT THIS YEAR.
I'M SORRY.
SOME DAY, HUH?
THAT'S OKAY.
THE BEST PART WAS MAKING THE COSTUME, ANYWAY.
ME AND MY MOM MADE IT TOGETHER.
DO YOU STILL HAVE MY TIARA?
UH...
YES.
YES, RIGHT HERE.
WAIT, LET ME DO THAT.
THERE.
HOW DO I LOOK?
OH! LIKE A BEAUTIFUL FAIRY PRINCESS.
( laughing )
NO!
DRINK UP, BUDDY!
SOME PEOPLE CANNOT HOLD THEIR LIQUOR.
WE SHOULD TOTALLY MESS WITH HIS MIND.
OH, YOU MEAN THE-HAND- IN-THE-WARM-WATER TRICK?
NOT ON THE COUCH, LUCY.
COME ON.
I GOT IT.
I GOT IT.
( laughing ): STOP IT!
DO YOU THINK HE'S OKAY?
YEAH, HE'S JUST A LIGHTWEIGHT
THAT'S ALL.
HE HAS A STRONG PULSE, AND HE'S STILL BREATHING.
YOU'VE BEEN IN THE E.R. WAY TOO LONG.
LET'S GET THIS PARTY STARTED RIGHT!
YOU GOING TO SHAVE HIS HEAD?
NO, THAT WOULD BE
CRUEL AND UNUSUAL.
THIS IS MEAN!
THIS IS MEAN.
YOU AIN'T SEEN NOTHIN' YET.
WELL, EVEN IF HE WAS DRUNK, THAT SHOULD STILL WORK.
NO, STOP, STOP, STOP.
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT. WILLIE?
WILLIE, WAKE UP!
SOMEONE NEEDS TO CALL 911
AND GO GET CARTER.
GET REAL, LUCE.
IF WE CALL DR. CARTER, HE'LL NARC.
NO, WILLIE'S IN TROUBLE.
WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING.
NO, LUCE, BERNIE'S RIGHT.
WE'RE MED STUDENTS.
WE CAN HANDLE THIS.
THIS IS NOT CLASS.
THIS IS OUR FRIEND.
NOW, YOU GUYS CALL 911.
I'M GOING TO GO GET CARTER.
DR. CARTER?!
WAKE UP, DR. CARTER!
WAKE UP!
OKAY, EVERYBODY, BACK OFF. GIVE HIM SOME AIR.
ANYBODY CALL 911?
I DID, DR. CARTER.
COME ON, WILLIE, WAKE UP.
WAKE UP!
I GOT A WEAK CAROTID PULSE, BUT HE'S NOT BREATHING.
OH, MAN.
( puffing )
( retching )
( all groaning )
OH, GROSS!
CAN I DO ANYTHING? WHAT CAN I DO?
HE VOMITED. THAT'S A... THAT'S GOOD, RIGHT?
NO, THAT'S BAD.
IF HE VOMITS
AND IT GETS DOWN IN HIS LUNGS
HE COULD DIE OF ASPIRATION PNEUMONIA.
UH, HIS PARENTS LIVE IN DOWNER'S GROVE.
CALL THEM. GIVE THEM A CALL.
WE'RE UP HERE, SECOND FLOOR!
"E-X"-- WHAT'S THAT?
THAT'S LIQUID ECSTASY.
WHAT IS THAT?
IT'S LIKE A NARCOTIC.
DID ANYBODY ELSE TAKE IT?!
I DIDN'T KNOW WILLIE TOOK IT. BRANCH TOOK SOME.
I CAN'T LEAVE WILLIE.
I'LL GO.
IT WAS CLEAN. THEY SHOWED THE REPLAY A MILLION TIMES.
PLEASE! IT WAS A JOKE HOW OFFSIDES THEY WERE.
YOU'RE DREAMING. PAY UP.
MARK, THAT WAS LUCKY LIQUOR.
AH, A VAGRANT'S BEST FRIEND.
THEY SAY THEY HAVE A GUY IN A COUNTY PATIENT GOWN
WITH A YELLOW I.V. BAG TRYING TO BUY BEER.
WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO "NO SHIRT
NO SHOES, NO SERVICE"?
THEY'RE TRYING TO STALL HIM
UNTIL SOMEONE COMES
BUT THEY'RE NOT GOING TO HANG ON ALL DAY.
TELL YOU WHAT. HEY, GRABARSKY.
YOU GO DOWN AND PICK THIS GUY UP AND WE'RE EVEN.
HOW'S THAT SOUND?
THIS DRUNK A FRIEND?
NO, BUT HE OWES ME BIGGER THAN YOU DO.
CONSIDER HIM ADMITTED.
WHERE IS HE? HIS ROOMMATE SAID HE WENT TO TAKE A SHOWER.
HOW'S WILLIE? PARAMEDICS INTUBATED HIM.
LIQUID ECSTASY.
THESE GUYS ARE MED STUDENTS.
YOU THINK THEY'D KNOW BETTER.
YEAH, YOU WOULD.
BRANCH?
BRANCH!
( groans )
( water stops )
BRANCH, WAKE UP! WAKE UP!
LET'S GET HIM OUT OF HERE.
NO, HE'S NOT MOVING ANY AIR.
NO PULSE.
DAMN IT!
I'LL START CHEST COMPRESSIONS.
WHERE'S THE SYRINGE?
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.
GO FIND THE PARAMEDICS. I'LL DO CPR.
OKAY.
MR. LUBIN JUST SPIKED TO 101.4.
GO AHEAD AND DRAW A FEVER WORKUP.
DRAW A SETZER FOR A PRE AND POST-GENTAMICIN LEVEL
WITH THE 11:00 DOSE.
HEY, HOW'S IT GOING?
WE SEEM TO BE RATHER BUSY.
I'VE GOT A GREAT LITTLE INTERN HELPING ME OUT.
DALE, LISTEN, UM...
IT'S 10:30 AND YOU'RE NOT EVEN ON
SO SIGN OUT THE SCUT.
THAT'S WHAT THE ON-CALL TEAM IS FOR...
UNLESS YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT.
THAT'S FINE.
YOU READY?
GIVE ME TEN MINUTES
TO GET BACK INTO MY COSTUME.
GOD. YOU'RE REALLY GOING TO WEAR THAT THING, HUH?
OF COURSE.
OKAY. LISTEN, WHEN YOU'RE READY
I'LL BE OUT FRONT, OKAY?
JUST TELL ME YOU WANTED TO BE AN AIRLINE PILOT.
OH, PLEASE. I DON'T EVEN LIKE
TAKING A PUDDLE JUMPER TO CLEVELAND.
HURRY UP.
THIS IS POLICE HARASSMENT!
REMEMBER RODNEY KING!
DR. G., HERE'S YOUR MAN.
HE PUT UP QUITE A FIGHT.
TALKING ABOUT IT'S HALLOWEEN
AND HOW HE'S JUST PLAYING DRESS-UP.
I AM!
GRABARSKY, THAT'S THE WRONG GUY.
LUCKY LIQUOR, BIG GUY IN A HOSPITAL GOWN.
HE KIND OF LOOKS LIKE, UH...
JERRY!
LLOYD.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
WHO'S LLOYD?
I'M THAT KNUCKLEHEAD'S COUSIN.
WHO KNEW THEY COULD HIT
THE GENETIC POWERBALL TWICE?
JERRY...
WELL... SEE, HE NEEDED A COSTUME
AND THERE'S A BIG CONTEST AT THE ELKS LODGE...
I WON AN HONORABLE MENTION, CUZ.
CONGRATULATIONS.
( laughing )
NEED ANYTHING ELSE, DOUG?
OTHER THAN A 48-HOUR DAY?
I'M GOING TO TAKE OFF. SEE YOU BRIGHT AND EARLY.
MMM, BRIGHT AND EARLY.
YEP.
HEY, DOUG, YOU DID A NICE JOB TODAY.
NOT BAD FOR A ROOKIE ATTENDING.
WELL, LET'S SEE HOW YOU DO WITH THESE.
WHAT'S THAT?
THE OVERFLOW CHARTS
FOR THE PEDIATRIC PATIENTS WE SAW IN THE MAIN E.R.
ACCORDING TO POLICY
YOU NEED TO SIGN OFF ON THEM.
( slight chuckle )
YOU'RE LOVING THIS, AREN'T YOU?
YEAH. THIS PEDES E.R. ISN'T SUCH A BAD IDEA AFTER ALL.
HAPPY HALLOWEEN, ROOKIE.
BRANCH CROCKETT AND WILLIE GOLDMAN, AGES 22 AND 23.
MIXED OVERDOSE OF ALCOHOL AND GHB.
WILLIE'S INTUBATED FROM A RESPIRATORY ARREST.
BRANCH CAME BACK WITH EPI AFTER A PULMONARY ARREST.
WHAT, A LITTLE LATE-NIGHT CLUB-HOPPING?
NO, MED SCHOOL HALLOWEEN PARTY.
HMM.
ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY, ON MY COUNT.
ONE, TWO, THREE.
C.B.C., A.B.G., LYTES, BLOOD ALCOHOL
TOX SCREEN AND A 12-LEAD.
STEPHANIE, CALL RESPIRATORY
FOR A VENT.
SOMEONE SHOULD CALL HIS PARENTS.
LUCY CAN DO THAT. I WANT TO HELP.
YOU'RE DRUNK.
YOU DON'T BELONG IN HERE.
NOW GET OUT.
PETER
HAVE YOU GONE COMPLETELY BALMY?
( laughing )
JUST GETTING FUNKY.
( laughs )
HEY, MEET MY NEPHEW, PEANUT.
NICE TO MEET YOU.
HELLO.
IT'S A HAY RIDE!
YES, IT'S A HAY RIDE.
SO, WHERE TO, UNCLE PETE?
MICHIGAN AVE.
HEY, POP THAT EIGHT-TRACK IN.
SOLID.
YOU DON'T GET IT.
YOU NEVER FIGURED OUT WHO I WANTED TO BE AS A KID.
( Shaft theme playing )
OH, MY GOD!
SHAFT.
( chuckles )
JOHN SHAFT.
( both laughing )
HEY, DR. WEAVER.
OFF TO ENJOY ALL HALLOW'S EVE?
ACTUALLY, I AM.
I JUST WANTED TO GIVE YOU THIS BILL.
$289?
YEAH, YOU'RE LUCKY
THE WHEELCHAIR CAME BACK UNDAMAGED.
IT COULD HAVE BEEN A LOT WORSE.
DR. WEAVER, I DON'T HAVE 300 BUCKS.
WELL, THAT'S WHY I'VE ARRANGED
TO HAVE IT TAKEN OUT OF YOUR PAYCHECK.
$28.90 A WEEK FOR THE NEXT TEN WEEKS.
THAT'LL RUN RIGHT INTO THE HOLIDAY BUYING SEASON.
KERRY, YOU GOT A SECOND?
YEAH, WHAT'S GOING ON?
UH, I WANT TO GIVE YOU A HEAD'S UP
ON THE COMMITTEE VOTE.
THAT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO BE ANNOUNCED
UNTIL TOMORROW MORNING.
WELL, THEY'VE TALLIED IT ALREADY
AND THEY VOTED FOR LITVAK.
OH.
THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO WIDEN THE OFFICE DOOR
FOR HIS SWOLLEN HEAD.
YEAH, HE'S KIND OF AN ASS, ISN'T HE?
WELL, IF IT MEANS ANYTHING, I VOTED FOR YOU.
THANKS, MARK.
WHICH PAYCHECK DOES THIS BECOME EFFECTIVE?
YOU KNOW WHAT?
IT DOESN'T.
ARE YOU SERIOUS?
I'M DEAD SERIOUS.
GIVE YOUR COUSIN A WHEELCHAIR.
GIVE YOUR MAIDEN AUNT A RAPID INFUSER.
I DON'T GIVE A DAMN.
YOU'RE GETTING OBSESSIVE OVER THIS.
DID I JUST HAND YOU ANGIOCATHS?
YEAH, A GROSS.
WHAT'S A GROSS?
144, AND YOU DID.
ARE YOU LISTENING TO ME?
YES, I AM.
ALL WORK AND NO PLAY MAKES DOUG A DULL BOY.
NOW, LOOK AT THIS.
I JUST ORDERED THREE CASES OF PEDIALYTE.
THIS IS PEDIAZOLE.
THIS HAS GOT TO BE... OW! OH...
DOUG, YOU ALL RIGHT?
OH, MY GOD! HOLD IT! HOLD IT!
PUT PRESSURE ON IT!
( fake moans )
YOU BASTARD.
YOU CAN DISH IT OUT, YOU CAN'T TAKE IT, HUH?
OH, YOU... PAYBACK IS A BITCH, ISN'T IT?
YOU SUCK. GET AWAY FROM ME. YOU SUCK.
GOOD EVENING. I WANT TO SUCK YOUR BLOOD.
NO, I'M NOT... NO, NO. I'M NOT KISSING BACK.
( chuckles )
( sighs )
HEY, DR. CARTER.
LUCY.
HOW ARE THEY?
THEY'LL BE FINE.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.
ONE SECOND, WE WERE HANGING OUT
AND THE NEXT...
WHAT HAPPENED WAS
TWO OF YOUR CLASSMATES ALMOST DIED TONIGHT.
I DIDN'T KNOW THEY WERE DOING GHB.
WELL, YOU WERE IN CHARGE OF THE PARTY.
I BROKE IT UP WHEN THINGS GOT OUT OF HAND.
YOU CONTINUED TO PARTY.
TWO GUYS ROLLED OUT OF HERE ON GURNEYS.
UH... DID I MISS ANYTHING?
THE PART ABOUT ME NOT BEING ABLE TO POLICE EVERYONE...
AND THE PART ABOUT YOU BEING THE RESIDENT ADVISOR
AND THE ONE IN CHARGE.
YOU'RE RIGHT, LUCY.
YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M IN CHARGE
AND IT WAS STUPID OF ME TO THINK
YOU WERE MATURE ENOUGH TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY.
( music blaring )
* WHO'S THE CAT THAT WON'T COP OUT *
* WHEN THERE'S DANGER ALL ABOUT? *
* SHAFT *
* RIGHT ON
* THEY SAY THIS CAT, SHAFT, IS A BAD MOTHER... *
* SHUT YOUR MOUTH *
* BUT I'M TALKIN' 'BOUT SHAFT
* WE CAN DIG IT *
* HE'S A COMPLICATED MAN
* BUT NO ONE UNDERSTANDS HIM BUT HIS WOMAN *
* JOHN SHAFT *
I NEVER KNEW YOU DIDN'T HAVE RHYTHM.
( giggling )
COME ON, BABY.
YOU'RE MESSING UP ONE OF THE GREATEST SONGS.
WHAT IS THAT?
IT'S MY TAMBOURINE.
