ALL RIGHT. HOOK HER BACK UP TO THE PULSE OX.
HANG 500 OF SALINE.
Hathaway: B.P.'s 120/30. PULSE 80.
YOU GOT THAT SECOND CRIT?
IT'S COMING.
DADDY, IT HURTS.
I KNOW, HONEY, BUT THEY'RE GOING TO HELP.
EVERYTHING WILL BE ALL RIGHT.
CAN'T YOU GIVE HER SOMETHING?
CAROL, TITRATE ANOTHER TWO OF MORPHINE.
Oligario: I GOT THE C.T.s.
WHERE'S DR. GREENE? ON HIS WAY.
PAGE BENTON. WE'VE GOT A SPLENIC INJURY.
WELL, IS THAT BAD?
DADDY, YOU'RE BLEEDING.
LUCY, I THOUGHT YOU
WERE SUTURING MR. SAWYER.
HE WANTED TO GO TO C.T. WITH HER.
Hathaway: CRIT'S 24 AFTER 600cc's.
33. WHAT WAS THE LAST ONE?
MR. SAWYER, WE SHOULD REALLY GET THAT SUTURED.
WHY DON'T YOU COME WITH ME?
Sawyer: WHAT'S WRONG WITH HER?
Carter: YOUR DAUGHTER IS BLEEDING FROM HER SPLEEN.
MOST SPLENIC INJURIES THIS SIZE
HEAL ON THEIR OWN, ESPECIALLY IN CHILDREN.
SO-SO-SO, WHAT DO YOU DO?
IF SHE REMAINS STABLE, NOTHING EXCEPT TRANSFUSE SOME BLOOD.
LET MISS KNIGHT SUTURE THAT CUT.
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO! I WANT TO BE WITH HER.
NOT UNTIL WE TAKE CARE OF THAT GASH.
I WANT TO KEEP HER CALM.
CORINNA, CORINNA, I'M JUST GOING TO BE
RIGHT NEXT DOOR.
4-0 NYLON, LUCY.
I KNOW. I LOVE YOU, SWEETIE.
I LOVE YOU. LUCY, CAN YOU GET CONSENT?
YEAH. RIGHT THROUGH HERE.
I NEVER SAW IT COMING.
THIS VAN, IT JUST CAME OUT OF NOWHERE AND JUST HIT US.
YOU'RE GOING TO NEED TO SIGN THIS. SIT DOWN.
WELL, WHAT IS IT?
IT AUTHORIZES BLOOD TRANSFUSION AND EMERGENCY SURGERY.
I THOUGHT SHE DIDN'T NEED SURGERY.
WELL, PROBABLY NOT. THIS IS JUST IN CASE.
WELL, HOW LONG?
HOW LONG WILL SHE HAVE TO STAY?
IT'S HARD TO TELL.
DO YOU HAVE INSURANCE?
WHAT? UH, YEAH, BUT I LEFT IT IN MY WALLET IN THE GLOVE COMPARTMENT
AND I'M NOT SURE I CAN GET TO IT.
THAT'S OKAY. WE CAN CALL.
WHICH INSURANCE COMPANY IS IT?
UH, BLUE... CROSS.
LISTEN, CAN YOU DO ME A FAVOR
AND CALL HER MOTHER IN CLEVELAND.
I... SHE SHOULD KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING.
DO YOU WANT TO USE THE PHONE?
NO, NO. IT'S-IT'S BEST THAT YOU MAKE THE CALL... PLEASE.
MULTI-VICTIM M.V.A.; FATHER-DAUGHTER.
C.T. ON THE DAUGHTER SHOWS A GRADE-TWO SPLENIC LAC.
SHE'S STABLE, BUT HER CRIT DROPPED NINE POINTS.
HOW'S THE FATHER?
HE'S GOT A MINOR SCALP LAC, CRIT OF 42
AWAKE, ALERT, ORIENTED.
WHAT'S HER NAME?
CORINNA.
CAN YOU TAKE A BREATH FOR ME, PLEASE?
HI, CORINNA, I'M DR. GREENE. HOW ARE YOU FEELING?
MY BACK HURTS.
YOUR BACK, NOT YOUR TUMMY?
WHERE'S MY DADDY?
Hathaway: HE'S RIGHT NEXT DOOR, SWEETIE.
SHE HAS RIGORS, WARM TO THE TOUCH.
PROBABLE FEBRILE REACTION TO THE TRANSFUSION.
HOW MANY UNITS OF BLOOD ARE IN?
Carter: THAT'S HER FIRST.
I NEED SALINE, RECTAL TYLENOL, 500 MILLIGRAMS
25 I.V. BENADRYL.
Benton: UH-OH!
Carter: CORINNA!
Jeanie: B.P.'s DOWN TO 60 PALP.
Carter: CORINNA?
HAS THIS BLOOD BEEN CROSS-MATCHED?
IT'S TYPE SPECIFIC.
THERE'S PINK URINE IN THE FOLEY BAG.
SHE MUST BE HEMOLYZING HER BLOOD CELLS.
SHE COULD ALSO BE BLEEDING FROM THE SPLEEN.
MAYBE BOTH.
500cc BOLUS OF SALINE.
STAND BY WITH EPI.
MIX A DOPAMINE DRIP. WE'RE SURE SHE GOT TYPE SPECIFIC?
IT SAYS B-POSITIVE ON THE BAG.
THAT'S HER TYPE.
RETYPE THAT BLOOD AND THE PATIENT.
THEY MAY HAVE MISLABELED IT UP IN THE BLOOD BANK.
ADD A C.B.C., HAPTOGLOBIN
FREE HEMOGLOBIN
DIRECT, INDIRECT COOMBS, P.T., P.T.T.
Knight: WHAT'S GOING ON?
HEMOLYTIC REACTION TO THE BLOOD TRANSFUSION.
HER IMMUNE SYSTEM'S CHEWING UP THE RED BLOOD CELLS.
YOU SHOULD BE SUTURING THE FATHER.
HE WANTS ME TO CALL THE MOTHER.
ASK HIM IF HIS DAUGHTER HAS ANY HISTORY OF HEMATOLOGIC DISEASE.
Greene: ADD A B.U.N., CREATININE.
LET'S GET LASIX...
MR. SAWYER?
WE WANT TO KEEP THOSE KIDNEYS WORKING.
Jerry: HEY, DR. ROSS.
ISN'T IT A LITTLE LATE FOR GOLF?
NEVER TOO LATE FOR GOLF.
IT'S NOVEMBER.
WHAT'D I JUST SAY?
YOU PEOPLE ARE CRAZY.
CARTER'S GOING SAILING.
WAY TO GO, CARTER.
HIS NAME IS NOT SAWYER, IT'S NELSON.
HE KIDNAPPED CORINNA TWO WEEKS AGO
FROM HER MOTHER'S IN CLEVELAND.
HER MOTHER TOLD YOU THIS?
YEAH, AND SHE'S ON HER WAY TO THE AIRPORT.
SO WHY WOULD SAWYER...? NELSON.
WHY WOULD HE GIVE YOU HER PHONE NUMBER?
UH, HE FREAKED OUT. HE HEARD HIS DAUGHTER
MIGHT NEED SURGERY AND HE'D BE DISCOVERED.
DR. GREENE, WE HAVE A SITUATION HERE.
UH, JUST A SECOND, CARTER.
ARE THOSE THE LABS ON THE GIRL?
U.A. SHOWS ONE-PLUS BILIRUBIN.
ARE YOU ON? JUST PASSING THROUGH.
THEY MISLABEL THE BLOOD?
NO. CROSS-REACTIONS TO MINOR ANTIGENS.
WE'LL HAVE TROUBLE MATCHING THIS ONE.
CAN I SEE IT? THERE'S NONE IN THE BLOOD BANK.
DID YOU TYPE THE FAMILY?
I DREW A C.B.C. ON THE FATHER
BUT HE TOOK OFF. LOOKS LIKE HE KIDNAPPED HER.
WHAT?
THE MOTHER'S ON HER WAY IN FROM CLEVELAND.
CRIT'S 22. WE GOT TO GET HER UP TO THE O.R.
THERE'S NO BLOOD.
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?
CARTER, TYPE AND SCREEN DAD'S BLOOD.
GET ON THE PHONE AND CALL ALL THE OTHER BLOOD BANKS.
LUCY, CALL THIS MOTHER; GET THE GIRL'S MEDICAL RECORDS
AND SEE IF MOM CAN HAVE HER BLOOD SCREENED.
SHE'S ON HER WAY TO THE AIRPORT.
GET HER.
WE DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME.
WELL, LET'S WATCH HER.
THE SPLEEN COULD TAMPONADE.
NOT WITH HER CRIT FALLING.
THAT'S THE HEMOLYSIS.
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.
YOU DON'T KNOW
IT'S THE SPLEEN.
WE'RE LOOKING FOR BLOOD.
CRIT'S WHAT, 22? WE HAVE A CUSHION.
LET'S HIT HER HARD WITH STEROIDS.
CAROL, 500 MILLIGRAMS SOLUMEDROL.
THAT MIGHT NOT BE ENOUGH.
YOU WANT ME TO TAKE A LOOK AT HER?
BE MY GUEST. PETER, YOU GOING TO STICK AROUND?
SURE. YOU'RE JUST GOING TO BE
PAGING ME IN 15 MINUTES, ANYWAY.
YOU CALLED DOUG, HUH?
YEAH. IT SEEMED PRETTY COMPLICATED.
NO PROBLEM.
THAT COVERS THE ENTIRE STATE?
SORRY I'M LATE. YOU READY TO GO?
HEY, JUST A SECOND.
AND WHAT ABOUT INDIANA?
JUST GIVE ME TWO MINUTES.
I'M TIED UP HERE.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING GOING SAILING?
MY UNCLE'S BOAT IS STILL IN BURNHAM HARBOR
AND JOHN OFFERED TO MOTOR IT IN TO DRY DOCK WITH ME
WHILE WE STILL HAVE DECENT WEATHER.
I HEARD IT WAS SUPPOSED TO RAIN.
I CAUGHT THE MOTHER AT THE BOARDING GATE.
SHE'S FAXING HER RELEASE FOR THE MEDICAL RECORDS.
REMEMBERS CORINNNA HAD A TRANSFUSION
FOR HYPERBILIRUBINEMIA AS AN INFANT.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
HI. HI, LUCY.
UNFORTUNATELY, THE MOTHER HAS A DIFFERENT BLOOD TYPE.
FIGURES. DAD MATCHES.
EXACTLY? TO THE ANTIBODY.
WE GOT TO FIND HIM.
I'M JUST GOING TO LEAVE YOU KIDS ALONE.
UM, I'VE GOT A COUPLE OF PHONE CALLS TO MAKE.
UH, UH, BUT YOU'VE GOT 15 MINUTES, MISTER.
YOU'RE LEAVING?
AS SOON AS I FIND THIS BLOOD.
GREAT. SO I CAN GO.
YEAH. SURE, LUCY, BAIL.
NATIONAL BLOOD REGISTRY, PLEASE.
I'M GOING TO GO FIND THE FATHER. HE LEFT AN ADDRESS.
HE DIDN'T GIVE YOU THE RIGHT ADDRESS.
YOU SAID I COULD GO, SO I'M GOING.
WHATEVER.
WHY DO YOU HAVE TO BE SUCH AN ASS ABOUT IT?
LUCY, I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU DO.
I'M GOING TO TRY AND FIND BLOOD FOR HIS KID.
SO AM I.
CRIT'S DOWN TO 19.
STEROIDS AREN'T WORKING.
LET'S GO I.V. I.G. 25 GRAMS OVER FOUR HOURS.
I GAVE YOU TIME TO TREAT THE HEMOLYSIS.
NOW WE'VE GOT TO STOP THE SPLENIC BLEEDING UP IN THE O.R.
SHE'S NOT HEMODYNAMICALLY STABLE.
OKAY. I'LL USE THE CELL SAVER.
THE SERUM YOU'D CYCLE WOULD KEEP DESTROYING HER CELLS.
ANY WORD ON THE BLOOD?
SHE HAS ANTIBODIES TO BOTH VEL AND LAN.
ONE IS FOUND IN FOUR OUT OF 10,000 PEOPLE.
THE OTHER, ONE IN 25,000 PEOPLE.
SHE'S GOT BOTH, SO DO THE MATH.
YOU KNOW THE FATHER MATCHED.
LET'S HOPE HE COMES BACK.
ONE IN 50 MILLION-- DO THE MATH.
THERE'S NOTHING IN THE MIDWEST.
THE RARE DONOR PROGRAM IS ON IT, BUT THEY'RE NOT OPTIMISTIC.
WE CAN'T WAIT THAT LONG.
ANESTHESIOLOGIST WON'T PUT HER UNDER WITH THIS CRIT.
THAT'S WHY I WANTED TO OPERATE WHEN SHE WAS AT 22.
RIGHT NOW, DONOR BLOOD IS HER BEST CHANCE.
WE'LL MANAGE HER MEDICALLY TILL WE GET IT.
IF WE GET IT.
DID YOU REACH THAT HEMATOLOGIST?
YEAH. HE'S ON HIS WAY.
WHY DON'T YOU GO HOME?
WHAT?
YOU'VE BEEN HERE SINCE MIDNIGHT.
YEAH, BUT... I TOOK HER.
LISTEN, YOU KNOW, WE'VE HANDED OFF PATIENTS BEFORE.
YOU'RE COVERED.
YOU GOT THREE DOCS HERE.
OKAY. MAYBE I'LL CALL IN LATER
SEE HOW THINGS ARE GOING.
HEY, MARK? CAN YOU USE ALBUMIN TO PRIME DIALYSIS?
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?
PLASMAPHERESIS.
I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'LL HELP.
COULDN'T HURT.
NO, YOU CAN ARRANGE FOR IT
TO BE IN ADDITION TO YOUR PENSION PLAN.
TAX FREE?
OKAY. YOU READY TO GO?
THAT'S HIM.
DR. CARTER.
YEAH?
JAMES MIDDLETON, CHICAGO P.D.
I RAN THAT LICENSE NUMBER.
TURNS OUT IT'S A DEALER PLATE.
USED CAR LOT ON WESTERN AND ADDISON.
WHAT LICENSE NUMBER?
ON THE TOTALED GRAND AM.
YOU GUYS CALLED IN ABOUT A KIDNAPPING.
UM, JERRY SAID THIS WAS YOUR CASE.
OH. OH, YEAH. DID YOU FIND THE FATHER?
WHO?
THEY WERE IN THE ACCIDENT TOGETHER.
HE HAD US CALL HER MOM AND THEN HE JUST TOOK OFF.
A CUSTODY DISPUTE?
MOM SAID HE STOLE HER.
WHEN? TWO WEEKS AGO.
IS THE MOM HERE?
NO. SHE'S FLYING IN.
OKAY. I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.
HAVE HER CALL ME WHEN SHE GETS HERE.
YEAH. THAT MIGHT BE TOO LATE.
WE REALLY NEED TO FIND THIS GUY.
IT'S A LOT OF "HE SAID, SHE SAID" WITH THESE THINGS.
HE MIGHT HAVE VISITATION RIGHTS FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS.
NO, IT'S NOT THAT. WE NEED HIS BLOOD.
HIS DAUGHTER COULD DIE WITHOUT IT.
DID HE LEAVE ANY CREDIT INFORMATION?
NO. SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER?
NO, NOTHING. JUST AN ADDRESS
BUT I'M SURE IT'S BOGUS.
ALL RIGHT. I'LL CHECK IT OUT; TRY THE USED CAR LOT.
MAYBE I CAN COME UP WITH SOMETHING.
HOPE SO.
OKAY. LINE'S IN.
LET ME GET A HEPARIN FLUSH.
WHERE'S THE PLASMAPHERESIS UNIT?
ON THE WAY DOWN.
MOMMY...
HI, HONEY.
CONNIE, CAN YOU GET DOUG, PLEASE?
WHERE'S MY DADDY?
YOU'RE IN A HOSPITAL.
YOU WERE IN AN ACCIDENT, REMEMBER?
DOES YOUR TUMMY HURT?
WHERE'S MY DADDY?
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE GOOD CARE OF YOU.
MY NAME IS CAROL.
I WANT MY DADDY.
YOUR MOM'S COMING. SHE'LL BE HERE SOON.
DADDY?
YOUR DADDY'S FINE.
HE'S JUST... HE'S JUST NOT HERE
RIGHT NOW.
WHY?
YOU DON'T REMEMBER ME, BUT YOU REMEMBER YOUR DOG.
I'M SURE IT'S ONLY TEMPORARY.
HOW'S YOURS GOING?
WELL, HE'S EITHER SUFFERING SHORT-TERM MEMORY LOSS
OR SAW THE ACCIDENT AS A LAST CHANCE TO BACK OUT.
ANY WORD FROM THE RARE DONOR PROGRAM?
YEAH. TWO WORDS-- "STILL LOOKING."
I GOT A FRIEND AT N.I.H. WHO'S AN EXPERT
IN BLOOD BANKING. I'LL GIVE HIM A CALL.
GREAT. THANKS.
CARTER ASKED ME TO GIVE YOU THIS.
HE SAID THERE MAY BE A DETECTIVE CALLING YOU LATER ABOUT THE FATHER.
IS HE STILL HERE?
NO. HE AND ROXANNE LEFT A WHILE AGO.
MARK, SHE'S SEIZING!
HOW LONG?
ALMOST A MINUTE.
I'VE GOT THE PHENOBARBITAL.
PUSH A THIRD MIG OF ATIVAN FIRST.
ACCUCHECK'S 40. I NEED D-50.
WHAT'S HER CRIT? SEVENTEEN.
GET ANOTHER H&H.
SHE'S HYPOXIC.
HEART AND KIDNEYS COULD GO NEXT.
B.P.'s 100/60. I'M GOING TO INTUBATE.
PUSH THE PHENOBARB.
THAT'S NOT GOING TO DO IT. WE NEED SOME DAMN BLOOD.
DOCTOR, HURRY IT UP.
ALL RIGHT. THANKS, JERRY.
OKAY. SO THERE WAS THIS GIRL NAMED SOUP--
DO NOT ASK ME WHY THEY CALLED HER SOUP.
ANYWAY, SHE WAS, LIKE
TWO YEARS OLDER THAN US, SO WE THOUGHT
SHE WAS REALLY COOL, AND SOMEHOW, SHE CONVINCED US
TO SUNBATHE TOPLESS ON THIS DECK
AND I'M NOT KIDDING YOU
JOHN, MY BREASTS WERE PURPLE
AND THEY HAD BLISTERS ALL OVER.
THESE...
WOW.
HAVE YOU HEARD ANYTHING I'VE JUST BEEN SAYING?
YEAH.
NO. NO, REALLY.
WHAT... WHAT DID I JUST SAY?
HUH?
I'M SORRY. I WAS THINKING ABOUT THAT GIRL.
YOU KNOW, I SHOULD REALLY FOLLOW UP.
I THOUGHT YOU SAID THEY HAD THAT COVERED.
YEAH. YEAH, THERE WAS
JUST THIS ONE OTHER THING I WANTED TO CHECK.
CAN YOU HANDLE THIS WITHOUT ME?
NO. NO...
AH, COME ON. IT'S NO BIG DEAL.
JUST POWERING IT UP THE RIVER.
JOHN, YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE WITH A BUSY SCHEDULE.
I MADE TIME FOR THIS, TOO.
I KNOW, BUT I HAVE TO TRY TO FIND THIS GUY.
BECAUSE LUCY'S LOOKING FOR HIM?
LUCY'S PROBABLY HOME BY NOW.
RIGHT.
COME ON. GET ON THE BOAT.
I'M SORRY. I'LL CALL YOU LATER.
( engine revving )
WHAT? I CAN'T HEAR YOU.
A LOANER. CARS WE LOAN TO CUSTOMERS TO RUN ERRANDS
STUFF LIKE THAT.
THE OWNER MUST HAVE GAVE IT OUT.
CAN I TALK TO HIM?
HE'S IN VEGAS.
IF HE'S WINNING, WE NEVER HEAR FROM HIM.
AND THERE'S NO PAPERWORK ON IT?
WE'RE PRETTY LAX ABOUT STUFF LIKE THAT.
LEAVE THAT STUFF OUT.
THE RAIN'S PASSING THROUGH.
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT
THAT WE FIND THE GUY THAT WAS DRIVING.
YEAH, THE COPS SAID SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
I WISH I COULD HELP.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY TOLD YOU.
HE WAS IN THE ACCIDENT WITH HIS DAUGHTER
AND SHE'S DYING.
HIS BLOOD MAY BE THE ONLY THING
THAT COULD SAVE HER LIFE.
THERE'S NO OTHER WAY TO FIND HIM?
JUST THE CAR.
HEY, THAT SUCKS.
YEAH.
I'D HELP YOU IF I COULD, MAN.
WOULD YOU GIVE ME A CALL?
YEAH, I'LL GIVE YOU A CALL IF I HEAR ANYTHING.
HEY, HOLD UP.
LOOK, YOU SAY ANYTHING TO THE COPS, I'LL DENY IT.
I LOANED THE CAR TO MY BOOKIE.
YOUR BOOKIE; WHAT'S HIS NAME?
HE'S YOUR GUY, NELSON.
I STILL OWE SOME MONEY.
HE'S BEEN GOOD ABOUT MY PAYMENT PLAN.
HE CAME IN ON FRIDAY
WANTED TO BORROW A CAR FOR A FEW DAYS
WHILE HE HAD HIS DAUGHTER, AND I SAID SURE.
DO YOU KNOW HOW TO REACH HIM?
I ONLY MET HIM ONE OTHER TIME.
THEN HOW DID, HOW DID...
I PLACED MY BETS WITH THE BELLHOP
AT THE DELAWARE.
THERE'S NO GAMBLING ON THE PREMISES.
NO, I DIDN'T MEAN YOU, BUT I WAS TOLD THAT
THERE WAS A BELLBOY AROUND HERE WHO COVERED SOME BETS.
I THOUGHT I JUST HEARD MYSELF SAY
"THERE'S NO GAMBLING ON THE PREMISES."
RIGHT, NOT OFFICIALLY.
SURE, LIKE THERE'S NO PROSTITUTES, HUH?
EXCUSE ME!
NUMBER AND IF YOU THINK OF...
I WONDER... WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
I WASN'T DOING ANYTHING.
I MEANT HER.
HEY, YOU WORK FOR A BOOKIE NAMED NELSON?
I GOT TO GET BACK TO WORK.
JUST A SECOND, PLEASE?
I'M NOT INTO THAT KIND OF STUFF.
JUST A NAME.
JUST GIVE ME A NAME, PLEASE?
EXCUSE ME, IS IT MONEY?
WE GOT MONEY. LET ME GO.
WE GOT TO FIND THIS GUY.
LOOK, GET OFF ME, MAN.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
WHAT?
HE WAS ABOUT TO TELL ME
ABOUT THE GUY WHO RUNS BETS FOR NELSON.
HOW DID YOU KNOW NELSON WAS A BOOKIE?
NEIGHBORHOOD GOSSIP.
THAT ADDRESS WASN'T FAKE, IT WAS JUST OLD.
I THOUGHT YOU HAD A DATE.
NO, WE'RE STILL HAVING TROUBLE
FINDING A BLOOD MATCH AT THE HOSPITAL.
I THOUGHT IT WAS WORTH A SHOT.
DID THEY OPERATE?
NOT UNTIL THEY GET HER CRIT UP.
SHE HAD A SEIZURE.
WHAT KIND OF ACTION YOU LOOKING FOR?
I CAN HANDLE O.T.B., GAMES, NUMBERS.
WE'RE JUST LOOKING FOR THIS GUY.
HIS DAUGHTER'S IN THE HOSPITAL.
OH, OKAY, SEE YOU.
NO, WAIT, WE WANT TO BET!
IT'S JUST THAT NELSON
TOLD US TO TALK
TO A BELLHOP BOY.
WHEN DID HE TELL YOU THIS, THE ICE AGE?
TOBY GOT FIRED. TOBY?
HE COVERS NELSON'S ACTION.
WHERE DOES TOBY LIVE?
I DON'T KNOW. HE'S ONE OF THOSE GHETTO BOYS
THE BUTCHER GETS JOBS FOR.
THE WHO?
THIS, UH, "LOST YOUTH" GUY.
WORKS AT A MEAT PACKING PLANT.
Weaver: SO WALK IN THE ROOM AND LOOK AT THE NAME TAGS.
YEAH, JERRY, CAN YOU ANSWER THAT, PLEASE?
UH, CHUNY, DO YOU MIND?
WHOA, JERRY, WHAT IS THIS?
WE'RE NOT MOVING PATIENTS, TRIAGE IS ALL OVER ME.
NO, ONLY EMERGENT CASES GET ON THE BOARD
UNTIL WE HAVE A FREE BED.
ANY LUCK?
NO, HE HASN'T ANSWERED MY PAGE.
I'M TRYING TO TRACK HIM DOWN.
WHAT DO I DO WITH ALL THESE CHARTS?
WHERE'S DOYLE?
I'M DOING MY SHARE.
YOU'VE BEEN WITH THE GIRL
AND DR. WEAVER'S BEEN ON THE PHONE...
I'LL TAKE THE L.P. AND THE MIGRAINE
YOU TAKE THE "TREAT AND STREETS"
AND GET JERRY SOME FREE BEDS.
THANK YOU.
BENTON WANTS TO CALL DOWN ANSPAUGH.
ANY BLOOD?
NOT YET.
MARK, CORRINA'S MOTHER'S AT O'HARE.
SHE WANTS AN UPDATE.
JUST GET HER OVER HERE.
I'LL BRIEF HER IN PERSON.
LUCY WANTS A STATUS REPORT.
I GOT IT.
I'M HOLDING FOR JOHN DERBY, YES.
DERBY, THE N.I.H. GUY?
YES.
HE RETURNED YOUR CALL
RETURNED YOUR PAGE, LEFT A MOBILE NUMBER.
JERRY, WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?
YOU'VE BEEN ON THE PHONE.
Knight: OKAY, THANKS, CAROL!
WAIT, SLOW DOWN. I DON'T THINK THIS IS THE RIGHT WAY.
SHE SAID IT WAS
PAST THE CONVEYOR BELT.
WHAT CONVEYOR BELT? ALL I SEE IS BEEF.
HERE, HERE, WHOA... GOD.
ANY LUCK?!
NO. NO MATCH YET.
WE'RE LOOKING
FOR THE BONING ROOM.
WHAT EXACTLY HAPPENS IN THE BONING ROOM?
THIS IS THE WRONG WAY.
I DIDN'T SEE YOU LEADING.
ALL RIGHT, I'LL LEAD THEN.
HEY! WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
TO FIND THE BONING ROOM.
YOU SAID I COULD LEAD.
I DIDN'T SAY I'D FOLLOW YOU.
I DIDN'T ASK YOU TO COME WITH ME.
I DIDN'T ASK YOU TO COME WITH ME.
I CAME LOOKING FIRST.
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
IT MEANS THAT IF YOU WERE RIGHT
YOU WOULDN'T BE WALKING AROUND A MEAT LOCKER!
I WOULDN'T BE WALKING AROUND A MEAT LOCKER
IF YOU HADN'T LET THE GUY GO!
I KNEW IT. I KNEW YOU BLAMED ME.
A LITTLE GIRL'S DYING, LUCY.
YOU CAN RELAX ABOUT YOU.
HEY!
HEY!
WHAT?
BONING ROOM.
THIS CITY CAN BUILD YOUTH DETENTION CENTERS
TEN YEARS BEFORE THEY'RE NEEDED
BUT THEY CAN'T START A JOB PROGRAM FOR KIDS.
PRISONS, YES.
JOBS, NO.
WELL, AT THIS JOB, APPARENTLY
TOBY TOOK BETS FOR A MAN NAMED NELSON.
NOT EVERYBODY IS A SUCCESS STORY.
DO YOU KNOW WHERE WE CAN FIND HIM?
SORRY, I DON'T SNITCH ON MY KIDS.
IF THEY DON'T TRUST YOU, IT'S OVER.
YOU WANT TO SAVE KIDS?
I GOT ONE YOU CAN SAVE.
CRIT'S LEVELED OFF AT 16.
I THINK WE STOPPED THE HEMOLYSIS.
HER KIDNEYS ARE FAILING.
SHE'S ALREADY HAD TWO SEIZURES.
IF HER SPLEEN IS STILL BLEEDING
SHE'LL DIE.
NO ONE IS DISAGREEING THAT SHE NEEDS SURGERY.
THE QUESTION IS, HOW LONG CAN WE WAIT FOR BLOOD?
IT MAY NEVER COME.
LOOK, AT SOME POINT
THERE'S SUCH A THING AS DESPERATE MEASURES.
WE'RE NOT THERE YET.
OH, MY GOD!
CORINNA.
( crying ): CAN SHE HEAR ME?
Greene: SHE'S BEEN DRIFTING IN AND OUT.
MAYBE WE SHOULD TYPE THE MOM.
I DID WHILE I WAS EXPLAINING
CORINNA'S CONDITION TO HER.
A-POSITIVE.
I CAN'T GIVE IT ANYWAY?
IT'S BETTER THAN NOTHING.
SHE NEEDS A PERFECT MATCH.
AND KEITH HAS IT?
TYPICAL. HE TAKES HER
HE HURTS HER AND HE RUNS AWAY WHEN SHE NEEDS HIM.
GOT IT!
WHAT?
N.I.H. FOUND A MATCH.
TWO FROZEN UNITS IN NASHVILLE.
Benton: HOW LONG BEFORE IT GETS HERE?
IN THE AIR IN TEN MINUTES.
GET HER TO PRE-OP.
I WANT TO BE READY THE MINUTE IT GETS HERE.
THERE'S NUMBER EIGHT.
THIS IS NUTS. THIS IS NUTS.
EVEN IF WE FIND THIS TOBY
HE MIGHT NOT EVEN KNOW NELSON.
WE'RE HERE. WE MIGHT AS WELL TRY.
HAVE A LITTLE FAITH.
HAVE A LITTLE FAITH?
IN OUR ABILITY TO FIND ONE GUY IN ALL OF CHICAGO?
GO HOME. I'LL FIND HIM MYSELF.
YEAH, RIGHT.
Carter: BE RIGHT BACK.
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
YEAH.
HI. IS TOBY HERE?
WHO ARE YOU?
HI.
DO YOU LIVE HERE?
WHERE ARE YOUR CLOTHES?
HE DOESN'T TALK MUCH.
ARE YOU HIS SISTER?
( coughing )
WHO'S THAT?
HIS MOM. SHE'S SICK.
THAT'S A PRETTY BAD COUGH.
HAS SHE HAD IT FOR A LONG TIME?
A WHILE.
WHAT'S HER NAME?
MRS. PRICE.
( coughing continues )
MAYBE I SHOULD GO IN, TAKE A LOOK.
SEE IF SHE'S OKAY.
YOU SHOULDN'T GO IN THERE.
IT'S NOT YOUR HOUSE.
IT'S OKAY BECAUSE I'M A DOCTOR.
WOULD YOU WATCH HIM FOR A COUPLE OF MINUTES?
YEAH.
HELLO?
HELLO? MRS. PRICE?
( coughing continues )
WHO-WHO'S THERE?
MY NAME IS DR. CARTER.
I JUST SAW YOUR BOY OUTSIDE.
DON'T BE AFRAID.
I JUST CAME IN TO SEE IF YOU'RE OKAY.
( gasping ): WHO-WHO LET... WHO LET YOU IN?
THE DOOR WAS OPEN.
I HEARD YOU COUGHING.
IT'S UH, IT'S BRONCHITIS.
I'VE HAD IT BEFORE.
ARE YOU COUGHING UP BLOOD?
IS THAT BLOOD YOU'RE COUGHING UP?
A LITTLE.
ANY FEVER?
HAS ANYBODY EVER DONE A T.B. TEST ON YOU?
HAVE THEY DONE A T.B. TEST?
DID THEY PRICK YOUR ARM?
YOU HOLD ON, SWEETHEART.
WE'RE GOING TO GET YOU SOME HELP.
AAH!
WHAT THE HELL YOU THINK YOU DOING?!
I'M JUST TRYING TO HELP.
YEAH, RIGHT.
Girl: I TOLD YOU NOT TO COME IN HERE.
ARIEL, GO HOME AND STAY THERE!
I NEED TO CALL 911.
YEAH, IF YOU'RE LUCKY.
LOOK, I'M A DOCTOR.
THAT WOMAN HAS TUBERCULOSIS.
IT'S HIGHLY CONTAGIOUS.
I WANT HER ON 100% OXYGEN, AC-14, TITLE VOLUME 250.
WHO'S ON FOR ANESTHESIA?
BABCOCK.
LET'S GET HIM HERE.
WHERE ARE WE GOING?
O.R. THREE.
FIND ME WHEN THE BLOOD GETS HERE.
MA'AM, YOU CAN'T GO IN HERE.
WELL, WHAT DO I DO?
WAIT HERE. SOMEONE WILL TALK TO YOU.
SHE WON'T LOSE MORE BLOOD DURING THE SURGERY.
THE OTHER DOCTOR SAID SHE HAD A LOW BLOOD COUNT.
THAT'S WHY WE'RE WAITING
FOR DONOR BLOOD.
HOPEFULLY, WE CAN GET HER COUNT UP HIGH ENOUGH
TO OPERATE SAFELY
AND PREVENT ANY FURTHER BLOOD LOSS.
SHE'LL BE OKAY UNTIL THEN?
( crying )
I TALKED TO TOBY'S SISTER.
SHE SAYS HE HANGS OUT AT A MINI-MART UP THERE.
HOLD ON. WE NEED TO WAIT FOR THE PARAMEDICS.
THE WOMAN IN THERE HAS ACTIVE T.B.
SHE'S GOT A LITTLE BOY.
THE WHOLE PROJECT COULD BE INFECTED.
SHE THINKS HE'S THERE NOW.
I'LL GO MYSELF.
NO. WE SHOULD GO TOGETHER.
I'M GOING NOW.
GOD FORBID YOU SHOULD LISTEN TO ME
AND LEARN SOMETHING!
I DON'T WANT TO LEARN THINGS?
NOT FROM ME.
BECAUSE I DISAGREE WITH YOU?
I HAVE EXPERIENCE.
YOU COULD RESPECT THAT.
I'M JUST TRYING TO FIND THIS GUY...
WHAT? THAT'S HIM.
MR. NELSON! WAIT!
MR. NELSON!
Carter: NELSON!
WAIT!
NELSON!
( tires screeching )
NELSON!
SORRY. EMERGENCY!
HEY! HEY!
WHERE DO YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING?!
I GOT TO STOP HIM!
THE FARE'S A BUCK FIFTY!
LET ME GO! NELSON!
WAIT, NELSON!
NELSON!
DAMN IT!
GO AND BUY A FARE.
YOU JUST KILLED A LITTLE GIRL.
FARE'S A BUCK FIFTY.
WANT A BUCK FIFTY?
THERE'S YOUR BUCK FIFTY.
HEY, YOU BETTER BACK OFF, PAL!
ALL RIGHT.
SON OF A BITCH!
( helicopter approaching )
BLOOD'S HERE.
THE BLOOD BANK'S DEGLYCEROLIZING AND THAWING NOW.
IT'LL BE 20 MINUTES.
CRIT'S DOWN TO 15.
PUT HER UNDER.
I DON'T WANT TO WASTE ANY TIME.
YOUR CALL.
YOU OKAY, PETER?
YEAH, I'M FINE.
GET ANSPAUGH IN HERE.
SURE.
COME ON, LET'S MOVE.
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW NELSON HAD A DAUGHTER.
SHE DOESN'T HAVE MUCH TIME, TOBY.
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE FIND HIM.
HE JUST PICKED UP HIS MONEY
AND SAID HE MIGHT BE LEAVING TOWN.
YOU CAN'T CALL HIM?
HE PAGES ME.
FROM WHERE?
HE DON'T SAY.
YOU WERE WORKING FOR THE MAN
AND YOU CAN'T TELL THEM WHERE TO FIND HIM?
IT AIN'T LIKE WE FRIENDS. IT'S BUSINESS.
HELL, WHAT IF I GET PINCHED?
YOU BETTER HOPE YOU DON'T GET PINCHED.
IF HE KNEW CORINNA'S CONDITION, HE'D WANT YOU TO TELL US.
I AM TELLING YOU. I DON'T KNOW HOW TO FIND HIM.
IF I DID, I'D GO MYSELF.
ALL RIGHT. WHAT ABOUT, UH...
OTHER BUSINESS CONTACTS?
HE HAS GUYS AT BALLPARKS TO TAKE LAST-MINUTE ACTION.
YO, WAIT A MINUTE.
HE GOT THIS UNCLE-- A GROUNDS GUY AT SOLDIER FIELD.
UNCLE JOEY.
CRIT'S DOWN TO 14.
HOW LONG DO WE WAIT?
HERE SHE IS.
IS THAT IT?
BAD NEWS.
COME ON, DON'T TELL ME.
THERE WERE SMALL HOLES IN THE BAGS.
WE COULDN'T TELL UNTIL IT HAD THAWED.
DID IT HAPPEN HERE?
MAYBE YEARS AGO.
WE CAN'T TELL IF THE BLOOD'S
BEEN EXPOSED TO BACTERIA.
OH, DAMN.
WE SHOULD GIVE IT TO HER ANYWAY.
YOU WANT TO MAKE HER SEPTIC, TOO?
NO, PETER'S RIGHT. WE CAN'T TRANSFUSE.
SO, NOW WHAT?
PETER
I THINK WE'VE ARRIVED AT YOUR DESPERATE MEASURES.
NO. I WANT TO TALK TO DETECTIVE MIDDLETON.
MAYBE HE WENT HOME FOR THE DAY.
NO, PLEASE DON'T PUT ME ON HOLD.
THE COPS WOULDN'T HAVE GOTTEN THIS FAR.
HOW FAR HAVE WE GOTTEN? UNCLE JOEY?
THESE KINDS OF PEOPLE DON'T TALK TO THE COPS.
WHERE DID YOU LEARN THAT, DETECTIVE SCHOOL?
WE'RE CLOSE. WE SAW HIM.
I DON'T WANT TO BLOW IT EITHER
BUT YOU GOT TO KNOW WHEN TO ASK FOR HELP.
HI. YEAH.
NO, I DON'T KNOW
IF IT'S TECHNICALLY CONSIDERED AN ACTIVE CASE.
HELLO? HELLO?
THAT MIGHT BE HIM.
HI. YEAH, I GOT YOU.
I SAID I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S CONSIDERED AN ACTI...
HELLO? HELLO?
I JUST CHARGED THIS BATTERY.
JOEY?!
JOEY?
WHO'S ASKING?
WE'RE NOT THE COPS.
OF COURSE NOT.
I ALREADY GOT YOU MADE FOR THE FBI.
WE'RE LOOKING FOR YOUR NEPHEW.
HIS DAUGHTER'S IN THE HOSPITAL IN CRITICAL CONDITION.
WE NEED HIS BLOOD TO TRANSFUSE HER.
WHOSE BLOOD?
KEITH NELSON, YOUR NEPHEW.
KEITH NELSON'S NOT MY NEPHEW.
EVERYBODY CALLS ME UNCLE JOEY.
BUT YOU KNOW HIM.
YEAH, HE'S A GOOD GUY.
YOU KNOW WHERE WE COULD FIND HIM?
NO.
WHEN'S THE LAST TIME YOU SAW HIM?
OH, COUPLE WEEKS AGO.
WE ALMOST BEAT THE RAMS.
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHERE HE MIGHT BE?
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT.
WHAT'S TODAY? THURSDAY?
SOMETIMES HE GOES TO THE COCKFIGHTS.
COCKFIGHTS?
YOU KNOW, TWO ROOSTERS PECKING EACH OTHER TO DEATH.
WHERE?
USED TO BE ON THE SOUTH SIDE.
I STOPPED GOING.
YOU GOT AN ADDRESS?
NO.
I COULD DRAW YOU A MAP.
OKAY, LINEA ALBA IS INCISED.
TOOTHED FORCEPS.
METZ.
YOU READY, PETER?
I HOPE SO.
BE FAST, HUH?
SHE WON'T TOLERATE MUCH MORE THAN 100cc
BLOOD LOSS.
GO RIGHT FOR THE SPLENIC ARTERY.
OKAY. BE STANDING BY WITH LAP PADS AND SUCTION.
B.P. 110/70.
LET'S KEEP IT THAT WAY, PETER.
ALL RIGHT.
HERE WE GO.
EXCELLENT.
PERITONEUM LOOKS DRY.
RETRACTOR.
BOVIE.
DIVIDE THE GASTROCOLIC LIGAMENT
AND WE'LL ENTER THE LESSER SAC.
OKAY, GOT IT.
WHOA! WHOA! SUCTION, SUCTION!
SHE'S HEMORRHAGING!
MUST HAVE RELEASED
TAMPONADE ON THE HEMATOMA.
B.P.'s FALLING.
VASCULAR CLAMP.
CAN YOU VISUALIZE THE ARTERY?
NO.
DON'T CLAMP OFF THE PANCREAS.
OKAY, SUCTION.
I CAN'T SEE A DAMN THING.
ALL RIGHT. LOSE THE CLAMP.
COMPRESS IT WITH YOUR FINGER.
150cc BLOOD LOSS SO FAR. PRESSURE'S DOWN... 70/50.
Benton: COME ON, COME ON.
DAMN. COME ON.
ARE YOU SURE THIS IS THE RIGHT PLACE?
YEAH. THE MAP SAYS IT'S ACROSS THE BRIDGE
AND PAST THE SECOND FREIGHT STATION.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
THERE'S NO ONE HERE.
THEY PROBABLY DON'T ADVERTISE.
THERE'S A LIGHT ON UP THERE.
SO, WHAT, WE'RE BREAKING AND ENTERING NOW?
UNLESS YOU GOT A BETTER IDEA.
NOT IF YOU BROUGHT BOLT CUTTERS.
NO. I CAN GIVE YOU A BOOST.
LIKE YOU SAID, WE'RE HERE.
MIGHT AS WELL CHECK IT OUT.
THERE YOU GO.
OKAY.
THERE YOU GO.
I CAN'T.
YEAH, YOU CAN.
I GOT YOU. GO AHEAD.
UP AND OVER.
YOU GOT IT.
THERE YOU GO.
YOU DID IT.
HOW MANY FENCES DO THEY NEED?
YOU GOT TO KEEP OUT THE RIFFRAFF.
YOU WANT TO GO BACK AND GET YOUR JACKET
'CAUSE IT STARTED RAINING AGAIN?
NO CARS.
DO THESE PEOPLE WALK TO THEIR COCKFIGHTS?
I DON'T KNOW IF I TRUST UNCLE JOEY.
HE SEEMED TOO EASY.
WHAT, YOU QUITTING ON ME?
HOLD UP. LET'S CHECK THIS OUT.
CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING?
SURE.
WHAT MADE YOU DECIDE
TO COME LOOKING FOR NELSON?
WELL, THE GIRL NEEDS HELP.
YEAH, BUT YOU SEE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO NEED HELP.
WHOO.
WHY'D YOU COME OUT HERE?
I DON'T KNOW.
OOH.
I FEEL RESPONSIBLE.
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT, LUCY.
THAT'S AN EASY THING TO TELL YOURSELF WHEN THINGS GO WRONG.
NO, I SHOULDN'T HAVE MADE YOU FEEL THAT WAY.
TRUTH IS, YOU'RE THE ONLY MED STUDENT I'VE HAD
THAT'S SHOWED ANY PROMISE.
DO YOU SEE ANYTHING?
NO, JUST A LOT OF DIRT.
I THINK I SEE SOMETHING.
HANG ON. WHAT IS THAT? IS THAT A RING?
WHAT KIND OF RING?
CARTER!
CARTER!
OH, MY GOD.
ARE YOU OKAY?
DR. CARTER, ARE YOU OKAY?
NO.
CAN YOU TELL ME YOUR NAME?
DO YOU KNOW YOUR NAME?
I KNOW MY NAME, LUCY.
I THINK I, UM...
WHAT?
I THINK MY SHOULDER...
I THINK I DISLOCATED MY SHOULDER.
ARE YOU SURE?
YEAH. ANTERIOR DISLOCATION.
I DON'T THINK IT'S BROKEN.
WE GOT TO GET
YOU TO THE HOSPITAL.
SENSATION'S INTACT.
AND I GOT A PULSE.
OKAY, YOU STAY RIGHT THERE.
I'M GOING TO GET SOME HELP.
NO, WAIT, WAIT.
THAT'LL TAKE FOREVER.
CAN YOU MOVE?
CAN YOU GET DOWN?
LET'S JUST DO IT HERE.
YEAH.
OKAY. WHAT?
DID WE GO OVER SHOULDER REDUCTIONS?
NO.
WE SHOULD'VE GONE OVER THAT.
YOU WEREN'T TALKING TO ME.
YOU'RE GOING TO PULL MY ARM...
REALLY HARD...
YEAH.
UNTIL YOU HEAR IT POP.
JUST LIKE THAT?
I HOPE SO.
WON'T THAT HURT?
OH, YEAH.
OKAY.
READY?
JUST COMMIT TO IT.
PULL HARD.
ONE, TWO, THREE.
( screams )
STOP! WHAT? WHAT?
WHAT DID I DO?
I'M SORRY.
I'M SORRY, I'M SORRY.
I'M SORRY.
( yells )
WE NEED COUNTERTRACTION.
OKAY.
ALL RIGHT, I KNOW.
ALL RIGHT, STICK YOUR FOOT IN MY PIT.
WHAT?
MY ARMPIT.
YOUR ARMPIT.
JUST BE VERY CAREFUL.
YOU SAID COMMIT.
THAT'S RIGHT.
OKAY.
ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THIS?
ONE... JUST DO IT.
TWO, THREE.
( screaming )
B.P.'s UP TO 100/80 WITH SALINE.
ALL RIGHT, THE DISTAL CLAMP IS ON.
NOW, LET GO WITH YOUR FINGER, PETER, SLOWLY.
OKAY. IT'S LOOKING PRETTY GOOD.
DRY AS A BONE.
CRIT'S DOWN TO 12.
NO FURTHER BLEEDING.
KIDS CAN TOLERATE LOW CRIT.
P.V.C.s?
WHAT'S HER POTASSIUM?
UH... 4.2 PRE-OP.
RUN OF FIVE.
LIDOCAINE, 30 MILLIGRAMS, I.V.
WHAT IS IT?
COULD BE CARDIAC ISCHEMIA.
V-TACH.
NO PULSE.
ALL RIGHT, BRING IN A CRASH CART.
COME ON.
CHARGE IT TO 80. HURRY UP.
CRIT'S TOO LOW.
SHE'S NOT GETTING ENOUGH OXYGEN TO THE HEART.
HERE WE GO. CLEAR.
STILL V-TACH.
CHARGE IT TO 160.
CLEAR.
SHOULD HAVE JUST LET YOU JUMP THE FENCE
AND DRIVE THE JEEP AROUND.
DO YOU THINK UNCLE JOEY HAD THE WRONG NIGHT
OR HE WAS JUST PULLING OUR LEG?
I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE WE SHOULD DOUBLE BACK.
THERE'S A LIGHT UP THERE.
JOHN... DR. CARTER.
I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT I DO RESPEC...
OW!
I'M SORRY. I'M...
SORRY.
THAT I DO RESPECT YOU
AND THAT YOU'RE A GOOD TEACHER
AND YOU MUST BE A GOOD PERSON
OTHERWISE YOU WOULDN'T BE OUT HERE.
AND I'M SORRY I'M SO STUBBORN SOMETIMES.
STUBBORN CAN BE GOOD.
NOT WHEN IT'S DEFENSIVE.
GOT US OUT HERE, DIDN'T IT?
IS THAT GOOD?
MOST PEOPLE WOULD HAVE GIVEN UP A LONG TIME AGO.
IN FACT, MOST PEOPLE WOULD NEVER HAVE GONE LOOKING.
I MIGHT HAVE GIVEN UP IF YOU HADN'T COME.
THANKS FOR COMING.
WELL, I DIDN'T COME FOR YOU.
I CAME FOR THE PATIENT.
NO, I APPRECIATE IT.
IT WAS VERY VALIANT OF YOU.
NO, REALLY.
THEY DIDN'T NEED ME AT THE HOSPITAL.
I WANTED SOMETHING TO DO.
YOU JUST SAID THAT YOU CAME BECAUSE I WAS STUBBORN.
I MEANT, WE WERE STUBBORN.
OH, MY GOD.
WHAT?
I AM SO SORRY.
MY JEEP.
IT DIDN'T LOOK THAT FAR FROM THE BRIDGE.
INDIANA DIDN'T LOOK THAT FAR FROM THE BRIDGE.
ARE YOU COLD?
I'M STARVING.
LET'S GRAB SOMETHING TO EAT.
I'M GOING TO CALL A CAB FIRST.
SOMETIMES THEY TAKE A WHILE.
IF THEY COME OUT HERE.
SOMEONE'S ON THE PHONE.
WE'RE OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE.
THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE IS THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SKYWAY.
SORRY.
I'M GOING TO ORDER.
OKAY, MAKE IT QUICK.
CHEESEBURGER QUICK ENOUGH?
GET IT TO GO.
HONEY, EVERYTHING'S TO GO.
UH, LET ME HAVE TWO CHEESEBURGERS
AND...
TWO ORDERS OF FRIES.
NO FRIES FOR ME.
THAT WAS MY ORDER.
WOULD YOU LIKE SOMETHING?
YEAH. A CHEESEBURGER.
ANOTHER CHEESEBURGER.
LONG DAY?
( laughs )
YOU MIGHT SAY THAT, YEAH.
SO, I'M GOING TO CALL A CAB
AND THEN CHECK WITH THE HOSPITAL
AND THEN I THOUGHT THAT WE MIGHT CALL TOBY.
HE WAS HELPFUL. HE SAID
HE'D THINK ABOUT IT.
HE'LL PROBABLY DENY EVER KNOWING THE GUY.
SO, WHAT DO YOU WANT US TO DO?
YOU WANT ME TO SAY IT FIRST?
WHAT?
WE'RE NEVER GOING TO FIND THIS GUY.
THERE'S GOT TO BE SOME OTHER PLACE WE CAN TRY.
YEAH, THERE ARE MILLIONS OF PLACES WE COULD TRY.
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.
LET'S JUST HOPE THEY FOUND THAT BLOOD.
I'M CALLING THE HOSPITAL.
GET A CAB FIRST.
WANT ANYTHING TO DRINK WITH THAT?
YEAH, LET ME HAVE A COKE.
ANYTHING FOR THE BOSS?
WHO?
THE BOSS. THE MISSUS.
YOUR GIRLFRIEND?
NO. NOT MY GIRLFRIEND.
JOHN.
COME HERE. COME HERE.
WHAT?
COME HERE.
WHATEVER YOU SAY, PAL.
TOBY GOT AN ADDRESS ON NELSON.
TOBY. YOU JUST CALLED TOBY?
I WASN'T GOING TO ARGUE WITH YOU.
YOU GOT AN ADDRESS?
HEAR YOU HAD A SCARE IN THE O.R.
I THOUGHT YOU'D BE GONE BY NOW.
I WANTED TO CHECK ON HER BEFORE I LEFT.
WELL, SHE'S GOING INTO RENAL FAILURE
BUT SHE'S TOO UNSTABLE FOR DIALYSIS.
SHE HAD ARRYTHMIAS ON LIDOCAINE
AND SHE HAD A BREAKTHROUGH SEIZURE.
IT'S A MIRACLE YOU GOT HER THROUGH THE SURGERY.
WELL, YOU KNOW, IT WON'T DO ANY GOOD
IF SHE CAN'T HAVE A SIMPLE BLOOD TRANSFUSION.
NOW I GET TO STAND AROUND AND WATCH HER DIE.
YOU WANT ME TO TALK TO THE MOM?
YEAH.
OKAY.
GOOD JOB, PETER.
YEAH.
THIS IS THE ADDRESS?
TOBY SAID THIS IS WHERE HE GETS HIS MAIL.
WHAT IS HE, A HOBO?
SO, THIS MUST BE HIS TRAILER.
DO YOU SEE ANYTHING?
JUST FIVE MINUTES.
I'M DONE PEEKING THROUGH WINDOWS.
I CAN'T BELIEVE BENTON OPERATED WITHOUT BLOOD.
THAT'S WHAT THE O.R. NURSE SAID.
THAT'S A GOOD SIGN, RIGHT?
NAH. SHE STILL NEEDS IT.
MR. NELSON!
MR. NELSON, ARE YOU IN THERE?!
SHOULD WE GO IN?
IF HE WAS LEAVING TOWN
WHY WOULD HE LEAVE HIS TRAILER OPEN?
DEPENDS ON WHAT KIND OF HURRY HE WAS IN.
WE SHOULD FIND SOMETHING.
MAKE SURE THIS IS HIS PLACE.
LOOKS LIKE THEY HAD EGGS FOR BREAKFAST.
ARE THESE RACING FORMS?
THESE DON'T LOOK LIKE CONSTRUCTION PLANS.
WHAT KIND OF GUY BRINGS A KID
TO A TRAIN YARD?
MAYBE HE HAD
NOWHERE ELSE
TO TAKE HER.
COULD HAVE LEFT HER AT HOME WITH HER MOTHER.
WE DON'T KNOW
THE WHOLE STORY.
WE KNOW HE WALKED OUT ON HER.
WELL, IN HIS MIND, HE GAVE HER UP
SO SHE COULD GET TREATMENT.
HE DIDN'T KNOW HOW BAD OFF SHE WAS.
I DON'T CARE.
YOU STICK AROUND FOR YOUR KIDS.
SOMETIMES IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE.
I NEVER EVEN MET MY DAD.
HE WAS 19 YEARS OLD
WHEN I WAS BORN.
PROBABLY THOUGHT HE'D SCREW IT UP.
MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE BEST THING FOR ME AND MY MOM.
I'M SORRY.
DIDN'T MEAN TO GET PERSONAL.
I'M JUST SAYING
SOMETIMES LOVE CAN BE COMPLICATED.
I'LL GIVE YOU THAT.
THERE'S A MESSAGE HERE.
LET'S HOPE IT'S A GOOD ONE.
Nelson: Inga, are you there?
Pick up.
Okay, I don't know if you got my message
or if you been to the hospital yet.
I'll try you again at work.
I'm across the street.
Call me on my cell phone.
It's important.
It's about Corinna.
LEAVE THE NUMBER.
DAMN IT!
SO, WHO'S INGA, HIS GIRLFRIEND?
ACROSS THE STREET.
ACROSS THE STREET FROM WHERE?!
AND WHAT IS SHE DOING AT THE HOSPITAL?
CHECKING ON HIS DAUGHTER.
WE FIND HER, WE FIND NELSON.
Carter: YOU TALKED TO RANDI?
SHE SAID SHE'D LOOK FOR HER.
THAT'S ALL RIGHT, WE'LL BE THERE IN FIVE MINUTES.
MORE LIKE EIGHT.
YOU TAKE THE E.R.
I'LL TAKE THE I.C.U.
AND PAGE IF YOU FIND ANYTHING.
OTHERWISE, WE MEET IN THE LOBBY.
HEY, YOU KNOW, YOUR FARE'S UP TO $84.
YOU TWO GOT ENOUGH CASH TO COVER THIS?
WHAT DO YOU HAVE?
I GOT 20. WHAT ABOUT YOU?
WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO STOP AT AN A.T.M.
CAN'T WE GET SOME PETTY CASH, OR SOMETHING?
OH, WAIT. THERE'S ONE RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET FROM COUNTY.
WHERE?
ACROSS THE STREET
BY DOC MAGOO'S.
ACROSS THE STREET...
NELSON SAID HE WAS ACROSS THE STREET.
THERE WAS MUSIC PLAYING IN THE BACKGROUND.
DO YOU THINK HE'S AT DOC MAGOO'S?
YOU SEE HIM?
NO.
EXCUSE ME.
HAVE YOU SEEN A GUY IN HERE
MID '30s, TALKING ON A CELL PHONE?
EVERY NIGHT.
JOHN? YEAH?
MEN'S ROOM?
Nelson: I WANT TO SEE HER.
CAN I SEE HER?
SOON AS WE GET THIS STARTED.
JUST SIT THERE AND ROLL UP BOTH OF YOUR SLEEVES.
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU FOUND ME.
THANK GOD. THANK YOU.
I WAS TRYING TO GET SOME NEWS.
I DIDN'T KNOW.
INGA NEVER CALLED BACK?
HOW DO YOU KNOW INGA?
ON YOUR MACHINE.
AT MY TRAILER?
WE WERE EVERYWHERE.
GOT THE DONOR BAGS.
I CAN'T DO THIS.
CAN YOU DO THIS?
Nelson: I THOUGHT SHE'D BE OKAY.
HER MOM COULD HANDLE IT.
DR. GREENE'S IN SICU WITH THE GIRL.
Carter: GET A B.P.
I DIDN'T KNOW THIS COULD HAPPEN.
HOW DID I KNOW THIS COULD HAPPEN?
GOT IT.
HOOK IT UP.
I THOUGHT I WAS HELPING HER.
HEY, YOU'RE HERE NOW.
THE BLOOD'LL HELP.
YOU CAN TAKE HIS BLOOD
AND THEN I AM GOING TO KILL HIM.
Carter: HEY, WE'RE COMING THROUGH.
GET THAT GURNEY OUT OF THE WAY.
TALK TO ME, CARTER.
WE FOUND MR. NELSON NEXT DOOR AT DOC MAGOO'S.
ONE UNIT DONATED.
HAS THIS BEEN SCREENED FOR VIRUSES?
THEY TESTED THE DRAW FROM THIS MORNING. IT'S CLEAN.
BELIEVE ME, IF I KNEW THERE WAS A PROBLEM...
Greene: SOMEONE PAGE BENTON.
KIT, GET THIS HUNG.
REPEAT A CRIT IN 30 MINUTES.
CHECK THE PHENOBARB LEVEL.
CORINNA.
CORINNA, I'M HERE, SWEETIE.
Kit: E.T. CUFF'S LEAKING.
I'LL CHANGE IT OVER A CATHETER.
SHE'LL BE OKAY NOW, RIGHT?
IT'S HARD TO SAY.
WHAT SHE HAS IS...
MULTI-ORGAN SYSTEM FAILURE.
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
SHE'S BEEN DEPRIVED OF OXYGEN.
SHE'S IN A COMA.
IT'S BEEN HARD TO TREAT HER SEIZURES.
SHE HAS THREE INTRAVENOUS MEDICATIONS
TO STABILIZE HER HEART RATE, AND, UH...
AND HER KIDNEYS HAVE SHUT DOWN.
BUT HIS BLOOD WILL MAKE HER BETTER, RIGHT?
A LOT OF DAMAGE HAS BEEN DONE.
HEY.
HEY.
YOU LOOK LIKE HELL.
THANKS. SO DO YOU.
SO, WHAT IS THAT, A CLAVICLE FRACTURE?
ANTERIOR DISLOCATION.
LONG STORY, RIGHT?
LONG STORY.
YEAH.
I BETTER GET OUT OF HERE.
I'M ON AT 6:00.
HEY, GOOD JOB--
KEEPING HER ALIVE.
BLOODLESS SURGERY.
THAT'S A FIRST, HUH?
YOU SHOULD PUT THAT SHOULDER IN AN IMMOBILIZER.
( door shuts )
HI.
I THOUGHT YOU WENT HOME.
NO. WE'RE ON IN AN HOUR.
IT'S BETTER NOT TO SLEEP
UNLESS YOU CAN GET AT LEAST THREE.
I WOULDN'T SLEEP ANYWAY.
HER CRIT'S UP THREE POINTS
BUT THE RENAL FAILURE MAY BE PERMANENT.
THAT'S IF SHE WAKES UP.
I THOUGHT WE WERE SAVING HER.
NO.
WE WERE GIVING HER HER ONLY CHANCE.
THAT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH.
IT HAS TO BE.
NO...
IT DOESN'T.
SOME PATIENTS GET TO YOU MORE THAN OTHERS.
I KNOW.
BUT WHEN YOU DO EVERYTHING THAT YOU CAN--
SOMETIMES EVEN MORE THAN YOU THOUGHT YOU COULD--
YOU GOT TO WALK AWAY KNOWING YOU FOUGHT THE GOOD FIGHT.
YOU FOUGHT THE GOOD FIGHT, LUCY.
TOMORROW, YOU'LL FIGHT ANOTHER ONE.
( sighing )
