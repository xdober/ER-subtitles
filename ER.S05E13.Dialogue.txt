PREVIOUSLY ON E.R.:
I WANTED TO MENTION
I'VE BEEN HAVING A PROBLEM WITH DR. ROMANO.
WHY DIDN'T THE GENETICS CLINIC SUGGEST THIS MEDICATION?
IT'S BRAND-NEW.
IT'S PART OF A CLINICAL TRIAL.
DO I NEED TO FILL ANY OF THIS OUT?
I WOULDN'T BOTHER.
HE'S NOT A CANDIDATE FOR THE STUDY.
BREAKING RESEARCH PROTOCOL
COULD DAMAGE THE HOSPITAL'S FUNDING.
SO YOU AGREE WITH THEM?
NO, I SEE THEIR POINT.
DOUG, DON'T WALK AWAY.
DOUG!
HEY, JERRY, HAVE YOU SEEN DOUG?
HE DROPPED OFF SOME CHARTS.
SAID HE WAS GOING UP TOP FOR COFFEE.
UP TOP?
AS IN KEEP YOUR COAT ON.
I MISSED YOU THIS MORNING.
I TRIED NOT TO WAKE YOU.
AT LEAST ONE OF US
SHOULD GET MORE THAN FOUR HOURS OF SLEEP.
I LOVE YOU.
YOU KNOW THAT?
YES, I DO.
DOUG, WHAT'S GOING ON?
YOU ALL RIGHT?
I'M NOT THINKING ABOUT JUMPING
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE AFRAID OF.
THAT'S GOOD, 'CAUSE I'M ATTACHED TO YOU
SO YOU'D HAVE TO TAKE ME WITH YOU.
IT'S JUST... ALL THIS, JUST ABOUT HELPING A KID.
ALL WHAT?
YOU AND ME GETTING INTO IT.
HEY, THAT'S OVER AND DONE.
IT'S NOT OVER AND DONE FOR MARK AND KERRY.
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.
THEY SAID THEY WON'T MAKE A BIG DEAL OUT OF THIS.
THEY HAVE TO DO SOMETHING.
WHY?
TO PROVE THAT THEY NEVER WANTED
A PEDIATRIC ATTENDING IN THE FIRST PLACE.
DOUG...
ALL RIGHT... BUT THAT'S NOT FAIR.
NO.
( laughing )
HEY...
YOU PUT THE PATIENT FIRST
AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE SUPPOSED TO DO, ISN'T IT?
HMM?
YOU'RE GOOD TO ME, YOU KNOW THAT?
YEAH, I KNOW THAT.
( chuckling )
LARGELY, IT'S BEEN INNUENDO--
THE SLIGHTLY INAPPROPRIATE PHRASE
AT THE SLIGHTLY INAPPROPRIATE MOMENT.
I'M NOT SURE YOU'D EVEN CONSIDER IT
SEXUAL HARASSMENT.
WELL, IF YOU COULD GIVE ME SOME SPECIFICS.
WELL, ONE OF THE MORE RIDICULOUS ONES WAS WHEN HE SPOKE OF
SNIFFING MY TAILPIPE.
( coughs )
EXCUSE ME?
I HAD JUST PARKED
AND HE SAID WORDS TO THE EFFECT THAT
HAD HE KNOWN IT WAS MY CAR
HE WOULD HAVE SNIFFED MY TAILPIPE.
AND I ASKED HIM WHAT HE WAS TALKING ABOUT.
HE SAID SOMETHING LIKE
"OH, I THOUGHT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT SEX."
BUT YOU WEREN'T.
NO, OF COURSE NOT.
I WAS COMING IN TO DO
A GASTROPLASTY.
DID DR. ROMANO
EVER GIVE YOU ANY REASON
FOR TERMINATING YOUR FELLOWSHIP?
UM... I WAS LED TO BELIEVE THAT
HE DIDN'T HAVE TO GIVE ME A REASON.
BUT HE DIDN'T SPONSOR ANYONE ELSE
AND THE FUNDING DIDN'T GO AWAY.
NOPE.
SO WHY DO YOU THINK
HE DID IT?
WELL, I SUPPOSE HE COULD HAVE BEEN PUNISHING ME.
UM... WE WENT OUT TO LUNCH ONCE.
HE LAID HIS HEART ON HIS SLEEVE
TOLD ME HE FOUND ME VERY ATTRACTIVE
AND ASKED IF WE MIGHT GO OUT TOGETHER ON A DATE.
AND HOW LONG AFTER THAT DID THE FELLOWSHIP END?
A MATTER OF WEEKS. UM...
BUT WE DON'T KNOW FOR CERTAIN IF THE TWO ARE RELATED, DO WE?
THAT WILL BE FOR OTHERS TO DECIDE.
WHAT OTHERS?
IF A FULL INVESTIGATION GOES FORWARD.
AND HOW WILL THAT BE DETERMINED?
DR. WEAVER, DR. CORDAY.
I JUST ORDERED
THE HIGH-CHOLESTEROL BREAKFAST: THREE EGGS, PIGS IN A BLANKET
AND BISCUITS AND GRAVY.
MAY I JOIN YOU?
UNFORTUNATELY, WE JUST FINISHED.
OH.
DRAINS TO PULL, THAT SORT OF THING.
I GUESS I'LL HAVE TO ADMINISTER C.P.R. TO MYSELF.
DOCTORS.
YEP.
( coughing )
I'VE BEEN SITTING FOR THREE DAYS.
I WOULD RATHER WALK IF YOU DON'T MIND.
I'D RATHER YOU SIT, MA'AM.
WE'RE GOING IN HERE.
I GOT US A CUSTOMER. S.O.B. WITH A COUGH.
WHO ARE YOU CALLING A SON OF A BITCH?
THAT JUST MEANS "SHORTNESS OF BREATH."
OKAY, LET'S GET YOU SEATED ON THE GURNEY
AND TAKE OFF THIS COAT.
NO, NO. IT'S COLD IN HERE.
WE'LL PROMISE TO GIVE YOU THE COAT BACK WHEN YOU LEAVE.
JUST GIVE ME SOME MEDICINE.
YOU NEED TO HELP US OUT.
OH, SPARKY.
GET BACK UP HERE.
YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED ANIMALS IN HERE.
( gasping ): GIVE ME COUGH MEDICINE AND I'LL GET OUT.
UH... TELL YOU WHAT.
WHY DON'T YOU LET MALIK
TAKE CARE OF SPARKY
WHILE I QUICKLY EXAMINE YOU, OKAY?
ARE YOU A DOG PERSON?
YEAH. SURE.
OKAY. ANY FEVER?
HEY, SPARKY.
NO.
COUGHING UP ANY YELLOW OR GREEN SPUTUM?
NO.
THIS MIGHT BE A LITTLE COLD.
( gasping )
( raspy breathing )
I HEAR A FEW CRACKLES.
I'D LIKE TO GET A CHEST X RAY--
MAKE SURE YOU DON'T HAVE PNEUMONIA.
ALICE, YOU'RE A SMOKER?
YEAH. BREAKS UP THE BOREDOM OUT THERE ON THE ROAD.
I JUST DROVE STRAIGHT FROM ALBUQUERQUE.
WHY?
I DON'T KNOW.
IF I'D KNOWN IT WAS THIS COLD IN CHICAGO
I'D HAVE GONE TO MIAMI.
HOW MUCH WILL THIS COST?
I DON'T HAVE THE INSURANCE.
I DON'T HAVE THE MONEY.
ALICE, WE'RE A COUNTY HOSPITAL.
IF YOU CAN'T PAY, IT'S SUBSIDIZED.
YOU HAVE ANY FAMILY IN CHICAGO YOU'D LIKE US TO CALL FOR YOU?
I DON'T KNOW A SOUL IN CHICAGO.
OKAY, YOU STAY RIGHT HERE
KEEP AN EYE ON SPARKY
AND MALIK AND I WILL BE RIGHT BACK.
I'LL ORDER A PORTABLE X RAY.
GOOD IDEA.
I DON'T THINK RADIOLOGY WANTS TO DEAL WITH SPARKY.
CAROL, MEDICAL RECORDS JUST SENT THESE CHARTS UP FOR REVIEW.
YEAH, WE SENT THEM LAST WEEK.
THEN WHY'D THEY COME BACK?
LIKE THEY SAID:
FOR REVIEW BY THE INTERIM CHIEF.
THAT'S YOU AGAIN, RIGHT?
THANK YOU FOR STRAIGHTENING THAT OUT, MALIK.
UGH.
RICHARD TUGGLE, 35.
COMPLAINS OF 20 MINUTES OF HEAVY, SUBSTERNAL CHEST PAIN
WITH NAUSEA AND DIAPHORESIS.
I FELT OKAY THIS MORNING.
COMING THROUGH!
SORRY. I'LL COME BACK.
IT'S NO PROBLEM.
OKAY, LET'S GO.
HERE WE GO.
B.P.'s 140/88, PULSE 90.
CHEST PAIN WAS RELIEVED BY TWO SPRAYS OF NITRO
AND THAT'S ALL SHE WROTE.
C.B.C., CHEM 20, CARDIAC ENZYMES.
HELP HIM OUT OF THAT.
AND A 12 LEAD.
HAVE YOU HAD PAIN LIKE THIS BEFORE?
NEVER.
ANY HISTORY OF HEART DISEASE?
NO.
HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE? DIABETES?
NO. I'M REALLY HEALTHY.
WHEN YOU'RE FREE, DOUG'S WAITING IN THE LOUNGE.
I'LL BE THERE IN A MINUTE.
PULSE OX IS 99 ON TWO LITERS.
WEREN'T OUT SHOVELING SNOW, WERE YOU?
NO, I WORK AT HOME. I'M A TELEMARKETER.
SO WHAT IS IT?
I HAVE A HEART ATTACK?
WELL, YOU'RE A LITTLE YOUNG FOR THAT.
WE'LL DO SOME BLOOD WORK
AND MONITOR YOUR HEART FOR A WHILE.
DON'T WORRY, WE'LL FIGURE IT OUT.
Man: I HEAR AN EJECTION MURMUR.
HMM. I HOPE NOT.
CARTER?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
AH, DR. ANSPAUGH.
MEET DUDZIK, HILTZIK AND STRAUSS.
SECOND YEARS.
PATIENT-DOCTOR CLASS.
NEED SOMETHING?
WELL, I WAS HOPING YOU COULD GIVE ME SOME TIME, BUT, UH...
NEVER MIND.
WHERE'S YOUR STUDENT, MS. KNIGHT?
SURGERY ROTATION.
RIGHT.
NEVER MIND.
SURE YOU DON'T WANT A CUP OF COFFEE?
NO, I'M NOT HAVING ANY TROUBLE STAYING AWAKE.
OKAY.
SO WHAT'S THE VERDICT?
NO BIG VERDICT.
WE AGREED THAT WE'RE GOING TO KEEP THIS QUIET
SO THAT WE DON'T JEOPARDIZE HOSPITAL FUNDING.
BUT MARK AND I WANT SOME ASSURANCE
THIS WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN
SO ANYTIME YOU WANT TO PRESCRIBE
SCHEDULE TWO NARCOTICS--
MORPHINE, DEMEROL, DILAUDID, FENTANYL, METHADONE--
WE WANT TO CO-SIGN THE ORDER.
THAT'S IT?
THAT'S IT.
OKAY.
WELL, IF IT'LL SETTLE THINGS DOWN, I'LL AGREE TO DO IT.
OKAY.
YOU KNOW, WHETHER YOU BELIEVE ME OR NOT
I DON'T HAVE SOME COMPULSION FOR BREAKING THE RULES.
SOMETIMES THEY GET IN THE WAY OF HELPING A PATIENT, BUT...
IF YOU'D SEEN HOW MUCH PAIN THIS KID WAS IN
YOU WOULD'VE DONE THE SAME THING.
DOUG, WE HAVE SEEN THAT KIND OF PAIN.
DR. ROSS, CAROL NEEDS YOU IN CURTAIN THREE.
THANKS, JERRY.
WORSE THAN ANYTHING I SAW WITH MICHAEL--
AND HIS SEIZURES HAVE INCREASED.
JOI, COME SIT.
DR. JULIAN WANTS TO ADMIT HIM
BUT I JUST CAN'T DO THAT.
ROGER JULIAN?
HIS DOCTOR UP IN GENETICS.
YEAH, I KNOW HIM.
JOI SPOKE TO HIM THIS MORNING.
MICHAEL, MY OLDEST, WAS IN THE I.C.U.
HIS WHOLE LAST WEEK
HOOKED UP TO ALL THOSE TUBES.
( sobbing )
I KNOW RICKY DOESN'T HAVE MUCH TIME
BUT I JUST CAN'T DO THAT TO HIM.
CAN WE KEEP RICKY HERE?
NO, PLEASE. I JUST WANT TO TAKE HIM HOME.
OKAY. I'M GOING TO TALK TO ROGER.
BUT I THINK WE SHOULD ARRANGE
FOR SOMETHING CALLED P.C.A.
WHICH IS PATIENT CONTROLLED ANALGESIA.
WE WOULD HOOK RICKY UP
TO AN I.V. THAT WOULD DELIVER
PAIN MEDICATION TO HIM AT HOME.
NOW, OBVIOUSLY, YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO CONTROL IT.
WILL IT BE STRONGER MEDICINE THAN WHAT YOU GAVE HIM BEFORE?
DILAUDID OR FENTANYL.
OKAY. I'LL DO WHATEVER IT TAKES, DR. ROSS
JUST SO I CAN KEEP HIM AT HOME.
I KNOW HE... PROBABLY WON'T KNOW THE DIFFERENCE, BUT...
IT'S OKAY. WE'LL LET YOU KNOW AS SOON AS
WE CAN SET IT UP, OKAY?
OKAY?
ALL RIGHT. I'LL GO FIND ROGER.
YOU SET UP AN I.V.
ALL RIGHT?
YEP.
GETTING NEAR THE END.
IF THE SURVIVAL RATE IS THE SAME
THEN WHY NOT DO THE LUMPECTOMY AND SAVE THE BREAST?
WELL, BECAUSE WITH A MODIFIED RADICAL MASTECTOMY
YOU CAN SAVE THE PATIENT.
ALTHOUGH A LUMPECTOMY CAN GET AROUND THE TUMOR.
AND THEN YOU'D DO RADIATION THERAPY.
YEAH. AND THERE CAN BE SEVERE SIDE EFFECTS.
THERE CAN BE WITH REMOVING A BREAST.
HEY, LOOK, I'M NOT DISCOUNTING THE PSYCHOLOGICAL IMPACT HERE.
ACTUALLY, I THINK YOU ARE, JUST A BIT.
YOU'LL DISCOVER MOST MALE SURGEONS
FIND IT RELATIVELY EASY TO JUST LOP OFF A BREAST.
ELIZABETH, COME ON, THAT'S CLICHE, DON'T YOU THINK?
YEAH, BECAUSE IT'S TRUE.
IT'S A REALLY PERSONAL DECISION THIS WOMAN HAS TO MAKE.
SHE'S GOING TO WORRY ABOUT HER SEXUALITY, HER SELF-IMAGE.
LISTEN, A PATIENT COMES IN HERE WITH CANCER
I SAY, WE CUT IT OUT.
SEE, EVEN THERE, YOU THINK OF HER IN TERMS
OF BEING A PATIENT, NOT IN TERMS
OF HER BEING A WOMAN.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
UH, IT'S, IT'S NOT THAT COMPLICATED.
YOU DON'T WANT IT TO BE THAT COMPLICATED.
JUST CUT TO THE CHASE, SO TO SPEAK.
WELL, ISN'T THIS A SCRUB FEST?
HEY, PETER, YOU MIND IF I BORROW YOUR INTERN?
I GOT STUCK DOING AN APPY.
NO. I'VE ONLY GOT A BIOPSY.
LUCY, YOU'RE WITH ME.
THANKS. APPRECIATE IT.
YOU REALLY NEED MY ASSISTANCE ON AN APPENDECTOMY?
COURSE NOT, BUT I'D LOVE THE COMPANY.
SO, HOW WAS BREAKFAST?
IT WAS COFFEE, ACTUALLY.
WOMEN NEVER SEEM TO EAT BREAKFAST ANYMORE, DO THEY?
NOW IT'S JUST COFFEE OR SOMETIMES MAYBE A MUFFIN.
THEY WORRIED ABOUT THEIR WEIGHT
OR THAT THEY'LL GET A REPUTATION
FOR EATING LIKE A HORSE OR...?
I REALLY COULDN'T SAY.
CAN YOU SAY
WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT
WITH KERRY WEAVER OVER THEIR COFFEE?
YOU CAN STOP PLAYING GAMES, ROBERT.
I KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON.
I KNOW SOMEONE'S ACCUSED YOU.
AH, FALSELY.
BUT IF SOMEONE LIKE KERRY WEAVER
STARTS ROOTING AROUND
AND DECIDES SHE'S DETERMINED TO DIG UP SOMETHING, YOU KNOW--
THAT'S HOW PEOPLE GET HURT.
YEP. THAT'S TRUE.
I MEAN, FOR INSTANCE, UH... WHAT IF, UH, IT CAME OUT
THAT, UH... YOU WERE SLEEPING WITH PETER BENTON
WHILE YOU WERE HIS INTERN AND HE WAS
YOUR SUPERVISOR
IN A POSITION TO EVALUATE YOU
WHICH, I'M SURE YOU'RE AWARE, IS A VERY BIG NO-NO.
( chuckling ): COME ON.
PETER AND I WERE TOGETHER BEFORE I WAS HIS INTERN.
AND YOU MADE ANSPAUGH AWARE OF THAT, RIGHT?
BECAUSE THAT'S GROUNDS FOR DISMISSAL.
I MEAN NOT FOR YOU, OF COURSE
BUT FOR PETER-- DR. BENTON--
WHICH WOULD BE A REAL SHAME
CONSIDERING HOW MUCH WORK
HE'S PUT INTO, UH, GETTING WHERE HE IS.
YOU WOULDN'T DARE.
I WOULDN'T LIKE MYSELF VERY MUCH IF I DID THAT, WOULD I?
ANYWAY... IT'S NOT REALLY IN MY HANDS, IS IT?
FILMS ARE BACK ON ALICE PRESLEY AND SHE'S ANTSY TO GO.
I TOLD HER I'D ROUND UP SOME MEAT LOAF FOR SPARKY.
THANKS, MALIK.
HEY, STEVE.
NURSE HATHAWAY, ALWAYS A PLEASURE.
I'VE KEPT THESE UP SO YOU CAN SEE FOR YOURSELF
AND AS YOU CAN SEE FOR YOURSELF
THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF PNEUMONIA.
THERE IS PERHAPS A SLIGHT INCREASE
IN BRONCHOVASCULAR MARKINGS
WHICH COULD BE SMOKING-INDUCED
ALTHOUGH IT'S MORE LIKELY SHE SIMPLY HAS THE FLU
NOT UNLIKE HALF THE TECHS IN OUR DEPARTMENT.
IN OTHER WORDS, WHAT WE HAVE HERE
IS ESSENTIALLY NORMAL CHEST FILM.
I'D LIKE A V/Q SCAN.
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK SHE HAS A P.E.?
SHE'S A SMOKER, SHE'S HYPOXIC
SHE'S BEEN DRIVING FOR 18 HOURS
PUTTING HER AT RISK FOR BLOOD CLOTS IN HER LEGS.
WHAT'S HER HEART RATE?
EIGHTY-FIVE.
RESPIRATORY RATE?
TWENTY.
ANY CALF TENDERNESS?
NOT REALLY.
WELL, NOTHING YOU'VE SAID
SO FAR SUGGESTS PULMONARY EMBOLUS.
SHE HAS PLEURITIC CHEST PAIN.
SO DOES EVERYONE WITH BRONCHITIS.
LOOK, I KNOW THERE ISN'T HARD EVIDENCE.
IT'S JUST A FEELING I HAVE.
WELL, UNFORTUNATELY, I CANNOT AUTHORIZE AN $800 TEST
BASED ON YOUR INTUITION.
YOUR PATIENT HAS A COUGH
AND NO INSURANCE, I MIGHT ADD.
SO THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ABOUT-- PAYMENT?
NO, ALTHOUGH THE HOSPITAL DOES LIKE TO COVER ITS EXPENSES.
I'LL PAY FOR IT.
YOUR CHECKBOOK IS MY COMMAND.
THANKS, STEVE.
ONE V/Q SCAN... COMING UP.
CAROL, WE GOT A COUPLE MORE HACKERS FOR YOU.
I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD
AND STICK THEM INTO EXAM TWO.
OH, NO, NO, NO. I-IT'S NOT READY YET.
YES, IT IS. YOUR PATIENT JUST LEFT.
ALICE PRESLEY? IS SHE NUTS?
SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT WALKING HER SPARKY.
OH, GOD.
SO I PROMISED ANSPAUGH I'D REVIEW CHARTS FOR HIM.
AM I A SUCKER OR WHAT?
( chuckling )
YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T HAVE TO AGREE WITH ME.
YOU OKAY?
YES. IT'S SLIPPERY.
BUT I'M FINE.
GOOD LUCK, MARK.
HOW'S HE DOING?
OH, PAIN FREE, NORMAL SINUS, NO ECTOPY.
WHICH IS ALL GOOD, RIGHT?
YES, BUT I GOT SOME OF YOUR BLOOD WORK BACK
AND I'M CONCERNED BECAUSE YOUR CHOLESTEROL IS 465.
THAT DOESN'T SOUND GOOD.
IT'S NOT.
DO YOU HAVE A FAMILY HISTORY OF HIGH CHOLESTEROL?
DID YOUR FATHER OR ANY MALE RELATIVE
HAVE HEART TROUBLE IN THEIR 30s?
I DON'T KNOW.
BECAUSE THERE ARE INHERITED CONDITIONS WHICH RUN IN FAMILIES
AND CAN CAUSE HIGH LIPID LEVELS.
SO YOU MIGHT WANT TO CHECK BECAUSE THEY CAN PUT YOU
AT RISK FOR A HEART ATTACK
AT AN EARLY AGE.
I CAN'T CHECK-- I WAS ADOPTED.
I DON'T HAVE A CLUE ABOUT ANY MEDICAL HISTORY.
I'D LIKE TO ADMIT YOU THEN
SO WE CAN START YOU ON A CHOLESTEROL-LOWERING AGENT
AND DO A COMPLETE WORKUP.
ALICE, WAIT! WAIT!
YOU NEED TO STAY FOR ONE MORE TEST.
NO, I REALLY CAN'T; MIAMI CALLS.
YOU DON'T WANT TO GET STUCK ON THE ROAD AND BE SICK.
NO, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.
I CAN'T LEAVE THE PUPS OUT IN THE COLD.
IT'S OKAY. YOU CAN BRING SPARKY BACK IN.
I WON'T TELL ANYONE.
NO, YOU REALLY DON'T UNDERSTAND.
IT'S NOT JUST SPARKY.
I DIDN'T START OUT TO COLLECT THEM OR ANYTHING.
IT JUST KIND OF HAPPENED.
COME ON, JULES. WE DID OUR RESIDENCIES TOGETHER.
THE OLD SCHOOL TIE IS NOT GOING TO WORK.
I HATED MY RESIDENCY.
THERE YOU GO. SO DID I.
I KNOW RICKY CAN'T CONTROL HIS ANALGESIC
BUT THE MOTHER'S WILLING TO DO IT.
UP IN GENETICS, WE PREFER TO ADMIT THESE END-STAGE KIDS.
WE DON'T HAVE EXPERIENCE WITH HOME CARE.
YOU DO IT WITH CANCER KIDS ALL THE TIME.
THEY SEND THEM HOME, TO HOSPICES.
MAYBE ONCOLOGY CAN HELP YOU OUT.
I DON'T HAVE TIME TO WADE THROUGH THAT DEPARTMENT.
THIS KID'S IN BAD SHAPE; HE NEEDS IT.
DOUG, LOOK...
JULES, COME ON.
LOOK, I'LL TALK TO THE REST OF THE TEAM ABOUT IT, OKAY?
WE MEET DAY AFTER TOMORROW.
I CAN LET YOU KNOW THEN.
RICKY DOESN'T HAVE TILL THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW.
I'M SORRY.
OUCH. YOU'RE POKING TOO HARD.
STRAUSS, STOP YOUR WHINING.
THESE ARE THE ANTERIOR CHAINS
AND THESE ARE THE... POSTERIOR.
AS YOU EXAMINE, ASK YOURSELF:
DO THE NODES FEEL LIKE BB's
LIKE PEAS OR SOUR BALLS?
I GOT TWO BB's.
I GOT ONE BB, ONE SOUR BALL.
DUDZIK, QUIT GOOFING.
IT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE A BB.
IT'S NOT A PEA.
IT CAN BE TOUGH
TO ESTIMATE THE SIZE AT FIRST.
BB AND A PEA, RIGHT?
HMM.
HAVE YOU HAD ANY, UH... ANY NIGHT SWEATS?
ANY WEIGHT LOSS?
( chuckling ): GEEZ, WHAT IS THIS?
HAVE YOU?
NO. I FEEL FINE.
NOTICED ANY ENLARGED NODES ANYWHERE ELSE?
WAIT. YOU'RE KIDDING, RIGHT?
NO. NOTHING.
I'M SURE IT'S NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.
MIGHT GET ANOTHER DOCTOR TO TAKE A LOOK, THOUGH.
MAYBE DO A BIOPSY.
A BIOPSY?
( groaning )
HI.
LISTEN, I'M MARK GREENE.
I'M SORRY, I... I DON'T KNOW YOUR NAME.
MOBALAGE.
MOBALAGE EKABO.
YOU'VE OBVIOUSLY DONE SOMETHING TO YOUR BACK.
WHY DON'T YOU LET ME TAKE A LOOK?
NO. UH... IT'S BEEN LIKE THIS FOR A LONG TIME.
I'M ALL RIGHT.
IT MIGHT BE A SLIPPED DISK. LET ME TAKE A LOOK.
COME ON.
THIS WON'T TAKE LONG.
SIT DOWN RIGHT HERE.
( groaning )
SO, DID YOU JUST START HERE RECENTLY?
IT'S BEEN SEVERAL MONTHS.
REALLY.
HAVEN'T SEEN YOU AROUND MUCH.
I WORKED ON OTHER FLOORS.
WELL, WE'RE GLAD TO HAVE YOU DOWN HERE.
THANK YOU.
JUST CLOSING THE CURTAIN FOR A LITTLE PRIVACY.
OKAY.
YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND TAKE YOUR SHIRT OFF NOW.
NO, PLEASE.
STOP, PLEASE.
NO.
STOP IT, PLEASE. NO.
STOP!
I'M NOT DOING ANYTHING.
STOP IT NOW!
STOP IT! STOP IT!
IT'S OKAY. STOP IT!
MALIK, NEED SOME HELP?
NO, I'M COOL.
I'M JUST GOING IN HERE.
HEY, HOW DID YOU DO?
GOOD, AS LONG AS THEY LIKE CHEESE SLIDERS.
SURE WE AIN'T BREAKING THE RULES?
NO, MALIK, SNEAKING DOGS IN THROUGH WINDOWS
AND FEEDING THEM CHEESEBURGERS
ISN'T BREAKING THE RULES.
DID YOU SAY CHEESEBURGERS?
THAT'S THEIR FAVORITE.
Hathaway: SHUT THE DOOR.
PLEASE DON'T ASK.
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU JUST FOR A SECOND OUTSIDE.
UH... YEAH. MALIK, YOU OKAY IN HERE?
OH, HE'S DOING GREAT.
THE PUPS LOVE HIM.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK. SHH!
OH, OH, AND AFTER THEY EAT
THAT'S USUALLY WHEN THEY NEED TO GO OUTSIDE
MAKE A LITTLE POOP.
GENETICS BAILED ON US.
WE CAN'T GET A P.C.A. FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS.
MAYBE I CAN ARRANGE IT THROUGH THE CLINIC.
I'LL CALL A HOME HEALTH CARE AGENCY I'VE WORKED WITH.
IT'S WORTH A TRY.
JERRY, DID YOU FIND OUT ABOUT THAT GUY MOBALAGE?
NO. HOUSEKEEPING HASN'T CALLED BACK YET.
I HEARD ABOUT THAT.
WHAT HAPPENED?
HE JUST FLIPPED OUT.
I HADN'T EVEN STARTED THE EXAM.
YOU KNOW, RACHEL CALLED AND SAID SHE'S GOING
WITH THE PURPLE FRAMES, WHATEVER THAT MEANS.
AH, POOR RACHEL.
SHE JUST FOUND OUT THAT SHE NEEDS GLASSES.
SHE COULDN'T SEE THE BLACKBOARD AT SCHOOL.
OH, YEAH, I HATED WHEN THAT HAPPENED.
I FELT LIKE SUCH AN EIGHT-YEAR-OLD GEEK.
HAPPENED TO ME AT NINE--
SAME AGE AS RACHEL.
FIERCELY BAD EYESIGHT
ON MY SIDE OF THE FAMILY.
YOU MUST HAVE HAD FIERCELY RED HAIR
ON YOUR SIDE OF THE FAMILY.
YEAH.
I HOPE THAT'S THE WORST THING
THAT I PASS ON FROM MY GENE POOL.
IT'S NOT LIKE SHE'S GOING TO GO BALD.
JERRY, WEREN'T YOU GOING
TO CHECK THOSE LABS FOR MRS. VOLPE?
YES, I WAS.
I AM.
YOU OWE HER, JERRY.
WHERE DID YOU SAY CARTER IS?
SUTURE.
( phone rings )
E.R.
MALIK, WHERE ARE YOU?
YEAH. OKAY.
I'LL BE THERE TO HELP YOU IN A FEW MINUTES.
I GOT IT ON MY SECOND CALL--
ONE OF THE AGENCIES I USED FOR P.C.A.
ON A CANCER PATIENT A FEW MONTHS AGO.
AND JOI'S HEALTH INSURANCE WILL COVER IT.
YOU TELL HER ABOUT IT?
NO. I THINK YOU'D BETTER EXPLAIN IT TO HER.
JOI, IT LOOKS LIKE WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE
TO PROVIDE THAT PAIN MEDICATION WE TALKED ABOUT.
NOW? TODAY?
WELL, A HOME HEALTH CARE AGENCY
WILL DELIVER THE MACHINE TO YOUR HOUSE.
THE MACHINE WILL BE SET
TO DELIVER A SPECIFIC AMOUNT OF DILAUDID EVERY HOUR.
WHEN DO I PUSH THE BUTTON?
WHENEVER YOU FEEL LIKE HE'S IN PAIN.
HOW DO I KNOW HOW MUCH TO GIVE?
YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THAT.
THERE'S ONLY ONE BOOSTER DOSE
WITHIN A TWO-HOUR PERIOD
AND THEN THE MACHINE
WILL AUTOMATICALLY LOCK OUT ANY ADDITIONAL DOSE.
DR. ROSS WILL WRITE YOU
A PRESCRIPTION, AND I'LL ARRANGE FOR THE MEDIVAN
TO TAKE YOU AND RICKY HOME.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU BOTH SO MUCH.
I JUST WISH
WE COULD DO MORE.
OH, IT STARTED SNOWING AGAIN.
YEAH, ABOUT AN HOUR AGO.
LISTEN, KERRY, UH... I'VE BEEN THINKING
AND, UM... I DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE
WITH WHAT I TOLD YOU THIS MORNING.
WELL, NONE OF US ARE REALLY AT EASE WITH THE SITUATION.
WHAT I MEAN TO SAY IS
I DON'T FEEL THERE WAS ANY HARASSMENT INVOLVED.
THAT'S NOT OUR DECISION TO MAKE.
WHEN THE FULL COMMITTEE HEARS THE TESTIMONY...
I DON'T BELIEVE I'LL BE TESTIFYING.
I MEAN, IF I'M NOT CONVINCED MYSELF
THEN I DON'T FEEL I SHOULD PUT IT FORTH
INTO AN OFFICIAL RECORD.
ELIZABETH, DID SOMETHING HAPPEN TODAY?
NO, NO. I JUST DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY RELEVANCE
TO THE INCIDENTS I MENTIONED.
AND, THAT BEING THE CASE, I THINK IT'S ONLY
RIGHT AND PROPER THAT I SHOULD WITHDRAW MY STATEMENT.
I'M REALLY SORRY--
SORRY THAT I WASTED YOUR TIME.
I HOPE YOU UNDERSTAND.
READY TO GO IN HERE?
YEP. LABS ARE ALL OKAY.
UPON PHYSICAL EXAM
NO SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS IN THE HEAD OR NECK
OTHER THAN THE ENLARGED
JUGULODIGASTRIC NODE IN THE RIGHT SUBMAXILLARY AREA.
YOU WANT TO DO THE HONORS, CARTER?
YOU KNOW, I'VE ACTUALLY NEVER DONE A NECK BIOPSY.
OKAY. WELL, HERE'S YOUR CHANCE.
YOU READY THERE, MR. STRAUSS?
YEAH. OKAY.
SO, THIS V/Q THING WAS POSITIVE?
YES, WHICH MEANS THAT SMALL BLOOD CLOTS
HAVE TRAVELED FROM YOUR LEGS
AND IF THIS CONDITION ISN'T TREATED
A LARGER BLOOD CLOT COULD LODGE IN YOUR LUNG.
THAT DOES SOUND BAD.
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO GET MYSELF
BACK HERE REAL SOON...
NO. YOU NEED TO BE ADMITTED TODAY
AND YOU NEED TO STAY FOR FOUR OR FIVE DAYS
SO THAT YOUR BLOOD CAN BE ANTICOAGULATED...
NO. MY DOGS; I CAN'T LEAVE...
I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO
BUT I PROMISE, WE'LL THINK OF SOMETHING.
EXCUSE ME, CAROL...
OH, JERRY!
DAMN IT, JERRY!
GO!
GO!
GO GET THEM, JERRY!
GET THEM!
OH...
HEY, MARK, RICKY ABBOTT, THE KID WITH A.L.D.
HE'S BACK; HE'S IN PRETTY BAD SHAPE.
I ARRANGED FOR HIS MOTHER
TO HAVE A HOME P.C.A. MACHINE
I NEED YOU TO SIGN OFF ON THE DILAUDID.
HE'S A GENETICS PATIENT, RIGHT?
RIGHT, BUT HE'S DOWN HERE NOW.
I CAN'T SIGN OFF ON THAT.
HE'S NOT ON OUR SERVICE.
I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE EASIER.
MAYBE, BUT THAT'S THEIR DEAL.
GO UP TO GENETICS AND HAVE THEM SIGN OFF ON IT.
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.
PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF THAT
IN THE FIRST PLACE, HUH?
HEY. HEY.
YOU HAVE A BREAK OUT?
YEAH, SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
OKAY, YOU'RE ON, ALL SET.
OKAY, THANKS. I'LL GIVE IT TO HER
AS SOON I GET RID OF THIS LITTLE GUY.
ALL RIGHT.
JERRY...
SORRY, DR. GREENE.
HI.
I WAS LOOKING FOR YOU.
HI.
I AM VERY SORRY, UM...
I CAN PAY FOR THE CURTAIN.
I DON'T CARE ABOUT THE CURTAIN.
I WAS WONDERING IF YOU WERE OKAY.
I WON'T CAUSE ANY TROUBLE
AND, UH, I'D LIKE TO KEEP MY JOB.
YOU DIDN'T CAUSE ANY TROUBLE
AND NO ONE IS GOING TO TAKE YOUR JOB.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
I DO THINK THAT YOU PROBABLY HAVE A PAIN IN YOUR BACK
AND I'D LIKE TO HELP YOU IF I CAN.
I THINK MY BACK IS FINE, UM...
BUT THERE IS SOMETHING.
I'M HOPING YOU CAN GIVE IT TO ME.
WHAT'S THAT?
I BELIEVE IT'S CALLED VIAGRA.
THAT'S MEDICATION USED FOR IMPOTENCE.
I AM IMPOTENT.
KERRY.
ROBERT, MAY I SIT DOWN?
CERTAINLY. I'D OFFER YOU
SOMETHING TO DRINK, BUT...
DID YOU SPEAK
WITH ELIZABETH CORDAY TODAY?
SHE ASSISTED ME ON AN APPY.
IS THAT WHEN
YOU SPOKE TO HER ABOUT MAGGIE DOYLE'S
SEXUAL HARASSMENT INQUIRY?
WHY WOULD I DO THAT?
TO STOP IT FROM GOING FORWARD.
I AM EAGER FOR IT TO GO AHEAD.
I'M LOOKING FORWARD
TO BEING VINDICATED.
OH... THEN YOU'RE GOING TO BE DISAPPOINTED
BECAUSE THE INVESTIGATION'S BEEN CLOSED.
REALLY? HMM.
WELL, I GUESS WE'LL ALL HAVE TO GO BACK
TO OUR HUMDRUM LIVES THEN, WON'T WE?
OF COURSE, ALL THE TESTIMONY HAS BEEN TYPED UP.
I'VE GOT IT IN A FILE.
MM-HMM.
AND-AND THE THING THAT REALLY STICKS OUT
IS THAT BAD EVALUATION YOU GAVE DR. DOYLE.
SHE'S RECEIVED SUCH POSITIVE REMARKS
ON HER OTHER ROTATIONS.
SO, YOU'RE THINKING
THAT PERHAPS I WAS A LITTLE BIT HASTY
AND THAT IF I, UM...
SPEND A LITTLE MORE TIME ON IT...
YES. I'M THINKING
THAT IF YOU TOOK THAT TIME, RIGHT NOW
YOU MIGHT WRITE
SOMETHING VERY DIFFERENT.
WHICH YOU'D CERTAINLY BE INTERESTED IN READING.
OH, ABSOLUTELY.
I IMAGINE I'D WANT TO PUT IT IN THAT FILE.
SO, MOBALAGE, WHERE ARE YOU FROM?
NIGERIA.
HMM.
THAT'S A WAYS AWAY FROM HERE.
HOW DO YOU LIKE CHICAGO?
OKAY.
MY WIFE DOES NOT LIKE THE COLD.
SHE WORKS HERE IN YOUR CAFETERIA.
OH, THAT MUST BE NICE.
BOTH OF YOU--
WATCH MY FINGER--
COME TO THE SAME PLACE FOR WORK.
MM-HMM.
OKAY. I NEED TO, UH...
PULL THE GOWN DOWN NOW
ALL RIGHT?
THE, UH, BURNS SEEM TO BE WELL-HEALED.
YES. THEY'RE NOT A PROBLEM.
HAD THEM FOR A WHILE?
WANT TO TELL ME HOW IT HAPPENED?
NO.
I NEED TO EXAMINE BELOW THE WAIST NOW.
I UNDERSTAND.
YOU'RE IN EARLY.
I HAVE NO LIFE.
DR. WEAVER, SAM BRODER CALLED BACK.
SAID HE WOULD MEET YOU AT DOC MAGOO'S AT 8:00.
THANKS, JERRY.
THAT SOUNDS LIKE A LIFE.
HOT DATE?
DOC MAGOO'S?
EVEN DR. WEAVER HAS HER STANDARDS.
THANK YOU, JERRY, I THINK.
DR. GREENE, PATH REPORT'S BACK
ON THAT MED STUDENT, STRAUSS.
LET HIM KNOW.
SENT THAT KID UP TO THE O.R.
HEY, YOU HAVE A MINUTE?
YEAH.
I WANTED TO FILL YOU IN ON SOMETHING.
LET'S GO IN THE LOUNGE.
SURE.
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THE PATHOLOGY REPORT.
YOU GUYS MIND HANGING OUTSIDE?
NO, THEY CAN STAY.
I ALREADY KNOW IT'S CRAPPY NEWS.
THE BIOPSY SHOWS HODGKIN'S DISEASE
WHICH IS A FORM OF LYMPHOMA.
OH, MAN.
YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND, THOUGH
THAT IT'S VERY TREATABLE
WITH RADIATION THERAPY.
YOUR CHANCES OF SURVIVING ARE EXTREMELY HIGH.
LOOK, CAN I JUST, UM...
CAN I JUST HAVE A FEW MINUTES HERE, PLEASE?
YEAH. I'LL CHECK BACK.
I'VE CONTACTED A PET RESCUE GROUP
THAT CAN TAKE ALL OF THE DOGS TOMORROW
BUT I NEED EACH OF YOU TO TAKE TWO OF THEM HOME
WITH YOU TONIGHT.
I CAN'T DO THAT, CAROL. I HAVE CATS.
YOU HAVE CATS?
WHAT'S WRONG WITH CATS?
SORRY, CAROL.
WELL, I'M A DOG PERSON.
I'LL TAKE TWO AND ONE OF JERRY'S.
I WANT THE LITTLE ONE.
NO, NO, NO, NO.
SPARKY IS MY MAN.
HEY, SPARKY.
I'LL TAKE TWO OF THE BIG ONES.
AL'S SICK OF THE LITTLE DOGS.
WHAT'S UP WITH THAT?
I'LL TAKE THIS AIREDALE IF NO ONE WANTS HIM.
CAROL, JOI ABBOTT'S ON THE PHONE FOR YOU.
OKAY. LISTEN, WORK IT OUT AMONGST YOURSELVES.
JUST GIVE ME ANY TWO, I DON'T CARE.
JUST TIE THEIR LEASHES TO MY LOCKER.
THERE YOU GO.
OH, HE'S SO CUTE.
HI, JOI. IT'S CAROL HATHAWAY.
WAIT, WAIT. JOI, WHAT'S WRONG?
WELL, DID THEY HOOK IT UP?
CAN YOU TELL IF IT'S WORKING PROPERLY?
UH, JOI, JOI, YOU NEED TO CALM DOWN
AND JUST TAKE YOUR TIME, ALL RIGHT?
JUST TAKE YOUR TIME.
INITIAL LAB TESTS DON'T REVEAL
ANYTHING LIKE DIABETES
WHICH MAY BE RELATED TO ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION.
I UNDERSTAND.
YOU'RE NOT ON ANY MEDICATIONS
THAT HAVE THAT SIDE EFFECT.
NO.
AND IF IT WAS PSYCHOLOGICAL
YOU COULD STILL HAVE
A SPONTANEOUS EARLY MORNING OR MID-SLEEP ERECTION.
NO, I DO NOT.
I THINK IT'S CAUSED BY TRAUMA.
IF YOU WERE IN AN ACCIDENT
OR MAYBE EVEN BEATEN.
IF YOUR PELVIS HAD BEEN BROKEN
INTERNAL BLEEDING COULD HAVE
COMPRESSED THE ARTERIES AND VEINS
AFFECTING THE BLOOD SUPPLY
TO AND FROM THE PENIS.
AND IF THAT IS THE CASE?
A UROLOGIST WOULD PROBABLY WANT
TO DO A VASCULAR BYPASS OPERATION
TO TRY TO RESTORE NORMAL FUNCTION.
I THINK YOU SHOULD SEE A UROLOGIST.
OKAY.
WHERE'S DR. ROMANO?
LAST SEEN IN THE LOUNGE.
WAS IT YOU?
SORRY?
THERE ARE ONLY A COUPLE OF NAMES
I GAVE DR. WEAVER.
ONE DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING CONCRETE
AND THE OTHER SEEMS TO HAVE BACKED OUT.
WAS THAT YOU, ELIZABETH?
DID YOU DECIDE TO PROTECT YOUR OWN PLACE
IN THE FOOD CHAIN?
STAY IN THE CLUB?
YES, I DID.
I'M SORRY, MAGGIE.
SORRY, MY ASS.
Ross; IF THE P.C.A. MACHINE ISN'T WORKING
THEN THEY HOOKED IT UP WRONG.
NO, IT'S HOOKED UP RIGHT.
SHE DOESN'T KNOW WHETHER TO GIVE HIM
A BOOSTER SHOT OR NOT.
IF SHE THINKS RICKY NEEDS IT.
BUT SHE CAN'T TELL.
IF SHE IS IN DOUBT
SHE SHOULD JUST GO AHEAD AND GIVE IT TO HIM.
IT'S NOT GOING TO MATTER THAT MUCH.
I DON'T THINK
HE'LL MAKE IT THROUGH THE NIGHT.
I TOLD HER WE'D GO OVER THERE.
WHY?
SHE KNOWS HOW TO WORK THE MACHINE.
WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO?
SHE'S ALL ALONE, DOUG.
SHE'S REALLY SCARED.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT GOOD IT WILL DO FOR US
TO BE THERE WATCHING HER SON DIE.
I KNOW.
I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW.
PROBABLY WON'T DO ANY GOOD.
I JUST REALLY WANT TO BE THERE.
OKAY.
I'LL PROBABLY BE HOME PRETTY LATE.
MOBALAGE, THEY TOLD ME YOU WERE HERE.
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS WRONG.
KUBBY, THIS IS DR. GREENE.
DR. GREENE, MY WIFE, KUBBY.
NICE TO MEET YOU.
HOW DO YOU DO?
I STRAINED MY BACK AND DR. GREENE
WAS KIND ENOUGH TO TAKE A LOOK AT IT
AND GIVE ME SOME PAIN MEDICATION.
YEAH, IT'S GOING TO PROBABLY BE BETTER
IN A COUPLE OF DAYS.
THANK YOU.
SOMETIMES HE TRIES
TO DO TOO MUCH AT HIS JOB.
HE WORKS TOO HARD.
YES, I KNOW.
I'LL BE FINE.
THANK YOU AGAIN, DR. GREENE.
YOU'RE WELCOME.
YOU'RE THE ONLY MAN SITTING ALONE
SO I'M HOPING YOU'RE SAM BRODER, RIGHT?
DR. WEAVER, NICE TO MEET YOU.
CALL ME KERRY.
MY OFFICE TELLS ME
YOU'VE MADE THREE OR FOUR APPOINTMENTS BEFORE
AND ALWAYS CANCELED THEM AT THE LAST MINUTE.
YOU'D THINK I WAS THE DENTIST.
YEAH, I'M SORRY.
IT'S PRETTY COMMON.
MAKING THE DECISION
TO TRACK DOWN YOUR BIRTH PARENTS
IS NOT SOMETHING YOU SHOULD DO LIGHTLY.
I'VE DONE THAT WHOLE INTERNET THING.
MOST PEOPLE START THERE
BUT I DO THIS FOR A LIVING.
MY COMPANY HANDLED
SEVERAL HUNDRED ADOPTION CASES LAST YEAR.
SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD LIVING.
( chuckles )
GOING TO NEED YOUR FULL NAME
DATE OF BIRTH, PLACE OF BIRTH
AND THE NAMES OF YOUR ADOPTIVE PARENTS.
I'M GLAD YOU COULD STEP IN
ON SUCH SHORT NOTICE, ROBERT.
I'M ALWAYS HAPPY TO GET A 16-YEAR-OLD UP AND RUNNING.
GET HIM BACK OUT THERE KISSING THE GIRLS
MAKING 'EM CRY.
( chuckles )
SO, HOW'S THIS INTERIM CHIEF THING WORKING OUT?
OH, MISERABLY.
BETWEEN MY SURGICAL DUTIES
AND ALL THE ADMINISTRATIVE CRAP DOWN THERE.
YEAH. IT'S A SHAME KERRY WEAVER
WASN'T ABLE TO CONTINUE.
ON TOP OF SURGERY, YOU'RE CHIEF OF STAFF...
I TACKLE THAT PART OF MY JOB AROUND MIDNIGHT.
DIDN'T IT WORK OUT FAIRLY WELL
WHEN DAVID MORGENSTERN WAS HANDLING SURGERY AND E.R.?
HE DID SEEM TO HAVE IT DOWN.
THEN I FEEL I'D BE REMISS
IF I DIDN'T OFFER UP MY SERVICES.
TO BE INTERIM CHIEF OF THE E.R.?
I THINK "ACTING CHIEF"
HAS A BIT MORE JE NE SAIS QUOI.
I DON'T CARE IF YOU CALL YOURSELF ALMIGHTY GOD
IF YOU'RE WILLING TO TAKE THAT ON.
WE'D STILL BE CONDUCTING A SEARCH.
AS LONG AS YOU NEED ME.
I NEEDED YOU TODAY.
HOW'S TOMORROW SOUND?
LIKE A STROKE OF LUCK.
SORRY IT'S ONLY INSTANT.
THERE WAS A DAY I USED TO GRIND THE BEANS.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
ANYTHING IS FINE.
( doorbell rings )
STAY HERE. I'LL GET IT.
HI.
HI.
( P.C.A. machine pumping )
( Ricky moaning softly )
( moans softly )
