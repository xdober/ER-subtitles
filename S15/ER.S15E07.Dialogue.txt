Hello. I'm Eriq La Salle.
This past week, we lost the creator of our show
Michael Crichton.
He was a true gentleman, gracious and witty
a brilliant writer, intelligent and unfailingly kind.
But most of all, Michael was a good friend
and we will miss him.
(female narrator) Previously on"ER."
So you don't remember anything like this..
I forget lots of stuff.
Do I know you?
You look so familiar.
You know I don't like people knowing my business.
How can you work in that place?
- You know it's working. - Clear.
[sobbing]
[instrumental music]
(Russell) 'Baby?'
'Where are you?'
What are you doing in here?
I hate this wallpaper.
We'll redo it.
I don't know what you were thinking last night
talking about that.
It was a dinner party I didn't pick the topic.
Well, you certainly didn't hesitate to dive right in.
Maybe that's because you won't talk about it when we're alone.
You think I blame you for what happened?
You think I'd still be here if I did?
I try not to worry about who you blame.
No offense, but living with a teenage boy
is like living with a barn animal.
Only, cows make better conversations.
Butt abscess, needs dressing.
Well, at least a cow's not a predator.
Sarah's friends are like a pack of she-wolves
with cell phones.
Look, a new one just for you.
Anal warts.
This is so ass.
Looks like the Gates-Taggart merger is in full swing.
You mean "TheBrady Bunch" from hell?
No, actually it's going great, but she'll never admit it.
Really? Okay.
He's never been happier.
He just loves to complain.
This much we know.
- What's that supposed to mean? - Sorry?
The VA sent these records over
and some guy called
from the Wounded Warriors' Project.
(Frank) 'What's that all about?'
Is the ladies' room this way?
Uh, yes, ma'am. It's down the hall and to the left.
(female #1) 'Thank you, dear.'
Hey, is Banfield on?
She should be in soon.
Is that about our homeless vet?
- Yeah. - What's the story?
I'm gonna figure it out.
Hey, uh, Bertha.
Bertha, this is not a good time!
- Bertha! - Whoa, go get her, big boy.
And Hoberman's still waiting on a cholecystectomy.
Uh, hey, when are you gonna clear out all these boarders?
We're working on it, Sam.
Oh, well, in the meantime, you might wanna get
'more than one intern down here doing your babysitting.'
How's Dr. Wade managing?
- The customers seem satisfied. - Yeah?
What about you? Are you satisfied?
I need to loosen up a bit.
I have a tendency to micromanage.
Yeah, Cate mentioned that.
Cate who?
Dr. Banfield.
You know, the department head coffee klatch.
Oh, great.
You know, autonomy is a fine teaching device, Neela.
Let's just make sure it doesn't lead to slowness
or distraction, okay?
You guys ready? Good.
Ready to round.
Where's your intern?
When are you going to get me a real bed in a real room?
Uh, soon. Uh, we're a little backed up.
I was meant to go under the knife yesterday
so I haven't had anything to eat but some Jim Jones juice
and Jell-O that made my poop red.
Red? Wait, you mean--
Now this?
The mattress is made of cement
and I've seen airport runways that were less noisy.
Am I smudged?
Uh... just a little.
Hello?
What are you doing?
Mm.
[cell phone ringing]
[panting]
Oh, God.
Hey.
I'm in the middle of my run.
We can talk about this later.
No, I'm not, it's just that..
[sirens wailing]
Listen, I got to go now, Russell.
(Abuelo) 'No, no, no.'
Nina!
'Nina! Nina!'
Nina!
'Nina! Nina!'
'Nina! Nina!'
[theme music]
- Six down, two to go. - That's not so bad.
That's just the ER. We have 40 more waiting upstairs.
Okay, right, 67-year-old woman, presents with neck mass..
Oh, God, with the age again.
...and dysphagia.
- Dis-what? - Uh, pain on swallowing.
Saying it fancy doesn't make you seem smarter, Andrew.
It makes you seem insecure.
It's a shorthand doctors use
'to save us time.'
Yes, in theory.
Uh, her son initially noticed the mass about three months ago
when she visited him in Michigan.
Ann Arbor. He's a professor at the university there.
Oh.
'A fine needle aspiration'
showed a degenerative, albeit benign cyst
'but thyroidectomy is still indicated'
'for symptomatic relief.'
Alright, that's thorough. Next?
(Andrew) 'Uh, review of systems is positive'
'for headache, back pain, constipation--'
Let's just stick to the thyroid, Dr. Wade.
That's what we're here for.
I'm with you, Bollywood.
Uh, no palpitations
diaphoresis, heat intolerance.
- However-- - Her TSH is normal.
So we know there's no hyperthyroidism, right?
- Right, but there is-- - Okay, then.
Moving on.
Three-year-old, near drowning with hypothermia.
Core temp's 84.
Bradycardic in the 60s with a thready pulse.
- Dr. Banfield? - You're doing a ride-along?
I was out for a run and saw the rescue team.
Stroller blew into the lake. Took almost 20 minutes to find--
Twenty minutes? She was under water that whole time?
[Abuelo speaking in Spanish]
Grandpa took her on a walk
'cause she was acting fussy.
[Abuelo speaking in Spanish]
Everything was good, she was happy.
[Abuelo speaks in Spanish]
And then the baby was just gone.
Go deep, go!
Go! Go! Go!
[dogs barking]
Chase me.
Nice pass.
(Russell) 'That's why they call it'
a "Hail Mary."
[Cate giggling]
You didn't chase me.
'Cause I'm the quarterback.
Now, buttonhook.
I'm tired.
Oh, one more touchdown, then we get ice-cream.
Booker and Banfield.
That's all the Bears are gonna need this year.
Whoo!
(Cate) What's your plan, Dr. Martin?
She has a pulse. So not much to do but warm her up andwait.
Right. So?
Access, warm saline
and get respiratory down here with a vent.
Get the Bair Hugger and prep for intubation.
I'll be right in.
- Hey, I have a favor to ask. - Not now.
I need your help getting an MRI.
If it's an emergency indication, call the radiologist.
It's not exactly an emergency, but it needs to happen today.
I have a homeless vet with seizures
cognitive deficits, behavioral changes.
Let neuro work it up.
Well, I tried that, but they said they want him
to come back as an outpatient, which is never gonna happen.
He's not an ER patient anymore? It's out of our hands.
He was in Iraq.
A war hero.
Served in the same unit as I did back in Desert Storm.
I hear the harmonica playing, Dr. Gates
but work is work and the rest is irrelevant.
Dr. Banfield, I get this whole tough boss thing
and it works for you, it really does
but cut me some slack.
I need your help.
Dr. Banfield, the old ball and chain on line two.
Thank you.
Tell him I'm in with a patient, Frank.
I'll call him later.
Max Gonzalez.
Sergeant first class.
You figured out who I am, huh?
Mm-hmm. 101st airborne
1st squadron, 75th cav.
Yeah.
Yeah, that's right. They called us the Widow-makers.
So you remember it?
My memory's a work in progress.
But it's getting better.
So thanks for that.
Don't you want to hear more?
Not really.
Awarded a silver star in '06
later wounded in a rocket attack
killed a bunch of your buddies.
Doctors documented altered behavior
anger, depression, hostility.
- They gave me some pills. - Yeah, SSRIs. Antidepressants.
Didn't help much.
Then they discharged you on a 5-13.
Do you remember what that is?
Yeah. It meant that I could go home.
(Tony) 'No, it meant the army could stop giving you medical care'
'stop being responsible for you.'
It meant I could get the hell out of there!
Because they said you had a personality disorder.
'They said that you had something wrong with your brain'
before you enlisted.
Maybe, there was.
That's what my old man always said.
What if there wasn't?
What if it was a lie?
Your symptoms are consistent
with traumatic brain injury, TBI.
Something you easily could have suffered when that rocket hit.
So you're saying what?
They dumped me?
I'm saying I think they missed it
mistreated it and sent you packing
for the cheapest possible price.
I wanted out, doc.
Trust me, I wanted out.
Max, you needed out, but not like this.
I don't want to be here.
I don't like it here.
I know how it is to come back
from a war and feel adrift.
Max.
Just give me a couple hours to help you.
Tube's in.
Then get Pharmacy to send down more warm saline
as much as they've got.
ABG's back. She's acidotic, 7.22.
Should we use a high vent rate?
The mother's out here.
Someone should probably talk to her first.
Dr. Morris, update the family.
I kind of have my hands full here.
Dr. Martin.
Okay, but, uh, shouldn't you?
I mean, she is your patient, right?
What's the CO-2?
Forty.
Standard rate.
The pH might normalize as we get the temp up.
Hello.
You're the mom?
Sandra Herrero. Is my daughter okay?
It's hard to know yet.
We're trying to warm her up now.
She's very strong for her age
and she's a good girl
very sweet, so..
She'll be okay?
The cold water may have protected her heart and brain.
We're just waiting to see.
Please, I know you know, so tell me.
Is my baby gonna be alright?
(Russell) Why can't you ever give a straight answer?
[laughs]
You want to have a baby?
Another baby?
Now?
Well, not right now, but..
Excuse me, is this.. This is your son?
There's something wrong with him.
Daryl?
- What? - Daryl!
Daryl!
- It's happening again. - Okay, okay, baby.
- We should call an ambulance? - No, no, I'm a doctor.
(female #2) 'He doesn't look good.'
Alright, he's burning up.
It's just a febrile seizure.
We should get him home and cool him down.
Maybe we should be safe.
No, no, it's just like last time.
Look, it's stopping already.
Are you sure?
I've been doing this too long to make any promises
but I'll tell you this.
Losing control is not going to help her
so if that's what you got to do, you do it outside.
In here, you be the mom, you be calm, you put all your energy
into helping your little girl fight back
because that's what she needs.
Can I..
Can I go be with her now?
Yes.
[elevator bell dings]
We've still got seven boarders down here.
Cate's gonna kill me if we don't clear them out soon.
Yes, she is.
How long is this gonna go on?
You people are practically living down here.
And by "you people", you mean..
- Surgeons. - Of course.
We're trying to clear our overflow as quickly as possible.
(Samantha) 'Miss Mendenhall is crashing.'
Well, that's one way.
(Samantha) BP down to 60/palp.
You got a massive GI bleed.
Saline wide open on pressure bags.
Prep for a central line, two units on the rapid infuser.
- Let's go. - How's her airway?
- Not that great, even on 100%. - Okay. Tube her, Neela.
Hey, did she complain of abdominal pain?
No.
Any history of blood per rectum?
Um, no, not so far as I know.
(Neela) 'Suction's on high.'
(Lucien) 'Okay.'
'Call GI. She goes to endoscopy'
'if we get her pressure up.'
- Lost the pulse. - Ah, damn it.
Starting compressions.
Dr. Banfield, our frozen girl
is having runs of V-tach.
(Blanca) 'I've got the amiodarone.'
Okay, give 75 milligrams and set up an infusion.
(Tracy) Got it.
BP's 67/32.
Valecia's temperature has dropped a little.
We're working on that.
Dropped? It's supposed to go up.
- You said-- - I said, stay calm.
I'm stepping up rewarming
with some pleural lavage.
You see that? Huh?
- How are the coags? - 'Not back yet.'
Do we have a platelet count?
Specimen clotted. We had to send it in again.
We should not have to wait an hour for trauma labs.
Forget it. We'll give platelets and FFP empirically.
Why do we have to fight the same battles every damn day?
Go on, do it.
[sighs]
[panting]
How long have we been going?
Thirty-nine minutes.
Another epi. It's time for another epi.
No, it won't do any good.
What about the GI consult?
They won't scope a patient without a pulse.
Dopamine?
She's had eight units packed cells
two units FFP.
We've replaced her entire blood volume twice.
If the heart could come back,
it would have by now.
- We're done. - Uh-uh.
We're done.
Two, three, four.
[flatline]
11:58 a.m.
- Any relatives? - A son.
Sorry?
She said she had a son in Michigan.
- I'll call him. - Okay.
I'll get started on the paperwork for the coroner.
Could you get..
Could you get me a death kit, please?
- I can take care of that for-- - Please.
Pull the curtain behind you.
[instrumental music]
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
No, tomorrow is not good enough.
She needs it now.
What's the hold-up?
There's no ECMO unit in the hospital.
What? That can't be.
County only has two machines.
One's in use, the other's out for repairs.
Systolic's down to 44.
Valecia needs a machine
that will warm her blood
and do the work of her heart and lungs.
We don't have that here
so we're gonna have to transfer her
to another hospital.
- Move her? - What?
It'll take hours for another hospital to accept her
and then a transport team to pick her up.
Yes, time is critical, so let's not waste it.
Call transport. Go.
This girl's not stable enough.
Let's increase internal rewarming
get the heart in better shape before we ship her out.
She still has a pulse and BP.
Now is our window.
Dr. Banfield, she's here now.
We gotta work with what we have.
(Cate) 'We don't need to go to the hospital.'
(Russell) 'You don't know that.'
He's groggy.
He's postictal.
Just like what happened the other time.
That wasn't the same.
He was fine in ten minutes.
He had a full workup.
He stayed overnight, spinal tap, CT..
You're not being objective.
They terrified him, and they found nothing.
It was nothing.
Febrile seizures recur.
The pediatrician warned us about it.
What if this is different?
If he is not better in 20 minutes
we'll take him in.
[bangs]
[monitor beeping]
She's in V-tach again.
We got a pulse?
Thready femoral.
Okay, Morris.
Lead the way.
Alright, let's move her to a trauma room.
Prep for peritoneal lavage
ten more liters of warm saline
and grab a Thora-Seal.
Wait, you're leaving?
Get it started.
I'll be in soon.
It was probably diverticulosis.
So, she blew an artery in her colon
and bled to death.
It wasn't foreseeable.
She had none of the predictors.
Like bloody stool?
Yeah, that would be one.
She had it.
Alright, it's not here. You never said.
(Andrew) 'She had it.'
Did you do a rectal exam?
Check for occult blood?
Did you ask her about any specific
signs of GI bleeding?
She, uh, she said something about the food
making her stool red.
Why didn't you bring this up at rounds?
'Cause she had so many complaints.
Her headache could have been a brain bleed
her backache, a ruptured AAA.
You know, it's your job to decide
what needs to be considered and when to speak up.
If you're submissive at all
when someone's life on the line
you're not ready for this.
I tried to speak up, and nobody listened!
Let's discuss this later.
There's no way to be ready for something like this
but in the end, it will make you better.
You can't be a great doctor
until you've killed a patient.
Yeah, I've heard that before.
I think it's called a rationalization.
It's only been 15 minutes.
It's too long.
I-I'm calling 911.
[sighs]
Russ, he's waking up.
Hey, sweetie.
How you feeling?
Hey, little man, you had us scared.
Can't have our number one wide out on the injured reserve list.
Here, have some water.
(Cate) Call an ambulance!
(Russell) Oh, God. Oh, God.
Call an ambulance!
[phone ringing]
Oh, don't bother, that's my private line.
ER.
(Tony) 'Vindication.'
Look. "Diffuse axonal injury
"in the parasagittal white matter
consistent with TBI."
Yeah, and this is vindication because..
It's gonna save Max's life.
Put him on a path of getting healthy
getting medical coverage.
Well, if you can convince neuro to readmit him..
- I can, with your help. - Dr. Gates..
Come on, indulge that inner softy one more time.
Alright, this is the last time.
Can I hug you? I wanna hug you.
Yeah, you try that, and you'll be the one
with a traumatic injury.
You're the best.
- Dr. Banfield? - Yep?
Valecia lost her pulse.
(Tony) Hey, Suri, what happened to my patient?
I just got here. That bed's been empty.
- Anybody see him leave? - Sorry, I don't know.
Hey, Frank. I had a guy in there from radiology
Max Gonzalez, a vet.
He had a duffel bag with him. You seen him?
Yeah, that guy was real jumpy.
He went outside for a smoke maybe 15 minutes ago.
[siren wailing]
Max!
Hey, Max!
[tires screeching]
Max, Wait up.
What happened?
Went into V-fib, didn't respond to the shock.
She's still too cold.
Alright, this is why I wanted to transfer.
This is what I was worried about.
Think she'd be better off coding in a rig right now?
Please, I stayed calm.
I did what you said.
Please help her.
Please. You don't need to do that.
Yeah, I don't want him to pull the IV out.
I'll hold his hand instead.
[Abuelo praying in Spanish]
It's getting harder to bag.
Might be pulmonary edema.
[Abuelo continues praying in Spanish]
Get sterile.
You can help with the thoracotomy.
Thoracotomy?
Why?
Myocardial irrigation.
I'm gonna open up your daughter's chest
and flush warm saline over her heart.
No. Please, don't. something else.
I know it's scary.
- Try something else! - If we don't get
her heart beating, she'll die.
I'm gonna need a ten blade.
[siren wailing]
Is there a fire, mama?
No, baby, we're in an ambulance.
We're gonna make sure you're okay.
Where's daddy?
He's in the car right behind us.
(Archie) 'Are you sure about this?'
We are not going to let this baby slip away.
Not here and not now.
(female #3) 'Okay, ma'am. We're here.'
[door opens]
Welcome to County General.
I'm Dr. Greene.
Are you the mom?
[monitor beeping]
(Cate) What's our core temp?
(Blanca) 'Still 86.'
Take it again.
She just did it two minutes ago.
Take it again!
[Sandra speaking in Spanish]
Internal paddles.
She's still too cold.
There's nothing to lose. Clear!
[Sandra speaking in Spanish]
- No change. - Go again.
Clear!
Why are you doing that?
I've got to get her heart going.
Nothing's working.
Why isn't anything working?
We're just getting started here.
(Haleh) Ceftriaxone's in.
Good. Finish the bolus, then run fluids at 100 an hour.
He needs a D-stick and a serum CK.
An hour ago, he didn't need anything.
Why don't we have labs back?
You in the medical field?
ER attending at U of C
where trauma labs are back in ten minutes.
Welcome to our world.
Sats' 91 on a 100%.
Come on. Come on, Daryl.
Wake up.
Alright, crank the O-2.
What about an ABG?
With your son's depressed consciousness
and dropping sat, we may need to consider..
Why don't we do a head CT first?
We only have one scanner
and your son's in line behind two criticals.
You have a critical patient here, a child.
Cate, let them do this.
Is Elizabeth working today?
I can check.
Forget it.
Call the lab and get them to read the CBC over the phone.
Pulse ox is 87.
Daryl, honey, wake up and breathe for us.
Six of etomidate and 30 of Sux.
No, no tube. He's just postictal.
Your son's vomited blood
and he's been altered for over an hour.
My son has a history of febrile seizures.
Okay, a seizure can't account for that.
A Mallory-Weiss tear, an atypical presentation.
He's hypoventilating and his brain needs oxygen.
- Why don't you check another.. - Listen!
I need to be the mom now, okay?
And I'm gonna be the doctor.
It works best that way.
- Cate, he's right. - Where's the chief?
Who's running the floor?
I am. And I've been doing this job
for awhile, so you need to trust me.
(Cate) Clear.
She should be warm enough now to respond to the shock.
Clear!
I don't understand this.
Autoscope.
Mr. Herrero
did you see her hit anything on the way down?
[speaking in Spanish]
No. No creo.
On some rocks? Anything?
[speaking in Spanish]
She was really cranky, so he took her out.
[speaks in Spanish]
He's asking if it's his fault.
'If he did something wrong.'
CAT scan shows signs of hypoattenuation
in the distribution of the MCA.
I-I'm not a doctor. Can you explain that?
- Your son had a stroke. - What?
W-w-why would he have that?
I can't explain that yet.
(Haleh) 'He's bradying down.'
You need to give thrombolytics.
Not without a CBC.
Alright, 0.2 of epi and prep some atropine.
Let's keep neurosurge in the loop.
You said he.. You said this was a fever.
You said he didn't need anything.
99 out of 100 times--
Stop talking like a doctor.
That's our son, damn it!
(Haleh) 'Heart rate's down to 40.'
No pulse.
Starting compressions.
Is there any sickle-cell in your family?
- Thalassemia? - No!
Can you think of any reason why your son had a stroke?
No.
Start atropine.
Mark.
They're waiting for you upstairs.
I'm a little busy here.
Yeah, I can take over. It looks like you need a break.
- Any meds? - No.
He's healthy. He doesn't take anything.
[softly] I'll see if they can hold your chemo.
Is it possible that he ingested something?
Something from your medicine cabinet?
Maybe it's an ingestion.
She's up to 94 now.
What medicines are in the house?
- Clear! - 'Nothing, just aspirin.'
Anything else? Prescription meds, over-the-counter?
Still V-fib.
- Sandra, mi medicina. - What? What does he take?
Pills for blood pressure, carda-something.
Is there any way Valecia could've gotten into them?
- No. It has a child-proof cap.. - Esta abierta.
Diltiazem. Diltiazem!
Very toxic in kids.
Blanca, half a gram of calcium. IV push.
I'll check trauma one.
Lab says that specimen's hemolyzed.
It's probably because they just let it sit around for an hour.
- Not the first time. - It's alright.
I always draw an extra red top.
Well, let me look at that.
What? What is it?
The buffy coat.
You can't diagnose anything from--
Look at the ratio of whites to reds.
Haleh, call oncology.
Have them get that leukapheresis machine down here now.
Oncology?
You're going to do that without a confirmed diagnosis?
The seizure, the stroke, it's sludging.
- It all fits. - Oh, God.
Jerry, I want you to drag
a hematologist to a microscope
'and make him look at this boy's smear.'
(Jerry) 'Right away, Dr. Greene.'
Is someone going to tell me what is happening here?
Leukemia?
Daryl's got leukemia.
[Abuelo reciting poem in Spanish]
What's he doing?
"Little Frog Tail", it's a nursery rhyme.
"If you don't heal today"
[reciting in Spanish]
"You'll heal tomorrow."
Another round of epi.
Toxicology's on their way.
Alright, Dr. Martin, make those compressions count.
(Blanca) 'Calcium's on board.'
Pushing epi.
Epi's in.
Infusion's on the way.
Is this the leukapheresis case?
We almost have access. Switch with me.
Platelets are up.
(Cate) Platelets?
We don't even know if he's thrombocytopenic.
He's oozing around his IVs.
There's no way he's not.
Platelets could worsen the viscosity.
He needs a femoral line.
I can't place it if he can't clot.
- We have no choice. - He could stroke out!
Listen to me, we have no choice.
Calcium's back, 4.2.
Going in the right direction.
Not fast enough. Push another half gram.
Got it.
Repeat the level with calce, phos, sodium.
Potassium, BUN, creatinine, LDH.
It's been over ten minutes.
Is-Is this gonna help?
This machine improves blood flow.
It'll give his heart a chance to rebound.
When will we know it's working?
It takes a little time.
(Archie) It's been 30 minutes.
Clear.
No change.
Come on.
Come on, now.
Clear!
(Mark) 'V-tach.'
Could be hyperkalemic from tumor lysis.
Five of insulin with an amp of D50.
Clear!
Still V-tach.
Going again. Clear!
Dr. Greene.
Mix 20 of Kayexalate.
Labs are back.
White count, 167,000.
- Large myeloblasts. - No. No.
No.
No, no, no.
Yes! Yes, sinus rhythm!
Clear. Clear!
(Tracy) 'Oh, my God.'
'We got a pulse.'
He's been down for almost an hour.
(Sandra) 'Is she back? You got her back?'
His brain's been deprived of oxygen.
Call surgery.
We need to get her upstairs so they can close the chest.
I'm gonna stop now.
[flatline]
[Abuelo reciting in Spanish]
(Sandra) 'You saved her.'
You saved her!
[Abuelo reciting in Spanish]
[monitor beeping]
[Russell sobbing]
(Russell) 'No.'
[Abuelo praying in Spanish]
(Russell) 'No.'
(Tracy) 'She'll be in surgery for an hour'
while we clean and close.
We can go with her?
[Blanca speaking in Spanish]
Have them recheck the calcium.
I wanna thank you.
It's what we do, when it goes right.
There was a minute there..
It was like I was losing everything.
You can't imagine--
I'm glad it all worked out for you.
She's a beautiful child.
[instrumental music]
We're still waiting on the coroner.
Something else you need?
I want to clean him up.
Probably have some gauze.
I want the tube out.
Normal procedure is..
...we have to wait for the coroner before..
I'm familiar with procedure.
Where's your husband?
He's calling our families.
I know, uh, nothing I can say
will probably mean much to you right now.
But I've..
I've seen enough grief in my life to..
...know how devastating it can be.
And, uh..
...how hard it can be to find the resilience.
I just hope
you and your husband find..
[door opens]
(Robert) 'Greene?'
A minute in the hall?
Excuse me.
So, oncology is mad at me.
Why do you suppose that is?
I've had my hands full, Robert.
Yeah, well, I just used all my pull
and influence to persuade them
to keep the chemo suite open for one more hour.
So get your ass up there or I'm going to sell
your vincristine on the black market for its street value.
- I'm still-- - Stop complaining!
Nobody told you to go and get cancer.
I have to go.
I'll be back as soon as I can.
You never answered my question.
I can't let you extubate him.
You know that.
You're free to cut the tube.
[melancholic music]
[music continues]
[door opens]
Those are the ones you never forget.
You shouldn't be doing that.
I keep a secret stash in the back of the fridge.
Crack one open when something really amazing happens.
In five years here, this is like..
...the third one I've drunk.
One beer every 20 months, I can overlook.
So, forgive me for noticing..
...but what happened in there?
Something changed.
The situation evolved.
It was a kid, right?
'We all have one.'
Some case you blew or patient you should've saved.
'Yours was a kid?'
[sighs] Yeah.
How old?
He was five years old.
Those are the worst.
He was my son.
He died here.
'In trauma one.'
Your son...died in this ER?
And you're working here?
I'm not sure why I've done
anything I've done since that day.
'Why did I not leave my apartment'
for almost two years?
Then I see the news about the tsunami
'and I fly to a place 10,000 miles away.'
Why'd I do that?
Why'd I come back?
Why did my son have leukemia?
I never understood any of it.
I'm-I'm sorry for your, for your loss.
I-I don't really know what to say.
When your parents are gone, you're an orphan.
'A spouse dies, you're a widow or widower.'
But when you lose your baby..
...there's no word for that.
See to it she gets this before you go.
[horn blaring]
Hey.
Listen, I would really like to see you.
I-I miss you, Elizabeth.
Please, please don't..
...don't-don't cry.
Yeah.
'Tonight.'
Yeah, yeah. I'll-I'll come over.
I'll see you then.
I'm sorry I-I wasn't there
when they came for Daryl.
But I, uh..
I had to be somewhere, so, um..
It was an atypical presentation.
Nobodycould've picked it up.
If I had just brought him in earlier..
He had acute leukemia, that's why he died.
It might've given me another day.
A little more time.
They said we can go now.
I-I appreciate your effort, Dr. Greene.
Take care.
Both of you.
Good luck.
(Cate) 'Baby?'
'Where are you?'
[sighs]
[Cate sighs]
You never cried.
At the hospital
at the funeral.
I've been..
I've been really angry about that.
You never cried about anything since that day.
Maybe we've been fooling ourselves.
Maybe we've been done for a long time
but never figured it out.
I never blamed you.
'Never.'
I used to think every day that..
...if God told me I could die
and go to heaven and be with Daryl, I would do it.
I wondered if that made me an awful person.
That I'd give up my life with you.
Give up everything we could still have in the future.
I never...really got away
from the feeling like I need to be with him.
Dreaming of him.
I never got away from the idea that..
...somehow I'd be able to hold him again.
[Cate laughing]
I've been afraid for so long.
I don't wanna be...be afra..
...afraid anymore.
[sobbing]
