[thunder rumbling]
[indistinct chatter]
(Tony) 'Who do we got comin' in?'
54's got an unconscious kid.
Uh, sorry, I should have asked if you wanted a coffee.
No, that's alright, I had a couple of hundred
cups tonight already.
I feel like I got ants crawling all over me.
Probably fleas from that homeless guy with the dogs.
I saw a rat over there by the dumpsters.
I thought it was a cat at first.
Call Jerry, he'll have maintenance bring
out a couple extra traps.
More like a couple of shotguns.
That thing was the size of a beaver.
[siren blaring]
- 'Here you go, girls.' - Alright.
What do you got?
Fifteen year old female found passed out by a toilet
after playing a drinking game
at a slumber party.
Unresponsive, sats 93 over two liters
BP's 72 palp.
Couldn't get a line. Name's Stacey.
Alright, Stacey, can you hear me? Stacey!
- How long has she been down? - Not sure.
Bunch of kids that were at the party are in a car behind us.
- Jerry, what's open? - Uh, they're both open.
- Take your pick. - Alright, access.
EtOH level, tox screen, D-stick, and lytes.
'Non-rebreather, she's hypoxic.'
Get ready for a transfer.
One, two, three.
(Lydia) Dr. Morris?
[snoring]
Dr. Morris?
Archie!
Fire's bringing in an altered old lady.
Found her out in the rain.
(Archie) 'How's the escalator lady?'
Ortho took her up to screw her hip.
Explosive diarrhea guy?
The Loperamide must be working, he's sleeping.
- Belly pain back from CT? - Nope.
Oh, I hate working nights.
Really? I like it.
(Archie) 'Nights?'
Lets me babysit my grandkids.
[siren blaring]
- What do you got? - Found her out in the rain.
Looks like she slipped and fell.
We called for a paramedic unit, but she passed out.
Figured we were only a couple blocks away.
It'd be quicker to just bring her in ourselves.
She's cold, warm saline, humidified O2.
- And the Bair Hugger. - Right here.
- 'Jerry?' - 'Trauma two.'
- 'Open your eyes, ma'am.' - 'Pulse is weak and thready.'
Looks like she broke her wrist when she fell.
Maybe hit her head too. She'll need a CT.
(Archie) 'Make some room!'
Pupils equal and reactive.
Fourteen liters by mask.
CBC, chem panel, UA, EKG and chest X-ray.
Core temp is 90 degrees. Hugger's ready.
What's your name, dear?
Hello? We got a name, ID?
Nothing but her nightgown.
(Dawn) Excuse me.
Blood alcohol level is back, 420.
Alright, no gag, she needs a tube.
- 'Systolic's only 66.' - BA of 420.
What is that, like, a gallon of tequila?
Dr. Gates, a bunch of the girl's friends are out there.
They wanna come back and see if she's okay.
Does she look like she's okay, Jerry?
Give me that. Another 250 to the IO. Where's my access?
(Chuny) 'The veins blow out every time.'
Mac 3 and 7-0.
Damn it. Lost it with the flush.
- A pair of gloves and a Cordis. - The tube won't pass.
- Alright, try cricoid. - 'Resps are shallow.'
[theme music]
[car horn honks]
(woman on radio) 'The is gonna continue.'
'And that cold weather will cross the, uh..'
[beeping]
It's still raining?
I was thinking about renting a boat
and rowing to work.
- How are the inmates? - Cranky.
So what's with the"iCarly"crew
out in the waiting room?
Uh, they came in with the kid
with alcohol poisoning.
Gates has been flogging her for hours.
Okay, kids, looks like it's just us.
So grab a coffee. We'll work the board in 15 minutes.
PV in three needs an H & P, honey.
- Mm, lucky you. - What's a PV?
Projectile vomiting. Blah!
Guy's like a champ. Puke went eight feet.
We thought he might have broken a window.
Isn't this a nurse's job?
Why God created med students.
Did you finish your overnight lab paperwork
or leave your usual mess for me to clean up?
Love you too, Frank. So long, sucka.
Uh-uh! Ow! What?
Didn't see you put anything in the donut jar.
No pay, no eat.
No, I swear, five bucks last week.
- Mm-hmm. - Hey, Morris.
Your old lady standing in the rain is back from CT.
Night, everybody.
I think I even put a ten spot
in there the week before that.
Sure you did.
Next time, write your name on it just so I know.
- You don't trust me? - You got it, champ.
Money with your name on it before
you leave today, Morr-ass!
I've got a three year old with otitis media.
Mom poured hot garlic oil into the kid's ear.
Looks like he has second-degree burns.
- Man. - What the hell was that?
PV patient. Thought he'd be out of ammo by now.
- Otitis kid? - You know, find Brenner.
I'm off. I gotta finish up with a few patients first.
CT negative for fracture or bleed.
Uh-huh. No anemia. EKG's normal.
- And chemistries are okay. - That's cold.
- She's awake? - Started coming around in CT.
Oh!
Hello there.
What's your name?
- Beverly. - What's your last name?
- My name is Beverly. - Temp's up to 97.
Uh, that means you don't need this big blanket anymore.
Hey, do you remember what happened to you, Beverly?
- No. - You were out in the rain.
And you got cold.
We think you slipped and broke your wrist.
Oh, my wrist hurts.
Tubular stockinette.
Oh-hoo, hoo-hoo.
Oh, your hands are so warm.
[chuckles]
And soft and strong..
...just like my Bobby's.
(Tony) 'Alright, what do you see?'
(Tracy) 'She must have aspirated'
when she was unconscious in the bathroom.
And?
That her brain is oxygen deprived
and she still may be altered when she sobers up.
Alright, two grams of ceftriaxone with 500 of Clinda.
Repeat an EtOH, please.
So what do we do now?
Now we wait.
Do you mind if I take off?
My shift ended, like, 20 minutes ago.
- Yeah, go ahead. Go. Go. - And I'm beat. Thanks.
Her friends are still out front asking if they can come back.
Yeah, send 'em in.
(Tracy) 'You think that's a good idea?'
Letting them see her like this?
Well, they're the ones that helped her get here.
They should see the consequences.
So it's okay with you if I go?
Yeah, go.
Get some rest. Go ahead.
[cellphone beeps]
[telephone ringing]
- Tony? - 'Hey. Did I wake you?'
No, I'm, uh, just getting Alex off to school.
Happy birthday.
'I got the day right, didn't I? '
Yep.
- 'You want me to sing for you?' - No. God, no.
Mom, let's go. I don't wanna be late.
- You gonna do anything special? - 'Like what?'
I don't know. Uh, get a tattoo.
Go skydiving.
Hang out with your friends.
Come on!
Uh, I gotta go.
Happy birthday.
'Thank you.'
Tony?
[beeping]
[clears throat]
Hi, I'm Dr. Gates.
- Hi, Dick and Heather White. - You're Stacey's parents?
No, uh, Stacey stayed at our house last night.
'Her parents were in Springfield for a wedding.'
(Tony) 'So, you've contacted them?'
(Heather) 'Yes, they're already coming.'
They should be here soon.
Is she gonna be okay?
She's in a coma, and she may have brain damage.
And we're not gonna know if she's okay until she wakes up.
Why does she need the tube?
To give her some oxygen and, uh, protect her lungs.
It keeps her from choking to death on her own saliva.
Uh, what were you guys drinking?
Vodka. Vodka and Kool-Aid.
'We were playing "I Never."'
Stacey won.
Where'd you get the vodka?
Kids drink. We all know that.
We just wanted them to be doing it somewhere safe.
So you supplied the alcohol?
I'd rather they drink at home
than out where they could be driving.
Can I give her something?
Come on, girls. Let's go out.
Call the cops. Get 'em down here.
(Archie) 'Hey, nine month old with bronchiolitis'
'on continuous nebs, waiting on the PICU.'
In two, we have testicular pain after a pommel horse incident.
That sport should be outlawed.
Twenty eight year old with leukemia cutis.
Oncology's gonna see him. Then we have the DKA.
A is gone, but still has the K, so he needs to come in.
- What is that smell? - The guy's a geyser.
- Who? - PV guy.
It's like dodging artillery in there.
I don't think the wipes are gonna do it.
Okay, once we're done here
grab some scrubs and ditch the clothes.
Don't ditch. Burn.
Guy in 3 torched his fingers making creme brulee.
Displaced tib-fib gonna Ortho
and hallucinating trombone player in sutures
needs a tox screen and a psych consult.
And with that, my job here is done.
Okay, Sanchez, testicular pain
trombone guy and displaced tib-fib.
Julia, leukemia cutis, creme brulee and the DKA.
Chaz, Chaz, we have a group of prospective medical students
coming in here today for their interviews
and Dr. Anspaugh asked me to show them around
but as I don't really want to
and you're the low guy on this particular
totem pole you're elected.
- Med students? - Prospective med students.
Right now they're just a bunch of overeducated
fiercely ambitious seniors tryin'
to claw their way over each other to get into
a prestigious program.
'So show 'em a good time.'
[grunting]
- Okay. - Morris?
Shh! I'm gonna put it back.
- Alright. - 'Hey!'
Here, money's in the jar, Frank.
- 'Morris?' - I'm out the door.
Beverly's daughter showed up.
Who?
Old lady with the broken wrist.
Hello, I'm Dr. Morris.
Temp's 99. All her labs check out.
God, she scared us half to death.
Mom, you scared us half to death.
I went in to make sure she was getting up
and her bed was empty.
'I looked around the house, around the yard.'
I ran up and down the street in the rain.
Tom got the car. He drove all over the neighborhood.
- Well, the CT is.. - I went over to the church.
To Emma's! I called the police and about 20 hospitals.
I was out of my mind with worry. Out of my mind!
She's gonna be fine...
Sometimes she wanders out of the house
and into the yard, but she never, ever
leaves the yard, never.
You can't leave the yard, Mom!
She broke her wrist. We put a cast..
You're going to give me a stroke!
You can get that from stress, can't you, Doctor?
A stroke? Well, yes, stress can cause a stroke..
What am I supposed to do about this?
Am I supposed to sew a LoJack into your nightgown
so I can find you when you wander off?
Well, we're just glad she's safe now.
Okay, so you'll have to bring her back
'in a couple days for a cast check.'
Well, come back sooner if there is any pain
redness or swelling.
Take care, Beverly.
- 'Dr. Morris.' - No, no, no.
Get away from me or I'll hit you.
- The kid in-- - I mean it, right in the face.
(Archie) Freedom!
- What was that all about? - Hell if I know.
The police are here on your alcohol poisoning girl.
(Dick) 'You're kidding. Wait a minute.'
- You called the cops? - Damn right, I called the cops.
- Easy. - This isn't our fault.
- Well, whose fault is it? - Look, everybody does it.
All the parents.
She had a blood alcohol level of 420.
That's not like giving a kid a sip of wine at dinner.
Hey, back up.
You just gonna have me arrested now, is that it?
Yeah, you're damn right they're gonna arrest you.
That kid almost died.
She could have permanent brain damage. 420?
'What the hell were you doing when those kids'
'were in there trying to drink themselves to death?'
Watch TV? Were you in the kitchen?
Mixin' up another batch of vodka and Kool-Aid?
- No, get off him. - Come on!
- Daddy! - Stay down! Ma'am, please!
- 'Stay down! Stay down!' - I wanna call my lawyer.
- You better have a good one. - Hey, Doc, you know what?
Shut the hell up.
[beeping]
[thunder rumbling]
Wow, should we be building an ark?
Well, the news said we could get as much as five inches today.
I'm glad I'm not an EMT anymore.
A day like this you get wet early
you stay wet the whole shift.
- You'll never get dry. - There you go.
Thirty seven year old construction worker.
Took a 15-foot fall from the scaffolding.
Diffuse abdominal pain, impaled thigh.
No pulse in the right foot.
Bagged his femoral artery. Let's get him in.
BP 90 palp with three liters of saline over 45 minutes.
(Simon) 'Kind of a long transport time.'
We had to wait for City Fire to saw him off the rebar.
His name's Dickie, Dickie DeAngelo.
That looks nasty.
(Frank) Look at this idiot.
Who drives into that?
What did he think it was like just a puddle?
Dr. Gates, that alcohol poisoning
girl's parents are here.
- Hi. - Hello.
Hey, Doc, you got time for a kid with a bellyache?
Grandma only speaks Spanish.
My Spanish is pretty shaky.
I've been taking a course, but..
It's got to be better than mine.
All I got is, Hola, Que paso?
Four year old boy.
Only thing I can think of is something
to do with his stomach.
The administrative, social worker
and counseling offices are all on the second floor
along with the wellness classrooms
and the therapy rooms.
[sighs] Ah.
(Kerry) Oh, my gosh.
This is..
- This is-this is beautiful. -Yeah.
36 exam rooms, radiology suite, two dental suites
shower facilities for the homeless, OBGYN
optometry, pharmacy, diagnostics
rapid HIV testing and support reproductive health.
Wow, I-I can't believe you were actually able to pull this off.
You had doubts?
No, I-I was pretty sure you were going to fail.
Tell me, are you gonna be able to get funding
for the county to staff this?
No, I'm gonna be fundraising
for the rest of my life.
But we have enough to open the doors.
Keep us going for the first year
while I try to build up some sort of endowment.
Carter, I knew you were rich.
I didn't know you were this rich.
Ill-begotten gains of my Carter forefathers
put to good use.
Redemption?
Maybe so.
Your grandma would be so proud.
Grandfather's rolling over in his grave.
He thought the Carter money was gonna last
longer than the pyramids.
You spent it all?
No, but most of it.
You've done a great thing here, John.
A truly great thing.
'Paramedics are pulling in'
with a 47 year old male with chest pain
and I've got a 60 year old man short of breath.
Okay, Julia, take the short of breath.
Chaz, you're with me for the rule out MI.
He looked like crap so I brought him right back.
Sats were 72%, so I went ahead
and hooked him up with some oxygen.
Okay.
Hello. I'm Dr. Wise.
And you are Mr. Gandhi?
My mom was a Mahatma fan.
And how long have you been sick?
About 20 years.
More recently?
Trouble breathing? A couple weeks.
Do you have lung disease?
Not that I know of.
- Heart problems? - No.
Any fever?
Just...can't breathe.
Okay.
Portable chest, 100% nonrebreather
EKG, first day labs.
IV?
Start a saline lock.
Well, wear gloves.
What?
I have AIDS.
[speaking Spanish]
[sighs]
No, no, no, uh..
[speaking in Spanish]
[sighs]
- Should we intubate? - Not yet.
Tachypneic, still hypoxic on 100%?
What do you see?
(Julia) 'Bilateral effusions.'
'Well, that explains his shortness of breath.'
Mm-hmm, and gives us something to fix.
Two Thoracentesis trays, please.
You're still gonna have to tube him
if he has underlying pneumonia.
One step at a time.
What are you two talking about?
You have a lot of fluid outside your lungs.
That's making it hard for you to breathe.
What can you do for that?
(Simon) 'Well, we can drain the fluid'
which is gonna make you feel a lot better.
So put your mask back on and let's lean you forward.
Just dangle your legs.
That's it.
Now we're gonna clean the skin with a bit of Betadine.
You're gonna feel a sting while we we numb the skin, Mr. Gandhi.
Gandhi?
Yeah, his mother was an admirer.
Now you're going to feel some pressure
while the needle passes through the ribs.
The fluid looks a little bloody.
Okay, let's send it for a cell count
culture and gram stain, AFB, and cytology.
[coughing]
Uh, you're gonna have some coughing as your lungs expand
but that's a good thing, that means it's working.
[coughing]
[thunder rumbling]
No change?
Alright, we're gonna have to move her.
We need the trauma room for an MVC.
Come on, guys.
Why don't you go home.
I'll call you if anything changes.
Hey, Frank, I'm goin' home.
Call me if anything changes with the Taylor girl, will ya?
- Who? - Alcohol poisoning.
Oh, another one of those kids showed up askin' about her.
She's the one with braids out in the waiting.
Hi. I'm Dr. Gates.
Are you here to see Stacey Taylor?
- Yeah. - 'Okay.'
Well, she's in a coma..
...and we don't know when or if
she's going to regain consciousness.
Were you at the party last night?
Um, no. I heard what happened.
You're here by yourself?
You know, uh, her friends
and, uh, her parents are on the second floor.
Maybe you wanna go up there.
You might be more comfortable.
I should have done something.
Well, you-you weren't there, right?
Stacey was texting me.
My parents wouldn't let me go.
I was really angry I wasn't there.
So she was texting me all night
to tell me about the party.
She told me she was sick
really sick and throwin' up.
And I..
...thought it was funny.
I should have called somebody.
I could have..
Maybe I could have.
[sobbing]
The ER is the nerve center where it all begins.
Between the ER and Urgent Care
we see over 200,000 patients a year.
As med students, this is gonna be your first rotation.
Four years to see if you've got what it takes
to be on the front line of urban medicine
or if you're a little bit more suited
for dermatology or plastics, something a little bit more..
...a little bit more safe
that you can practice out in the suburbs.
Triage is our first stop.
We rely on our talented nursing staff
to determine who's gonna be first
and who is gonna have to wait.
And wait and wait.
These highly trained professionals
can tell the difference between a hot MI
and a common indigestion just by lookin' at a guy.
After triage, the patient is brought back.
Their chart is racked.
You pick up the next in line no matter what.
You get caught swapping, fecal incontinence for knee pain,
you'll never hear the end of it.
Glad you learned your lesson.
Our curtain areas
'are for our subacute patients.'
Over there is the break room where we got bad coffee
and stale bagels.
'Trust me, you don't wanna be going over there.'
Uh, excuse me. Keep up, okay?
'So here's the deal about being a med student.'
Some docs like to teach but most just see us
as being a pain in the ass.
So they're not gonna be issuing no formal invitation
to the cool stuff.
You got to keep your eye open
and go after the action.
It's not gonna come to you.
Come on.
Another epi and let's shock him.
Shock him again.
- Chaz. - This is Dr. Brenner.
One of our fine ER attendings.
Dr. Brenner, this is a tour of prospective
medical students that you asked..
Chaz, get them the hell out of here!
Okay.
So who wants to see the suture room?
Clear!
Anybody seen Brenner?
Down in Trauma with a chest pain.
You okay?
Just got results back on a patient.
Bad news?
You want company?
No, I should do it.
No time like the present.
Right.
Post tap film came back.
Your lungs have re-expanded.
No pneumonia. Are you feeling better?
I can breathe again.
You said you've been sick for a number of years.
Well, I got the AIDS diagnosis in 1987.
Started AZT soon as it was out.
It's great that you've been able to fight it off this long.
'Come on, doctor, no holding back.'
I can take it.
Believe me.
Your test results came back.
There were atypical lymphocytes.
Large immunoblastic cells.
And what does that mean?
It means that you have cancer.
[thunder rumbling]
Whoa, it's a little nasty out there today.
Keeps up, we're gonna start handing out life jackets.
How are you?
I'm on the mend.
Everything workin' down there?
No complaints with the plumbing.
Wish I could say the same.
I was up six, seven times last night.
[sighs] Kind of a quiet day today, huh?
Yeah, I'm thinkin' of pulling out a crossword puzzle
just to fill the time.
I just had lunch with Susan Lewis and Kerry Weaver.
Really?
How is the old dragon lady?
She's good.
Susan actually looks fantastic.
What are they doin' in town?
Tonight's the opening of the Carter Center.
They...came in for it.
Open bar, free food on fancy little crackers.
All that.
Housekeeping needs to clean up trauma two.
It's still a mess after that shotgun accident kid.
They're down in Radiology
tryin' to mop up a roof leak.
- What's up? - Pregnant woman coming in, MVA.
Here they are.
Hey, store that for me, would you?
Sure.
[instrumental music]
(female #1) 'Thirty six year old female'
'nine months pregnant with twins.'
'Broke her water at home.'
Oh, contraction!
Traffic collision on the way to the hospital.
T-boned by a CTA bus.
(Simon) 'This is your first pregnancy?'
- Fourth! - Struck on the passenger side.
With abdominal pain and contusions.
Tachy to 120, BP's normal.
(Lisa) 'Get me off of this!'
As soon as we assess you, ma'am. Let's get her inside!
[screaming] Go.
[groaning]
On my count. One, two, three.
My husband should be here any minute.
He was on his way to meet me at Mount Sinai.
Alright, check the perineum.
I'll do a primary survey.
[groaning]
- 'I got to push!' - It's okay. Not yet.
- 'Not yet, not yet!' - 'I got to!'
Sterile gloves and an OB kit.
- What do we need, Julia? - CBC, coags, type, Rh.
And?
- Um.. - Fetal monitor.
Uh, right. Fetal monitor.
You, uh, care to pitch in, Dr. Carter?
- Oh, I thought you'd never ask. - I'll start a second line.
[screaming]
Now, don't move your neck until
we make sure that it's not broken.
I'm fine!
I guess the C-spine is clear.
She's crowning.
All right, mom, you can push now.
[screaming]
Head is out.
Okay, get ready. Twins go quick.
Delivering the shoulders.
[screaming]
[baby crying]
Good...girl.
- Umbilical clamp. - Is she okay?
She's got a great set of lungs.
Uh, baby looks great.
Apgar of 9, one off for color.
[baby crying]
Congratulations, mom. One down, one to go.
[baby continues crying]
Hey, baby. Want to go see mom?
Hi. You're beautiful.
Hey.
We paged OB down for the twins.
Has anybody seen them?
Coburn's in an emergency C section
said she'd send down a resident
as soon as she could free one up.
The husband just showed.
He's the wet, anxious guy.
- Mr. Salamunovich? - Yeah Chris. Is Lisa okay?
The first baby's out and healthy
and we're waiting on the second.
Oh, God.
Can I help you?
You don't remember me.
Should I?
God, it's amazing how little has changed around here.
- My dad used to be on staff. - Mm-hmm.
Mark Greene. I'm his daughter, Rachel.
[instrumental music]
[groans]
We have three boys under the age of ten at home.
- Three? - 'Yep.'
It's a madhouse.
But I wanted a girl, so before Chris went in
to get snipped, we decided to try one more time.
- We ended up with twins. - Hey.
What are the chances of that, huh?
Hello, Camille. Hey.
We're still going with Camille for the first one, right?
Yeah, fine by me.
It was my grandmother's name.
Honey, keep an eye on the clock.
Preschool pickup's in an hour.
I'll just have my mom go get them.
No, no, no. You should..
[groaning]
- 'Another contraction.' - Okay.
Big push this time.
[groans]
Okay. Big push.
[screaming]
- Fetal heart rate's down. - Wh-what does that mean?
Could be a sign of distress.
Okay, mom, let's get this baby out, huh?
[screaming]
I can see the head.
Meconium.
- DeLee suction now, please. - What's meconium?
It's in the baby's intestine prior to birth.
It could pass it into the amniotic fluid
and get into their lungs during birth.
[screaming]
How-how bad is that?
(Simon) 'Clamp.'
And cut.
(John) 'If it gets into the baby's lungs'
then she has to be intubated.
It has to be sucked out.
[sighs]
It's another girl, honey.
[chuckles]
She's not crying.
That's intentional. We don't want her to breathe in the mec.
Laryngoscope and suction, please.
- Mom's heart rate's up to 140. - Some bleeding here.
Okay, two liters of saline, wide open.
- A lot of bleeding. - Let's get some more access.
Alright, I want you to put gentle traction on the cord.
Let's get two units from the blood bank.
(Simon) 'Meconium at the epiglottis.'
(Haleh) 'She's cyanotic. Poor tone.'
Honey, is she okay?
Systolic's down to 90.
Alright, prime the rapid infuser.
Where the hell is OB?
[screaming]
Is that the placenta?
That looks like uterine inversion.
- 'Set up for a Cordis.' - What?
Give me some steriles.
The uterus has turned itself inside out
and has pushed itself through the cervix.
I need you to push it back in.
[screaming]
- It won't go! - Alright, IV nitro, right now!
[screaming]
Let's set up for an intubation on mom. Two units of FFP.
Let's have the blood bank stay ahead four units.
[beeping]
[engine revving]
[beeping]
[indistinct chatter]
[sighs]
Pressure's only 65/45. Second unit's in.
Hang two more.
No, it won't go.
- Alright, four units of mag. - What's happening?
If we can't get your wife's uterus in
we're gonna have to take her up to the OR
for general anesthesia and see if we can
relax the uterus up there.
(Haleh) 'Heart rate's up to 140.'
'Alright, you try one more time.'
Really push hard.
Really push.
Come on. Get in there! Really push!
- It's in! - It's in?
- 'Yeah.' - Oh, great.
Hold off on the nitro.
20 of pit in a liter, wide open.
Keep pressure on the cervix with your fingers.
No, no, push in, all the way up to your forearm.
With your other hand, I want you to massage
the uterus at the umbilicus.
OB's here. Heard you have twins.
Yeah, we just reduced an inverted uterus.
She's still bleeding with an accreta. Alright, call the OR.
Tell Coburn I'm bringing her up.
- What are you going to do? - You're the dad?
Yes.
We need to stop the bleeding or else
we may have to give her a hysterectomy.
- How about the twins? - First one's good.
Second one aspirated some mec.
- I paged Pedes. - Should I let go?
Do not let go until they tell you to in the OR.
Should I go with Lisa or stay?
Your wife's gonna be under general anesthesia for a while
but we'll give you updates from the operating room.
(John) 'Your wife mentioned something'
about having to pick up kids at school.
If you need to make a call
you can use that phone on the wall there.
[indistinct chatter]
Sarah!
'Sarah!'
'Hey!'
What's goin' on? Thought you couldn't pick me up today.
I couldn't sleep. Get in.
But I was gonna go to Madison's to study for the trig test.
I'll give you a ride. I have to meet Alex to finish the car.
So what's up, Tony?
You ever play "I Never?"
Drinking game.
I haven't been drinking, okay?
"I Never?"
I've heard of it.
I mean, some kids from school have played it
at parties and stuff.
How many drinks do you think it would take
to be drunk enough to die?
- What? - How many.. What do you weigh?
How much, 90 pounds?
How many drinks would you have to down
before the alcohol would kill you?
What do you think?
- I don't know. - Five? 10? 20? 50?
- I don't know, 20? - Try six.
- Six? - Yeah.
That could do it. That could-that could kill you.
Give me your phone.
Give me your.. I'll give it back to you.
That's fine. Give it.
Do me a favor.
Next time you're at a party and you're drinking
and you've had too much to drink or you're throwing up
or your friends are or somebody's texting you
saying they're throwing up..
...hit that.
"Help?"
- 'Who does it call?' - Me.
And I'll come, no questions asked.
I'll help you. I'll help your friends.
I'll make sure you're okay.
No questions asked.
[train chugging]
(John) 'When did it stop raining?'
How's that second twin doing?
Intubated, waiting for Pedes.
- Your mom get to the OR okay? - Yeah.
I'm going across the street for coffee.
- Anybody want a latte? - Sure. Nonfat, double shot.
- Nonfat, double shot. - Mocha frap, extra foam.
- Mocha frap. - 'Excuse me.'
I'm not sure I'm in the right place.
My daughter-in-law's here somewhere, having twins.
Is her name Lisa? Come with me.
Go right in here and just check in with that nurse at the desk.
- Thank you. - Julia, there's a call for you.
- Oncology. - Thanks.
Hey, you guys know a doctor
used to work here named Greene?
'His daughter was on my tour today.'
- She's applying to med school. - Rachel?
- Yeah, I think so. - 'You're kidding me.'
Is she still around?
I dropped the tour off at the dean's office.
They're doin' their interviews this afternoon.
[indistinct chatter]
Rachel?
[chuckles] Dr. Carter!
Hey...look at you.
You're all grown up. How old are you?
- Twenty two. - Oh, my God.
I remember you when you were..
Now you're going to medical school, huh?
Took your MCATs and everything?
Yeah.
Where are you doing your undergraduate?
- Duke. - Great.
Yeah, Elizabeth's on faculty there
so I get a really good deal on tuition.
- Elizabeth Corday? - Yeah.
Yeah, actually, she flew up with me.
- Elizabeth is in Chicago? - Uh-huh.
Oh, what are you both doing later tonight?
Uh, I don't know, I think we're seeing some old friends.
No, no, no, no, you have to come
to this thing that we're doing.
Rachel Greene!
This is my number. Give this to Elizabeth.
- Have her call me. - Yeah.
- Good to see you. - Good to see you.
- 'Good luck in there.' - Thanks.
Thanks. Yeah.
Path says it's primary effusion lymphoma.
Who's this?
- My guy who couldn't breathe. - What's his prognosis?
- Median survival's two months. - And his options?
Well, chemo and radiation could give him another
couple of months.
- You told him he has cancer? - Yeah, a couple of hours ago.
- Brave. - Or maybe just relieved.
- Relieved? - Dr. Brenner?
To finally know how and when after all these years.
[hissing]
Nice and slow. Keep it clean.
Excellent.
Good. That'll do it.
Yeah, man, that looks good.
I think you were right about the color.
I don't know. The cobalt blue would've been cool too.
No. Red is more your mother.
Phew. Yeah, all fire.
Well, that's better than cold and distant.
- If you say so. - I know so.
She's gonna love this.
Definitely.
Sorry I've been gone so long. Something came up.
Oh, that's okay. Gerry came by.
Gerry Gugliemotto, Dr. Wise.
She's very nice.
- Great to meet you. - Nice to meet you.
Gerry brought me gardenias.
I just love gardenias, don't you?
'I mean, the smell..'
Uh, the rest of your labs came back.
Everything looks clear.
Except for the cancer.
But it means your body could tolerate chemotherapy.
No. No, thanks.
It could buy you a few more months.
I've already had an extra 20 years, doc.
I should have died with all my friends in the '80s.
You're still here.
Tommy and Bill.
Jeff and David.
Remember Michael? Michael Thomas?
Of course I do.
Little Bobby?
So many people I loved.
I've been trying to live for them, you know?
Keep their memories alive.
But I've had my time. No regrets.
I went skydiving last year in Hawaii.
It was the most remarkable thing.
I was floating...free.
I-I couldn't feel my body.
I'm afraid of heights, but-but-but I wasn't up there.
'I guess that's kind of what I hope death is like, doc.'
'Floating, free in the air..'
'...above everything.'
Just...just watching the world drift by.
Is there anything I can do for you?
Yeah, th-there is.
I don't want it to hurt.
We can help with that.
Sixty six year woman ruling in for MI.
She's going to the cath lab any second.
Hula girl needs an X-ray of her wrist.
We've got an SBO who's NPO and not happy about it.
Sickler with a fever.
Dislodged G-tube on an old gal that came in from Lakeshore
and a three week old with lethargy and cardiomegaly
admitted for echo.
And, as you can see, the hallucinating
trombone guy's still here.
The tox was negative, but we're trying to find
a psych bed somewhere in Chicago.
Is my alcohol poisoning girl still here?
The family didn't want her admitted here
so they're transferring her to Mercy
but Mercy hasn't picked her up yet.
Alright.
(Frank) 'Hey, Jerry, look at this inbox.'
'It'sempty.'
All of my day shift paperwork is completed.
Look. It's a think of beauty. It's a clericalMona Lisa.
I just wanted you to see what a empty inbox looks like
so you can try, try to replicate that
for when I come in tomorrow. Okay?
Tough day?
About the same as every other.
- Goodnight, y'all. - Night.
Watch out for the guy in three, he's a grabber.
Thanks.
Hi.
You look nice.
Oh, I got a thing to go to.
You saw a med school applicant today Rachel Greene.
- She's pretty great. - She a student of yours?
No, she's Mark Greene's daughter.
Mm-hmm, so you have no firsthand knowledge
of her academic qualifications?
No, I've known her since she was kid
and Mark was a pretty great doctor.
I'm sure the apple didn't fall too far from the tree.
[sighs]
She did well on the interview.
I can't say if she'll make our final list
but she made the first cut.
(Simon) 'So, he's a bit of a boozer?'
(Neela on speaker) 'Stinks of bourbon by noon.'
(Simon) 'It doesn't affect his work?'
'No, that's the irritating thing, drunk as a skunk'
'and he's still a wonderful surgeon.'
- Is that Neela? - Yeah.
- Hey! - Hey.
How's the teaching going?
Oh, I've got mostly R3s.
Very polite, follow me around like ducklings.
I'm sure they're in awe
of the depth of your surgical brilliance.
It's either that or your exceptional beauty.
Ah, I think they may just be stupid.
(Archie) Hey, is that Neela?
- Yeah. - Hey!
- Hey! - 'How's life on the bayou?'
[chuckles] The bayou's, like, a hundred miles away, Morris.
Dr. Brenner, Pedes finally showed up
to extubate the mec twin.
Okay, thanks. Uh, I've got to go.
- I'll, uh, speak to you later. - Oh, okay.
How's the mom?
Still in surgery, I think.
She's still in the OR?
As far as I know, yeah.
Hey, you mind if I tag along with you?
- 'See you, Neela.' - Okay, bye.
Hey, Joe. How we doin'?
Suctioned out the trachea and the stomach.
No mec below the cords.
Satting at 100%.
Vigorous tone, good respiratory effort.
Think we can extubate.
Blow by oxygen is ready.
Here we go.
[instrumental music]
Good air movement.
- Can I hold her? - By all means.
How about you go and grab the rest of the kids?
Oh. I gotta go.
Good work, Doctors.
- Thanks, Joe. - Yeah.
[baby crying]
What's the mom still doing up in the OR?
She's probably already out.
Sometimes they forget to call.
Hey, guys, do you wanna meet your sisters?
- Yeah. - Yes.
- Come on. - Oh, boy.
Hey.
Kiddo, look at this.
Look. I love you.
'Look at this.'
They're sisters.
Where is my mom?
[instrumental music]
'Eighty two year old woman with history of MS'
and pyelonephritis on home IV therapy.
Now with altered mental status and respiratory distress.
BP's 60 palp.
'Gave 500cc's of saline to get her pressure up'
'but it's all going to her lungs.'
She's been coughing and groaning terrible.
- She's burning up. - Pulmonary edema.
Probably septic.
(Paul) 'This is the second time we've been here.'
We've been taken care of by Dr. Gates.
Her parents around?
They've been here all day.
They must be around here somewhere.
Hey, Tony?
Elderly MS lady just came in with sepsis.
Husband said you've been treating her.
- You look tired. - Thanks.
Oh.
Are you okay?
Yeah. This..
This 17-year-old girl came in last night
with alcohol poisoning
BA, 420.
- Mm. - Still hasn't come around.
She was texting her friend all night
telling her she was throwing up.
Her friend thought it was cool.
Mr. Manning.
Marjorie's not doing too well, huh?
(Carter) I know a lot of us never
actually thought that this day would come.
In fact..I think I was one of them.
[laughing]
But here we are, in this beautiful facility
finally ready to provide
state-of-the-art outpatient services
to the HIV/AIDS community, the homeless
families in need.
Medical care, dental care, day care..
...counseling.
Services.
Services that have been sorely lacking
at County for many years.
I, uh..
don't wanna try your patience by rambling on too long.
Um, but I hope you'll bear with me
'for a moment'
'while I talk about why we chose to name this'
'the Joshua Carter Center.'
'My wife and I had a son'
and we named him Joshua.
And he died.
[dramatic music]
[clears throat] Excuse me.
And it seemed so..
It seemed so senseless that we..
That we, my wife and I
we struggled to find some..
...sort of meaning in it.
'And, in the aftermath of our small tragedy'
'we realized that we could make a difference'
'in other people's lives.'
Other people experiencing their own small tragedies.
'And that made, somehow..'
'...the loss of Joshua bearable.'
[dramatic music]
Thank you so much for coming.
[cheering]
- Well done, Carter. - I didn't embarrass myself?
I wouldn't go that far.
You came.
I didn't think you would.
[chuckles] Neither did I.
Sorry I was late. Flight was delayed.
That's..
That was a beautiful speech.
(male #1) 'Hey, John.'
I just want you to meet Wendy Spence
from the Fort Foundation. Right over here.
(Tony) 'Your wife has low blood pressure from the sepsis'
but giving her IV fluids
will only cause more damage to the lungs.
'We discussed this'
'when you wanted to take her home, Paul'
that this would most likely happen.
I didn't realize.
Please. Do something.
Marjorie has a DNR. She doesn't want us to intervene.
Oh. I've got her power of attorney here.
Out here, uh..
That-that means I can decide for her, right?
Your wife has a degenerative disease
that's left her debilitated
without enough strength to fight off this infection.
Even with aggressive treatment..
'She would only live a week or two in the ICU on machines.'
A ventilator, dialysis, IV pumps
to keep her blood pressure up.
It's only going to prolong her pain and suffering.
I'm not ready to lose her.
[dramatic music]
It's time to talk about how to make her
as comfortable as possible.
[sighs]
[gasping]
Paul?
Excuse me. I'm here to check on a patient.
- And you are? - Dr. Wise from the ER.
I called, but I got put on hold.
Yeah, we're swamped. Couple of people called in sick.
Stomach flu.
We brought a woman up, inverted uterus
bleeding with an accreta.
- 'Her name's Salamunovich.' - Uh..
Dr. Zwerling just went out to find the family.
They're still downstairs. They have a bunch of kids.
One of the twins had mec.
Did she have to have the hysterectomy?
No, she went into DIC.
They coded her for over an hour, and she died.
* Happy birthday to you *
* Happy birthday to you *
* Happy birthday dear Sam *
* Happy birthday to you *
It wasn't me. It wasn't me.
Here, make a wish and blow out the candles.
- 'Ah!' - There.
[cheering]
Very funny. Very funny.
What did you wish?
I wished that nobody told
you guys it was my birthday.
(Chuny) 'Cut the cake.'
Hey. What are you doing here?
I wanted to give you your present.
- How did you get here? - I drove.
Drove? Drove what?
Well, you wanna see it?
Go ahead. We got it.
Hey.
'The twins are doing great.'
'They're keeping one overnight in the NICU'
but the other one's already on the way to the nursery.
'What?'
- What are you doing, Alex? - Just one second.
- Just give me one second. - I'm working.
Mom, just one minute. You'll love it.
What are you doing?
You drove that?
'Whose car is that?'
Alex.
- 'Do they know you have it?' - Mom.
Nobody is going to let a 16-year-old kid drive that car.
Open this.
Whose car is that, Alex?
Just open the box.
Mom, it's yours.
It was pretty banged up at first
but Tony helped me fix it up.
- Alex did all the work. - No. No.
- Get in. - What?
- 'Go.' - Go, Mom.
Oh, my God. Are you kidding?
Oh..
It's beautiful.
Are you serious?
'Are you..'
Mom, just turn it over.
[engine revving]
Oh, my God!
(Julia) 'I don't know if I can do this.'
Do what?
This.
Every day.
'Sure, you can.'
People need help, and you know how to help them.
And if I can't help them?
You do the best you can.
'Then you go home, you get some sleep'
'and you come back the next day.'
'And you help the next one.'
I'll see you tomorrow.
Ah, I should have grabbed a jacket. It's freezing.
It feels good. I like it brisk.
Brisk? You could hang meat out here.
- I can't feel my feet. - So go wait inside.
Not like we need you to push a couple gurneys.
Global warming?
A couple of these scientists
should spend April in Chicago.
49-year-old woman laceration to the right forehead
from a broken bottle vitals stable en route.
- What happened? - Drunken brawl at the Marriott.
The bitch cut me. I can't believe it.
It was a free-for-all. Chairs flying, champagne bottles.
We got there first, had to wait for the cops
to arrive to break it up.
Right. Take her. I'll get the next one.
28-year-old female. Blunt trauma to the head
and superficial lacerations to the left forearm.
She broke my damn arm.
Tiffany, you're dead! You hear me? You're dead.
You're the one that hit me with a chair!
You wouldn't have believed it.
It was like All-Star Wrestling in there.
- At a wedding? - My wedding!
You did this at my wedding, Mom!
That's what you wanted all along, right? Isn't it?
To ruin it, ruin everything?
- That's your mother? - Worse.
My new mother-in-law.
[indistinct chatter]
- Totally not true. - Yes, it is.
You were there. Yes!
No, I never
pulled a guy's Foley
without deflating the balloon first.
Yes, you did. And the patient was so angry
'he threw an emesis basin at his head..'
A Foley is for collecting urine.
(Susan) 'Yes, and what about the time where he got crazy'
'with the Dermabond and glued the lady's eye shut?'
Okay, that I did do, actually.
What about the time when he spent
like, three hours doing a one-inch head lac
without an X-ray, then, all of the sudden, he discovers
there's still glass in it and he had to go back and do it again?
[scoffs] Really glad you came. Don't believe them, Reese.
So, should we head out for a nightcap?
Oh, yeah. I'm in. You coming?
Ah, you know what? I gotta get
this young man home.
- Come on. - No, no, no, no.
It's a school night.
No. Get you home. Go to sleep.
(Susan) 'Why don't you drop Reese off'
with Cleo, then come back out?
The night's young.
I was gonna try Elizabeth.
See if they wanna drop by.
(Susan) 'Great.'
Elizabeth is an old friend.
No. A friend.
Mm-hmm.
- 'So' - So, we in?
- 'Yeah.' - Uh, you know, maybe. Maybe.
- Yeah. - Alright.
(Kerry) 'Alright. Ready?'
- 'Yeah.' - Meet you there.
- Yeah, great. - See you later.
What were you talking about?
- What? - With Kerry Weaver.
Oh..
Africa. She was back just last summer..
...to visit friends.
It's gorgeous, John.
Do you, uh, wanna join us for drinks?
I'm a bit tired.
It's 5:00 a.m. in Paris.
How long are you staying?
I leave tomorrow night.
[dramatic music]
It's hard for me to be here, John.
I know.
I'm glad you came.
Me, too.
Can I buy you lunch tomorrow?
We'll go to Shaw's. Eat too much seafood.
Take a walk by the lake.
It's supposed to be a nice day.
I was thinking about Joshua.
[music continues]
He'd be five, nearly six.
I think about him
almost every day.
Lunch?
Maybe.
Call me in the morning.
Kem..
(Tracy) 78-year-old man
'in from the nursing home'
'with penile pain, deformity, and bruising.'
'Sorry I called you in on this.'
'I just don't feel very comfortable with him alone.'
'He's kind of...randy.'
Welcome back, doc.
You bring yourself a chaperone?
Mr. Thunhurst, you're having penile pain?
Oh. Hurts like a son of a bitch, Doc.
Let's take a look.
You're, uh, sexually active, I take it?
Oh, yeah, yeah. Don't need Viagra, either.
The odds at the nursing home are great.
I mean, women outlive men. It's at least four to one.
[grunts]
You use condoms, I take it?
Oh, you betcha..
The big ones.
Alright, you, uh, fractured your penis.
Fractured?
There's a bone in there?
No bone, a tear of a fibrous sheath
called the Tunica albuginea.
'Swelling, bruising, hematoma, standard eggplant deformity'
tender to the touch.
Usually happens when a female's on top.
Was your partner on top, sir?
What? Cowgirl position?
Oh, no, no, that's not for me.
We were going at it at the nurses' station
while they were running the movie night.
I slipped out, and Mr. Fred hit the edge of the desk.
Alright, he's gonna need a retrograde urethrogram
to make sure there's no damage
and surgery to evacuate
the hematoma and repair the albuginea.
- Mm-hmm. - Tony?
'Surgery?'
How long am I gonna be out of action?
About six weeks.
Good Lord.
What am I gonna tell the girls?
Paramedics have a chest pain
and the MS lady's breathing
is scaring the hell out of her husband.
So, you like the car?
Oh, it's incredible
and amazingly cool
but I can't keep it.
Why not?
Because Alex couldn't have afforded to do that.
I barely give him enough to support his iTunes habit.
He worked his ass off on that car.
I can't take a car from you, Tony.
It was a piece of junk.
He did all the work. We found the parts.
It still must've cost you hundreds of dollars.
Thousands of dollars?
Alex learned how to rebuild a car from the struts up.
You don't take it, you're gonna break his heart.
Hey, that rule MI's pulling up.
Alright, talk Mr. Manning
through what's going on with his wife
and tell him I'll be in there as soon as I can.
Sam, if you're thinking about selling the Mustang
I will give you $500 cash for it right now.
- Go away, Jerry. - $700?
- Oh, is Dr. Gates coming? - He'll be here soon.
Because she, she stopped breathing
and I thought she was gonna..
and then she started up again.
Yeah, her irregular breathing is completely natural.
Ah..
It's, uh, all part of the dying process.
[groans]
72 years..
I'm sorry?
'72 years.'
I met her in the sixth grade.
That's how long we've known each other, 72 years.
And her family had moved in from Nebraska
because they lost their farm
you know, during the Depression.
'And..'
'Mrs..'
Mrs. Ross, our teacher..
She said to take the empty desk next to mine...
That was it.
'You know..'
'I never looked at another girl for 72 years.'
You hear that, Mrs. Manning?
Not once, sweetheart.
Excuse me.
[indistinct chatter]
(Susan) 'Yeah, just, like, let it out.'
Well, this is a thoroughly disreputable-looking group.
Oh, my God, Elizabeth! Oh, it's good to see you.
- How are you, sweetheart? - I'm good.
- Hi, Susan. - Hi!
- John. - Thank God you showed.
You were the bait we used to
lure him out late on a school night.
Oh, come on. That's not true.
You remember Rachel.
- Hey. - 'Oh, my goodness.'
- Hello, Peter. - Hey.
I've known you since you were this big.
Yes, I know, Everyone's been saying that.
Well, I can imagine. Look at you!
What can I get you?
Oh, I'll just have a cranberry juice.
- You look great. - Thank you.
Hey, and for you?
I'd like a margarita, no salt.
- 'See some ID?' - 'Absolutely.'
- Oh, my God! - So, how's Ella?
Oh, she's nine and gorgeous.
Now, Peter, you and Cleo are still right?
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
She's an associate professor
at University of Chicago.
(Susan) 'Oh, no, no, I'm dating again.'
[indistinct chatter]
Roger Anderson, 48, with eight hours
of substernal chest pain.
Why'd you wait so long?
I thought it would go away.
Good vitals, no ST changes.
Am I having a heart attack?
(Tony) 'Too soon to tell.'
(Linda) 'Unbelievable. First she traps Donnie into getting married'
by getting herself pregnant.
(Tiffany) 'Right, innocent little Donnie'
'perfect little Donnie.'
I have news for you, Linda
your little Donnie 'bout raped me in the backseat
of his Camaro.
I warned him, I warned him from day one
that all she was after was
his paycheck and health benefits.
Oh, right, his incredible salary working
for the post office. Ouch!
'Then she insisted on inviting'
all of her inbred Kentucky relatives to the reception.
Hey, it wasn't my Uncle Phil who was found pissing
in the lobby fountain! Ouch!
Keep still then.
Am I gonna have a scar?
A little one.
You hear that, Tiffany? I'm gonna have a scar.
Yeah, well, I'm gonna be on
my once-in-a-lifetime
Caribbean beach honeymoon
with a cast on my arm!
Tiff, are you okay?
Oh, honey, baby, she broke my arm.
Donnie? Donnie, is that you?
Yeah, Mom, it's me.
Donnie, she cut me.
I'm getting stitches in my face!
- Donnie, hold my hand, please. - Donnie, come here.
'Come here and see what she did to me.'
Donnie, sweetheart?
- Donnie, hold my hand. - Donnie?
- Donnie? - Donnie.
- Donnie, come here right now. - Donnie, come here!
Donnie, you come here right now!
(Samantha) 'I wanna prepare you.'
Your mom is unconscious
and the sepsis has made her breathing more difficult.
We have her on oxygen to help
and Morphine to relieve any pain.
So she's dying?
Yeah.
Soon?
Probably.
'Would you look at that?'
How much he loves her.
I never could understand how he put up with that woman.
Tough as nails.
Hard on him, hard on us.
[dramatic music]
'Then she gets sick, and he takes care of her'
'for all these years.'
'I would have left her by the side of the road somewhere.'
You know what I was doing in the car
the whole way down from Milwaukee?
Crying.
Crying my eyes out.
Beating myself up trying to remember what it was
we fought about last time we talked.
Isn't that something?
As if it mattered anymore.
[music continues]
Hey, um, you mind if I eat this last piece of cake?
No, knock yourself out.
Thank you.
[telephone ringing]
ER.
Yeah.
What's up?
[dramatic music]
I know, Soldier Field.
No, Tommy's gonna get us tickets.
Yeah...that's fine.
Mom. Hey, did I wake you?
Uh, yeah.
Oh, who, who does Leno have on?
No, I'm working tonight.
How was your day?
Yeah, they got me a cake.
Chocolate.
That crazy grandson of yours, Alex, tell you
what he got me for my birthday?
A car.
No..
Ah!
- Whoa! - It got so cold!
(John) So you wanna come and see
what a real doctor does for a living?
Oh, yes, a doctor in an underfunded
over-utilized, insane asylum
that passes for an urban medical center.
- I'm in. - Oh, no, it's very late.
- Oh! - Don't start.
Well, how are you gonna get back to the hotel?
- I'll call a cab. - Oh, come on.
She's not a baby anymore.
We'll make sure she gets back safely.
You gonna come, Kerry?
No, I've got an early flight.
- Peter? - No, 7:00 a.m. rounds.
Ah, there's a cab.
I'm gonna go.
- Bye. - Bye.
So good seeing you.
Alright, bye, guys.
Well, ready?
Hey, our flight leaves at 9:00!
The car's coming to pick us up at the hotel at 7:00!
[sighs] Kids.
She's not a kid anymore.
Yeah, her mother would absolutely kill me
if she knew I'd let Carter haul her off
to the ER in the middle of the night
on a field trip.
Hey, uh, want me to get you a cab?
Oh, uh, no. I've got a rental car.
Alright. Well, want me to walk you?
Um...sure.
Thanks. Yeah.
So...is Cleo good?
Yeah, really good.
Do you have any more children?
No, no, no, no. What about you?
- What about me? - Do you have any more kids?
Oh, no, no.
Are you, uh, in, a relationship?
- No. - Dating?
No, not really.
Uh, well, I've got a nine-year-old
at home and a busy career.
Maybe when Ella's a little older
I might, but, uh..
So..
This is me.
[horn honks]
[laughing]
As usual, there was a problem with the rental reservation.
This is all they had.
It's, um..
It's big.
- Yeah. - Wow.
Well, you know, if you need to transport an infantry
for any reason, uh..
[laughs] Yeah, or a rap star's entourage.
Anyway..
[dramatic music]
It was really nice seeing you again, Peter.
Yeah, it was.
Take care.
[music continues]
[siren wailing]
(John) 'Jerry, you remember Rachel?'
Yeah, I heard you were around.
- Hi, Jerry. - Hi. You remember me?
- No way! - Jerry!
There's a spirit of camaraderie around here.
It's kind of what makes this place work.
Everybody helps everybody else out.
Oh, God, maggots.
Tracy, this is Rachel.
She's thinking about a career in emergency medicine.
Run, don't walk, to radiology.
Trust me, you don't ever, ever want to have to do this.
(male #2) 'I am the chosen one.'
Come to be known as Uhdia..
Ten of Haldol and restraints!
...and he who believeth in me shall have eternal life!
(John) 'Hey, Morris.'
Hey, Carter. How'd the opening go?
It was good. Sorry you missed it.
Well, you know work.
Can't wait to see it when it's finished.
Give me a call. I'll give you a tour.
Rachel? Rachel Greene?
- Hi, Chuny. - Oh, my God.
Look at you. You going to be around for a while?
Sure.
Don't you dare leave
before we get a chance to catch up.
And I will deliver..
Haldol, miracle drug.
Laverne, what have you got?
Mr. Meyer here polished off
a few too many bottles of fine burgundy
fell off the curb in front of Spiaggia
broke his ankle, hit his head.
Waiting on CT and Ortho.
Mind if I take over the IV?
Oh, sure, no problem.
You ever done one of these before?
No.
Okay. Well, we use an angiocath
with a 16-gauge needle.
It's a large bore, but you need that in case
there's bleeding and you have to transfuse him.
What you want to do
is pull that skin tight so that the vein doesn't roll
go in low, bevel up.
Once you're in the vein you just pull this little gizmo out
and tape it down.
Gates, is it my imagination
or is Dr. Carter, who is not on duty, by the way
in Trauma 1 with a patient demonstrating IV placement
to a college student?
What?
Never mind.
Jerry, why is Dr. Carter performing
medical procedures on our patients?
Uh...because he's a doctor?
Tony?
Excuse me one second.
Perfect timing.
That poor bastard's son and daughter are having..
Marjorie Manning died.
[flatline]
So...
That's it?
[sobbing]
[dramatic music]
Can I stay with her..
...a little longer?
Of course.
Stay as long as you'd like.
Oh, yeah.
Pizza!
[sighs] Okay..
What is that?
Uh, meat lovers' special.
You want a piece?
You better call a cardiologist
and schedule your first angioplasty.
Mm, it's good.
How old are you?
- 37. - Hmm, yeah,
Make an appointment for three years from now.
You keep eating like that, 40 ought to be just about right.
(Susan) 'No, come on!'
(Chuny) 'It's true!'
[laughing]
You're right, they don't get it.
They don't get it!
Who are you?
Oh, hi, I'm, uh, Dr. Susan Lewis.
I used to work here.
- Hi. - Hmm..
What is it with men and their penises?
Oh, yeah, I've been trying to figure that one out for years.
Amen to that.
My trouble-urinating guy?
It turns out that he has erectile dysfunction
and he can't afford Viagra.
So, he takes a tube of bathroom caulk
the kind you use around the tub
and squeezes it into his urethra.
It's not a religious talisman.
Get that thing in a biohazard bag.
Police brought in an altered old woman
found her on the street wearing one of our bracelets.
It had your name on it.
(Archie) 'Beverly?'
- Hello. - Hello.
How's her temperature?
Core is 96.
My name is Beverly.
Yes, I know.
She was in here yesterday.
Her daughter's name and number
should be in the chart here somewhere.
- Martha or Mary... - Margaret.
Margaret, that's right.
You know, she's gonna be worried
about where you are.
Margaret is a lovely girl.
Just quiet and thoughtful.
How's your wrist? Any pain?
- I broke my wrist. - I know.
I fixed it yesterday.
I fell out of a tree.
Margaret was telling me to go higher and I fell.
Really? Margaret was telling you to go higher?
Mm-hmm, she's..
Margaret's my sister.
'Just a lovely girl.'
You know, you really shouldn't leave your yard.
It's not safe.
Ooh, you have such strong hands.
Warm and strong.
You can tell a lot about a man by his hands.
Yes, ma'am.
[dramatic music]
Where's the daughter?
Uh, she went to call the mortuary, I think.
Thanks.
For what?
For everything you do with Alex.
I really appreciate it.
[music continues]
Wow..
A little cold out here to be playing basketball, huh?
I'm just trying to stay awake.
- Oh, yeah? - Yep.
I've got a, um..
Important phone call to make in a couple hours.
I'm afraid if I close my eyes, I'll sleep through it.
Don't you own an alarm clock?
Oh..
Can't chance it.
Yeah?
- Love or money? - What?
Well, if it's that important
it can only be, uh, one of two things
love or money.
- Love! - Oh!
Hey! Put a towel around that guy!
- 'There's women in there!' - Whoa!
I thought streakers went out with disco
and the Ford administration.
I'm going across the street.
You guys want a microwave burrito?
- Bean and beef is pretty good. - I'm fine.
I'll pass.
Man's a culinary freak of nature.
Nice.
Where's your little ward?
Who, Rachel?
The women stole her from me an hour ago.
- Coming back, boss? - What?
You're hanging around here enough.
Take some shifts. Get paid for it.
I don't know. Maybe.
Hey, Tony, I need you.
Those transport guys from Mercy
finally showed up for your alcohol poisoning girl.
Soon as they tried to move her
she started groaning and thrashing around.
Is she responsive?
I didn't stick around long enough to find out.
Went looking for you.
- Stacey? - What? What's happening?
Stacey? Alright, she responds to stimuli.
- What does that mean? - Stacey, can you hear me?
- 'Honey..' - Stacey, alright
you're in the hospital.
Okay, I'm Dr. Gates.
You were at a party last night.
You had a little too much to drink.
- Stacey? - Please, is she alright?
Stacey? Stacey?
I need another CT, guys. It's gonna take a little while.
- How long? - Hour, maybe two.
I'll call Dispatch.
(Mark) 'Doctor?'
She's responding, but not in a purposeful way.
'It may be a sign of lack of oxygen to the brain.'
'I'm gonna order another CT'
'make sure there's no swelling in the brain.'
But she's going to be okay?
Well, it's too early to tell if her mental status
will improve from, um, from what you see now.
- 'But it could?' - 'Maybe in time.'
CT can take her now.
Okay, good.
Can we go with her?
Of course, yeah.
(Tracy) My first ER rotation
they sent me to a jail ward to do a rectal
on this prisoner with a GI bleed.
So, this guy is very sketchy
you know, and he's kind of a leech
but I don't wanna seem like a wimp.
So, I close the door to give him some privacy
and I pull on my glove, lube up my finger
and go ahead with the exam.
When I'm done, I go to the door to leave
and it's locked!
It's a jail ward.
The doors don't open from the inside.
So, here I am, stuck with creepy convict guy
who is now laughing, pulling up his pants
and asking me if it was
as good for me as it was for him.
Oh, my God.
Yeah, it took me ten minutes
of banging on that door
to finally get a nurse's attention to let me out.
Guy in Exam two is coughing red snappers.
Be sure and wear a mask.
- What's a red snapper? - TB.
- Tuberculosis? - Yep.
My first week in the ER
I forgot Haleh's name
'and called her Nurse.'
As in "Nurse, can you get me some more 4x4s?"
Ooh, bad idea.
Nurses hate being called Nurse.
- Why? - 'Cause we actually have names.
Or because we know a lot more than med students.
Yeah, more than the interns.
And more than most doctors.
So, anyway
Haleh decides to punish me
by paging me for Tylenol orders every 20 minutes.
I would have paged you every ten.
Every five.
(Tracy) 'My first year in med school'
'the dean comes into our very first lecture and he says'
'"I want you to look to your left and to your right."'
'"A year from now, one of you will be gone."'
Dean told us that old chestnut when I was in med school, too.
Was it true?
No, but it scared the hell out of us.
I mean, as if we weren't worried enough already.
- Hey, what are you doing here? - Couldn't sleep.
'I just thought I'd come in and catch up on some charts.'
Maybe check up on a baby in the NICU I helped deliver yesterday.
Where's Banfield?
Down in sutures stitching up naked drunk
'and disorderly guy.'
Get her down here now.
What is it?
Explosion at a power substation
multiple burn and blast victims.
- Three minutes out. - How many?
At least eight.
Chuny, clear the trauma rooms.
Jerry, get the blood bank to send all their O-neg
and Dawn, make sure we have enough
Morphine and rapid infusers.
Yippee-ki-yay.
You wanna be an ER doc?
This is the fun part.
[instrumental music]
Industrial explosion.
[sirens wailing in the distance]
Dr. C.
[sirens wailing]
Morris! Triage!
(male #3) '55-year-old man thrown 20 feet against a wall.'
Diffuse abdominal pain. BP 80 palp.
Rigid abdomen, probably spleen or liver. Tracy!
- 'Yeah?' - Two of O-neg.
'Hold for the OR.'
Open femur, good distal pulses.
I'll take this one. Chuny!
'Gram of Ancef, 100 of gent.'
Titrate Dilaudid and call Ortho.
- Julia, you're up! - 'Laverne!'
- I got Bardelli's.. - Good!
Found him down in V-fib on a high-power line.
'Epi, Lidocaine, and ten shocks'
'put him into asystole.'
- Trauma 2? - No, Curtain 3.
We have to hold trauma for the ones we can save.
27-year-old male. Short of breath, pulse ox 82.
Come on. Come on!
Decreased breath sounds on the right.
- Okay, no facial burns. - 'Pneumothorax.'
Okay, set up for a chest tube!
Arm was blown off below the elbow.
- Intubated after ten of MS. - Alright, Sam!
Anything to re-implant?
- Bits and pieces. - Go.
- Dr. Carter? - What? I'm sorry. What?
- Are you okay? - Yeah.
Just a little deja vu.
Carter, you working?
- Absolutely. - Come on!
Burns over 90% of his body.
'Soot at the vocal chords.'
Three liters of Ringers.
'Let's call the burn service.'
- Okay, let's go. - Yeah.
Dr. Greene.
You coming?
[sirens wailing]
Tight wheezing throughout the ride.
Pulse ox 88.
Singed nasal hairs from smoke inhalation..
Set up for intubation!
