(male narrator) Previously on"ER."
Sleeping with you, it counts as poor judgment.
I...thought we fit well together.
Bertha's family is suing.
You're kidding. They said they wouldn't do that.
You're an intern, you'll be protected.
It's the rest of us who are going to fry.
It was a kid, right?
Patient you should have saved.
He was my son.
Your son...died in this ER?
I'm not sure why I've done anything
I've done since that day.
Looks like the Gates-Taggart merger's in full swing.
You mean "The Brady Bunch" from hell?
No, actually, it's going great, but she'll never admit it.
He's never been happier. He just loves to complain.
Oh, your lasagna was amazing.
Really good, yeah.
In fact, we all had seconds.
Yeah, they're hitting the books.
You make it there okay?
I don't have to send a rescue party?
No, but I could use a yak with a cask of brandy.
(Tony) 'I'll see what I can do.'
- Did you get any sleep? - Maybe three hours.
(Samantha) 'Yeah, well, go to bed early'
and give Alex a big hug and kiss from me.
Hey, Alex, your mom says goodnight.
'Night.
That's the best you're going to get.
Alright, have a good shift.
Bye.
(Alex) 'The contractile vacuole of the paramecium'
excretes excess water regulating osmotic pressure.
I knew that once. How's the English paper?
"In spite of a terminal illness
"Johnny Gunther lives with passion
"emphasizing the author's theme of living
like there is no tomorrow."
I hope you can back that up with specifics.
So, if we get our homework done
are you gonna let us go to that party?
Didn't we talk about this?
Come on, it's Friday night.
Yeah, and tomorrow you want
to go to Alpine Valley
'cause you wanna go snowboarding for the weekend.
Besides, it's a blizzard out there.
It's only five blocks away.
We'll walk, and we'll be home by 10:00.
No, we all made a deal. Homework.
(Simon) Migraine headache?
Just got Imitrex.
- Slip and fall? - Broken coccyx.
His wife's coming to pick him up.
Yeah, don't count on it.
Already a foot on the ground.
Jumbo Mart's closing early.
You are a snow angel.
And that, my friends, is the board.
Wow, your day was pretty qu--
Hey! Hey! Do not say the "Q" word.
You can think it, but you never say it.
Okay, well, if it stays, uh, not busy
we'll do a suture lab with pigs' feet.
Hmm, guess I'll have to miss that one.
No, you don't. Kaya's snowed in.
You get to stay.
- I was up till 2:00 last night. - Good for you.
I didn't leave Tracy's until almost 4:00.
Here, I got an extra one.
- Can't we get somebody else-- - Take it like a man, Grady.
Oh, uh, Banfield is stuck
in Omaha at the ACEP conference.
She wants you to cover her day shift tomorrow.
Oh, n-n-n-no. She can..
- She's got, like, 12 hours to-- - Yeah?
Take it like a man, Brenner.
Were you aware that Mrs. Mendenhall
complained of red stools?
It wasn't discussed.
Your intern Dr. Wade tried to bring it up
but you told him to
"stick to the thyroid."
Do you recall that?
The patient was here
for routine elective surgery.
But didn't Dr. Wade have important information to share?
In retrospect, yes.
Is it your standard practice to cut off
an intern's presentation?
It is when you have an hour to round on 50 patients.
So you're saying being busy
is an excuse for negligence?
Objection. Lacks foundation.
Doctor, did you know that your intern
went to the family and admitted fault?
Assumes facts not in evidence.
Dr. Wade had the moral fortitude to be honest with the family.
- Why can't you? - Objection. Argumentative.
Dr. Wade lacks experience.
I advise my client not to answer.
...years to understand the system.
How long does it take to lose your integrity?
This is a public teaching hospital.
'We are overwhelmed with patients--'
...not continue in this way.
...of training young doctors.
To get through the day, we have to rely
on our interns, it's not the perfect system
'but it's the best we have, and yes'
things can fall through the cracks!
I said we need a recess.
Fine.
You are not following my instructions.
I need to explain what happened.
No, you need to keep your mouth shut.
Answer "yes", "no", or "I don't know."
Be a good girl, and you won't lose your medical license.
[theme music]
- 'There you go.' - Oh, I-I'm sorry.
- I-I didn't order a.. - A Bahama Mama.
Courtesy of the gentleman at the end of the bar.
Could you just take the drink back, thank the gentleman
and ask him to leave me alone, please?
Now, I can't do that.
- Why not? - He was very insistent.
[sighs]
(Neela) 'I was in there for four hours.'
(Simon) 'That is a long time in the hot seat.'
Yeah, it's ridiculous. I came across like a fool.
Well, that's to be expected.
I mean, their job is to discredit you.
Well, they're good at it 'cause after that grilling
even I think I'm incompetent.
Well, you're not, so just take a break
and I'll-I'll keep the surgical consults to a minimum.
You know, I don't know if you're being nice
or if you just don't want me touching your patients.
Hey, Simon, can you reassess our fever girl?
Yeah, no problem.
Uh, if you don't mind
can you check on the interns
in the break room?
Temp's down, no source.
She needs a catheterized urine.
That can be a little traumatic.
How about conscious sedation?
She might stop breathing or drop her BP.
It's too risky for such a simple procedure.
You sure?
Sam, Tony called. I couldn't find you.
(woman on TV) 'And with two feet of snow predicted'
'authorities say to stay indoors and off the roads.'
(Frank) 'Chicago, I hope you're listening.'
Hey, Chaz.
Hey, Neela, Frank.
Surprised you made it in.
I'm dedicated.
I'm supposed to observe every Friday night.
Well, you can observe a drunk
sleeping it off in exam three
or you can help me with the Christmas decorations.
There's nothing going on.
You might as well go home.
Now that I'm here?
I mean, I was lucky to make it this far.
(Neela) 'Good point.'
(Paul) 'Stay subcuticular through the flap'
but distal to the tip.
Half-buried vertical mattress?
- Yeah. - Uh-huh.
Looks good.
So, dude
what was up with you and Dawn last night?
Nothing.
Nothing? You were slow dancing.
If you can call that dancing.
Where was your wife?
We couldn't get a babysitter.
Look, Dawn got drunk and--
You guys go to Ike's last night?
Uh, there was a party.
Oh, really? I didn't hear about it.
At Tracy's, just for the interns.
And the nurses.
And a...couple of residents.
(man on TV) 'As the storm moves across the central plain'
'we're well past Omaha's..'
[slurping]
Mm. Sure you don't want some?
Positive.
Last time I saw you was at registration.
I thought we were in the same classes.
It's like you've been avoiding me for three days.
Yeah, I-I changed my schedule.
Okay.
Can you believe every flight's been canceled?
And now, of course, every hotel room in town is booked.
Yes, I know.
[tapping]
Listen, what we talked about that time in the break room..
Yeah, I had a very bad day that day.
You know, if there's..
...ever anything more you want to discuss..
I-I'm a very...private person.
I understand that.
It would be between you and me.
I have a lot of reading to do.
[sighs]
They say the storm will pass by morning.
Figure the airports will open up by noon.
(male #1) 'You know, folks, it might be a little cold'
outside, but we are gonna warm it up
with a trip to a little place I like to call Kokomo.
[instrumental music]
* Aruba Jamaica ooh *
* I wanna take ya *
* Bermuda Bahama come on pretty mama.. *
He's not too bad.
Hey, you know what?
Good music, good company, good booze.
This could be an okay night.
(Samantha) 'Things were slow in the OR'
so I borrowed a nitrous setup.
- Are you sure it's safe? - Very.
Sam, are we authorized to use this?
Come on, dental assistants use this stuff like water
'and they don't have our monitoring capabilities.'
Is there a problem?
- No. - No.
Alright, we're good to go.
Very cool.
Why don't you use it down here all the time?
Good question.
All done.
She didn't even flinch.
(Chaz) 'I'll go run it to the lab.'
She'll be awake in five minutes.
- Thank you. - Mm-hm.
Nice work. I'll get ready for the traumas.
[clinking]
Hey, everybody. How you doing, every..?
Can I have your attention, please for a second?
Ah.
[coughs]
Is there a doctor in the house?
[laughs]
'I know you're all doctors.'
Uh, well, you know
w-we're gonna be here all night.
Might as well, might as well get to know each other.
Right?
I'm Archie Morris
from County General in Chicago.
'And, uh, you know what?'
Why don't we, why-why don't we go around?
Okay, we'll go around.
Tell us your name, where you're from
maybe, maybe, maybe a story of your funniest ER patient
whatever you want.
Who wants to go first?
Okay. I'll start.
I'll start by introducing my colleague
the chair of our department
the very beautiful and talented
Dr. Catherine Banfield.
Anything you want to share, Cate?
Not really.
You know what, I'll be honest.
She has a reputation as a bit of a hard-ass.
Does your boyfriend need another beer?
He is not my boyfrie..
- 'Right, Dr. Cole?' - Give me a refill, please.
Make it a double.
But, you know, deep down inside..
...she really, really, really cares.
Ah.
[siren wailing in the distance]
Did you ever call Gates back?
- Oh, man. - Good thing I'm here.
Teenage girl, full arrest.
Hey, what took you guys so long?
Waiting on the damn snowplows.
Her name's Ashley.
Backseat passenger, car versus utility pole.
She was ejected through the rear window.
- Very drunk. - Did she ever have a pulse?
- No. - Is that gray matter?
Looks like an open skull fracture.
One, two, three.
Asystole on the monitor.
(Neela) 'Resume compressions.'
(Samantha) 'What do you guys want?'
Blunt trauma, no vitals.
Not an indication for thoracotomy.
- 'She's so young.' - 'Okay.'
(Simon) 'Let's try and fix anything reversible.'
Pneumothorax, tamponade..
(Neela) Bilateral chest tubes, pericardial tap
'and four units of O-neg.'
- Sounds like a plan. - Patient number two is here.
At least they're not doing CPR.
- Grady wants another nurse. - Well, we're a little busy.
- 'We've got this, Sam.' - Go check it out.
Tell us what you need.
Fine.
What's the story?
Driver with altered mental status
chest trauma and a really bad shoulder dislocation.
What's your name?
Come on, tell us your name.
[groaning]
Portable C-spine, chest, pelvis and left shoulder.
(Samantha) 'Alex?'
Alex?
Mom.
Alex.
[machine beeping]
- Did you call her parents? - I left a voicemail.
The cops should go to her house.
I could use a second Thora-Seal.
Be right back.
I'm in. Bag him.
(Samantha) 'Tony, wake up.'
Alex snuck out of the house.
He was in a car crash.
You need to check on Sarah.
There's not much blood in the chest.
Let's get O-neg and a vent.
- You ready for the reduction? - Soon as we tape this in.
(Dawn) 'Sam, I can take over in here.'
- No, I'm okay. - Suri can do it.
(Samantha) 'No, she's got another trauma out there.'
Look, I'm not going anywhere, okay?
Let's fix this shoulder before the paralytics wear off.
Okay, come back as soon as you're done in there.
Ready, steady, pulling.
Uh, the humeral head is...stuck.
(Neela) 'Let's try again. I'll give you direct pressure.'
Go for it.
No, it won't budge. I'll get the skin hooks.
(Samantha) 'Labs are ready.'
Trauma panel, type and cross four?
And blood alcohol level.
Yeah, no, he doesn't drink.
I need you to keep still..
Doc, is the girl gonna make it?
Pretty unlikely.
Well, how about the boy?
It's too soon to tell.
Backseat passenger.
Head trauma or drugs and alcohol.
Okay, titrate Ativan and get him a head CT.
Also has a sternal contusion.
EKG and a chest X-ray.
- Where did you put her? - Leo, try to relax.
I'm right here, Ashley!
(Samantha) 'No, no, that is not a good answer.'
I wanna talk to your supervisor.
- Skin hooks. - The blood bank is outta O-neg.
And Red Cross can't deliver because of the snow.
- He's got a good crit. - Yeah, for now.
(Samantha) 'Hello, what is up with the O-neg?'
'We have multiple trauma victims here.'
What do you expect us to do?
We should get Dawn in here.
(Samantha) 'Uh, send O-positive.'
'The patient is a male.'
That'll work until we get the cross match.
Pulling.
There you go.
Got a pulse back at the wrist.
Okay, shoulder immobilizer and right to CT.
Alright.
'I got the Lifepak.'
The O-2 tank is full.
The chest tube is on water seal.
Okay, I'll go check on Grady.
I'll help you with the sling.
I think I've got it.
I got a little musical game
that we're gonna have some fun with, okay?
And the hotel has generously donated prizes
to all the winners.
Stuffed mushrooms and, uh, potato skins.
Your choice.
Okay? Yeah.
You guys ready? Okay.
[piano music]
* Oh the weather outside is.. *
* ...Frightful *
* But the fire is so.. *
No winners yet.
* ...Delightful *
* And since we've no place to go *
* Let it.. *
Stop.
[laughter]
* Let it stop *
* Make it stop *
[crowd applauding]
Whoo!
Stranded in Omaha in the dead of winter
listening to lame-ass music.
Does this suck or what?
[laughing]
You know what?
'Dermatology gets to go to Maui.'
I know.
Radiology to Acapulco?
I mean, just like always
ER gets no respect.
Uh-huh.
I mean, we bust our asses
taking care of people
that no one else wants to touch..
...24/7.
We deserve better.
[chuckling]
Got any foreigner?
Do you think we deserve better?
(all) Yeah!
[laughing]
[rock music]
Ready, and switch.
No tension pneumo, no effusion.
Did they ever find the parents?
Two more units, and then call it.
(Dawn) 'Faster and deeper, Ryan.'
How is the CT?
Good news, abdomen's benign, no brain bleed.
- But he won't wake up. - Give him some time.
- Oh, my God. - Front seat passenger.
I was trying to triage her. She wouldn't wait.
- You okay? - Broken wrist on the right.
Everything else seems fine.
- I need to get back out there. - Okay.
(Simon) 'Prep a subclavian on the right.'
How is he?
How does he look, huh?
- Were you drinking? - No.
- A little, but he wasn't. - Sam..
You were supposed to be home studying, you knew that.
- We were. - You snuck out.
It wasn't like that.
He has a learner's permit, Sarah.
He needs an adult in that car.
Ashley was too drunk to drive. He was just trying to help.
You can't call Tony or you can't call me or a cab?
What the hell is wrong with you, Sarah?
- What's wrong with you? - 'Introducer needle.'
Uh, I need a thin wall, not a 25, Sam.
- You got this? - Yeah.
Okay. Let's check you over, Sarah.
- I want to stay here. - Back in a few minutes, okay?
Come on.
[machine beeping]
* Said can I take you home where we can be alone *
* Next we were movin' on and he was with me *
* Yeah me *
* We were movin' on and singin' that same old song *
* Yeah with me singin' *
* I love rock and roll *
* Put another dime in the jukebox baby *
* I love rock and roll *
* So come and take your time and dance with me **
[crowd cheering]
Dude, you have got the coolest boss
in the whole world.
Whoo! How y'all doing?
Alright.
Uh, why don't we get Archie up here
so we can do a duet.
(female #1) 'Archie!'
[crowd cheering]
(Cate) 'Yeah! Give him some love!'
Give him some love!
(Cate) 'Yeah, give him some love.'
[crowd cheering] Archie! Archie! Archie! Archie!
[cheering]
Alright, ooh.
[laughs]
What do we want to sing, huh?
- I don't, I don't-- - "White Christmas?"
(female #2) 'Yeah.'
[groans]
I don't think so.
"Free bird!"
"Free bird."
[cheering]
Do you know "Walk This Way?"
[crowd cheering]
You know "Walk This Way?"
Whoo!
Tell you what, guys. Tell you what, guys.
Uh, we, we are going to "Walk This Way"
'...because I think'
the show is over, I'm sorry.
Let's get you some coffee.
Let's get you some coffee.
However, ACEP rocks, I mean it.
- It's, uh, you okay? - Whoo!
[crowd applauding]
Good-goodnight, Omaha!
Hold compressions.
Asystole.
That's it.
1:57, I'll get a shroud.
I'll clean her up.
Let's move her to the suture room.
Tidal volume 500, AC 14.
Turn him down to 80%.
You called it?
Crit's good, 41.
'Blood alcohol level is zero.'
He wasn't drinking.
[door opens]
(Tony) 'Sam.'
CT's all good.
Small hemothorax
and a bad concussion.
Dawn, this ET tube can use a little suctioning.
You wanna step out?
Sarah's here. She's getting a cast.
Yeah, I know.
Things seem stable in there.
How are you doing?
He was driving some drunk girl's car.
She just died.
And I don't know if he's going to wake up.
[sobbing]
I'm sorry, I..
I shouldn't have given in to them.
[sniffling]
What are you talking about?
I let them go to the party.
[sniffles]
You what?
I tried to call you.
No.
No-no, no, no.
We are not doing this now.
Sam.
[vomiting]
Alright, alright.
There you go.
[coughing]
Now you're gonna feel a whole lot better.
Alright?
[moaning]
You know, I hate to say this..
...but there's a lesson here.
[groans]
Yep.
Red wine and scotch don't mix.
Gotta remember that.
- You okay? - Mm.
- Want to take a little rest? - Mm.
Let me know when you're ready.
[groans]
[feet thumping]
[thumping stops]
Sorry.
[sighs]
You know..
...my dad was born in Lincoln.
Not too far from here.
When I was little..
...he used to drive us to my grandma's house.
I remember the ride took forever.
He'd, he'd yell at me
for kicking the back of his seat..
...or getting crumbs on the floor
or...breathing too loud.
[chuckles]
That was my dad.
Yeah.
You know, he, uh, he died last year.
'We hadn't spoken in years.'
He's got this storage locker..
...in Indiana.
'They can either trash it'
'or I can go deal with his stuff.'
It could be a complete waste of time.
Or maybe...I'd learn something
about a father I didn't really know.
Ortho can take Alex in an hour.
No problems. His vitals are stable.
Dr. Brenner, Leo's positive on opiates
benzos and marijuana.
Okay.
How about, um, aspirin and Tylenol?
We sent them. None detected.
See that?
I get attitude from all the interns.
Well, maybe they don't like you picking on one of them.
You mean Andrew? We've worked through that.
When I was an intern, I was friends with all my residents.
Well, you're more like an attending.
I don't feel that way.
Well, you make them nervous.
You showed them some teeth.
Man, no one's delivering pizza in this snow.
How can you be hungry at a time like this?
You still got to eat?
I may have to nuke the pigs' feet.
Has anyone seen trauma two's chart?
Right here, Dr. Rasgotra.
Oh, Brenner, I got family in here from Gilda--
(Laverne) 'I need some help here!'
[sighs]
Wait a minute, Chaz.
Weren't you with that Ashley girl?
Yeah.
Somebody has to talk to her brother.
- No, I'm supposed to observe. - Mm-mm.
I've been stalling for an hour.
You're all I've got.
This is Chaz Pratt.
He's one of our student doctors.
Where's Ashley?
[sighs] You two are the brothers?
No, just Tyler.
And you are..
The babysitter, I guess.
Tyler's supposed to hang out at my place till midnight.
That was two hours ago.
'Picked up the message and the little guy was freaking out'
'so I brought him in.'
Can I see my sister?
Her doctors are working on her.
Where are their parents?
'In Europe for a couple of weeks.'
You got it from here, 'cause I gotta get my truck towed
or dug out or something.
Sating well at 50%.
Less than a 100 cc's from the chest.
Sam, I let them go to the party as a reward
because they busted their ass on their homework.
We all agreed, no party tonight.
I quizzed him, he knew it all.
- Great. - I tried to call you.
They walked to the party.
I don't know what to do.
I'm trying to be his friend, I'm trying to be a good father..
Tony.
Did Ashley really die?
Yeah.
[sobbing]
I can't believe it.
That is awful.
It is.
I'm sorry.
Alex, is doing better.
Come on, let's go get you some Kleenex.
(Neela) 'Head CT was negative?'
(Laverne) 'No fracture, no bleed.'
(Sarah) 'Is that Leo?'
Leo, the kid that calls you every night?
- What's going on? - Looks like a bad drug OD.
He's had eight of Ativan.
I told him not to take that crap.
What crap?
(Sarah) 'It's called "Trail Mix."'
Kids steal prescription pills from their parents
and everyone throws it into a big bowl.
[sighs]
Sats are down intubation tray.
You know what, it could be antidepressants, push bicarb.
Okay, 100 milli-equivalents over two minutes.
Come on.
(man on TV) 'Would you like to pick one up?'
(Woman on TV) 'Police are on the scene..'
- 'Forecast doesn't look..' - 'It's only 30..'
You're not gonna spend 129..
Am I ready for a facelift?
Nothing but news and infomercials.
When can I see Ashley?
In a little bit.
We've got some magazines.
Eh, I know where they have some video games.
I want to see my sister.
Okay.
I'll go check with her doctors.
Hey, Frank..
...I need Brenner to talk to the little brother.
He's all tied up.
Well, how about a social worker?
At 3:00 in the morning?
Is there an on-call chaplain or something?
Trauma two's open.
Grab a cutdown tray, he's in tamponade.
Chaz, find me an ultrasound.
- Table for two? - Yeah.
Some, uh, coffee for you folks?
- Definitely. - I'll have some hot tea.
We've got a couple of night owl specials.
A, um, apple pancakes
and a spicy breakfast burrito.
Ooh, what's in the burrito?
(female #3) 'Uh, eggs, onions, bell peppers, uh, chorizo'
jalapeno jack cheese and chunky salsa.
One of those and a large OJ.
I'll have some dry toast.
And some napkins when you get a chance.
You need silver. I completely forgot to set your table.
Pregnancy brain.
'I'd forget my head if it wasn't screwed on.'
[chuckles]
It's called a pericardial window.
They're removing blood clots from around Leo's heart
so it can beat stronger.
- I can't watch this. - Alright.
Dawn.
- 'No problem. Come on, Sarah.' - Let you know how it goes.
(Samantha) 'Heart rate's up to 120.'
We can run another liter of saline.
- What for? - Case we're behind on fluids.
What if he's bleeding in the belly?
- CT was negative. - Yeah, well, things change.
- I want to get Neela in here. - Alright.
Let's run another crit and FAST exam.
That's what she would do.
Maybe Grady can break out and reassess him.
Blood loss is unlikely.
I think it's hypoxia, dehydration, pain..
What do you know? I want a surgeon in here.
How's he doing?
- Okay. - Good.
Have you guys seen a little boy, six years old?
I left him in the break room and now he's gone.
He's not in here.
Why won't she wake up?
Why won't she wake up?
Pressure's up to 110.
That's a hell of a lot better than 60.
Cardiac team's waiting in the OR.
Let's go.
Nice work, doctor.
He's in sinus tach.
His crit went from 41 to 38.
Could be just dilutional from all the fluids.
- That's what I said. - Or it could be pain.
We could dial up the sedation.
But, then you'd miss an intra-abdominal bleed.
Ultrasound's still negative.
He's not bleeding in the belly.
Or the chest.
Well, you can't be sure of that without a repeat CT.
You know what, I really think that my kid
deserves a surgical attending.
Where's Dubenko? Or where's Crenshaw?
- Not available. - What?
Dawn's here. Alex is in good hands.
- Let's take a break. - I don't need a break!
You want a cup of coffee?
'You want something to eat?'
You never listen to me.
I'm checking for blood loss, I ordered a third CBC.
Neela and Brenner agree with my plan.
You've got to trust us, Sam.
Trust you? Why would I trust you?
I wanted Alex to stay home and study.
- You knew that! - Sam..
What?
You'd rather be his friend than an adult.
Come here. I know how to be a parent.
Oh, really? Why would I believe that?
You don't know anything about their friends
you let them do whatever they want.
You've made mistake after mistake with your kid
and now you wanna do the same with mine, yeah, right!
Go ahead and keep screwing up Sarah but I am sure as hell
not gonna let you near Alex again.
- I know you're upset. - Don't!
And I know you don't mean that.
Okay.
It's okay.
I need to be with him.
I saw what my classmates were doing, during med school
during residency
but I wasn't going there, you know.
I mean, every other night on call.
That's no way to raise a kid.
You know, so...I put if off.
Oh, nothing wrong with that.
I mean, by the time I was pregnant
I had a good salary, a good schedule.
I was secure.
I was older.
A lot of people prefer it that way.
Hm.
When we lost...Daryl
I was 40.
But we tried.
You know.
You know, eventually it worked out.
I mean, everything looked pretty great.
The baby looked perfect on the ultrasound.
[sighs]
And you know..
...then at three months..
You had a miscarriage?
'I'm sorry.'
I just took it as a sign it wasn't supposed to be.
[sighs]
Look, I made a choice.
I devoted myself to my training, to my profession.
And now, I'm chief of an academic department.
Yeah. That is a huge accomplishment.
I invested in my career
I've been a great success.
[sighs]
You can't have everything.
[door opens]
I thought you were sleeping.
Leo's surgery went well.
They fixed his heart.
Good.
And, uh, Alex is going up for shoulder surgery.
Want to go see him?
I hate that room.
Okay. Later, then, huh?
You okay in here?
Okay, why don't you lie down and get some sleep?
I heard Sam yelling.
Yeah, she's mad at me.
She has a right to be.
'It'll be okay.'
(Dawn) 'His third crit went up.'
'That's good.'
How's he doing?
- Better with fluids and Versed. - Brought you a water.
Would you just put it on the counter, please?
Heart rate's 160.
Pressure's down to 80 systolic.
Get Neela back in here. He needs blood.
- Sam, you don't know that. - Well, it's my best guess.
Okay, there are two units in the cooler.
Where do you think he's bleeding?
It doesn't matter where. We need to transfuse.
(Neela) 'Give me the ultrasound.'
- Stat portable chest. - Repeat the HemoCue.
- Simon, you see any P waves? - What?
They're there. You just can't see them.
Excuse me.
Hey, I can't get to the subclavian.
(Simon) 'Breath sounds a bit down here.'
- Alright. - Place another chest tube.
- 'Tony, I need to prep.' - What are you doing?
Everybody back off.
I'm gonna run the EKG at twice the speed.
It'll spread out the complexes.
I need to ultrasound.
There might be hemothorax.
(Tony) 'Alright. Shut up and look.'
'No P waves. It's not sinus tach.'
It's SVT. We need to cardiovert.
He's not bleeding.
He's got an arrhythmia from a bruised heart.
- Let's get them on there, Sam. - Hold on.
Clear.
(Simon) 'Heart rate's 82.'
(Neela) 'Looks like normal sinus.'
(Dawn) 'BP's 110/74.'
Thank you.
- 'Dr. Brenner?' - Yeah?
(Chaz) 'You got a minute?'
Looks like I do now.
Let's run a 12 lead.
(Neela) 'CK, troponin and cardiac echo.'
The girl who died, her little brother's here by himself.
- What about the parents? - They're out of town.
And...he saw her body.
I don't really think he gets it, but I don't know what to do.
Okay. Okay, I'll.. Come on.
I'll-I'll talk to him.
(female #3) 'More coffee?'
No. Just the check, please.
Okey-dokey. I'll be right back.
[phone ringing]
- Hello. - 'Is this Dr. Banfield.'
Yes.
Oh. Oh. Hold on.
Just a minute.
A room just opened up at the hotel.
- Great. - Just one room.
Oh. Yeah, go ahead.
- Hmm. - Go ahead. No.
I can hang out here.
- You sure? - Yeah.
Alright, I'll take it.
Okay. Thank you.
[sighs]
Uh, here you go. You folks have a..
Oh, I think my baby just kicked first time.
[laughs]
- Hm. - That's wonderful.
Uh, can you feel it?
It's like popcorn popping.
Yes, it is.
Congratulations.
I got to go call my husband.
Pff.
Hey, Tyler.
Hi.
This is Dr. Brenner.
Nice to meet you, Tyler.
Is Ashley awake yet?
(Simon) 'Tyler..'
...your sister was in a car crash.
She flew out the window.
Right.
And she hit the ground very hard.
And it made her stop breathing
and-and then, her heart stopped beating.
We did everything we could for her, and we..
We gave her medicine and oxygen and blood.
But sometimes..
Sometimes people are-are injured so bad..
...that we can't save them.
'And that's what happened to your sister.'
We did everything we could for her..
...but we couldn't help her.
'And she died.'
Maybe you can try some more.
Maybe she needs another operation.
That wouldn't work.
Are you sure?
I'm sorry.
Your mom and dad are gonna come back to town tomorrow.
In the meantime, we're gonna keep an eye on you.
Can you stay with me now?
I'm not going anywhere.
(Paul) 'Hey, Dr. Brenner..'
...Alex is going up to surgery.
Everyone else is tucked in.
Okay if we send the interns home a little early?
- Yeah, it's fine by me. - Cool.
Ugh, I was going to catch some z's up in the call room.
But I think I'll go home, see my kids.
(Neela) 'I thought this shift would never end.'
- Yeah. - Uh-huh.
You know, when I was an intern
after a rough night, my resident would take us
all out for breakfast.
It's my treat. What do you say?
You know, with the snow, I'm pretty sure everything's closed.
- Right. - But thank you, Dr. Rasgotra.
Maybe next time.
They all hate me.
You're just their boss.
It's not fun hanging out with the boss.
Well, if I hurry, I can pre-round before I sign out.
You did a fantastic job on the traumas.
- Everyone pitched in. - Incredible saves.
I wouldn't wanna be stuck in here
all night with anyone but you.
- Oh, that's enough. - No, I'm serious.
And forget about the deposition.
If the case goes to court, I'll testify on your behalf.
You'll be golden.
And for what it's worth
you can ask me out to breakfast any morning.
Except this morning. I've got to cover for Banfield.
[sighing]
[sighs]
Goodnight, Dr. Banfield.
Goodnight, Dr. Morris.
[groans]
Ah.
Just for the record..
...tonight never happened.
[sighs]
(Tony) 'Since Sarah finally fell asleep'
when Alex goes to surgery, I'm gonna take her home.
You want me to pick you up a change of clothes?
- Yeah, sure. - Okay.
Uh, sorry about your son.
I was out at the investigation.
He swerved to avoid a minivan
that skidded through a red light.
Missed 'em completely.
Could have been a lot worse.
Yeah.
[sighs]
Ortho wants a couple more films
before they take him up.
Alex, your mom's back.
Did he just open his eyes?
- I think so. - Alex?
(Samantha) 'Hey, over here.'
Hi. Hi.
It's okay. It's okay to sleep.
I'm right here, okay?
I got to take these to the lab.
I was really mad. I am..
Those things that I said, Tony, I..
'What I said about Sarah, I didn't mean that.'
Okay.
I know you try.
And that we all make mistakes.
It's just..
...this is a pretty big mistake.
[sighs]
''Cause he's everything to me.'
And I'm still just trying to deal with it.
[water sloshing]
What the hell?
- Oh, God. - Pressure's down.
Lost the pulse. We got to open up his chest.
- PEA arrest! - I'll bag him.
(Tony) 'Four units packed cells, four FFP.'
- Tony.. - Two liters gushed out.
Delayed aortic rupture.
We need to get a side clamp on it.
I've got it.
'Hold CPR.'
'Get ready for internal compressions.'
(Dawn) 'Two units hanging.'
(Simon) Chest incision right now.
'Rib spreader, please.'
