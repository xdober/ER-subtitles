(female narrator) Previously on"ER.."
Couple months from now, I'll be a first-year med student.
It's all thanks to you, Greg.
Trying to show off to Daria by making me look small.
You know what? That is never gonna fly.
Hey, teaching the interns is part of my job.
What do you want me to do?
You know, you gave me some great tips on our last shift.
I'm really glad we're working together.
What are you doing here?
There's nothing going on between us.
We work together and that's it.
I know. I thought we could have a drink.
I wanna stay with him. I want to push his gurney.
We embrace the memory of our colleague and our dear friend.
[car horn blaring]
[engine revving]
They're coming tonight?
We talked about this two weeks ago.
It's not a good weekend.
So when's good? Pick a date.
I'm working a shift Saturday. I won't even be around.
They're excited. They've been planning this.
They're about to drive five hours
to come see you, see us.
You want me to tell 'em not to bother?
I think you better.
Been doing that since you got back.
- They're starting to wonder. - Wonder what?
What's wrong.
I got a full day, alright? The house is a mess.
- They need clean linens. - Look.
Look, I've already set up the guestroom.
We'll stay in tonight, have dinner.
I don't have time to cook dinner.
Then we'll go out.
After that drive, they're not gonna want to go out.
It's just three days.
[scoffs]
They're your family. And they miss you.
It's not my fault the pipes froze up and burst.
What?
Okay, well, then you can at least pay for the hotel.
No.
No.
No, no, no. Well, I don't care what the law says. I..
Okay, you know what? Forget it.
Thank you, you jerk.
I don't understand how he can do that.
We have two days to find a place while they fix the stupid pipes.
I don't..
You know, there is an obvious solution.
[horn blaring]
Hey, hey! Excuse me, sir. You can't be right there.
I gotta pick up a Physiology syllabus.
I'll see you inside, okay?
Alright. Hey, come on, buddy.
We got sick people in here. Let's go.
- Let's go. - Come on, Jake, let's go.
[dog barking]
Order me around. Don't order me around!
[groaning]
And today's the fourth time in three weeks
that you crashed your bike?
[sighs] Where does it hurt at, exactly?
(Patti) 'Right side. Shoots down my leg.'
Any weakness in the foot?
Are you for real? I can hardly walk!
Chaz, my man, how we doing?
Good. I put a splint on your ankle guy
and restocked the paramedic cart.
Already? Wow.
I need something for the pain, damn it!
You've already had ten of morphine.
- It ain't touched me. - You know what, Patti?
Maybe you should start thinking about taking the bus.
'I mean, not that we don't thoroughly'
enjoy seeing you every week.
Dr. Morris, I'm concerned about a L-4 motor deficit.
Huh? She's never had that before.
Could be nerve root impingement. Cord compression.
You know, we should check for Cauda Equina Syndrome.
We're checking labs and doing blood draws?
He's a first-year med student. He should be observing.
Teacher's pet needs to learn how to do a physical.
I heard he's an EMT, he still works shifts.
I can't stand those do-it-all guys.
Especially ones named Chaz. What kind of name is that?
Chaz Pratt, nice coat.
[chuckles] What's up, Tony?
Hey, Frank, page Neurosurge.
I need a stat lumbar MRI on Patti.
You mean Patti, the pain in the ass?
Yeah. You know, we all assume she's full of it
but Chaz picked up a foot drop.
She may need emergent decompression surgery.
Nice job, buddy.
Healin' and dealin', I dig it.
Hey, you guys should take her up to Radiology.
Maybe the med student could do that.
Good idea. You know what? We'll all go.
I'll meet you guys up there.
Cool.
Dude, Chaz, he's a natural. Must be in the genes.
- Oh, yeah? - Yeah. He's awesome.
- Smarter than I ever was. - That ain't sayin' much.
Stable pneumonia, had Ceftriaxone and Zithro.
Medicine's admitting.
Frank, why has my cellulitis guy been here all night?
Oh, get in line, Gates.
I just got here. I haven't had my coffee.
CHF'er with intractable nausea, ultrasound's negative
so I'm thinking gastro.
No, Digitoxicity could explain the symptoms.
She's right. Good thinking.
Alright, I'll add a level.
Why you all dressed up? You got a hot date or something?
You're blushing.
No, Dr. Banfield just suggested that I-I present myself more
you know, professionally, so..
These are not gonna cure themselves.
What do I gotta do to get some damn morphine
from you people!
- Okay, let's do this. - Thank God!
So, Chaz, you'll see a herniated disc at L4-L5
L5-S1 according to our exam on Miss McPhee.
Dr. Morris can we go in the booth?
No you cannot go in the booth.
Now get her in here. I haven't got all day.
(Chaz) 'Let me give you guys a hand.'
Can we go in the booth?
[Patti screams]
You didn't switch out the gurneys?
- I thought he did it. - I thought you did it.
I didn't know it had to be done.
Can I get my morphine now?
[theme music]
How much? Does that come with breakfast or anything?
Okay, thank you.
Frank, do you know any good, cheap hotels?
Goodandcheap, no. One or the other.
Hey, Sam, you think about my solution?
- 'Solution?' - Yeah, to your problem.
Well, if you got one, spit it out.
Alright, I was thinking that maybe you--
(Daria) 'Uh, sorry. Excuse me, Sam.'
Um, Mr. Rappaport in Three needs a repeat trope drawn.
It should've been sent an hour ago.
Sorry. I don't know why night shift didn't tell me.
I'll get it.
And if he's got two negative troponins?
Low-risk patient.
If Cards can do a treadmill today, he'll go home.
Alright, good plan.
Hey, Crash, how's it goin'? Radiology called.
Said you owe 'em 300 large for a new scanner.
You heard about that already?
Yeah, I heard you almost killed a woman.
Her-her plain films were negative. She's fine.
Oh, Chaz, I don't know if anyone's told you
but the M in MRI stands for magnetic.
Thanks for the tip.
Dr. Morris, Miss McPhee's still pretty upset
about the whole gurney thing, but her foot drop resolved.
She's got full range of motion.
Ha!
Well, the accident must've been some weird
chiropractic manipulation.
Nice job.
You cured a patient.
[chuckles]
I should go check the supply carts in the exam rooms.
And through there are the Trauma rooms
where all the really serious cases go.
Hey, Brenner, I got your unstable angina
admitted to cards.
Thanks. Morris, Frank, these are my mates, Colin and Roger.
These your derelict countrymen I've heard about?
- Pleasure. - Good day.
Ah, good day to you, too.
Dr. Morris we gotta rig coming in.
Oh, hello, there.
- Hi. - 'Dawn Archer.'
- Hi, there. - Charmed.
(Simon) 'Okay, that's about it, guys.'
There you have it. County General.
- Beauty, man. It's impressive. - Yeah, good on you.
Still can't believe you guys still trust the bastard
with actual human lives.
- Us either. - 'Much appreciated, Frank.'
- Where you guys headed? - Big game.
Seven's against the dreaded Kiwis.
It's rugby. It's seven on seven
against some boys from New Zealand.
Oh, I've always wanted to learn rugby.
Maybe I can come out with you sometime.
Yeah, maybe.
Yeah, I was a kicker for my high school football team.
Yeah, if you ever, if you ever need an extra.
Right now, we're good, bro. I'm all signed out.
But I'll see you guys later.
Are you gonna play in your stubbies?
(Colin) 'Yeah, I'm true blue, man.'
Somebody print out a recipe for chicken piccata?
Do you read everything that comes off the printer, Frank?
Yes. And if you need recipes
I got some that can knock your socks off.
Keep your recipes to yourself.
Looks like maybe it's just gastroenteritis.
Do think they'd call us down here for a non-surgical problem?
Is this about my two year old with vomiting?
- Mm-hmm. - What's your differential?
Uh, right. Okay, so something structural
'like, uh, maybe..'
I'm thinking malrotation with a possible volvulus.
How do you think we should proceed?
(Neela) 'I'll order an upper GI.'
Oh, you mind if I do the cut down?
No, not today. Too busy. Go back to the floor.
I'll just put in a line and meet you back at rounds.
- Derek Taylor, 21. - Move, please!
Facial and chest trauma from a knockout in the fifth round.
- How you doing, Derek? - Move!
Been better.
They didn't say nothing about him being a Southpaw.
- Coming through! - Dawn, what's open?
- Trauma Two's ready. - I hate Southpaws.
Dr. Morris, I'd like to discuss the case
of the levitating gurney at some point.
- Be there as soon as I can! - Looks like a broken nose.
Third time.
But I feel pretty good now. I don't need all this.
Yo, Chaz, facial trauma with LOC.
'We can review the cranial nerve exam.'
Well, lookie what we got here.
Bards, what's up, baby?
Not much, ice cream man. Looks good on you.
You know how to assess
for mandible fractures with a tongue blade?
- No. - Good. I'll show you.
- You sending him to CT? - Definitely.
Dr. Banfield said we should jump in on this.
Yeah, sure. Kaya, on your count.
Okay, one, two, three.
Pleasure doing business with you.
Chaz, don't screw it up.
Trauma panel, portable chest, head and facial CT.
Kaya, eyes and nose. Ryan, extremities.
Chaz, we'll do the primary assessment.
(Dawn) 'Pulse ox 99 on two liters.'
Sixth round, I was gonna make my move.
You were a round too late.
(Chaz) 'Breath sounds good bilaterally.'
- A little tachycardic. - I agree completely.
(Derek) 'Ithought I had him. Damn.'
You cannot explain that sport to me. Look at this poor man.
Lid edema, no hyphema.
Peripheral pulses intact.
They call it the sweet science for a reason.
It's a lot harder than it looks.
I'm not saying it ain't hard, just stupid.
So, what are you, a middleweight?
Welterweight.
You a fighter?
No, my dad just showed me a little bit.
Mine, too.
My old man won the Golden Gloves back in the day.
CT is starting a guided biopsy.
Okay, tell 'em if they can't take him next
I'll talk to an attending. Maybe Betina's on.
We had dinner together the other night.
- Oh, yeah? How's she doing? - Really good.
She's just putting in a lot of work
on that after-school program we starting in Greg's name.
You pretty young for a doctor.
I'm a med student.
- 'Brainiac, huh?' - 'Not really.'
I just decided this is what I wanna do.
Looks like it's working out for you.
Trying. It's not easy, though.
- I feel you. - He's got a septal hematoma.
- 'I need an 11 blade.' - It's okay.
I'll do the procedure with Chaz.
[car horn blaring]
- Hey. - Hey.
- Labs come back on taxi lady? - What? Oh, yeah.
Uh, Isolated thrombocytopenia. Yeah, just like you thought.
Did Hematology see her?
Uh, yeah, they want to start an IVIG.
Blood bank's gonna send it down.
- Perfect. Coffee? - Okay.
No, no, I get this, uh, this per cent latte thing.
Thanks, though.
[dog whining]
'Hey, you want a hot coffee?'
It's cold out here. I have an extra.
Here.
You wanna come inside, have us check you out?
'Have a shower, hot meal?'
I hate hospitals.
Alright, offer stands.
L-shaped incision from high to low
then along the floor of the nose.
Okay.
Okay, if we don't drain it, we get something
called pressure necrosis of the septum.
Go for it.
Everything okay in here?
Yeah, draining a septal hematoma.
Pressure down to 80 systolic.
Squeeze in a liter of saline.
Pulse ox down to 85.
Set the packing underneath the flap.
How you doing, sir?
Sir?
One hundred percent non-rebreather.
Intubation tray and repeat the hemocue.
Uh, prep a cordis for the IJ.
(Banfield) 'Please tell me why we're ignoring the ABC's'
of a critical trauma patient.
No, we were doing an emergent procedure
and the patient was stable.
- Did you call surgery? - They're on their way.
And who's your assistant with the short coat?
- Med student. - Fourth year?
First.
You got him with a scalpel up a patient's nose.
Anything wrong with that picture, Dr. Morris?
[ECG machine beeping]
Kaya, left upper quadrant.
No perisplenic blood.
And the subxiphoid view?
Negative for pericardial effusion.
I'm not getting a flash.
- I'll give it a try. - No.
Andrew, 45-degree angle.
'Aim for the ipsilateral nipple.'
Level one is ready with two liters.
Soon as they get the line.
(Neela) 'A little higher.'
- No. - I can't get it.
Okay, move.
- No blood in the belly. - 'Got a flash.'
Chest is still clear pupils are still equal.
(Dawn) 'Repeat hemocue is 14.2.'
Oh, I guess we didn't miss any internal bleeding.
- He's just dehydrated. - You got lucky.
Alright, you, you, you and you, with me.
Was I not clear? Now please.
Excuse me. Dr. Wade's a surgical intern.
In my department.
And I wanna see the two of you at the desk as well
as soon as you're finished here.
Now is the time when you acquire
the skills you need for the future.
Do not let upper level residents and attendings decide your fate.
You get in there. This is your shot.
'Speak up for your right to be educated.'
And if your supervisors aren't respecting that right
then you talk to me.
Except for you.
You...stay quiet, stand back and watch.
You are barely qualified to speak.
'Okay, then.'
'Let's get back to work.'
Look, I know what you're gonna say.
We are teachers at a teaching hospital.
Which means we have a bunch of young kids running around here
trying to learn how not to kill patients!
I understand that--
Then why are you teaching a first-year med student
a procedure that your interns should be doing?
- Chaz was an EMT. - That's irrelevant.
He is only here to observe.
Teach your interns, Dr. Morris. Both of you.
They learn by doing, let them do things.
Teach, educate, delegate.
That's your job.
Now go clear the board.
Um, excuse me, Dr. Banfield, but with all due respect
we have a different culture in surgery.
And?
And I'm going to supervise my internas I feel appropriate.
And I don't appreciate you undermining my authority.
Dr. Rasgotra, I prefer to handle this at the attending level.
You have a problem, have Dr. Dubenko give me a call.
Alright, keep him warm.
Keep the head of the bed up 30 degrees.
Hey, Sam, I wanna ask you something.
Uh, so I wasn't so clear earlier.
About what?
What?
Move in with me.
You and Alex need a place to stay, you stay with me.
[siren wailing]
No. We're not a charity case.
Who said anything about charity? We'll split the rent.
You mean, like, temporarily?
Yeah, if that's what you want.
Your place is too small.
We have an extra bedroom downstairs we don't even use.
What am I supposed to tell Alex?
Alex and Sarah get along. Me and Alex are cool.
[laughs]
You're insane!
It's way too soon. It would never work.
Why are you laughing at me?
I thought you wanted to get serious.
I, no, I do. I'm not laughing at you.
Well, it sure seems like you're laughing.
You know, you're something else.
Why do you have to do everything the hard way?
You know what? Forget it. Forget I even asked.
'Just forget it.'
- Tony.. - Need a little help over here!
(male #1) 'Hey! Help over here!'
Excuse me?
There's something wrong with him.
[dramatic music]
Hey, sir?
'Sir!'
How long you gonna keep this up, huh? How long?
Eight hundred bucks, pop. Double if I win.
- We need that. - Not this bad.
Dawn, he needs three grams of Unasyn.
- I'm on it. - Are you Derek's dad?
- Yeah. Louie Taylor. - Dr. Morris.
Uh, the CT was negative.
No bleeding in the brain, it's good news.
That means you're gonna be okay. He's gonna be okay, right?
Derek, you have a depressed zygoma fracture.
Basically means your cheek bone is broken.
- 'But that's serious.' - 'No, it's completely fixable.'
But it does require surgery.
How long's it take to come back from that?
Good six weeks of recovery.
You should be able to train with headgear after that.
Got another about in two months.
- Damn it, Derek-- - Don't start, pop!
I ain't loading boxes for nine dollars an hour.
No, you'd rather continue getting your ass beat, right?
Let's-let's take it one thing at a time. Okay?
We'll get you through the operation first. Okay?
Surgery should be down soon to take you up.
Hey, Dr. Morris.
You think he's really gonna be able to fight again?
Yeah, there's a good chance.
Procedure's very routine, and he's young.
- You okay? - Spinal stenosis.
Up until a couple months ago, I was able to work full time.
You know, hit the gym a few days a week.
Oh. We got some great surgeons here.
Yeah, I'm-I'm on the list. 18 month wait.
Derek's got in his head he's gonna..
...make enough fighting, get me the surgery.
That and a new car, a new house.
- Seems like a great kid. - Yeah.
He showed a lot of promise when he was young, you know?
Then his mother died.
He's got a lot of heart, doc
but his-his record's five and 28.
Well, nothing's easy at first but he keeps at it, who knows?
Yeah, but-but, doc..
You know what they say about a fighter like that?
He's a stiff, a bum.
A silent offering.
My son gets paid to lose. They laugh at him.
Then they throw him in the ring that somebody for real manhood
can use him to tune up on.
You know what I'm saying? And for what?
[sniffles]
Man, I was good.
And still, I was barely good enough to turn pro.
And Derek ain't half the fighter I used to be.
Difference between us is that I knew when to hang it up.
Now he won't listen to me.
But maybe he'll listen to you.
Maybe you could talk to him.
Help me out.
Give him a real reason to stop, huh?
Due respect, Mr. Taylor, but I can't do that.
He's a grown man.
If he's got something he wants to do
there's-there's nothing I can say about it.
He's killing himself.
But he's going for what he wants.
Maybe you should...think about giving him a little support.
Excuse me. Excuse me, please.
Watch out.
Maybe he hit his head.
No sign of trauma.
Can we finish our talk later?
Daria, give us a hand, please.
Oh, um, no, actually, Dr. Banfield really--
Now please.
What do you think he's altered from?
- Probably ingestion. - Of what?
Coma's pretty deep.
Benzos, barbs, Opiates.
No pinpoint pupils, respirations aren't suppressed.
Do you want me to start a line and draw some labs?
No. Sam can do that.
Actually, I think it'd be really good for me
to have the practice.
- Thank you, Daria. - Sam, vitals.
I'm putting him on the machine now.
Alright.
Okay, um, what kind of labs do you want?
I want Chemistry, I want CBC, ETOH levels
'Acetaminophen and Aspirin, please.'
- Tony. - Huh?
- Looks like yours. - 'Oh, yeah.'
Alright, we need to scan. Can I have my light, please?
- Got to secure his airway. - I don't wanna wait.
- Light, please. My light. - Yes.
Um, you know what, it seems like you two have this under control.
- I'm gonna just-- - No, actually, Daria.
Will you stay here and check his Babinski, please?
- We should give him Dextrose. - 'No, I wanna a finger stick.'
(Samantha) 'It'll take too long.'
[gasping] 'Whoa, whoa, whoa.'
Do you want me to get some Ativan?
- Yeah, two migs. - Mixing up Dilantin.
- Mix up Dilantin. - Oh!
[clatters]
(Daria) 'Sorry!'
Get the Ativan!
Dilantin load's running.
So his tattoo, that means he's Army, right?
Yeah, a paratrooper.
- Same as you. - Yep.
Let's get some antibiotics on board
two grams of Ceftriaxone and one gram of Vanco.
I think maybe we should get him on some steroids, too.
Listen, I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings earlier.
Dr. Gates, uh..
...he's waking up.
[clears throat] So steroids?
Yeah, Decadron, ten milligrams.
Okay. Don't let me tell you what to do.
Don't worry, you're not.
Alright.
Feeling okay?
Huh?
How you feeling?
Like I got my bell rung.
Yeah, you had a seizure.
You ever had one of those before?
I don't know.
Can you tell me your name?
Max.
- And your last name? - 'How-how'd I get in here?'
Uh, last thing I remember, I was drinking coffee.
We found you passed out on the street.
Where's Jake?
My dog.
Um, sorry, I don't know.
I-I gotta go.
- Where's my stuff? - We got your duffel--
I got stuff I need in my duffel.
Yeah, we got it, don't worry about it.
- Hey. - I-I gotta go.
- No, no, no. - Jake needs me.
Whoa! Alright. Oh, my God!
Okay, come on, sit down.
- 'Please!' - Jake!
'You need to stay in bed, sir.'
We're gonna find him, okay? Don't worry.
And Neuro wants us to send CSF for prions
and HSV for our ataxic guy.
What? He's just stoned? What's wrong with neurologists?
I don't know. That's all I've got.
I've got an ingrown toenail in Three with my name on it.
- So I'm gonna.. - Alright. Hey, hey, hey.
- Huh? - Are you okay?
Yeah, no. I mean, why wouldn't I be okay?
- DoI-do I not seem okay? - You seem hasty.
No. No, no.
- I-I'm just busy, that's all. - Okay.
Okay. Bye.
Hey, Frank, do you have the LFT's on my jaundice guy?
Yeah. I'll-I'll find them.
- Excuse me, Dr. Banfield? - Mm.
I can't just stand by and watch.
Uh...here.
- Veal Frank-alini. - I thought I told you--
Maybe you can't tell this by looking at me.
I happen to be a culinary genius.
I used to cook for all the guys down at the precinct
all the time, and Chicago cops know good food.
Now this is my variation on a timeless classic.
Veal scaloppini with a chanterelle cream sauce.
A little touch of heaven.
Now, the key is the chanterelles.
A good chanterelle is firm.
You don't want a soft chanterelle.
Please stop saying chanterelle.
Sorry.
Thank you...Frank.
You're welcome.
Hey, you.
[clears throat]
Russ, what are you doing here?
Didn't like the way we left things.
- You-you got a minute? - No, I don't. I'm busy.
You should've called.
I've been trying your cell all day. Left messages--
You know, you just can't show up at work like this.
- I need to talk to you. - Well, not here.
Cate..
Uh..
Sorry, I-I can come back later.
What is it, doctor?
My husband, Russell Banfield.
Hello. I'm Neela Rasgotra.
- Nice to meet you. - You, too.
Would you wait for me outside, please?
[door buzzing]
Um, you know, it...really can wait.
- I didn't mean to-- - I'm here now. Go.
Okay. Uh, so, I spoke to Dr. Dubenko
and he feels that I should handle our..
...issue on my own, especially--
- 'Dr. Banfield?' - You know what, Dr. Rasgotra?
We'll do it your way, hmm?
Make things nice and easy for you.
And you let me know if there's anythingelseI can do.
[door buzzing]
What happened here?
- Rugby match. - 'You win?'
23-6. I think that qualifies as a massacre.
Can't we get on with this? All I really need is a drink.
Yeah, I'll go and get you wrapped up.
We'll get some Ibuprofen and some ice.
Hey, uh, you should come celebrate with us.
Bring some of your pretty little nurse friends along.
I don't think mysurgeon friends would be interested.
Well, we're gonna head over to Ike's.
Stop by if you're free.
Yeah, maybe you could have a spot of tea.
You know, leave the real drinking to us.
Unasyn finally came up from the pharmacy.
Yo, med student, what's up, man?
- You graduate yet? - Not yet.
(Louie) 'How much longer you gonna keep us down here?'
I thought you said he needed surgery.
He's next. I'm sorry. They're swamped with emergency cases.
But isn't he an emergency? I mean, look at him.
- Give the guy a break, pop. - It's okay.
Gives me time to do a full neural assessment.
Chaz, will you cover that eye for me, please?
(Chaz) 'Sure.'
Okay, I want you to look into my eye and not move yours
and tell me when you see my finger moving.
- Now. - Alright.
Tell me again when you see it moving.
How about now?
Now.
There's a visual field deficit.
- Translate. - Well, your retina's fine.
Which means it could be a problem in your brain.
- What? - You said my brain was okay.
Well, it might be something called a diffuse axonal injury.
It doesn't show up on a CT.
Usually happens with repetitive head trauma.
You mean like getting punched over and over again!
Which is why you keep getting hit by all those shots, man.
Look,Icould step in there and take you out.
Imagine what somebody half my age would do.
He's got brain damage, right?
Well, we need to get an MRI to be sure.
You can't keep doing this to yourself, Derek.
I'm doing this for us.
(Louie) 'This doesn't do us any good, son!'
Pulse ox is down.
What's going on, huh? What's going on?
- My chest.. - Where? Where?
- The left, the left. - Decreased breath sounds.
Let's get him to Trauma.
I'll get the non-rebreather.
Derek?
Derek?
[clears throat]
Best I could do.
Got you an extra Jell-O.
Is there anyone we can contact for you?
Family or friends?
Just Jake.
I'm fine on my own.
Yeah, well, you don't seem fine.
No one likes to be alone all the time.
What doyouknow?
I've been on my own most of my life.
But it is up to me to fix that. You know?
Well, could I-could I get some mustard or something?
(Morrison) 'The incision is along the fifth rib, midaxillary line.'
Tunnel superiorly to the next interspace.
Curved vascular clamp around the tube.
You know what? You should push it through.
No, that's okay. Dr. Banfield said I shouldn't touch anything.
I-I did the whole procedure, alright?
We'll push it in together, just so you can get the feel.
Wait, wait, time out. He's astudenthere, right?
This is a teaching hospital, sir.
Right here.
'Just above the rib line.'
Right there.
Heard you guys needed help.
I'm sorry if this hurts a little, man.
Okay. It takes a little force to get through the muscle.
Dr. Morris, shouldn't Chaz be observing?
He's assisting.
- Feel it? - Mm-hmm.
Okay.
(Morris) 'Push it in.'
'Harder.'
'A little harder.'
Harder.
[gasps]
Pulse ox coming up. Strong pulse.
Way to go, Chaz!
Now...we just sew it in.
You meanyousew it in.
Yes.
0 silk.
- The Thora-Seal-- - Dropped his pressure again.
- 500 cc's. - What are you guys doing?
Hang two units of blood.
I thought you said he had a collapsed lung.
Morris?
We bagged an intercostal artery.
Chaz...when you pushed the tube in, did it slip?
- No. - Huh?
I-I don't know. Maybe.
- He's not breathing. - What?
(Morris) 'Intubation tray. Page Surgery.'
(Louie) 'Derek?'
[instrumental music]
Honey, I-I've been out here for half an hour.
I'm busy. You should've called.
You know I don't like people knowing my business.
How can you work in that place?
I know you didn't pull me out here to talk about this.
Russ, please, my board is full.
I-I made dinner reservations. Mia Francesca, your favorite.
We are not going to dinner.
They'll be at our place in about an hour.
That's not what I meant, damn it.
I'm going to cook, okay? I will cook!
I thought you didn't have time.
I know what I said.
I'm just trying to make things easier for you.
By making your mother think that I can't make dinner
or keep a home?
That won't make a damn thing easier, believe me.
Baby, I'm sorry. I'm just trying to help.
[pager beeping]
Alright, I'll be there at 7:30.
(Morris) 'Come on.'
Can't get control of the bleeder.
BP's still in the toilet.
It's up inside the costal groove.
Fourth unit's going in.
(Morris) 'Come on, come on, come on!'
- I got it. - 'Alright, 120/80. Not bad.'
- Chest tube output's way down. - Surgery's here.
- Where's Neela? - Gone for the day.
- Crenshaw's on. - Get in here.
'Keep your finger on the vessel.'
- You got it. - Is he gonna be okay?
We got to get him up to Surgery.
What's going on?
We tore an intercostal, but he's stable now.
And how'd you tear an intercostal doing a chest tube?
Must've slipped.
- It happens. - OR's ready for him.
Should be an interesting M and M.
- Stay ahead four units. - I'll call the blood bank.
Hey, Morris, you got a second?
He's got an 18-gauge in each arm.
Get something central.
(Tony) 'Come here.'
What the hell are you doing?
Chaz isn't trained to do chest tubes.
- This is his first year. - He has EMT experience.
They don't do chest tubes out in the field.
I was trying to teach him, give him a head start, you know?
By letting him kill a patient?
You put him in a situation he wasn't ready for.
That's not giving him a head start, that's setting him back.
[indistinct chattering]
(Roger) 'Hey! Look who it is!'
'Got a hot cup of Earl Grey waiting for you, love.'
- Do you take milk with that? - You made it.
Well, it looks that way.
'I'll make you some chamomile'
'you know, since it's almost bedtime!'
Let's get you a drink.
Hey, I am so sorry that I barged in the other night.
I didn't realize that you and Ray were--
Oh, no, not at all, it's fine.
He and I, we're friends. He was in town, we were catching up.
- So we're good. - Okay.
Oh, uh, Jimmy, another round for my mates
and whatever she's drinking.
Hey, Max. How you doing?
Your CAT scan looks good.
Okay.
So, you don't remember anything like this
happening to you before?
I forget lots of stuff.
No head injury..
...anything, maybe, uh, epilepsy?
Now, could I get a sandwich?
That nurse lady brought me one, but I'm still kind of hungry.
Sure, no problem.
Can you remember your last name for me?
I tried to see it on your duffel, but I couldn't read it.
Alright.
Well, you let me know if you can, alright?
What about this ink on your chest?
'Paratrooper?'
Oh, yeah.
Thing hurt.
I got one, too.
101st Airborne.
Screaming Eagles.
Right.
Where'd you get yours?
This dude.
Mm.
Max, do you remember where you served?
Tal Afar.
[chuckles] Hot as hell.
Yeah, up north by Mosul, right?
Tony..
...the homeless guy you were just in with..
Yeah?
Neuro wants to discharge him.
Outpatient EEG and clinic referral.
He won't get his Dilantin filled.
He'll never make it back here.
- Sam, I took care of it. - You did?
Yep. Pulled some strings and got him admitted
to the Neuro service.
Oh. Okay.
Well, there you go.
There you go.
- Listen, I feel like-- - Hey, mom.
Hey, you're early.
- What's up, Tony? - Alex, how you doing?
I'm good. Hey, can we go eat?
Uh, yeah. Let me get my stuff.
See you tomorrow.
Later, Ton.
Night.
Daria, before you leave
can you get a read on my pericarditis guy's echo?
Yeah, no problem. Um, Dr. Gates?
I was, uh..
I was just wondering, I wanted to make sure
that everything was okay.
You know, with you and Sam.
Yeah, everything's fine.
Oh, okay.
Yeah, that's.. Well, no, that's great.
Um, it was just because, you know, earlier
things got a little bit weird.
Not bad-weird per se.
They just got a little bit weird.
And so I just wanted to make sure that..
Yeah, but everything's okay, so that's-that's great.
- Yeah. You good? - Yeah.
- You sure? - Totally.
'Cause you're blushing again.
Okay. I'll see you tomorrow.
[sighs]
Oh! Oh, hi. Uh, so you're ready for sign outs?
After you tell me how today went.
Did Dr. Gates instruct you well?
You know what, these are the pass ons.
Goodnight.
Somebody had a poopy day.
- You sure? - I don't know. Are you sure?
I mean, what else are we gonna do?
A lot of things. We can go to a hotel--
Mom, you hate hotels.
Hey, sorry to interrupt, but since I am..
I want to tell you, both of you that..
...that I want, I want you to come stay with me.
'Because I really like you guys.'
'And-and I know it's fast but you know what'
if it doesn't work out, then you guys
can just move out, you know?
I-I just think we'd be great together.
'I think we'd all be great, all of us.'
And Sarah's totally on board and-and I have a flat-screen TV
and I live in a great neighborhood--
Tony...we were actually just talking about it.
[clears throat] We're in.
- You are? - Uh-huh. Right?
You had me at flat screen.
Alright, alright--
- Shut up, shut up. - No pressure now, love.
Just don't miss. Don't miss.
Calm it. Calm it down.
- Oh! - Yes!
- Oh-ho-ho! - Yes!
- You see that? You see that? - Yes!
Oh, thank you. And thank you.
And thank you. Green is my favorite color.
Don't worry, mate. It is a British game after all.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, God save the Queen and all that.
She's your queen too, you know.
Uh, excuse me, who invited the Brit?
- You did. - Sore loser.
Shut up.
Oh, what'd you just say to me, convict?
Again, that's alright.
It's my shout. Who's drinking?
- I am if you're buying. - Alright, Jimmy.
So, surgery went well.
Then I'm okay now, right?
Well, your lung will heal and so will your face.
But the damage from repeated head trauma..
...that won't heal.
See? You got to stop this mess.
Pop, please.
Just let the man talk.
Your dad's right.
Boxing is just not a good idea.
You saying I can't fight..
...or I shouldn't fight?
I know, I know you think that you don't have a choice--
You don't know what I think.
I know that you wanna do whatever it takes
to help your dad.
To make him proud.
But if you keep fighting, you are risking
serious brain damage.
I know I've been tough on you.
'I'm sorry.'
I take full responsibility for that.
But where you go from here is up to you, Derek.
You got nothing to prove.
What are we gonna do, pop?
We'll find a way, like always.
'We'll figure it out.'
I'll come back, check on you later.
(Louie) 'Hey, doc.'
Thank you.
Dr. Banfield, I-I thought you were gone for the night.
I needed to follow up.
You don't have to check up on me.
I was checking up on your patient.
Right, my patient.
Yes, who thankfully survived
your little therapeutic misadventure today.
May I ask you a question?
How can such a good doctor be such a knucklehead?
I thought Chaz was different.
It was a mistake.
After Greg Pratt died..
...I lost some focus.
I'm working on it.
Well, I hope you find clarity soon.
[elevator bell dings]
Dr. Morris.
Goodnight.
Goodnight.
(Frank) 'Dr. Banfield!'
Oh, I'm glad I caught you.
Here's everything you need.
Veal, cream, chanterelles.
You'll never find good ones. I've got a guy.
No, Frank, I-I can't accept that from you.
Please. I insist.
[instrumental music]
- Let me know how it turns out. - Frank!
Remember this never happened.
[music continues]
[door buzzing]
Hey, man.
So, how was your first day?
I'm so sorry about that chest tube.
Dude, don't worry about it. He's-he's gonna be fine.
All the interns hate me.
No, they don't hate you.
They probably hate me, but not you.
Listen, all that stuff.
My fault.
I'm the one that should be sorry.
It's just, every time I see you..
...I see your brother.
And he was a hell of a doctor.
And you will be, too. One day.
But you've got a ways to go, and I forgot that.
So, today, chalk it up.
Alright, it's your-it's your first step
on a thousand mile journey.
I really appreciate you looking out for me.
That's what Greg used to do.
[instrumental music]
Yeah.
Hey, I'm off soon.
I was gonna go grab a burger.
Forgot to eat today.
You wanna come?
Sure. I'd like that.
Cool.
[music continues]
[sighs]
[door opens]
Hi.
They're here.
[sighs]
(Marie) 'Cate? Is that you?'
It's me.
- Hi. - Hi.
George, get down here! Cate's here!
Oh, it's so good to see you, baby.
Let's get inside. It's-it's freezing.
[music continues]
