(male narrator) Previously on"ER.."
- Alex? - Ma?
He was driving some drunk girl's car.
She just died.
I let him go to the party.
Oh, forget about the deposition.
If the case goes to court, I'll testify on your behalf.
You seen this guy?
Morris, that storage locker in Indiana called again.
They said if you don't pay up
they're gonna sell off your dad's stuff.
(Simon) 'Hold CPR.'
'Get ready for internal compressions.'
[instrumental music]
You-you can't just show up at my work and drop this off.
You wouldn't go to the storage unit, so I brought it to you.
I was gonna deal with it.
- Eventually. - What is this?
It's my dad's way of aggravating me from the grave.
This is my cousin.
- Simon Brenner. - Johnny.
Nice to meet you. Look, I did you a favor.
This here, it's only the good stuff.
I find that hard to believe.
Well, have fun.
Oh, and Aunt Ethel says
thanks for the birthday card.
I didn't send her a birthday card.
Exactly. Bastard.
What am I supposed to do with all this junk?
I'm sure there's a logical explanation here.
Hey, Archie, Dr. Banfield's looking for you.
Great, she's gonna love this.
Well, how about a peace offering?
Somehow I don't see her really appreciating a cheese head.
Eager for a case?
Someone says, "Abdominal trauma"
I come running.
24-four-year old female, EGA 36 weeks.
Tripped and fell during an immigration raid
at a tie factory down on North Orleans.
- Okay, vitals? - Stable.
But contracting Q five minutes.
I'm Dr. Brenner. What's your name?
- Gloria. - Uh, is there any bleeding?
(female #1) 'Uh-uh, BP's 124 over 81.'
[screams]
- Where are you going? - This is a case for OB.
Yeah, but she still needs a trauma assessment.
Alright, we're gonna help you.
I'll give you my blessing
but she's an OB patient.
- I'm gonna page Coburn. - Okay.
- Hang in there, Gloria. - Please!
My baby.
Oh, Dr. Banfield.
I need to skedaddle just a little early today
to get in, uh, character for the Christmas party.
Never met a costume you didn't like, huh, Frank?
No, ma'am. Oh, and your other half called.
Wanted to know what time to be here for said party.
You're going to the party?
You say that like I don't know how to have a good time.
That's not at all what I meant.
Is there anyone you want us to call?
- What's open? - My husband.
- 'Trauma One. You need a hand?' - But he doesn't need to come.
- We got it. - Here you go, jock itch.
Oh, you sweet talker, you.
Oh, oh, hang on.
You're not seeing patients today.
I need you to do the intern mid-year reviews.
- I'd rather do the jock itch. - Too bad.
But, but, uh, Dr. Brenner is great at paperwork.
Terrific penmanship.
(female #2) 'Yoo-hoo, Dr. Morris.'
- Hello, Mrs. Gaines. - Hello.
I need refills for my cholesterol
and blood pressure pills, and I also need--
Well, you know, I would love to help you
Mrs. Gaines, but I'm not seeing patients today.
- Oh. - Dr. Morris, you can go ahead--
No, rules are rules.
However, Dr. Sanchez here
would love to help you.
Okay, my work here is done.
I brought you folks some brownies.
- I made them myself. - Awesome.
Hey, Frank, did psych come down on my hair puller?
- Not yet. - Ooh!
- Don't eat at the desk. - I'm goin'.
- 'Right this way.' - 'Oh, well, thank you.'
- Brownies? - No, I'm good.
Dr. Gates, any word on your homeless vet?
Nah, I seem to have hit a dead end.
Alright, well, I'll put a call
into a friend of mine at Midnight Ministries
so maybe she'll know something.
Thanks, I appreciate that.
I gotta run upstairs for a minute.
- Is Sam comin' in today? - Should be.
Heard she wanted to get back to work.
They're getting ready to extubate Alex.
(Marisol) 'He's fighting the vent.'
Sats are dropping. He's biting the tube.
- Well, he wants off. - He's agitated, Sam.
Hang on, hang on.
Mm-mm, 40 milligrams propofol IV push.
No, no, no, please, don't give up!
Sorry, we can't extubate like this, Sam.
- Oh, he's right. - Well, he'll calm down.
Just give him a minute.
Restart the drip at six milligrams a minute.
(Marisol) 'Sedation's in.'
Sorry, Sam.
We'll see where we are again tomorrow, okay?
[monitor beeping]
[theme music]
[siren wailing]
(male #1) 'Um, excuse me.'
Is Dr. Morris working today?
Uh, yeah, he's, he's somewhere.
(Frank) 'Jerry?'
What brings you to our neck of the woods?
I thought you were up in Alaska.
Yeah, I got tired of slinging beers, so I moved back.
Hey, Archie!
Look what the world's largest cat dragged in.
- Jerry, my man! - Hey.
- How you doing, brother? - Fine, how are you?
Good.
Dr. Morris, do you realize
there's large storage unit in the bay with your name on it?
- I'm trying to get rid of it. - Burn it, donate it.
I don't care.
- I want it out of here. - Sell everything.
You know, one man's trash is another man's cash.
And when do I have time for that?
- I'll do it. - You will? Seriously?
- Yeah, I love a good fire sale. - Excellent.
You know, I'll tell you what. I will give you ten percent..
Ten?
- Fifteen. - Man, it's cold outside.
Okay, fine. Fifty percent of whatever you bring in.
You can't miss it, okay?
And-and paper money only
'none of this "I want everything for a quarter" crap.'
You don't even wanna look through it?
Oh, I made it this far without that junk.
I don't need to weigh myself down now.
Oh, welcome back. How's Alex doing?
Well, he's still sedated.
You know, they tried to extubate him this morning, but..
He'll be off the vent soon.
You don't know that.
I mean, I thought he would be talking by now
but he was hypotensive for so long.
You know, what if he has brain damage?
Or what if he just never gets off the vent? It's..
Look, Sam, if you need to take a little more time..
No, no.
I really should keep busy, you know?
I can't just keep sitting there, staring at Alex's monitors.
- Thank you for the offer. - Mm.
Come on, let's get some coffee first.
(Neela) 'Chest is clear.'
- How are you feeling, Gloria? - Okay.
- Did you reach my husband? - He's on his way.
He doesn't have to come. I can call him later.
Cap refill's good.
You know, he's probably worried about you.
How long have you two been together?
Oh, we met at the aquarium.
- I was 15. - 'Wow.'
Can't imagine being married to my high school boyfriend.
We were both new to America.
- How's the crit? - Stable at 39.
So everyone going to the Christmas party?
Not a chance.
Yeah, but Surgery's hosting it this year.
- You have to go. - Belly's benign.
Archie pinched my butt last year
and Frank nearly threw up on me.
That sounds like fun.
Can't imagine why anyone would wanna miss that.
- Fetal heart rate's at 145. - You're not into the party?
A work party? At work? Yeah, no, thanks.
I got a hot date with a stock broker.
So while you losers are drinking virgin eggnog
I'm going to be sipping Veuve Clicquot.
[screams]
It's okay.
They're every three minutes now.
- Breathe, Gloria. Breathe. - 'She's on mag?'
- Yeah, but it's not doing much. - OB can take it from here.
- She's clear surgically. - Alright, Coburn's on her way.
This is Mrs. Ortiz' husband.
[speaking in foreign language]
Is the baby okay?
We're just checking to make sure.
Do you know if it's a girl or a boy, Mrs. Ortiz?
At my last ultrasound, it was too soon to tell.
[groans]
What are we looking at?
[groans]
- Something wrong? - Is that a twin, maybe?
I'm not sure.
(Tony) Getting back to work will probably be good for you, right?
A little distraction?
Yeah, I could use the money.
Oh, excuse me. Hey, excuse me, sir!
(Samantha) 'Your kids need to be buckled up.'
Sorry, what?
Your kids need to be wearing seat belts.
Okay, lady, whatever you say.
She's just saying it's probably better
if the kids had their seatbelts on, that's all.
You know what, it's the law, and it's common sense.
- And who the hell asked you? - Hey!
She's saying it'd be better, if the kids were buckled up.
- That's all. - Hey, screw off!
- Hey, watch it, alright? - How are you gonna feel, huh?
If one of comes through that windshield
and ends up in the ER with brains
comin' out of his skull, huh?
[honks] You're an idiot!
- You know that? - Get out of the way.
It's idiots like you that keep our hospital from shutting down
so thank you very much!
Let it go. Let it go.
Let it go.
How long do I have to wait for my refills?
- Uh, check with Dr. Sanchez. - I did.
He said something about spiders and wandered away.
Well, if I see him, I will send him your way.
Thank you.
Did you have that necklace on earlier?
I got it from that big man outside.
[chuckles]
He wouldn't know a Hattie Carnegie piece
if it bit him in the ass.
I know because I was a buyer
for Marshall Field for 40 years.
- Well, you wear it well. - Thank you.
Oh, and you should know the original owner of that necklace?
- Mm-hmm? - She was a saint.
[cellphone rings] Ooh!
(Archie) 'Frank, have you seen the intern evaluation forms?'
Well, let's see, the last I looked, they were right here.
Thank you.
I got myself a little something from the Morris family estate.
Let me guess, a nice broach?
A baseball signed by Joltin' Joe DiMaggio
and some no-name Yankee.
Yeah, no, that was me.
"Archie Morris." My dad was pissed.
I couldn't sit down for a week.
Listen, um, that was my friend Ida.
I-I-I need to find Dr. Sanchez.
Okay, if I see him, you will be the first to know.
Oh, no, no, no. No, this is really important.
- What do we have? - Renee Weber Stewart, 39.
She passed out at the mall.
Alright, let's take her to Exam Three.
- We were waiting for Santa. - She has a six-month-old, Lola.
Mom broke her fall
but you might wanna check on the baby too.
Belly's distended, systolic's only, 84 after a liter.
My wife, Nicole..
- We'll call her for you, ma'am. - I have the number.
Could be vagal, but she's still pretty out of it.
Have Social Services watch the baby
until we can get a family member here.
Oh, that's okay. I'll look after her.
Ah. Hi, you little reindeer.
It's okay, we're gonna get you right back to Rudolph, huh?
Oh, hi. Aren't you a cute baby?
Oh, Frank? Frank, still no psych?
I'll call again.
Hey, I'm saving that for later.
Okay, you still have one left.
I'm sorry, I'm hungry.
We're from immigration. We're looking for a patient.
"Gloria Ortiz."
Mom's five centimeters dilated and maxed out on terb and mag.
Can you tell if it's a boy or a girl?
It's a boy.
- We're having a boy. - 'Second IV's in.'
We're having a boy. Did you hear that, Roberto?
- A boy. - That is great.
This is what we were looking at.
We thought it might be a multiple gestation.
But there's only one heartbeat.
Yeah, no, it's not a twin.
Are you sure?
What's wrong?
Alright, Mr. and Mrs. Ortiz..
...the ultrasound shows that your baby
has a large mass involving the lower face and neck.
A mass? What does that mean?
Does my baby have cancer?
The ultrasound doesn't tell us if it's cancerous.
(Coburn) 'No, right now, the most pressing issue'
is that the medications
aren't stopping your contractions.
What are you saying?
We're gonna do everything we can for your baby.
There are two immigration agents at the desk
'who wanna talk to your patient.'
[speaking in foreign language]
Well, we're kind of busy here, Frank.
They don't seem like the type who want to wait around.
- 'Well, they're gonna have to.' - What do we do now?
(Coburn) 'Alright, your baby needs to be delivered.'
[speaking in foreign language]
[grunting]
- Is this Gloria Ortiz? - We're doing an exam in here.
What do you need?
We're here to take Mrs. Ortiz into custody.
- What for? - She's a fugitive alien.
'She's being deported.'
This yarn is so soft.
Yeah, my mom spent the '70s obsessed with macrame.
Wall hangings, tea cozies, vests.
- Vests? - Yeah.
My first grade class picture..
...rocking a blue macrame vest.
It's like, no matter where it is..
...it's staring at me.
(Tracy) 'Oh, hey, come to the OR.'
Dr. Brenner's letting us watch an EXIT procedure.
What?
You know, it's when they section
the mom to get an airway on the baby
before the delivery.
I mean, can you imagine?
- Hey, did you hear me? - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Airways, airways, baby. Here. - No, uh, no.
Uh, listen, have either of you seen Dr. Sanchez?
Oh, he's over there.
Oh, oh, uh,
that's not one of my brownies, is it?
Why, is it bad? I ate two.
- How are you feeling, dear? - Hey, that's my Jell-O.
You shouldn't be eating my food.
It's okay, I'm a doctor.
Dr. Sanchez.
- What are you doing? - Wiggling and jiggling.
- Put that back. - Yeah.
Oh, doctor, doctor, he's high as a kite.
The brownies have cannabis in them.
You gave pot brownies to my staff?
Do you know how dangerous that is?
They could have mistreated a patient.
I know, it was a mistake.
You see, my friend Ida had cancer
and I made special brownies for her.
Now she's in remission, thank the Lord
but she still likes them
and I mixed up the batches.
You two are done for the day.
Drink some water, take a nap.
Whatever you do, do not drive home
till you're clean and sober.
Pick any three eight-track tapes
for the price of two.
Mr. Ortiz?
How's Gloria? Is she okay?
She's fine, but we're worried the tumor on your son's neck
could prevent him from breathing normally.
So fix it. Can you fix it?
Well, we're gonna do a cesarean section
so we can insert a breathing tube
while he's still attached to the placenta.
I don't understand--
Well, that way, Gloria's body
can supply him with oxygen until he can breathe on his own.
Wait, she's having the baby today?
We're prepping her for surgery.
No, I can't.
- No, not like this. - But we have to.
Are they still there?
Did you know immigration was after her?
We're undocumented.
Two years ago, they scheduled her for deportation
but she didn't show up.
I couldn't let her go.
[pager beeping]
Our life is here.
I'm so sorry, I have to get back.
I'll call you when we're out of surgery.
'We're not bad people.'
'We never harmed anyone.'
We only want to be happy.
- Frank gave this to me. - Oh, that was my mom's.
That's your story, huh?
- You want it back? - No, I'd break it.
When I was nine, I juggled the holy family set.
And?
I'm not sure what upset my mom more
that I broke her Hummel's
or I tossed around the Baby Jesus.
Only time she ever raised her voice at me.
Well, I don't juggle, so I think this one's safe.
Dr. Banfield, this is, uh, Nicole, Renee's partner.
Hi. Is she okay?
- She's doing better. - Can I see her?
- Right this way. - Uh, where's Lola?
Oh, one of our nurses is baby-sitting. I'll go get her.
Now she's still a little sedated from the CAT scan.
What's wrong?
We're not sure yet, but we noticed
the surgical scar on her abdomen.
Do you know what it's from?
She had cancer of the small bowel
'but she's been in remission for three years.'
What does this have to do with her passing out?
Her belly is distended and we're concerned.
Oh, God.
Is that what you think that the cancer's back?
We'll know more when we get the CT results.
(Samantha) This one's mine.
I got this when Alex and I lived in Albuquerque.
He was just a baby then.
And this one's Haleh's.
It was a gift from her grandma.
And look, look.
There's Frank. That one's his, obviously.
It's pretty silly, huh?
Sam, you can take Lola back to her mom now.
Bye, little reindeer.
Bye.
- You okay? - No, not even a little bit.
[sighs]
I remember this one Christmas
Alex begged me for a skateboard.
'When I gave it to him, he was so excited.'
And then I made him wear a helmet.
You were looking out for him.
Do everything you can to keep them safe
and then...he ends up on a ventilator.
Sam.
'He's been tubed for almost a week.'
What's next? He's gonna be on a trake his whole life?
Come on, let's not jump the gun.
They're gonna extubate tomorrow.
Yeah, I asked Dubenko if they could try again tonight
but he said they only do it before noon.
Well, he's just following the rules.
Why do you do that?
What?
Why do you always take the other side?
I'm just trying to help.
Yeah, well, then, take my side.
Alright, well, then, let's tell Dubenko
that his rules are stupid and maybe he'll make an exception.
You never know.
- 'Cefazolin on board.' - 'Uterine stapler.'
- Where did you get that? - Surgical lounge.
Want some?
- Ew, no, thanks. - Amnio infusion's underway.
- Okay, people, here we go. - 'Pulse 118.'
Hey, you guys...look.
(Coburn) 'Watch the head.'
(Neela) 50 atropine, 30 of fentanyl IM.
Okay, Vecuronium's in. Clock is ticking.
Okay, Miller zero and three-five, let's go.
(Tony) The scan shows some abnormal tissue
'wrapped around part of the liver.'
- The cancer's back. - Most likely.
What's next?
We'll talk to a surgeon and find out what the options are.
Uh, run the scan by Dr. Dubenko.
- It was in the lymph nodes. - Yeah.
We knew a recurrence was likely.
I convinced myself that..
...I was gonna be lucky
that I could dodge the bullet.
Well, that's a great attitude to have.
She doesn't understand the concept
of, "The glass is half empty."
I finally met someone
that I couldn't live without
and that's no time to give up.
A week before the surgery
we flew to Boston and got married.
And we ran off like a couple of teenagers.
That's quite a leap of faith.
It's not hard when you have someone to hang on to.
So what is going to happen once she's out of surgery?
She'll be detained by Immigration
till they deport her.
What about her recovery? Let's try Miller one.
Detention facilities have doctors.
Not good ones. I can't get a good view.
Suction. Can't we keep her until the baby's DC'd?
No, we can't justify that
baby needs to be in the NICU for at least three weeks.
- Well, if people knew. - 'Fetal heart rate's 138.'
And by "People," you mean the 10 o'clock news?
Yeah, couldn't hurt.
You know, you put a magnifying glass
on our hospital like that, public perception will be
"Go to County, get deported."
- How's the sat? - 'Holding at 52.'
- Nothing we can do? - We're doing it.
No, it's too distorted. Suction.
(Coburn) Oh, we've got some uterine bleeding here.
Switch with me, Neela. Rigid bronch.
Step aside. You're taking too long.
- Mom's systolic's only 84. - Okay, guys, time's up.
We gotta clamp, whether you got the airway in or not.
- Just hold on. - 78.
If we don't get a handle on this
mom is gonna bleed out.
- We're gonna lose the baby too. - Damn it!
(Neela) Okay, type specific and point 25 methergine now!
[alarms blaring]
(Coburn) Lucien, I have to cut the cord.
- Not without an airway. - We have no choice!
(Neela) The baby's not getting enough oxygen, he can't tolerate.
(Coburn) Oh, please, we gotta bail out now or we lose 'em both.
- How about a tracheotomy? - Not yet.
Dr. Dubenko, I've got a 39 year old woman with recurrent.
Later. Find Anspaugh. We're busy here.
- Dr. Banfield-- - Find Anspaugh!
- Got it. Sorry. - 'Lucien.'
(Lucien) Screw it. We'll do the trake.
(Coburn) Five minutes. That's all you've got.
(Perry) Let's go. Let's go.
(Neela) Okay, 15 blade and 3-O shiley.
Nicole?
What's the word from the surgeon?
Uh, none yet.
How are you doing?
I was thinking, uh, what if..
...what if this is it?
Lola won't remember her.
You will.
And you'll make sure your baby does too.
I feel like I might forget.
[crying]
Just the little things.
[sniffling]
Just the little things.
Uh, how she burns the roof of her mouth on pizza..
...every time.
Or how she slaps my arm when she laughs and..
You won't forget those things.
[sobbing]
You won't.
- Jerry couldn't get rid of it? - What do you wanna do with it?
- Hey, thanks for the crock pot. - No problem.
Uh, if it's the one with the blue flowers on the side
it has a short! I almost burnt the house down.
- Son of a bitch! - What is it?
I made this in the third grade.
Yeah, it's milk and cookies.
- For Santa. - Okay.
Yeah.
My teacher, Miss Durbin said
that wherever we are
if we set this out, Santa would find us.
That's sweet.
My dad didn't think so.
Yeah, he said Santa wasn't stupid.
He'd know it wasn't real.
- That was my dad. - Yeah, but he kept it.
Yeah. I guess he did.
(Neela) The anatomy's so distorted. I can't feel the tracheal rings.
- Focus on your landmarks. - Crit's down to 26.
- I'm pulling the plug. - Wait! Uh, guidewire.
Systolic's only 68.
Either you have it or you don't.
- I'm in. - Throw me the bag.
20 units of oxytosin and start the drip.
Okay, we've got chest rise. You can clamp.
(Coburn) Done.
Scissors.
Get the carboprost on board.
[instrumental music]
Don't ever worry that you don't do enough
for your patients, alright?
Lucien, can you stay? I need the hands.
Yeah. Uterine tone seems better.
- 'BP's comin' up.' - Nice and pink.
Umbilical line tray.
Wow.
Good luck, Mr. Mosely.
It's a little late for that, isn't it?
I'm sorry they couldn't extubate Alex today.
- Hopefully soon. - I'll keep my fingers crossed.
Copy, uh, discharge summary, will you?
I'll be right back.
Hey! Max?
Hey, Max!
Hey.
I've been looking for you, man.
You alright?
Yeah, I'm okay.
Jake has a hard time when it gets cold though.
Well, come inside. Warm up a bit.
Jake can come too.
Let's start with a cup of coffee.
You want some coffee?
Yeah. Yeah, coffee's good.
(Simon) 'This wasn't your average C-section.'
As long as she's stable, we have to take her into custody.
You know, she hasn't even seen her baby yet.
- I mean, give her a few days-- - Look.
We don't like this either, separating a mom from her kid.
But we can't make an exception here.
Well, why not? She should be able to spend--
I'm sorry. We'll see you tomorrow.
I'll show you out.
You got them to leave?
They're coming back tomorrow.
They're going to transfer you to a detention facility.
- But my baby.. - He's doing very well.
He's still on a ventilator, but mostly breathing on his own.
I should call my husband.
I told him the surgery went well.
And that he'll be able to take your baby home in a few weeks.
Immigration won't get involved in custody.
A mother is supposed to protect her child.
- Keep him safe. - He's in good hands.
We're taking care of him.
I need to see him.
I need to see my baby.
(Samantha) 'Dr. Dubenko.'
I'm really swamped right now, Sam.
Yeah, I need you to try to extubate Alex again.
- We will. Tomorrow. - No, today. Please?
Oh, we already talked about this.
First thing in the morning. I promise.
I've been studying to become a nurse anesthetist
and I think there are some tricks that we can use.
- Tricks? - Yeah.
We can give an anxiolytic
before shutting off the propofol, right?
That may cut the agitation we see during emergency.
Two of versed would be calming and not too sedating.
Okay.
Okay, then we sit him up
and we give him something familiar to focus on.
It's a Blackhawks' game from last night.
Okay.
Well, what if it doesn't work?
No, it'll work.
I'll talk him through it. I will stay there all night.
I will make sure he uses the incentive spirometer.
Whatever it takes.
He's so little.
We'll, uh, do an MRI to figure out exactly
what we need to do to remove the tumor.
Hola, mi hijo.
Had you two picked names out?
For a boy, we liked Pablo.
After my grandfather.
He was a strong man.
That's perfect.
How long will he be here?
Well, if all goes well, only a few weeks.
We're pretty sure, he won't need chemotherapy or radiation.
All alone.
[speaking in foreign language]
I'll come back.
- They took a risk staying here. - So what?
It's still inhumane to separate them.
Yeah, but there is nothing that we can do, is there?
Not right now.
It's not a good time to rock the boat.
Why, because you're at the center of a malpractice suit?
Something like that, yeah.
I could've sworn
that Neela Rasgotra was a boat-rocker.
Like a champion-grade, professional one at that.
But I guess, I don't know, I was, I was wrong.
- No, you're not wrong, but.. - What?
I just don't want to take any unnecessary chances
with my career.
Ah.
Good things happen when you take a chance.
You ready?
Okay, kiddo, I'm gonna take that tube out now, okay?
I know you can do this.
Try, try again, remember?
Like when we took the training wheels off your bike.
The first time you fell off
then you got right back on and you rode like the wind.
- Remember that? - Okay, balloon's down.
Just relax and take some deep breaths, okay?
'Second time's a charm.'
You wanna do the honors?
- Me? - Yeah.
You know what you're doing.
Yeah, okay.
Are youready?
Here we go.
Come on.
[coughs] Yankauer.
[gasping]
Give it a moment.
Alex?
Hey, Alex.
Hey, sweetie, how you feeling?
Did I..
...did I miss Christmas?
No.
Hey.
Jake's in the break room eating pot roast
courtesy of our Clerk Frank's wife.
I'm not sure who's happier, Jake or Frank.
Yeah.
Thanks.
After I got back, nothing went right.
Those people who used to care were gone
or I scared them off.
Or the ones I thought I could rely on from the Army said
I wasn't their problem anymore.
Then you came along
and I figured you were more of the same.
But these past few days
I heard you were looking for me.
- I saw the fliers. - I was worried about you.
That means something, you know.
That makes a difference.
I don't, I don't wanna die on the streets.
Oncology says if we do nothing
she has a couple of months, tops.
The best thing we can do is urge her to spend the time well.
She has a six-month-old child.
All the more reason for her to enjoy the time she has left.
Look, if I take her to the OR
there's a very good chance that I'll cut
into that thing and she'll bleed to death.
There's also a chance that you could successfully
debulk it and give her more time.
Her and her partner have had three years together.
Is that all the time they get?
You could give Renee enough time
to create real memories with her daughter.
Christmas really brings out the tenacity
in you ER people, doesn't it?
Doesn't it?
Fine, make her NPO after midnight.
I'll try to get her on the schedule for the morning.
Hey, I heard the good news.
How you feeling?
- I'm alright. - You don't have to talk.
Here, I brought you some entertainment.
There's enough movies in here to tide you over
until you go home.
Thanks.
Alright, I'm gonna run out and get you that ice cream
you've been craving.
- Rocky Road? - Cookie Dough.
Ice cream for dinner, huh, big shot?
Not bad.
Sarah wanted to be here, but she, uh..
...she's at her grandparents.
Although she did send this..
...tiny little card.
- How is she? - She's good.
Said her arms itches from the cast.
I thought I was doing the right thing, you know.
- I didn't, I-- - No, Alex.
This wasn't your fault.
I should have never let you and Sarah go out that night.
No, you were being cool.
Well...yeah.
- That was the problem. - Here's your half.
Three dollars and a Canadian quarter?
Ah, most of my customers were patients.
I mean, come on, I'm not gonna charge some kid
with the chicken pox for his first ever
pair of roller blades.
There were roller blades in there?
Don't worry.
I saved the best for last.
You know what that is, don't you?
A really old motorcycle?
It's a 1966 Triumph.
Marlon Brando rode a Triumph in"The Wild One."
Never saw it, don't care.
Oh! It's only the greatest rebel movie ever
with the most awesomest bike.
You know what? If you love it so much, keep it.
What? No, no, I-I can't, I can't take this.
Fix it up, sell it, whatever.
I don't, I don't get you.
All the great stuff in there
and there was nothing in there you wanted?
No. It's just, it's just stuff.
Anyway, thanks for taking care of this.
I'm sure you had something better to do.
Actually, I didn't.
Since I moved back..
...work's been tough to come by.
Oh. I'm sorry, man.
Anything I can do?
How can I get my old job back?
Fell asleep five minutes ago.
The extubation must have worn him out.
- Yeah. - I'll put this in the freezer.
Oh. He seems like his old self again, you know?
He wanted me to remind you that he wants a PS3 for Christmas.
Lucien said he could be out in a week.
Yeah. We should have a party for him when he comes home.
Oh, you know what? I forgot to tell you the other good news.
Max showed up.
- Can you believe that? - Oh, yeah?
Yeah, I got him admitted
and don't get mad, but I said
that we could watch his dog while he was in the hospital.
And I know, I know, but you know what?
Alex always wanted a dog, and so I thought it'd be cool
like, when he gets out, a dog would be there at the house.
Tony, listen.
Uh..
...I'm gonna stay at Chuny's..
...for a while..
...until, uh..
...until I can find a new place for me and Alex.
You're moving out?
It's just, it's just not working.
Sam, I know, I know this has been rough
but it'll get better.
We were doing fine before.
What, you just think things can go back to normal?
I-I made a mistake.
- I shouldn't have let them go. - Yeah, I know.
You keep saying that but it doesn't make me feel better.
Well, I don't know what else to tell you!
Sam?
We can work past this.
I can't.
I can't.
So you're just gonna run away?
I'm not running away.
I'm just telling you..
...it's over.

[instrumental music]
- How's it look? - It's like locusts got to this.
Oh, hey. How was the hot date?
Oh, he was a douche.
You know, who lies about their age?
First he was 34, then he was 37, now he's 42.
Maybe he was afraid you wouldn't date a 42-year-old.
Well, of course I wouldn't.
Besides, he was a stockbroker
so it's been a bad year for him anyway.
Bummer. Well, this has been fun.
- I'm gonna get a drink. - I'm gonna get more food.
Mm-hmm.
She hired you on the spot?
Yeah. She wanted a Santa that wasn't stoned.
* Jingle bell jingle bell jingle on the way.. **
Wow. You think you know someone.
Ho, ho, ho, Dr. Banfield.
And who might this young fellow be?
Russell Banfield, the husband.
- Ho, ho, ho. - This is Jerry.
He's filling in for Frank.
Call me Kringle, Kris Kringle.
- Mr. Kringle. - And this is Dr. Morris.
So you must be the guy that slept with my wife.
- What? No, no, no. - Just kidding.
[laughs]
Nice to meet you.
- Jerry. - Yes?
- Uh, Santa. - Yes.
Listen, I need you to do me a favor.
- Alright, now.. - Don't worry. It's a virgin.
I'll be ready for Renee's surgery in the morning.
- Hey. - Hey.
We got news on
the Bertha Mendenhall malpractice suit.
What is it?
Well, I don't know if I should tell you.
Well, is it bad? It's bad.
Depends on whose side you were on.
Just spill it, okay?
Motion for summary judgment.
The judge threw the case out.
You're kidding.
Merry Christmas, Neela.
Gloria left?
Oh, yeah. Looks that way.
And you're not upset?
Well, people do crazy things when they're desperate.
- Eggnog? - Well, wait.
Uh, uh, you're not even the slightest bit worried?
She'll be okay. I'm starving.
What's going on?
Nothing.
It's nothing.
Wait, your patient leaves hours after surgery
and-and you're not concerned?
She needs to be under a doctor's care.
It is possible
that someone put her in a cab to another hospital.
Good luck with everything.
So she's just gonna show up
and-and ask for a bed.
And it's also possible
that someone wrote down a few instructions.
Neela Rasgotra, rocking the boat.
Archie! Will you just hold this?
I'll be right back.
Hey! Where are you going?
Archie Morris never leaves a party early.
In fact, more often than not, he's the last man standing.
Well, there's a first time for everything, right?
Oh, come on. Who's gonna pinch my butt later? Frank?
He's far too stoned.
Not in the party mood, I guess.
Well, we can change that.
You're like Happy Holly over here.
I should be asking if you're okay.
I'm just saying, there are always things to celebrate.
Come with me.
[crying]
It's pretty amazing, huh?
Some days, our job really does matter.
Today I did paperwork and saw
my childhood parade around the ER.
Oh, yeah, Jerry gave me
"the Burl Ives ChristmasFavorites"
on reel-to-reel.
You know, I kept acting like I didn't care.
But, you know, I'd be lying
if I said there wasn't a part of me
that hoped Jerry might find something that would..
...I don't know, help me understand my dad.
Something more than crock pots and cheese hats.
[Bebe Winans singing "My Christmas Prayer"]
* To all those who are hungry *
* May they never miss a meal *
* All the broken hearted *
* May they find.. *
So I was thinkin'..
...about us having a family.
Starting again.
That's a pretty big leap of faith.
Not so hard when you got someone to hold on to.
* Upon Valance Street *
* I'm sending out *
* These hopes to high above *
* That this whole earth *
* Just might someday be *
* A little better place *
* For the human race *
* This is my wish *
* It may be a lot to ask *
* But I'm hoping that a miracle *
* Will finally come to pass *
* And that all that I am saying *
* Are just whispers in the air *
* This is my Christmas *
* This is my Christmas *
* This is my Christmas *
* Prayer **
