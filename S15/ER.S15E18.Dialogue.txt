(male narrator) Previously on"ER."
- Hi, mom. - Do I know you?
You said you were going to stay until we got her
settled in to the nursing home.
I can't, Sammy.
Archie, this is my new partner, Ed Bernstein.
I hear you're looking out for her.
She looks out for herself.
It festers in you, 'cause you know
you know it's wrong.
You need to, you need to talk to somebody about this.
What was it like when you were a kid?
You never talk about that stuff.
Oh, I-I was barely living before I met you.
I need a kidney, and I came back
to the States to get on the list.
(Chuny) 'Good job today. It's like you never left.'
(John) Sit? Do you want me to sit?
- 'Yeah, we're rolling.' - Okay.
It's a little warm in here.
It must be the, uh..
Alright, so you guys started yesterday, huh?
(male #1) 'You can relax, Dr. Carter.'
And you're interested in, what? Life in the ER?
'We're documenting the challenges'
'of emergency care in the 21st century.'
And you want to know what?
'About you, the people who work here.'
- 'What you do.' - Okay.
'How long have you been at County?'
I started about 15 years ago.
That's actually kind of hard to believe.
Wow.
- 'Can you focus here?' - Yeah.
Oh, here? Yeah.
Sorry. Oh, uh, I was a med student then, and, uh..
...well, the thing that you realize
pretty soon is that, you see it all.
You see the whole spectrum of human experience.
[laughs]
Does that sound a little pretentious?
It did, right?
Sound a little pretentious, uh..
Well, you guys are going to probably..
- Anyway-- - 'Go on with that.'
Yeah? Good?
Um, well, whatever you can imagine, it happens here.
Sometimes you're there for the end.
And that part never gets any easier.
Uh, it can be the loneliest place in the world.
Or, where you go for a second chance.
And every once in a while
if you're smart, or lucky, maybe..
...you find exactly what you need right here.
Come on. You can be a little late.
No, I can't.
What's so important?
Um, a murder investigation?
Oh, that's the best you can come up with?
[chuckles] You're cute.
Hey, did you mean what you said?
You hate the way this place is decorated?
You're a man, okay? Just get rid of the futon.
I love that futon.
And what's with this paint job? It's like shades of feces.
You know, that's all I'm saying.
I was a bachelor till very recently. Give a guy a break.
Don't worry, Archie. I'll whip you into shape.
[instrumental music]
[music continues]
(John) The one thing that you keep learning
is that you can never think that you know, what's coming.
Policia!
(John) Because when the rig rolls up
and the doors pop open, you have no idea what's inside.
[gunshots]
[gunshots]
Diaz?
'Diaz, talk to me.'
'Ten one, ten one, B54 12. My partner's been shot.'
'I'm at, 25, 49, West Harrison. Third floor, rear landing'
'Return fire, officer needs assistance.'
'Ten, one, seven, officer needs assistance.'
(John) So the only rule is..
- 'Dr. Carter.' - Never relax.
Sorry to interrupt. Two GSW's five minutes out.
'One's a police detective, multiple wounds.'
Alright, set up both trauma rooms and call for some O-neg.
I got to go.
- 'Can we finish this later?' - Yeah...if you can find me.
[theme music]
The most common thing I see? That's easy.
Rectal insertions. Seriously.
I say, I say "stat." Yeah, I say "stat" quite often.
This guy, he was, um, he was high on PCP.
But he was, like, over seven feet tall
and we had him strapped down on a gurney.
I mean, the funny part is-is that
it doesn't matter if it's a shampoo bottle
uh, a light bulb, a whisk, whatever.
They always tell you the same story..
..."I fell on it."
"Thoracotomy, stat."
"I fell on it."
And that guy got up
and he had the gurney strapped to, strapped to his back.
And he was chasing us all up and down the hall.
Men.
People in Australia can understand me, which is good.
I've got an accent, you see, um..
"Just clerks?"
Those were his words, "just clerks."
He said that we didn't count
as emergency healthcare providers.
"He?" Who is "he?"
- A writer, I think. - Of a documentary?
Documentaries have writers?
Well, he pieces it together or something, I guess.
"Pieces it together."
Well, that's what's wrong with television.
He seemed like a pipsqueak to me.
So you've met him?
- He interviewed us yesterday. - The nurses?
- Got their own day? - Get over it, Frank.
- We go to school for this. - That's it.
If they can make their own stupid reality show, so can I.
Can't argue with that.
Uh,I-I don't think that's such a good idea.
Here, press and point.
You know how to work these things.
Okay, okay, but there's nothing wrong with a life
lived out of the spotlight.
A stack of files, a broken stapler
a three-hole punch..
But lives are saved and lost right here.
- It's a desk, Frank. - Admit.
The nerve center of the ER.
What you're about to see is a document
of those who serve as the gatekeepers.
My name is Martin. Frank Martin.
Jerry Markovic.
The few, the proud..
(both) The desk clerks!
[siren wailing]
That film crew get to you yet?
Yeah, they just asked me a bunch of boring questions
about the effect of the economy.
The effect of the economy is that people get poor
and then they use guns to get money and the ER stays busy.
Now you tell me. What are we getting?
- I heard officer down. - A detective.
- How'd he get shot? - He's a she.
This one's ours. Perp's coming behind.
- Okay, we got this one. - Claudia Diaz.
I think you guys know her.
(Tony) 'She and Morris have a thing.'
"A thing?" Is that what it is?
(John) 'What happened here, detective?'
Son of a bitch shot me when I was walking away.
- I bit my damn tongue. - Lucky you had your vest on.
Yeah, I feel real lucky right now.
Here's the shooter! Took multiple shots from her partner.
Let's get chest and abdominal films, type and cross..
[coughing] ...type and cross four.
- You alright, boss? - Yeah.
Now, work on access when we get in there.
Does Archie know yet?
My partner's still on the scene. He said he'd call him.
I'll try too. Just to be sure.
Thank you, for bringing breakfast.
Yeah, this is nice, what you're doing.
You like it?
You know, I was, I was torn between
uh, an eggshell white and-and something bolder.
Like a, like a Robin's egg type thing.
Okay, now I sound gay.
I mean, not that there's anything wrong with that.
You're nervous.
It's kind of risky, asking her to move in.
Maybe-maybe she'll say "no."
I think anygirl would appreciate
a guy willing to repaint for her.
How are things going with thewonder from down under?
Good...I guess.
As long as we don't talk much.
Typical guy.
I know you fellas have to have your deepest thoughts
and feelings pried from your cold, dead fingers, but..
...still, he's hard to figure.
Well, it's understandable.
You know, with what happened to him as a kid.
Told him he needs to see somebody.
You know, if-if you've been hurt like that
you know, sexually, at a young age.
'It doesn't just go away on its own.'
Well, it's, um, good he confides in you.
'It's been hard for him... moving to Chicago.'
There's-there's you and there's me.
That's basically his whole circle of friends.
Real ones, anyway.
Right.
Wait. You didn't..?
- 'He never told you?' - Hmm-mm, it, um...
Neela, I'm-I'm sorry.
- 'I-I didn't mean--' - It explains a lot.
Um, I have to get to work by 9:00.
We've got a complicated triple-A repair.
- Dubenko wants me in on, so.. - No, Neela--
I-I'll see you later.
[phone ringing]
Hello?
[dramatic music]
[instrumental music]
Decreased on the right, ten blades, sterile eights and a..
[coughing]
And a chest tube tray.
Hey. She took two shots
one to the buttock, one to the shoulder.
We got an exit wound in the right chest.
I told you to get a desk job.
- Bastard shot me in the back. - How's your partner?
- He's alright. - You were covered?
- Any pain here? - Ow! Yeah.
- It wasn't like that. - How do you know?
It was clean, Archie.
Alright, four milligrams morphine, IV, set up..
- Is 32 okay? - No, it's not okay.
It's too big!
Hey, John, let's just get the films.
- Then I'll do the chest tube. - I'm okay. I'm okay.
Just dig up a 28 someplace, would you?
Are you sure you're okay with this?
- It's all you guys. - I'm sorry.
This has to stay on you. Okay?
[clears throat] Let me get the sterile eights, please.
Bullet crossed the mediastinum.
(Tony) 'That doesn't sound good.'
- Probable aortic injury. - I need a 28.
- Try the hallway. - Whoa, whoa, half a liter out.
- Alright, hold compressions. - He's still asystole.
Okay, start up. Let's, uh, let's hang another unit.
- Should we do a thoracotomy? - Aorta's transected.
- There isn't much point. - It's worth a shot, isn't it?
When you're new, everything's questioned.
Even when you know, you knowsomething
you say it with an inflection.
It's never, "Thoracotomy!"
It's more like, um, "Thoracotomy?"
[humming]
[knocking]
You got my smokes?
Hi.
The orderly said he'd get me a carton of Salems
for the right price.
That was two days ago.
I hate smoking these things.
Taste like wet leaves. Where's Carlos?
I was, uh, kind of hoping
today would be the day you'd remember me.
I remember you, well enough.
- I'm your daughter. I'm Sam. - I said,I know who you are.
[wheezing]
They told me you been around.
That's good. You're more alert.
Yeah, this place is like a dream come true.
I feel like I won the super lotto.
[wheezing continues]
Turn off my tank for me, would you?
You can't smoke in here. It's against the rules.
What?
So it's your turn now, is that right?
[wheezing]
I want to make sure that you're okay.
- Kelly and I both do. - Kelly never left.
Kelly stayed home and took care of me.
I don't know what you've been doing.
- You kicked me out. - I didn't.
You called me a "whore" and a "slut."
You told me I didn't belong to you anymore.
You said you didn't care what happened to me.
You are always dramatic.
You told me no one would even notice I was gone.
I was 15 years old.
What happened to that baby of yours?
His name's Alex.
Alex?
When a head injury rolls into the ER, every minute counts.
- And, um... - Delays. Talk about delays.
A delay of even 15 minutes
can mean the difference between life..
...and death.
(Haleh) 'Here's the pelvic film.'
[coughing]
And Brenner's calling, next door.
- Right. - Guy lost a lot of blood.
How are we doing in here?
(Claudia) I can't stay. I'm going to be late for a meeting.
- She's not lucid. - They lose him?
- 'Yeah.' - I'll bet no one will miss him.
Hey. Come on. A guy died.
(John) 'Bullet traversed the pelvis.'
Could've hit it or the bladder.
Or the uterus on the way through.
- Where's surgery? - In the OR.
They promised they'd send someone in a few minutes.
There's fluid around the liver.
Let's hang another unit, type specific.
- She going to need an ex lap. - Or maybe not.
Let's CT her. It's going to take time
for the surgeons to get here.
She could be in and out of
the scanner in, like, ten minutes.
- Christ. Mac 4 and 7.5. - 'So you're going to intubate?'
- We gotta protect her airway. - Airway's fine!
- We don't know that for sure. - Her lungs are re-expanded.
- Hey, this isn't the time! - This is the time.
Okay, Tony, he's right!
You're right.
Laryngoscope and a tray, please.
- How's she doing? - How's it look?
- Hang in there, Diaz. - 'What happened?'
We were taking witness statements on a murder case.
Some guy started shooting through the door.
Can I get that laryngoscope, please!
- Where were you? - 'Right next to her.'
'Not a scratch. What a lucky guy.'
- 'Is there a problem?' - As long as you had her back.
You'll want to think about slowing your roll here.
Is that what, is that what I want to do?
Take it from me. A badge beats a lab coat any day.
Yeah, yeah, "Band of Brothers," right?
Where's your chief, huh? Where's the department?
On their way, pal. Ease up.
This guy always such an asshole?
Hey, come on. You want to get into it with me, huh!
[indistinct shouting]
[thud]
(Jerry) 'Alright-alright, you got us both in frame there, Boris?'
Composition not ideal.
'You are freakishly tall and Frank's head'
is square like, block of wood.
Thanks for the input, Spielberg.
In this segment, we are going to highlight
some of the unsung heroes of the ER.
First up is Sadiq, the computer guy.
Sadiq Gibran-Hassani.
I'm not just a "computer guy," my family has
illustrious history in Syria before we were forced out.
Uh, let's just try to stay on point, Sadiq, okay?
Without me, there'd be no timely lab results
or X-ray readings which are crucial in the saving of life.
You let me know when I can speak again.
- Okay, Uncle Sam? - Thank you, Sadiq.
You're the boss.
And this is Crystal Hung, pharmacy tech.
Okay, when a doctor says, "I need an amp of Lidocaine"
a nurse goes to get it.
If there's no Lidocaine, it's a problem.
I put the Lidocaine in the cart every damn day.
So that's that.
Interesting. Very interesting.
And here we have good old Fred Tennyson
custodial service engineer
and catcher for the ER softball team.
I switch out whatever's broken.
Like light bulbs. Without light bulbs, it's hard to see.
And doctors, they..
...well, you know, they need to see stuff.
And uh, here we have...uh..
[clearing throat] ...uh, from thecafeteria.
[speaking in Spanish]
Uh, and without food, we would all go hungry.
[speaking in Spanish]
And on camera we have Boris
from, uh, media services.
Please, leave me out of this. This is horrible.
- When was your last dialysis? - Dialysis?
Banfield thought I should know. Since you were gonna be working.
Two days ago. I'm not due for another four hours.
Must be fluid overloaded since he's not making urine.
Waiting on a kidney transplant?
- Yes. Long story. - Any fever?
No.
Increased salt or fluid intake?
Maybe an extra sip of coffee
and a handful of popcorn, nothing crazy.
Sometimes this kind of thing is idiopathic.
It can happen when you're a chronic dialysis.
I know.
Systolic's down to 92.
(Archie) 'Let's get nephrology down here.'
'I'll grab the ultrasound.'
'If there's a big effusion, we need to tap it.'
Get my nephrologist, Gustavo Petrov at Northwestern.
Anyone else you want us to call?
- No. - I'll be right back.
Pelvic trajectory goes through the soft tissues.
- Could have bagged the iliac-- - I need an ultrasound.
- And how's she doing? - She needs angio.
She should go to the OR first.
It didn't enter the peritoneum.
- We don't know that. - Okay, let's not argue here.
I'm not denying she needs surgery.
I'm saying that let's look at the iliacs first.
There's no hematoma.
What if she starts bleeding from the pelvis?
- We'll deal with it? - Vascular's standing by?
You do not listening to a word I've said.
And you're not thinking things through.
We've got time to be systematic here.
- Systematic? - Angio, retrograde cystogram.
- Let's not lose our heads. - Calm down.
And make a decision.
Archie, it's your call. Angio or surgery?
You guys need to decide this.
Bone fragments to the bladder wall?
She needs the OR.
The pace down here is visceral.
It demands being instinctive, in the moment.
I prefer having time to, to think something through.
Hash out different possible versions, make a plan.
I mean that's why I'm better at being...a surgeon
than I was strictly working in the ER.
You're going to get in trouble if they catch you doing that.
[wheezing]
Maybe they'll throw me out.
You know, if you don't want me here, you should just say so.
Not like I'm going to leave
but at least we could talk about it.
Why don't we just try to forget our mistakes
and wipe the slate clean.
- Mistakes? What mistakes? - The ones that we both made.
- Speak for yourself. - Alright, you know what?
I'm not going to sit here and play along
with you as the martyr and me as the evil child.
You don't have to sit here, at all.
I was young and dumb and in love, mom.
I believed everything he said.
I raised you better than that. I raised you better than that!
No, you didn't.
You actually know, you didn't.
What is this? It's all wet.
You spilled something?
Leave it.
I'll go get somebody to clean it up.
- No, it's just fine. - It's what they do here.
- It's what they get paid for. - Don't want the staff in here.
- I said stop it. - It's disgusting.
'It's not. Leave it!'
Would you please get out of here, you little bitch!
- Get out! Just get out of here! - Give it to me!
- Give it to me! - Just get out!
[metal clanking]
Mary, I was coming to get you for flex and fun. You ready?
Do I look like I'm ready for flex and fun, you idiot?
[instrumental music]
So your mother's stroke affected her frontal lobe.
- Do you know what that is? - Yes, I'm a nurse.
Oh, I thought, I thought you were in fashion.
No, that's my sister.
I didn't realize there were two of you.
Anyway, what we see with frontal lobe injuries
is the-the filters come down.
The ability to self-censor
be empathetic, sensitive
all tends to be affected.
Yeah, I know what you're getting at.
So the things that she says, it's not really her.
It's the stroke talking and it changed her.
I appreciate what you're saying.
I do, but the thing is, is that..
My mother hasn't changed a bit.
What you see in there, that's who I grew up with.
That's exactly how I remember her.
Could use a bit more angle on that needle.
Eureka.
Good. I'll be right back.
We'll, um, do a liver lac
then explore the pelvis.
Urology will fix the bladder.
GYN will scrub in to address the uterine issue.
Primary repair will get it done?
Well, I hope so. She may need a hysterectomy.
- Well, whatever you have to do. - Okay.
She has four more units cross matched.
We'll have 'em sent up with her.
OR's ready.
I hate the fact that you put yourself in danger every day.
Every time you do, I'm so proud of you.
Okay, let's go.
- How's it going? - Fluid is serosanguinous.
And Johnny Boy here is a backseat driver.
- Dr. Carter? - John?
- Dr. Carter? - John!
- He's in V-tach! - No pulse.
- Did I irritate his myocardium? - No, it's not your fault.
500 of calcium gluconate, amp of D50, 10 of insulin.
We don't know his potassium level.
No, trust me, it's high
if the kidneys can't excrete it.
Alright, here.
Charged to 360.
Clear!
- Still V-tach. - Again! Clear!
Again!
Hi, you guys have a consult for renal?
Mig of epi, 150 of amiodarone.
Excuse me, Dr..?
Emily Haverman from nephrology.
- Gates, switch. - Alright.
You're a med student?
Um, fourth year. I'm doing a rotation.
Okay. That, that is an ER attending coding on the table
and this is not a teaching case, so please
turn around, walk out
get your attending, and come back now.
I'm sure Dr. Wheeler would prefer it
if I at least examined the--
I'm trying to remain professional here, Emily
but if you're not walking away from me
within three seconds, I swear to God
I may start doing compressions on your head.
(Tony) I spent a lot of years in the army
jumping out of choppers and..
I thought I was a team player.
I wasn't.
Not until I got here.
Whoa, K's 7.6.
- Calcium's on board. - Going again. Clear!
Back in sinus. Carotid's good.
Recheck the lytes now and Q 30.
I'm Dr. Wheeler from nephrology.
My attending.
Perfect timing.
Morris..
You saved me?
I'll never live it down.
Mom?
I...gotta get to work.
When's Kelly coming back?
A week, maybe.
I must have spilled some water on that..
...blanket or something, I don't know.
Well, I'll take care of it.
I'll get it back to you tonight.
[wheezing]
I'm gonna keep coming here..
...no matter what.
You won't go through this alone.
[phone ringing]
You do what you gotta do.
We all have our cross to bear.
You know, the UNOS list can take a long time.
Have you thought about direct donation?
Yeah, I've considered it.
And...your wife not a match?
If not, you know, we have paired organ donor program here.
The two of you could qualify for that.
Yeah, I'm aware of that program.
I just haven't talked to Kem about that yet.
There's very little risk in testing.
Well, it's just not something we're in a place
to get together on right now.
Well..
Does she know about your status?
She knows that I have some medical...issues.
I came back to Chicago.
She's in France. She's visiting her family.
I left the whole thing kind of vague.
Okay.
I will shut up now.
I'm just kind of tired.
I'll split.
- Pull that curtain for me? - You got it, boss.
Hey, I didn't realize you were coming in.
Yeah, me either. I got paged for an organ transport.
Heart donor.
- Plane leaves in two hours. - How's your mom?
Visiting her makes me feel like Jodie Foster
in"Silence Of The Lambs."
Fun.
Hey, no offense, but this smells like piss.
Yeah, I'm supposed to bring that to her tonight
and now, I'm not gonna make it.
I'll take care of it for you.
- Really? - Yeah.
All you really have to do is send it up to laundry
and then drop it off on your way home.
Not a problem.
- Sure you don't mind? - Did I not just volunteer?
You know, you're not such an ass
as some people say.
Thank you.
Um, what were we talking about?
Oh...but you know, eventually
I-I started to figure things out..
...as a doctor, you know
and how I fit in professionally with this place
and this community of people.
Yeah..
That's a big, big part of it..
For me...is, uh
being...good with yourself
and who you are
and-and who you're meant to be.
You know, finding yourself.
And then...there's the next step..
...after that, which is..
...finding somebody else.
And sometimes you think..
No, that's just, that's never gonna happen...for me.
And you meet someone..
...who makes you feel..
You know..
Who-who-who gets you.
And you, and you get her.
Yeah, some-someone you can, you can imagine..
[chuckles]
[sighs]
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
People think all we do is scrub poop and vomit off the floor
but I refill the paper towels, the toilet papers
stock the soap, the dispensers.
Without clean hands, you get lots of bad infections.
She's right.
'Nosocomial infections cause over 30,000 deaths'
in the US each year.
He knows.
So, boys, what's this all about?
Oh, the...interview guy
said that we were non-essential staff.
Non-essential?
We're offering a rebuttal.
You're essential. You're quintessential.
Uh, yeah.
I'm sure you'll set him straight.
- Let me get a little rest, eh? - Yeah.
Hey, hey.
I think this lady's having an allergic reaction or something.
Uh, okay, okay. Uh, we'll page somebody.
Let's put her right over here.
(Frank) 'Let's get Morris.'
(Jerry) 'No, Morris is upstairs.'
How about Brenner?
Uh, critical ICU.
How long have you had this rash?
[hoarsely] An hour.
She's having trouble breathing.
Penis!
Did she say "penis"?
This is getting a little weird.
Pea-nuts!
Peanuts! It's a peanut allergy.
I knew a kid who had this in school.
- And? - He died.
Oh, man, she's not moving any air.
We need help.
Uh...uh..
Uh...no, we don't.
[laughs]
[gasping]
[sighs]
Oh, thank you!
- Yeah? - Huh!
[both laughing]
Oh, in your face, reality boy!
Yeah, do we look non-essential now?
I thought you'd be upstairs working on Claudia.
Uh, urology's doing the bladder reconstruction.
They swapped me out for their own resident.
Ah.
I'm, um, going on a heart retrieval
so I figured I'd grab a coffee.
- What do you have? - A heart retrieval for Joanie?
Yeah, it's good news.
That is, that's fantastic!
The, uh, heart's in Seattle
so we won't be back until the middle of the night.
Right.
Are we alright?
What do you think?
Well, um, that..
...something's bothering you?
Clever twist.
Forget it.
No. Explain it to me.
Hey. How is my being worried about you a twist?
Because you keep turning everything around.
I-I don't think I'm smart enough to fight with you.
Like that.
You're plenty smart enough, but right now
it's easier to make me seem hyper-analytical.
I mean this morning..
...wasn't going your way, so I was "irrational."
Neela, I never said you were--
I'm the one who's bothered by something.
I'm the one refusing to have a reasonable conversation
and I'm the one who doesn't make sense.
It's all a defense mechanism.
Defense...defense for what?
I don't know.
Something you haven't told me?
I don't tell anyone everything.
Then what are we doing?
We hit a speed bump...weeks ago
and you react by disappearing.
We see each other all the time.
We talk. We-we-we sleep together..
There's a way to do all those things and still disappear.
Why would I want to do that?
Tell me.
Look, Neela, there are, there are..
there's things that-that should be kept private.
Not between two people who are trying
to figure out if they belong together.
No, I'm-I'm comfortable with you.
Well, maybe that's not enough.
Not when I have to find out things..
...important things
about you from other people.
Oh, so that's it? That's it, is it?
What, I'm not chatty enough, so you go snooping around
trying to get under my skin?
No. It's not like that.
Trying to make me be what you think a boyfriend should be
sharing my emotions and..
...and...ta-talking about every stupid damn thing
that-that-that bothers me? No.
[shouting] No!
Look, a terrible thing was done to you.
I understand that.
And I hate that it happened.
But somewhere..
...in all of what's gone on between us
one thing is clear.
We're not meant to be together.
It doesn't mean we don't care about each other deeply, but..
You know, I truly believe..
...there's something better out there for both of us.
Whenever we're ready for it.
Better?
Something more right.
So, Northwestern, huh?
Too good for county.
Well, what can I say, Frank?
I've seen how you care for your patients here.
Dr. Morris says to make sure they check another potassium
as soon as you get there.
Thanks, Haleh.
We're gonna see you soon, right?
Not if I see you first.
Alright, folks, it's only a mile away.
You can visit him when we're not on the clock.
[engine starting]
Um..
Primary repair worked.
So, I-I guess the world can look forward to, uh
a gaggle of olive-skinned kids..
...with red hair and freckles.
If-if that's something that you want.
(Simon) The life you lead, the things you have been through..
They define how you do your job.
The-the quality of, of..
The quality of your work.
Especially in a place like this.
So at the, um..
At the end of the day, you choose to..
...deny or deal.
(male #1) 'And which do you choose?'
It's evolving.
I'm evolving.
Um..
All I know is that I-I know..
Um, that there is a lot of work that I need to do.
(male #1) 'Can you be more specific about that?'
No. Not with you.
Mrs. Taggart?
Hi. Tony Gates.
I work with Sam.
I used to play.
You know, Christmas time.
Play the carols.
[discordant notes sound]
- It's all gone now. - Yeah.
Well, Sam wanted me to get this back to you.
Well, she said she was coming by.
Well, she-she can't tonight.
She's on a work call.
Uh-huh.
And you are?
I am a friend.
A friend?
Do you smoke?
No, ma'am, I don't.
That's too bad.
You're a good looking fella, though, aren't you?
Hmm, must be the lighting in here.
Do you know..
...that out of all these people in here
I'm the youngest one by about 15 years?
[wheezing]
What the hell did I do to deserve this?
I can't imagine.
[chuckling]
I don't want her to stop coming.
So, if she thinks that's so, you tell her it's not.
Okay.
You know, Sam's an amazing person.
She's very strong.
She's overcome a lot of obstacles.
You get to know her, you'd be very proud.
- She hates me. - No, she doesn't.
Well, she thinks that I hate her.
Well, then, change that.
Sure.
[striking piano keys] Tada!
Changed.
Well..
...it's up to you.
Have a good night.
Hey.
You're not lying, are you?
She's going to come back tomorrow?
When Sam makes up her mind
nothing stops her.
I love helping people.
You know, originally, I-I wanted to, um..
...be the first baseman for the Chicago Cubs.
The thing I hate most about my job?
(male #1) 'Mm-hmm.'
- Smells. - The smells.
The human body's got some pretty interesting smells.
What's-what's the dating life like?
[laughing]
Well, I'm not going to tell you.
[laughing]
It's personal.
A patient is a patient.
Um...pain is pain.
It's-it's universal.
(John) I reached a point about
five years ago..
...where I started..
...to feel that every day was the same thing.
And I'd had enough.
But I've been through a lot of stuff since then.
And now..
...I try to embrace the idea
that..
...everything that happens has never happened before.
Like that saying..
...that you can't stand in the same river twice
because by the time that you come back
it's not the same river.
And you're not the same man.
Anyway.
I look around this place now
and I can't imagine ever finding it boring.
Because right at the moment..
...that you think you've seen it all..
Something happens that you never could have expected.
