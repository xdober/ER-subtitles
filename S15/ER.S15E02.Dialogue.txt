(male narrator) Previously on "ER.."
Are you a sociopath? A sadist? Stoned?
I heard that you were tightly wound but I had no idea.
What am I giving up, a dumpy OR?
Overnight call? Below-market pay?
This is not what you want.
Everything was going really well
'till the ambulance blew up.'
Morris..
...don't screw this up.
(Neela) 'There's an open artery. I can either let him bleed out.'
Or we can accept the risk of a stroke.
(Archie) 'His heart's gone.'
His brain's gone. We're pronouncing him.
He was going to be the chief of the ER.
(Archie) 'As we embrace the memory of our colleague'
'and our dear friend..'
(Archie) Helipad access, ortho supplies, suture cart.
Nurses' station, drug lockup, call room.
There's a call room?
Yeah, but don't plan on sleeping.
Oh, I didn't come here to sleep.
Hey, don't be snarky. We just got here.
Nice dress.
Oh, Barney's sale, 1,800 bucks,
got it for a fourth, I love that.
Okay, these are the trauma rooms.
Take some time to familiarize yourself with the equipment.
Ah, the new interns.
(Simon) 'Welcome to County.'
'Those are some shoes.'
Oh, I always wear heels.
Anything else hurts my feet.
[alarm rings]
Everybody get a chance to look around Chicago?
No, we were at a friend's wedding in Denver yesterday.
Drove all night.
Yeah, I washed my hair
in a gas station sink
and I came straight here.
Uh, you're from Texas, right?
Went to med school in San Antonio
but I'm from New York.
[Archie speaks in Spanish]
I don't speak Spanish.
Oh.
Ah! Everybody meet Dr. Tony Gates
third-year resident, and Sam Taggart, one of our nurses.
- Welcome. - Nice to meet you.
Gates oversees you, I supervise him
and Sam's got her eye on all of us.
Be careful or she'll kick your ass.
Trust him, he knows.
[thudding]
[shouting]
(female #1) 'Security.'
Charts, forms, lab recs, it's all here.
Is this..? Are these who I think they are?
My friend, it's true. Your replacements have arrived.
Tracy Martin, it's nice to meet--
Thank you, God!
I'm not an intern anymore.
Kaya, come meet your partners in crime.
Hey, you guys. How's it going?
- You're an intern, too? - Yep. Skipped the orientation.
Y'all need to get your newbie behinds down to Personnel.
You can't work without I.D.
And this is Frank.
Donuts will make him your friend.
Avoid coconut, it gives him gas.
You can say that again.
Hi, I'm Tracy Martin.
And I'm an intern in the Emergency Department.
Oh, wait! I-I need a touch-up.
Andrew Wade, intern, General Surgery.
- Surgeon, wow. - Yeah.
Daria Wade, intern, Emergency Department.
I should really go find where I'm supposed to be right now.
- Call you later, Dar. - Honey, honey, yeah, I know.
I gotta go now. I love you, bye.
Ryan Sanchez, intern.
(Ryan) 'My wife, she's home with the kids.'
Still getting used to the new place.
[phone rings] Hello?
I did my MBA while I was at Stanford.
And the program there is real..
Hold on. I wasn't ready.
(Cate) That's enough, you're done.
(Cate) Put the little penis away.
And you... you're a doctor now.
Try to look like one.
And on that note, three-inch heels
have no place in the hospital.
Catherine Banfield, Attending Physician
Chief of the ER.
Hello, everyone.
I'm your new boss.
[theme music]
We see an average of 250 patients a day.
300 if it gets crazy.
A few years in this place, you can handle anything.
Well, I'm sure.
So what made you come back from Indonesia?
It was time. Chicago's home.
I don't get the whole medical mission thing.
Why chase tragedy overseas
when we've got disaster right at our front door?
It's not for everyone.
I thought the nurse ratio was four to one.
My ex-girlfriend went on a medical mission.
- Total mistake. - Where are all the nurses?
Doesn't look four-to-one around here.
We're short, as usual.
This is Haleh Adams, our charge nurse.
Haleh, meet Dr. Banfield, our new chief.
- Welcome to County. - Nice to meet you.
Coffee anyone?
I'm not into coffee, it's a crutch.
Uh, meet me to run the board in five minutes.
Do I know you?
You look so familiar.
I don't think so.
Ever work at St. Mark's?
I pick up shifts there sometimes.
- No. - Moonlight in urgent care?
You know, I could swear I've seen you before.
No, it's my first day.
Well, if there's anything you need to know
about this place, just ask.
Cuticle cream?
Latex gloves are murder on your hands.
Do you think this used to be a sandwich?
You guys get settled, meet me out at the desk.
- You okay? - Yeah.
You've been here for, like, 96 hours straight.
We're a little short staffed right now.
- Thank you. - Us, too.
Abby took a few days off with Luka
and you look like crap.
Look who's talking. You live here.
Yeah, well, it's easier than going home.
- Sleep is overrated. - Another day, bring it on.
These patients have been on the board since yesterday.
Well, the hospital's full. They never discharge at night.
Which makes it impossible to admit anyone.
I'm friendly with the nursing supervisor on med-surge.
I bet you are.
She can always find a bed for me.
You get her to open things up?
Lubricating the logjam?
Do it.
Oh, Dr. Banfield.
Hey, so I just wanted to let you know
I have to take off a little early tonight.
I'm starting the nurse anesthetist program
and I have to drop my kid off at a friend's house.
Leave when your shift's over.
I'm kind of a stickler for that, Sam.
- It is Sam, right? - Yeah.
It's only like 20 minutes.
We all have commitments, just don't let them
bleed into your work.
Wow, new chief seems great.
You know, Alex can hang out with me and Sarah tonight.
- Really? - Yeah.
It's just he's been home a week. I don't want him to be alone.
No problem, I'll pick him up after work.
Thank you, Tony. It's a big help.
(Archie) 'James Silcott, 26.'
Burns and minor trauma from a chemical explosion
in the apartment next to theirs.
Decca Richards, 24, same explosion.
Vitals good, complaining of abdominal pain.
- Baby, you okay? - Yeah, I think so.
I'm Dr. Gates. What happened?
(Decca) We were reading on the couch when boom!
This blast just came through the walls, man.
Both trauma rooms are both open.
(Simon) 'Okay, Kaya, with Dr. Morris.'
Gates, you're with me. Trauma One, let's go.
Follow me.
You're gonna be right next door, okay?
I'll bounce between and supervise.
We're attendings, we don't need to be supervised.
Just watch this time, get a sense of how things go.
Screw that.
(Sam) 'Eighteen gauge in the antecube.'
(Kaya) 'Tachy at 118, pulses are good.'
(Archie) 'Second degree burns to chest and arm.'
'Kaya, let surgery know.'
'Alright, on my count, one, two, three.'
(Sam) 'What exploded?'
Don't know, just heard this breaking glass.
'Probably like his meth lab or something, guy's a freak.'
Sam, HemoCue, trauma panel, type and cross.
Why the ultrasound?
Explosion, blunt trauma. That's why.
(Kaya) 'How's your pain?'
It's pretty bad. My arm is killing me.
We can get you something for that.
Five of MS, titrate up from there.
Get another set of vitals before you go
dropping his pressure with narcotics.
Is Decca okay?
(Cate) 'I'll go check.'
Good idea.
(Tony) 'So what kind of music does your band play?'
It's hard to explain. Imagine a punk version of 40's standards.
That makes no sense.
Okay, no fluid, looks good.
You'll have to come check it out sometime.
- Ow! - Sorry.
Do you want me to try?
I said stand back and watch.
(Tony) 'I had a band once.'
Bunch of sexually frustrated adolescent boys.
Alright, I.V.'s in. Hang a liter.
Liter of what?
- Normal saline. - So be clear.
Everyone knew what he meant.
'We knew one song, "You Got Lucky"'
'by Tom Petty and we played it'
over and over again in this guy's garage.
* You got lucky babe * * You got lucky babe *
* You got lucky babe * * You got lucky babe *
* When I found you * * When I found you **
Over and over again. I'm not kidding you.
It was, it was sad.
You have a patient on the table.
- A stable patient. - It's cool, really.
A trauma case can turn on a dime.
I know that. We're good here.
Every single patient that comes through that door
is my responsibility.
And I have to know that I can trust your judgment.
I'm sorry for calling so early
but I've got an obstructive pancreatitis on the schedule.
(Lucien) You know what? You gotta stop doing this, Dusty.
(Dustin) 'Would you jump straight to'
pancreatojejunal anastomosis or do a sphincteroplasty first?
If the proximal duct is open, option one, otherwise two.
Intermittent dilation
'go with a Puestow procedure.'
- You are my hero. - 'Yeah, yeah, I know.'
I gotta run. I'm doing grand rounds at Rush.
- Dr. Crenshaw? - What?
Oh, finally, I've been looking for you.
Andrew Wade, new surgical intern.
I'm supposed to shadow you today.
Is black okay?
Fantastic.
Where is she?
You probably should be getting back to work.
It's my day off. I only came in because I wanted to--
Neela, I know where this is going.
But Lucien's a fantastic teacher
and the patients love him.
And he's an amazing trauma surgeon.
I don't disagree.
Well, then how can you let him leave?
I don't like it either, but he forced our hand.
Look, he was upset. H-he didn't mean--
The board voted for dismissal. It's done.
(Archie) 'Listen, Captain Hemolysis'
you guys use the same excuse every time.
Spare me the dog-ate-my-homework crap
and get me the damn potassium level, thank you.
Impossible to get anything done around here.
- You okay? - Yeah.
When was the last time you had a day off?
I got a... I got a guy with bullous pemphigoid
in curtain three, you should check it out.
Why don't you get out of here for a while?
It'll be good for you.
Hey. I need you to sign off on a bunch of stuff.
I'm all yours.
One of the nurses had me order bactrim
on tricycle girl.
Is that approved for kids?
You're missing the point. She asked me.
Didn't need my order cosigned or anything.
Hallelujah, I am so sick
of getting my orders co-signed.
I'm just saying, there's always been someone
double-checking our decisions.
Making sure we didn't mess up.
Now you're feeling like you're flying
without a net, right?
- Exactly. - It's completely normal.
Yeah, all this responsibility, I mean..
...I want it, it's just a little scary.
- Hmph! - What?
Well, if you're not ready
then you shouldn't be here.
You're all ready, it just takes
a little time to grow into this job.
'You have complete backup, okay?'
No one's expecting you to run a code the first day.
Now, come on, let's start with the basics.
Fever with a murmur.
What's the workup?
Surgery wants to admit the explosion couple
for observation, but they have no beds.
What else is new? Okay, park them in the hallway.
I'll write orders for vitals and fluids.
Hey. See this guy, will you?
He's been waiting five hours already now.
Oh, s-sorry, Frank. We were eating bonbons in a bubble bath.
Totally lost track of time. Go say, "Hi".
Hey, I'm Sam. I'm one of the nurses.
Finally. I was ready to give up on you guys.
Check this out.
Do I have flesh eating bacteria?
No, I don't think so.
But, uh, I'll have one of
the doctors take a look at it.
Well, h-how long is this gonna take?
I got a big test tomorrow, I can't be here all night.
And if it were up to you, what would you do?
I just got here 30 seconds ago.
Sometimes, that's all you get.
Okay, um...severe cellulitis.
- IV antibiotics. - What kind?
I don't know. Um...Ancef?
No, IV Vanco to cover the MRSA.
And don't answer a question
with a question, I hate that.
Well, you gonna give me some medicine?
What was that?
Just trying to get a sense of how you think
and what you're capable of.
Oh, well, that's kind of hard to come up with a plan on the fly--
Hard? You're an ER nurse.
You're the first line against gunshot wounds, stabbings
you scrape brain off your shoes.
Think a little bedside teaching's hard?
Forty something male, found down behind the explosion site.
I don't want this! Let me go!
Sir, your leg's broken, you can't walk.
Minor burns to the neck and torso
probable tib-fib on the left.
Alright, Gates, take this with the interns.
- I'll be right in. - Listen to me!
Why won't you listen to me?
- Can I run it? - No. I'm Dr. Gates.
- I don't need a doctor! - 'What's your name, sir?'
- Shut up! I don't want this! - 'We gotta call you something.'
Felix! You don't know what you're messing with!
(Tony) 'Alright, ABCs. Here we go.'
Yeah, but he's really tachypneic.
(Daria) 'Could be edema from the fire.'
(Tony) 'On my count. One, two, three!'
Stop!
Okay, I'm only gonna listen.
- Don't touch me! - Sats 91.
(Tony) 'Sir, your oxygen level is low.'
We need to evaluate your lungs.
Leave me alone!
Come on, let me just cut your shirt, okay?
Don't touch, don't touch my stuff!
- Hold his arms. - Sir, relax!
- Listen to me! Listen to me! - Sir, relax!
- Oh. - What the hell?
Oh, my God. Now you did it.
- Is this cocaine? - You cut through the damn bag.
- Bag of what? - You shouldn't have done that!
- What powder is that? - It's weaponized ricin.
It's extremely lethal. I made it myself.
- Oh, ricin? - You shouldn't have done that.
- I am so out of here. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, stop.
You open those doors, the whole ER is exposed.
I told you not to touch me!
Now we're all dead!
- ER. - Frank, call Hazmat.
We have a situation here.
Cops said the guy is a real whack job.
Had stuff on anthrax, botulism, plague.
Alright, let's keep it down.
We don't want people to panic.
We're moving people out into the waiting area.
I think they're gonna know something's up.
Environmental Services won't touch it.
- They said call Hazmat. - Okay, did you?
Yes, but the fire department is supposed to respond first.
- Well, what's their ETA? - Ten minutes out.
Alright, I think we should seal off Exam Two.
With what, duct tape? I'll find some.
- Morris! - Right behind you!
If they get sick, we need to have access to that room.
Be a few hours before any symptoms manifest.
Well, we can't just leave them in there.
They got to be quarantined till Hazmat
can figure out what we're dealing with.
Let's, uh, let's just concentrate on evacuation now.
Evacuation? Where?
You know this hospital, you tell me.
- 'Hey, hold the elevator.' - Hey, where are you going?
- Upstairs for observation. - 'I thought you had no beds.'
Well, we can't very well leave them here
in Hot Zone, can we?
Surgical lobby. Come with me.
Dr. Gates, the hazardous materials team is on the way.
I have an unstable patient
three freaking interns, please hurry up.
I knew the cops would be all over my place
so I took my stuff and ran.
There are no masks in here!
There's no gowns either!
I didn't count on the fire escape collapsing.
You know what, Felix? Shut up.
This says inhalation of aerosolized ricin
can kill in 24 hours.
Does it say if it's absorbed though the skin?
Gloves, we should all be wearing gloves.
How's his pulse ox?
They're trapping us in here.
[phone ringing) Oh, my God.
Annie, honey, I'm with a patient, gotta go.
Alright, let's stay focused.
Secondary survey, let's go.
I've got a year's supply of Valium in here.
Don't forget the I.V. tubing and the infusers.
I don't know what they have upstairs.
How much you think this would be worth on the street?
After today, I'm thinking about an alternate career.
You doing alright?
I should bring some fentanyl, too, right?
He's got a phone in there.
You can call and talk to him.
Nah, he's busy. I'm busy, too.
Gotta start my new career as a drug dealer.
I don't want that.
I'm not too interested in what you want at this point.
I didn't mean for this to happen.
You should have told us about this
before we started working on you.
I tried! Listen, my leg is really killing me.
Yeah, because it's broken, and unfortunately for you
we can't help you, because we're stuck in this room.
Please, something's really wrong.
(Daria) 'That doesn't look right.'
(Tony) 'Yeah, compartment syndrome.'
We have to do a fasciotomy.
You're bleeding from the fracture' into the soft tissue
That's why blood is not getting to your foot.
Ryan, go to the code cart, get me some morphine.
Morphine? Wait, for this guy?
- We treat everybody the same. - What's morphine look like?
It's a clear bottle, black top, says "Morphine."
Man, it's really killing me!
I don't think there's any here.
Alright, alright, I'm sorry, this is gonna hurt, man.
- 'You, uh, what's your name?' - Daria.
- Daria, talk to him. - What? What?
- Talk to the patient! - Oh, um, okay.
So, so how did you become a bioterrorist?
Damn it!
[Felix screaming]
Hey!
What's going on?
Hazmat team's about ten minutes out.
In the meantime, discharge whoever you can
and bring the rest to the evacuation area.
You moved all the portable monitors upstairs?
Grab your instruments, medicines, whatever you need
because when Hazmat gets here
they're not gonna let you back in.
- Okay, let's move the CHF-er. - Excuse me, one minute.
Hey, Mr. Burke, you can't leave yet.
What the hell is going on? I heard bomb scare.
Now they're saying anthrax or something.
It's not anthrax.
Yeah, whatever it is, I don't need it.
Uh, stop for one minute, okay?
You have a serious infection, and you need to be admitted
to the hospital for IV antibiotics.
Well, I can't be admitted.
I'm supposed to take the GED tomorrow.
I'm finally gonna get my diploma.
- 'Sam, we're going up.' - Please, don't leave.
I'm gonna try to work something out for you, okay?
[sighs]
Okay, go slow. He needs an expiratory phase.
Any chance we could give oral antibiotics to the--
- No! - He's gonna go home AMA.
Change his mind.
Hey, I thought I said we were taking
the rule-out MI's to family practice.
We don't have enough staff to cover an additional area.
But I got the clinic nurses to agree to help out!
Dr. Morris, the rule-outs will wait
upstairs like everyone else!
You just let me know when you need my help, okay?
I'm here for you.
You think the docs in that room are gonna be okay?
I don't know.
I hope so.
I, uh, I heard that you worked in Thailand after the tsunami.
Indonesia.
Well, this must seem pretty minor compared to that.
Yeah. It is.
ICU says they're not allowed to lend out their EKG machine.
Don't ask, just take it!
Intubated patients, through there.
How many more are left down there?
Another 20 or 30.
We need to make more space.
Respiratory's on the way with more than two tanks
and rehab's sending three vents they aren't using.
- Nice. - Rehab was Marisol's idea.
- This one's a keeper. - Sorry. Gotta take this.
Hey.
(Dubenko on phone) 'Eleven hang-ups, Dusty?'
We are under siege!
Yeah, you do know your number shows up, right?
I can tell it's you.
'I am stuck with a new intern'
and the ER was the target of a bioterrorist attack.
Mm-hmm. I used to call that a Thursday.
'Oh, you love this, don't you?'
Me getting my ass kicked while you get
to sleep in and go to yoga.
I wish that was the case, but with all the, uh, lectures
conferences and interviews out here, it's been grueling.
Speaking of which, I got to run.
Yeah. Okay, no, no, wait. Lucien? Lucien?
You know, the ER's being attacked
and you're catching up on phone calls.
Any headway with Anspaugh?
No. But he knows it's crap.
He wouldn't even look me in the eye.
We got a transplant kid who pulled out his G-tube.
- Oh, that's Neela's specialty. - Oh, you owe me.
The guys in the moon suits are here.
Oh, good, I feel so much better now.
They must have an exit strategy.
Fracture must have severed the tibeal artery.
'I can't see crap.'
It says here that low-micron ricin particles
may be suspended in the air for hours.
That's it. We're screwed!
Put the phone down and get me a suture kit.
I'm gonna have to make this incision bigger
to find the bleeding vessel, okay?
(Tony) 'You ready? Here we go.'
- One, two, three. - Ow!
Alright, four by fours!
- Give me four by fours! - I don't feel so good.
You need to lie down. What are you being admitted for?
Asthma. It's really bad this time.
We were here all night, my mom went home to take a shower.
I can't get any air!
No, it's gonna be okay, I promise.
Alright, Daria, find a large BP cuff
and put it around his thigh.
Heart rate's up to 135.
Look in the drawer for a hemostat.
- Like a clamp? - 'Yeah.'
(Tony) 'A needle driver, anything, come on!'
Do we have any albuterol in here?
- It's too much! - He's not moving air very well.
Alright, so, Felix, talk
to me, who was the ricin for?
It doesn't matter.
Listen, if we're all gonna die in here
you can at least tell us why.
You owe us that much.
I was gonna send it to
a few officials, prove my point.
- Systolic's only 84. - This cuff is way too small!
- I'm not finding any clamps. - Okay!
I'm serious, this guy needs a neb.
We don't normally keep respiratory meds in here.
Check-check the cart, look through all the bottles.
(Felix) 'Homeland Security, what a joke!'
We let anyone in. Anything can happen! It's not right!
Well, neither is exposing a bunch of innocent people
to a deadly biotoxin.
She has a point there, Felix.
'My wife, she used to work near the Pentagon.'
She got killed by one of the planes.
Alright, I need prolene. Get me prolene.
What's prolene?
So this is a dose of Vancomycin now.
You're gonna go home with this IV tonight.
In the morning, before your test
you're gonna come in, show your bracelet.
They're gonna bring you back and give you a second dose. Deal?
Deal. Thanks.
I think it's cool you're getting your GED, you know.
I got tired of telling people I dropped out of high school.
You're challenging yourself. I admire that.
(Archie) 'This is Devon, eight years old.'
'Floor collapse, fell into a basement.'
Crush injuries to chest and pelvis.
His mom, Hannah, jumped through the hole to get to her kid.
Arm looks broken, vitals okay.
Okay, this way.
- Mommy? - Devon, honey, I'm right here.
- Where are you? - Get me off of this thing!
- In a minute, ma'am. - I need to see my son!
What's going on? We're closed to trauma.
The accident was four blocks away.
The rig got authorization to come.
- I never authorized-- - I did.
Diverting an unstable kid across town
would have been crazy. I authorized them to come.
(Sam) 'Come on, wake up.'
Morris, throw me that bag. This kid's not breathing.
- 'Devon.' - 'Five-oh and a Mac two.'
Alright, I think I got it.
There we go. God, crap!
- Another prolene? - Oh, his sats only 81.
Alright, turn up the O2.
It's up. It's all the way up.
Felix, Felix?
(Jacob) 'I can't..'
under the...she went out of snow.
Dr. Gates, he's altered and there's no Albuterol in here.
Alright, mac three and a seven-oh.
Jacob, hang in there, I'm gonna be right back.
What's a mac?
Macintosh laryngoscope, size three
seven-oh ET tube.
Got it. We're going to intubate?
Yeah, looks like we might have to.
V-tach, I can't feel a pulse.
Alright, start CPR.
I can't take my hand out of here.
Come on, let's go! Ryan, start compressions.
Daria, bag him. Tracy, charge the defibrillator, let's go.
Let's do real thing now.
- Three sixty? - Yeah.
Put the paddles on his chest.
'Come on, put the paddles on the chest!'
Clear.
Go!
- Still V-tach. - Alright, resume compressions.
Daria, switch with me.
Alright, put pressure on the artery
like your life depends upon it.
Tracy, give me that tube.
It's for Jacob, there was only one.
Yeah, well, this guy's not breathing, Jacob is.
- Let's go. - 'He's just a kid--'
Shock him again.
- Clear. - Alright.
Okay, so you're gonna let some innocent kid
suffer and maybe even die to save
a lowlife who tried to kill us?
(Ryan) 'Still V-tach.'
I'm sorry, but why do you even want to save this guy?
Because we prioritize the sickest patient.
That's what we do here.
If you guys don't get it, you don't belong.
Fine...then you tell that to the kid's mom.
(Gates) 'Alright, I'm in.'
- Tape. - Got it.
(Tracy) 'Two milligrams, right?'
Yeah, give it to Daria and, uh...
Always hold the tube against the soft palate
until it's secured in.
Going again.
Clear.
- Still V-tach. - Alright.
- Resuming. - Uh, what do I do with this?
Squirt it in the tube.
(Gates) 'Good.'
- Here you go. - That one's for Jacob.
Two cc's in the IV.
Won't intravenous EPI mess with his rhythm?
Maybe, but it'll dilate his bronchioles
and help him oxygenate. Alright, do it.
- Tracy, with a flush. - Here it goes.
[gasping]
- No change. - Alright, shock him again.
Might work now with the drugs on board.
Clear.
Back in sinus.
Alright.
Aren't we the heroes.
Hey, come on. We just saved a guy's life.
(Tracy) 'Dr. Gates, it worked.'
Jacob's sats are coming up.
'Good.'
[telephone ringing]
- Hello? - 'It's Cate Banfield.'
How you guys doing?
Oh, honestly, we're a little bored in here.
When you open the doors, you'll be in a quarantine corridor.
[door creaks]
[machine beeping]
What thehell?
This is so surreal.
Gates, what have you got?
Severed tibeal artery.
I got vascular standing by.
Status asthmaticus.
He needs a terb drip and the ICU.
I'll make sure they have room.
The four of us...dry martinis, straight up, with a twist.
You'll all be decontaminated and admitted for observation.
Well, I hope they can decontaminate our insides
because we've been breathing that crap for a long time.
Ow!
Positive Murphy sign, any fever?
Uh, yep, white count's 24.
Ultrasound showed acalculous cholecystitis.
Okay, it looks like you're gonna need an operation
to take out your gallbladder.
Will I have to stay home from school?
Only for a few days. We'll be doing it laparoscopically.
Which means we'll only be making a tiny cut.
If you make a bigger cut, could I stay home longer?
Don't like school, huh?
I just moved here.
And everyone already knows each other.
- Did you write a pre-op note? - Uh, not yet.
It's hard, I know. I just moved here, too.
The girls in my new school..
...well, they're all into being cool
and making out.
I miss Detroit.
Listen, you don't want to be cool in seventh grade.
- I don't? - 'No way.'
Seventh-grade cool kids peak at 16
and spend the rest of their lives missing the glory days.
Me and Dr. Rasgotra here?
Huge nerds at your age.
- Am I right? - For sure.
[pager beeping]
We've got a trauma, they're asking for you.
Make sure you get consent from mom.
You know, the truth is, every cool adult
will tell you they were an unpopular kid.
- You're just saying that. - No, it's like, um..
A rule of the universe.
You'll see.
- I will. - Yeah.
The adventure is just beginning.
Somebody grab me another cordis, this wire is kinked.
Fluid in Morrison's, he needs a repeat HemoCue.
I'm on it.
Hey, hang in there. I know it's hard to watch.
'This is all my fault.'
I took him with me on the job.
I don't have anyone to watch him
stay with him after school.
Believe me, I get that.
I'm a locksmith.
Banks have us running ragged
and changing locks on foreclosed houses.
Sounds depressing.
Who knows why some people's lives work out
and others don't?
'It all seems so random.'
Yeah.
Okay, subclavian's in.
'Get the blood bank to rush our packed cells.'
(Hannah) 'Devon thought that he saw a cat in the house'
and he went inside to see and..
'...the next thing I know he was'
screaming through a hole in the floor.
Your tube's in the right main stem.
- I know. - Why didn't you pull it back?
I put it there intentionally to decrease the risk
of pneumo during line placement.
Then you should decrease tidal volume.
Okay, you know what?
Youreallyneed to stop micro-managing everyone.
Do your job, and I won't have to.
(Rasgotra) 'Look, have this out later.'
We need to get him to surgery now.
I'll get ortho in here, to reduce that arm.
- OR's ready. - Okay, let's go.
I'll update you as soon as I can.
No, no, give her a moment with her son.
You know, we don't have time for this.
Two minutes?
[intense music]
Listen, baby boy.
I want you to be strong in there.
Okay?
Because..
[sobbing] ...if anything happened to you
the world would stop.
You know that, right?
[indistinct chattering]
Felix made it to the OR.
(Ryan) 'Baby, they do it every year. It's tradition.'
- What about Jacob? - He's tucked away in the PICU.
They keep us overnight the first day. It's a ritual.
Should be fun.
I love you, too.
Kiss the kids goodnight.
Bye.
Why are you lying to your wife?
She'd freak if she knew the truth.
- Give her a little credit. - Yeah, got it.
Thanks.
[sighs]
(Ryan) 'Annie grew up in west Texas.'
In a town with like...4000 people.
Never meant to end up with a guy from Brooklyn
and she was totally against moving to the city.
But I fought for it.
Can't really practice emergency medicine out in the sticks, huh?
Exactly.
I talked her into this.
Ooh, boy.
She was nervous about smog
traffic, purse snatchers.
So, I can't quite bring myself to tell her
that on my first day, I was the target
of a weapon of mass destruction.
- Hey, you. - 'Hi.'
- You okay? - Yeah.
I'm not coughing up blood
but the night is still young.
Yeah, there's only eight more hours
till we find out if we're gonna die.
Okay, well, they're looking for beds
for you guys upstairs.
'Uh, can I get you some lunch?'
Burgers, fries, onion rings, all on me.
I mean, after all, it could be our last day on this...earth.
What's up, Ryan, you a vegetarian?
- Ryan! - Whoa!
Hey, we need a gurney here.
Keloid cowboy can go home.
He has a follow-up in surgery clinic.
Cholecystitis girl will have to hang here till a bed opens up.
She won't mind. She's crushing big-time on Dr. Andrew here.
Too bad I only have eyes for you.
Dusty, that little boy's going to the OR.
And I'm pretty sure it's a liver lac.
Alright, tell them to start prepping.
I'll be right there.
You want to grab a coffee?
You know, after this settles down?
Or maybe a stiff drink's more in order.
- It's been quite a day. - Yeah, it has.
I just thought we could talk about what happened.
Don't mind her. She's in a foul mood.
Today's her day off.
She struck out with Anspaugh
and then got sucked into this mess.
- Struck out with Anspaugh? - Yeah.
She's on a campaign to bring Lucien back.
I told her it was a lost cause. But Neela's stubborn.
- Your uncle's worse. - Yeah.
Marisol, you work here on the surgical floor?
The elective surgery guys were asking
how they could help and I suggested they take
the obstructive pancreatitis case off your plate.
I mean, that is, unless you wanted to do that one yourself.
Are you for real?
We have blood pressure yet?
BP at 85 over 51. It's too low to get access.
- Is he satting okay? - Go back to the tent.
- Is it the ricin? - Go back inside.
- You haven't been cleared yet. - Hey, is this what happens?
Alright, let's let Dr. Banfield fix him up. Come on.
You think it's the ricin?
It seems early, but it's possible.
Brachial artery's here.
Slightly medial, you'll hit the vein.
'Got a flash.'
Welcome back.
(Reidy) 'Drug overdose in PEA.'
Found him two blocks away with a syringe
still connected to an IV.
We're closed to trauma.
Yeah, he's wearing a County ID
bracelet registered for today.
Must have wandered off for a drug fix.
It's my cellulitis guy.
Alright, move him upstairs.
Let's go.
(Morris) 'Resuming compressions.'
Narcan's in.
[machine beeping]
It's the fourth dose.
Are we sure it's opiates?
Some guy told the paramedics they shot heroin
together an hour ago.
He has track marks all over his ankles.
It's called a head-to-toe exam for a reason.
[machine beeps]
Hold compressions.
[machine beeping]
- Still PEA. - Another epi.
He was taking his high school equivalency test tomorrow.
He was not the type of guy who was gonna walk out and shoot up.
Did you ask about IV drug use before you sent him out
with a portal into a mainline vessel?
Not specifically, no.
You cannot judge people based on how they look
or what they're reading. I expect you to know that.
Just heard from the CDC.
'The ricin powder was too coarse to vaporize.'
No chance a toxic dose could have got into the lungs.
[sighs] Oh! That's good news, Frank.
(Frank) Exam two needs to stay sealed pending environmental detail.
That's just a precaution. Otherwise, we're all clear.
(Banfield) 'Thanks, Frank. Hold compressions.'
No change.
- That's it, we're done. - What?
Four rounds of cardiac meds and still he's in an agonal rhythm.
Core temp's dropping. This guy's dead.
[machine beeping]
- What's our EBL? - 400 cc's.
- Not bad. - Sponge?
How's it going?
Liver lac, grade three, just like you thought.
Repair's going well, vitals are solid.
I think Andrew here's a good luck charm.
- Irrigate right here. - I'll let the ER know.
- Is it cool if I go then? - Yeah.
Check out the, uh, sit-in outside
Anspaugh's office on your way out.
- 'What?' - Yeah.
Brenner organized some kind of protest.
'Everyone's talking about it.'
'The humanity of this department.'
'I mean, Dr. Dubenko has been an extraordinary--'
- What's going on? - We want Dubenko back.
Dr. Brenner says his uncle responds
to the whole strength in numbers concept.
Sit down, join us.
Uh, no, I've, uh, got some loose ends downstairs.
'And certainly not under these circumstances.'
When can I see Devon?
As soon as he's in recovery, they'll let us know, okay?
While you were asleep, the police came by.
They investigated the house.
It seems the prior owner
intentionally broke a water pipe, flooded
the whole first floor.
Kind of a screw-you to the bank for repossessing.
We see that kind of thing.
With the heat and humidity, the floorboards
rotted and just gave way.
Doesn't change the fact that I've been dragging my son
all over the Southside changing locks.
He's only eight years old.
He deserves to be protected from the world.
You know, this idea
that we can protect our children..
...you believe it because you have to.
But it's an illusion.
So, what, it's all just luck?
All you can do is...hope for the best?
You love him. You spend time with him.
That's all any kid wants.
One second, she's a raging bitch
and the next, she's Mother Teresa. I don't get it.
Well, she's pretty good at faking compassion.
Hey, I know you know this
but what she said about the OD, that was crap.
It wasn't your fault.
Thanks, Archie.
(Frank) 'Hello?'
Hello?
They disconnected every damn phone.
Pain assessment forms?
File them next to the H and P sheets.
Okay, um, patient satisfaction surveys?
- These are all filled out. - I'll take those.
Okay, and-and-and this looks like an old handout
on renal failure by Greg Pratt.
Should I toss it? It's from 2002.
No, you should not toss that. That's his work.
- That's-that's his legacy. - Dr. Morris.
Mind if I give you some feedback?
Oh, here we go.
You need to have better control of your emotions.
- Act like a leader. - Oh, come on!
All the, all the criticism, the bullying.
You think that's how you get people to respect you?
You have been storming around here sulking all day.
You are an attending physician.
Not a toddler.
[door creaks]
Did you think that I was finished?
You know what, lady? Shut up!
We have been through hell... here the last few weeks.
But somehow, we're getting through it. And you know how?
By showing up here
every day and dedicating ourselves to this work.
You don't know us.
You don't know this place.
And the last thing we need is for some stranger
to come in here and tell us how it's done.
I know that you lost a friend
and I'm sorry about that.
But we will never have a conversation like this again.
Understand?
[door creaks]
[sobbing]
Hey.
- Hey. - Can I, uh, talk to you?
Yeah, I'm all ears.
Uh, thank you for what you did.
I-I mean, the thing for Lucien.
Um, I don't know if it will work
but I appreciate it, I really do.
No big deal.
And, um, now, maybe
I'm being presumptuous here, but, um
if this was in any way some kind of gesture intended for, well..
...me...I guess I just want to be clear.
Clear?
We're work colleagues and that's all.
I don't wanna go for coffee or drinks with you.
Not now, not ever, okay?
So let me get this straight, me going to bat for Lucien
is...actually, some sort of
uh, romantic overture to impress you?
You've lost me there.
But, um, don't worry about the drinks.
It's, uh, message received.
[bell buzzing]
Dr. Brenner, your favorite water skier's asking for you.
Thank you.
I've got the old records on your thalassemia guy.
Thank you.
I called the pneumonia kid's insurance company.
Told 'em to go to hell, we're not transferring.
Perfect.
Uh, listen, I-I know things have been a bit rough
with you and Dr. Morris today.
I-I hope you don't mind my saying, he's not himself.
He-he took Dr. Pratt's death harder than any of us.
But he's a good guy, he's a good doctor and I--
I don't have a problem with Dr. Morris.
- You don't? - Nope.
He cares about his patients, has an opinion, takes a stand.
Works his ass off, which is more than I can say about you.
Excuse me?
You better get things in order, Frank.
It's a mess around here.
I can't believe they made me throw away my shoes.
Louboutins, do you know how much those cost?
No, but I'm sure you're going to tell us.
That was quite the first day, huh?
You could say that.
I got to perform a liver lac on an eight-year-old boy.
- That is so cool. - Wait.
- So, they're not admitting you? - Well, no.
You all heard the ricin isn't dangerous, right?
(Daria) 'What? So then what happened?'
I mean, why'd you faint?
I was reading about psychosomatic
responses to perceived toxic threats.
Apparently, it's pretty common.
Oh, so you're a hypochondriac.
I said psychosomatic. It's different.
(Gates) 'Either way, you'll live'
to see another day of scut.
Welcome to internship.
The dream starts now. Cheers.
- Hey. - Hey.
'Health department said you're cool to go.'
You're free.
Oh! Sweet.
- Later. - See you, kids.
- Bye. - Bye.
- Cute couple. - Yup.
So, when are you going to class?
Oh, forget it.
- It was a bad idea - What? Why?
'Cause I'm missing things at work. I'm barely there for Alex.
The last thing I need is to complicate my life.
I don't know what happened to you today
but you're a kick-ass nurse and you're a good mother.
This is important to you and this is something you should do.
You'll be great at it.
- Really? - Yes.
Besides, I wanna spend time with Sarah and Alex anyway.
Alright, uh, I mean, I guess I can make it, if I really hurry.
'Course you can. Go.
I'm just going to get some beer
we're gonna play some quarters
spark up the bong.
[chuckles] Hey!
I'm glad you didn't die today.
(Rasgotra) 'The whole department was there.'
Doctors, nurses, techs, clerks.
They were all sat outside Anspaugh's office.
'Demanding your return.'
You know, can we talk about this later?
- I'm about to go out. - What's there to talk about?
'Neela, these things usually happen for a reason, you know?'
Maybe it really is time to move on.
Time for a new chapter.
Yeah, you belong at county.
You know it and I know it. Don't make me beg.
It's healthy to change things up, you know?
I was stagnating there.
'Oh, that's bollocks.'
That's what my yogi says and I'm telling you
he's always right.
[door creaks]
Lucien, don't be an idiot.
Come back to work.
[instrumental music]
[sighs]
[theme music]
