(female narrator) Previously on"ER.."
Chase me!
One more touchdown, then we get ice cream.
Booker and Banfield, that's all
the Bears are gonna need this year.
That we should ride in together
unless someone might see us.
Um, being covert is more exciting, isn't it?
We've broken up. We're working together. It's weird.
We said we weren't gonna screw up our schedules.
Some-some awkwardness..
...while we're finding our bearings is..
Weird.
I should have never let
you and Sarah go out that night.
No, you were being cool.
We may have to put you on the transplant list.
(Brenner) 'So, Joanie's not her mother, and Lucy has no idea?'
I guess I'm in big trouble.
Only five hours in and it's safe to say..
...best Valentine's Day ever.
I gotta go. I've to check yesterday's paperwork.
Get the car gassed up.
I thought my hours were tough. It's 5 a.m.
I'm a rookie detective, they're looking
for reasons not to like me.
You know, I think what you're doing to me
is tantamount to police brutality.
Where did you hear that line? Some"Dirty Harry"movie?
No, I think it was a porno.
One-one of the feminist ones, though.
Oh, right. Yeah, I bet.
So, what can I do to sweeten your day?
Hmm.
- Candy hearts. - What?
You know those little candy hearts
with stuff written on them?
[zipping] Get me some.
I've never had them.
Are you crazy? Of course you have.
Everybody gets those.
Not me.
No one's ever given you a Necco?
No.
Forget it. You're nuts. I gotta go.
- Then go. - Then stop.
- You stop first. - Archie. Muah.
Oh, Detective Diaz.
He bought me a plastic tiara
and took me to Hampton Court.
Said I deserved to be treated like a queen.
Well, he got that right.
We were 15.
Oh.
What happened to him?
I heard he runs the Bombay Brasserie in Alaska.
Has three little kids and hands that smell of dal-chini.
It's not such a bad life.
What about you?
Me?
Uh, there was-there was one time, when, um..
...this girl and I went to Bali.
Some-some surfing and some diving.
It was nice.
But Bali, uh, well Bali was nice.
I like it there.
What about the girl?
Yeah, she was nice, too.
Right. You probably don't even remember her name, do you?
[laughing]
No, uh, her name was Nicole.
It's Nicole.
I was thinking, maybe we...maybe
we should go away sometime.
Well, maybe in a month or so. We'll see.
Where were you thinking?
I'll tell you later.
[laughing]
Alex, honey, I'm sorry you didn't sleep
but you are not staying home from school.
I know. It sucks.
We'll talk about it when I get home, okay?
Bye.
Alex had a girlfriend for two whole days
and she just dumped him tonight on the phone.
- Wow. Happy Valentine's Day. - I know.
I tried to tell him she's just a spoiled
little princess and forget about it, but..
Forget about it? Weren't you ever 15?
- Uh, no. - What happened?
Some kind of brawl at an after-hours club on Fulton.
- I'm Dr. Morris. - Get this thing out of me.
How did you end up with a tire iron in your belly?
- It was about this girl. - I've got a forearm fracture.
- And a hefty lip lac. - Another one?
Must've been some girl. Okay.
You and Gates take tire iron guy.
The rest go to triage.
I'll take this.
Teddy Lempel, 63, bronchospasm at a wedding.
Still going at 6 a.m.?
Pretty raucous wedding.
We were just getting started.
They wanted to be married at daybreak on Valentine's Day.
It's a Midsummer Night's Dream themed wedding.
- Teddy was officiating. - As Puck.
- But you already guessed that. - 'Hypoxic on the scene.'
Sats went up after a nasal cannula O2 .
Are you alright?
I'm fine. I'm fine.
It was just an allergy or something.
- Don't listen to him. - No, no, I saw it.
- He turned blue. - Baby, you need a doctor.
Lovers and madmen have such seething brains.
First unit's up.
Ow, my stomach, man!
Do something, please. Dude, take it out.
I can't do anything until the surgeons get here.
Just give him ten more morphine.
The first dose didn't seem to touch him.
I already did.
- You already did what? - Gave him ten of morphine.
- About two minutes ago. - Sam.
You can't just give meds without an order.
'Oh, come on you were just about to ask me for it.'
- 'But I hadn't.' - It's only morphine.
In the OR, I don't even need an order.
Yeah, well it's different down here, okay?
If something goes wrong, it's my ass on the line.
You can't just give whatever you want.
Is there a problem?
Systolic's down to 88, doctor. What would you like me to do?
I need some more blood, Nurse Taggart.
- Thank you. - 'Gates.'
Go sew up the lip lac. I got this.
- Oh, come on, Archie. - Drop it, Sam.
(Archie) 'Set up to incubate.'
We could try one more cycle.
We could.
You don't think it's a good idea.
Fifteen thousand dollars, all those hormones
and only a very little chance of it working.
That's no reason to give up.
I-I want us to raise a child.
I'm not giving up on that.
I'm only saying it doesn't have to be through IVF.
So, you're back to adoption, then?
I don't understand why you're so against it.
I'm not against it. I..
...I just worry we wouldn't be able to
love that child the same way.
- That's not true. - It's such an unknown.
It scares me.
And if we had a biological child
do we know exactly how that's gonna go?
Well, at least we have some idea where it came from.
Hmm.
What about an egg donor?
So, you would use a stranger's egg
but you won't adopt? That-that makes no sense.
No. Not a stranger.
I can get an egg from someone who carries my genes.
'Lara's in school at UC now.'
You...wanna use your niece's egg?
You don't think that's weird?
Mac 3 and an 80, I'm gonna put a tube down
your throat to help you to breathe.
No, man, I don't want that.
Do you want etomidate or ketamine? I think ketamine--
Etomidate, please, you're not gonna feel
'any of this, I promise you.'
Hey, Dr. Morris.
Hi. What brings you guys around?
We're investigating the brawl at the Night Kitchen.
- The what? - 'The club.'
Where the fight broke out.
2000 kids got stuffed into this
little warehouse, it's a wonder
'more people didn't get hurt.'
Detective Trent Mallory, CPD.
Oh, uh, Claudia's been telling me about you.
Detective Diaz is our little star.
'Mind if we ask you a few questions?'
- Get the cops out, alright? - Sorry, guys.
I got stuck with a transplant patient. Whoa.
Vitals are holding about 200cc's out.
Hello. I'm Dr. Rasgotra, the trauma surgeon.
I don't need surgery and I don't
need cops asking me stuff, alright?
Just get this thing out of me and let me go!
Wait.
- Whoa. - Etomidate's in.
- Two units on rapid infuser. - Throw me more lap pads.
- Everything you've got. - I'm gonna bleed to death, man.
80, and push the SUX!
And let the OR know we're sending him up now!
[theme music]
Morning. Waiting on a rig?
- No, a girl. - Oh, I see.
No, not like that, a little-little girl.
Her mom's a patient in the transplant service.
- Hi, Simon. - Hey.
That's my foster dad. He said to call
if I need him to take me to school.
Oh, I think you're gonna be missing school today.
Why?
I'm gonna let your mom tell you.
Lucy, this is Dr. Banfield.
- Hi. - Nice to meet you.
Good news, sweetie.
They found me a heart.
- Really? - Really.
I knew they would.
- I knew it. - Her heart's in Bloomington.
I'm gonna take a helicopter there
as soon as they're ready.
Now, Lucy, your mom's gonna go
and get some tests and some scans done
'and then we're gonna take her to the operating room.'
It's all happening today?
That's what they tell me.
It's the ER again. I've gotta go.
Um, I'll come back as soon as I know anything.
Thank you, Dr. Rasgotra.
Thank you.
Ten minutes? Are you sure?
Alright, then, there's a, uh, coffee shop
we can meet at, across the street.
I'll see you there.
Hey. This is from my girlfriend.
Really?
Yeah, we met last winter.
Snow dog sledding.
It's a crazy story.
Yeah, I'm sure it is.
I'll be back soon.
- Jerry, is that for you? - Yeah, from Doris.
The Eskimo chick?
She's not an Eskimo.
Excuse me. You okay?
Oh. Yeah, a patient freaked out.
It's under control now.
Listen, about earlier..
I'm sorry if I was out of line.
No, I was being a little dense.
It's okay, it's just when I'm up in the OR
I have a sort of different kind of autonomy.
- It's hard to turn it off. - You don't have to shut it off.
Just let me know what you're doing before you do it.
- Okay. - 'Hey, you two.'
Get a room! I think you've overdosed on mushrooms.
Mushrooms?
Not that kind of mushrooms.
When are we gonna get out of here?
We're still waiting on some tests.
What kind of mushrooms
'are we talking about?'
'Huh, this is Teddy Lempel'
the premier mycologist in Chicago.
He's been voted the best mushroom man
four years running by"Fungi"magazine.
(Nina) 'I'm a chef, and anyone who's anyone knows'
no one can hunt down exquisite wild mushrooms like Ted.
My gift...my curse.
Alright, can we have some room here, please?
Quite an entourage.
Alright, I need to listen to your lungs.
This wedding is because of me
you could say, and now it might not happen
because of me, which is quite a paradox.
Shh. Baby, baby, don't fret.
So, you're Cupid?
Oh, it's the basidiomycetes, really.
Some of which are known to produce
a mating trigger in sows.
A sort of porcine pheromone, if you will.
I don't say I know that it works on humans
but a certain beverage I concocted
was imbibed by Kevin and Nina the other night.
'Their eyes met across a crowded kitchen'
and voila, they were like Abelard and Heloise.
Tristan and Isolde.
Pyramus and Thisbe.
- Chest films are back. - Thank you.
I need to look at these with Radiology. I'll be back.
Come with me.
Well, don't take too long. Love is fleeting.
He'll be in surgery for a while. You'll need to come back later.
Ah, that's fine, we got a bunch of other interviews
we need to do back at the station.
Oh, nice seeing you, again.
Here, you've been deprived.
(Jerry) 'Neela.'
Special delivery.
You know, I'm waiting on a call from chopper transport.
I'll be in the break room if you need me.
- What's this all about? - Hmm?
Oh, it's from Doris.
Oh, the malamute breeder?
I told you about her?
Lucky guess.
[paper rustling]
[beeps]
[Pete Yorn singing "Crystal Village"]

[ambulance sirens blaring]
[baby crying]
Dawn, can you redress my ankle in three
and make sure that my NPO girl is still NPO
before we ship her to surgery?
(Dawn) 'I got it.'
Excuse me.
Hey, Grady, I got, uh
your STD Buddhist to take the penicillin.
- Oh, thank God. - Hi.
Is-is Dr. Morris around?
Uh, are you a family member?
I'm John Carter.
Uh-huh?
Used to work here.
Oh. As what?
[chuckles]
Can you find him? Can you find Dr. Morris?
- He's around somewhere. - Carter?
You the one that got that nurse pregnant
and moved her up to Seattle?
No, that was somebody else.
Sorry, my mistake.
Elixir of love.
My Valentine's Day gift
to the daring among you.
It looks fecal.
It works.
As what? A love potion?
Puck had a magical mixture made
from a flower called "Love-in-Idleness"
and I've got my mushroom juice.
Correct me if I'm wrong but didn't that make
Titania fall in love with an ass?
We're all asses, aren't we?
It was a mistake.
'Right? I mean, that's what the play's about.'
It's about mistakes.
Perhaps..
...but without the mistake
there'd be no play, would there?
So, what now? Are you done with me?
Well, we found some abnormal nodules
that are concerning.
Concerning?
Did you consult a pulmonologist?
Yeah. Anyway--
- Did you order bronchoscopy? - What's that?
It's a test where they look into your lungs--
Thanks, I got this.
We can biopsy the nodules and see what we're dealing with.
(Zadro) '20 year old, heart rate in the 60's.'
Went unconscious and apneic in the rig.
Alright, find Morris. He should be down the hall.
(Carter) 'Hey, Zades!'
Finally, a familiar face.
Dr. Carter, how the hell you been?
Not too bad. How about you?
- Same old same old. - What happened to this guy?
'We were taking a statement on the brawl.'
He started looking bad.
How long you in town for?
Uh, it all depends.
On what?
A bunch of stuff, actually.
I wanna do it.
I appreciate that. I do.
I mean, it's-it's very sweet
but you need to think it through.
You've explained it all to me.
It's not like giving blood.
- It's your egg. - Aunt Cate--
You really should be--
Do you remember when I was 15
and I ran off with that guy?
The 25 year old bartender?
And I called you from that restaurant.
Uh, it was a bar.
My parents had no idea.
You and Uncle Russell were the only adults I could talk to.
You saved me.
I remember driving out there.
'Bringing you home. Cleaning you up.'
Getting you into bed.
That week I spent with you
sleeping in Daryl's room..
'He must have been about three.'
I was so sad then..
...and he was so sweet to me.
I would do anything for you.
We brought him in as a witness.
Flexes with painful stim, but that's about it.
It was only later he told us he got punched
in the face trying to break it up.
Tracy, what's the GCS?
- 1-1-35. - So what now?
- Tube. - Good. Do it.
Archie Morris, all grown up.
No way!
What are you doing here?
I have some business to take care of.
I'm gonna be in Chicago for a while.
That's great!
- Ready for the etomidate. - Pushing it now.
I was thinking about picking up some shifts while I'm here.
You're kidding. That'd be awesome.
This guy is a legend.
We kind of met outside.
- Suction. - Yeah.
Might get better alignment with a shoulder roll.
(Carter) 'So, who should I talk to about'
getting some temporary privileges?
That would be Catherine Banfield.
Our chief. She should be out there.
- I can see the cords. - Then go for it.
Looks like you followed my advice, Archie.
- How's that? - You set the tone.
I'm off to Bloomington, they're about to
cross-clamp the donor's aorta in 40 minutes.
Wow. Joanie in surgery yet?
No, she's still in Radiology
but she should be heading to the OR any minute.
Okay, well I'll try and catch her before she goes up.
What are you...what are you looking for?
Scopolomine patches.
Helicopters make me airsick.
- Really? - Mm-hmm.
You never told me that.
Well, planes are fine but
helicopters are so jiggly.
Well, that is good to know.
Tell me..
...how do you feel about boats?
What?
Have a safe flight.
Hyperventilate at a rate of 26.
- CT can take him now. - Alright, let's move.
- Left my backboard. - Hey, Zades.
You sure you got the story right on this guy?
- Yeah, why? - He's in pretty bad shape.
Not your average punch in the face.
Cops took a report. People saw it happen.
Good enough for me, maybe he hit his head
on something on the way down.
- Maybe. - How's he doing?
Not great. Minimally responsive.
We had to put a tube in to breathe for him.
Oh, no.
You know, he seems a lot sicker
than he should be from one hit.
- Something's not right here. - Yeah.
It seems like our uniformed guy got a little mixed up.
This didn't happen at the club.
'It happened at the station house.'
- It did? - 'Yeah.'
They brought the guy in for questioning.
Turns out my guys weren't watching him
as close as they should've been.
How so?
There was a drunk thug from Garfield in the holding cell
'with him. They had words and it turned ugly.'
- I see. - It's our fault.
We should've had better control of the situation.
Well, thanks for the update.
I better go check on him.
I'm gonna get you something to make your tummy feel better.
Alright?
I'm telling you, drink the juice.
Everybody's doing it.
Thanks, but to be honest
this really doesn't look potable.
Dr. Carter?
- Hey, Sam. How are you? - Hi. Good.
Hey, you should probably be back in bed.
Why? That's for sick people.
- When did you get here? - Back a little while ago.
It's like Bizarro ER.
Kind of the same, but every single thing is different.
Well, one thing never changes, the patients.
- Dr. Carter! - Hello.
- Wow. - Welcome back.
- Hey, how are you? - I didn't even see you come in.
No, I kind of snuck in.
- Hey, how's Kim? - She's good. She's great.
Actually, she's in Paris visiting her mom.
Oh, well, how long are you in town?
That, uh, is still kind of up in the air.
We're trying to figure all that out.
I'm still waiting on that file, Jerry.
Alright, Sam, our migraine lady's been parked
in this hallway since Tuesday.
Mary, shouldn't you be, uh, leaning against
a wall somewhere, smoking?
- Dr. Banfield. - Mmm?
- Meet John Carter. - Hello.
- I've heard a bit about you. - All good, I hope.
I would love a couple of minutes of your time
to talk to you about something.
Pump-flow failed on the L-VAD
while she was in Radiology.
- BP took a dive. - This is mom?
Pre-transplant, Neela's on the way to pick up the heart.
Uh, sorry, Jim. You'll have to catch me later.
It's...John.
Good, you guys are still here.
- Is he okay? - What did the scan show?
That's what I came to talk to you about.
You see these areas here?
Multiple cerebral contusions
as well as generalized brain edema.
- Is that really bad? - 'Yeah, it is.'
And the radiologist and I are a little confused about something.
- Hmm? What's that? - Well..
...the only way to get a picture like this
is from multiple blows to the head.
Multiple blows from different directions
probably from a blunt object.
You can tell that from an X-ray?
I don't know the details
but I do know this, this picture?
Doesn't match the history that I'm getting.
Dr. Morris, hey--
I mean, it wouldn't be
thefirst time something like this has happened.
What are you suggesting?
That whoever is telling you this story is lying.
The thing is, Dr. Morris..
...I'm the one telling you the story.
You don't understand, our patient is herniating--
(Archie) '50 of Mannitol.'
Yes. As soon as you can. Thank you.
- 'Can't hurt.' - Neurosurge is in the OR.
Yeah, what else is new?
- In another hospital. - What?
This guy just gave me an earful about
the national shortage of neurosurgeons.
Apparently, they've started double-covering
the Chicago hospitals.
Is that even legal?
Systolic's 214. Pulse down to 44.
Okay, did he say how long he'd be?
- A couple of hours, at least. - You're kidding.
(Sam) 'He's gonna die if we wait that long.'
(Archie) 'I know that!
'We don't have a surgeon.'
Alright, so? Let's do it.
No, no, no. We can't. We don't..
...we don't have the training or the authority to do--
Who cares? What are you gonna do?
Stand here and let the guy
herniate and die?
[beeping]
Sterile eights, a Bovie, and a ventriculostomy tray.
Whoa, whoa, are we gonna do a ventriculostomy in here?
- It's his only chance. - I'll go get the twist drill.
Ejection fraction only 18%.
L-VAD's definitely malfunctioning.
What does that mean?
The device that's supposed to help pump the blood--
- Stealing your twist drill. - 'Sats only 84.'
- Okay, another 80 of Lasix. - Why won't it work?
Don't you think the girl should wait outside?
- She can handle this. - Fix it.
- Can you fix it? - Lucy, come here.
Look at me.
I'm okay.
You don't have to worry.
- Systolic 49. - Mom.
Joanie, we gonna need to intubate.
- Guys, I found this in the ICU. - What is it?
In the event of an electrical failure
'the L-VAD is designed to use a hand pump.'
How do you know it's an electrical failure?
I don't.
But it's worth a shot.
Give it a minute.
- Good carotid. - 'Pulse ox is coming up.'
Dawn, mix a Milrinone infusion. I think this might hold us.
- Till we get to the OR. - You got it.
How long are you going to have to keep squeezing that thing?
Until she gets her new heart.
Which is gonna be any minute, Lucy.
So let's get your mom upstairs.
BP's 190 over 118.
- 'And..' - What are you doing?
(Archie) 'I'm through to the white matter.'
Oh, nothing, just drilling
into the brain.
- Good luck with that. - 'Catheter.'
(Tracy) 'Bradying down to the 30s.'
Aim it toward the medial canthus of the--
Opposite eye, I know.
Everybody start praying.
How do you know you're not gonna hit a blood vessel?
- I don't. - 'Or a major structure?'
Like the pituitary?
I'm nowhere near the pituitary.
I don't think.
Does a brain feel more like Jell-O or like butter?
- Tracy, shut up. - I'm sorry.
I mean, I'm just nervous.
- Oh, my God. - 'Believe I am in.'
Is that CSF?
Yep, decompressed the ventricles.
Keep the ICP around 15.
Heart's up to 58 and climbing.
Recheck the blood pressure.
Tell ICU to make room.
Assertive...I like it.
Nice job, Archie.
You alright, man?
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.
Hey, Jerry, is Frank coming in today?
Uh, only if I call in sick.
No, he's not on till next week.
Some family thing in Cleveland.
Uh-oh. Love is in the air.
Did somebody actually drink that?
Oh, that chocolate soda?
- Pretty skunky. - 'No.'
The bogus fungus water.
What?
Are you sure you're okay?
Yeah, all good.
I'll wait for Dr. Banfield in the lounge.
Mm-hmm.
John.
Can I just tell you, you look great in those jeans?
Thanks.
I know, it feels like the end of the world today.
But you will be falling for someone else tomorrow.
Wow.
Where did you learn that? Parenting 101?
[door creaking]
Sorry. I can wait someplace else.
No, no, no. Actually, you saved me.
I'm gonna go get something from the Jumbo Mart.
Alex.
[sighs]
Well, there's another thing that's different.
That kid got like a foot taller.
I know and he's under the influence
of a bunch of fun hormones.
Well, don't let him drink whatever Jerry's drinking.
Forget it.
[tapping]
So, Sam..
...what did you hear from Abby and Luka?
She e-mailed me.
Sounds like it's, uh, going great.
Great for them.
[chuckling]
Sam, can you check the status of the transport team?
I wanna know the minute they get here.
Yep, I'll call the coordinator.
- Thank you. - It is good to see you.
It's good to see you.
So, you're a popular guy.
Worked here a long time.
Been away a long time.
But I am gonna be in Chicago sort of indefinitely and
I was kind of hoping to keep my skills up
and maybe help you out a little.
- Help us out? - Pick up a few shifts.
You don't have to pay me.
I work for food.
- You were an attending here? - Yeah.
'And what have you been doing since you left?'
Working in Africa. Darfur mostly, at an IDP camp there.
I spent some time in Indonesia after the tsunami.
Really?
So, now you're ready to come back
to the real world?
Uh, that felt pretty real to me out there.
But yeah, you could say that.
Having done the same thing, I know there's
a lot of re-learning required
and if you're not fully invested--
I don't know how long I'm gonna be in Chicago.
I don't know how many shifts I can pick up.
But I do know procedures, and I do know the patients
that come through those doors, and I know quite a bit
of your personnel.
And I know not to use the snack machine on 3
and I know how to get to the clinic
without ever going outside in winter.
And I know that the bottom right-hand drawer
of the admin desk sticks unless you brace it
with the bottom of your foot.
I wasted a lot of money in that snack machine.
Not anymore.
So, tell me, when did you first work here?
I was a med student in the ER in 1994.
- You knew Mark Greene, then. - Yeah.
I knew Mark Greene. Yep.
Learned a lot from him.
When can you start?
- Is he gonna be alright? - No.
But what you guys did down there, I thought--
Well, we probably saved his life
but there's no way to know if he'll ever wake up
be able to talk or understand anything.
You know. I can tell, you know.
- Know what? - Don't do that.
I can tell when something is bothering you.
It was like I froze.
I didn't know what to do.
When? What happened?
They took this guy into interrogation.
I stayed at the desk filling out some forms.
After a while, I go back there and there's three of them
tuning him up pretty good.
Three cops?
I see them through the window, so what do I do?
Go in there, tell them to give it a break?
Get somebody else involved? No.
I walk away, come back ten minutes later.
By then, he's moaning on the ground, crying for help.
Eventually, they let me call 911.
Did you tell Detective Mallory?
I didn't have to because he was in there with them.
Okay, you can't just bury this.
What am I supposed to do? I am the new guy.
- I follow orders. - Claudia..
I wouldn't even be there if he hadn't backed me up.
- You can't just let this go. - You don't get it, Archie.
- No, I think I do. - These things happen sometimes.
I just gotta know how to deal with it.
You mean ignore it.
There's a code on the job.
You don't turn on one of your own.
That's something you never come back from.
We walk in and there are about 20 surgeons
in the room, all picking up organs for other recipients.
Dr. Robbins steps up, takes a scalpel--
- 'Dr. Robbins?' - The transplant attending.
She whips out the heart like it's no big deal
holds it up, inspects it for a minute
and then says to the room, "Looks good. Thanks."
30 seconds later, we're back up in the air
like a band of superheroes.
Well, you kind of are.
I don't know if I could do
transplant surgeries full-time
but there's this kind of high, a rush.
Robbins wants your butt in here.
Okay, coming. You off shift now?
Yeah, uh, but I'll wait
with Lucy until you're done.
(Robbins) 'Adson with teeth.'
Dr. Rasgotra, you're missing all the fun.
- Yeah, I'm sorry-- - SVC, IVC are done.
- Saved the aorta for you. - Wow, are you sure?
'My eight-year-old could do it.'
Most important thing is to cut
the great vessels as close to the heart as you can.
'That way, we have tissue to work with'
when we're sewing in the new one.
Okay. Scissors.
- Ready? - Less talk, more action.
Okay, uh..
...the aorta is...divided.
- Take it out. - The heart?
No, the kidney.
Yes, doctor, the big dead organ
'you just disconnected from circulation.'
It's Bloomington. They wanna talk to a doctor.
Tell them it's going fine.
Pick it up with the clamp and pull.
Dr. Robbins, they need to speak with you.
Voila.
They say we need to stop the transplant.
There's been a mistake.
(Cate) 'Go ahead and discharge'
'but make sure you do phone follow-up.'
'Alright, gotta go.'
Thanks.
- 'Lucy.' - Are you done?
No.
Is the new heart in yet?
What's going on?
I, um..
Do you know what a blood type is?
Sort of.
Your mom is a type O
'which means she can only get a heart from another O.'
There was a mistake at the Bloomington Hospital.
'The donor's blood type was mislabeled.'
'She's an A.'
If we had put that heart in your mom
she would have died.
Fortunately, they found out before...it was too late.
Your mom will get a new heart, Lucy.
So, what now, we, uh..
...we re-implant the L-VAD, and then we wait?
(Neela) 'Well, the thing is..'
The thing is we didn't learn of the mistake
until we had already taken out the old heart.
'Your mom is on a cardiac bypass machine.'
She needs to stay on it until we find her a new heart.
She can't talk?
No, but she'll know you're there.
[sniffles]
Any changes?
Well, his intracranial pressure's
still spiking. It's not a good sign.
As I'm sure you're both aware
I'm required by law to report this.
Report what?
'Well, whenever the history doesn't'
'match the physical injury'
we need to follow certain protocols.
- 'You know the drill.' - I don't think I do.
I've sent the scalp lavage fluid to the lab
where pathologists will look for substances.
Fibers that could perhaps help fill in the blanks.
You know, standard procedure.
I see.
And of course, I'll need to notify the state authorities.
Start an official investigation.
[sighs]
What do you think you're doing, Doctor?
My job.
You see that game last night?
The Bulls were really, uh..
...shooting from outside the paint.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Me either, basketball banter.
Just trying to approximate guy talk.
Well, thanks for trying.
Women. Can't live with 'em. Can't shoot 'em.
Look, I'm no expert, but I've learned one thing.
It's...get your heart stomped on
it's best to take all that energy
and channel it into something positive.
Hi, Lucy.
Your foster dad's not here yet?
It's okay.
I want to say goodnight to my mom before I go.
Well, she should be settled upstairs soon.
[sighs]
I always knew she wasn't my mom.
I found a picture of another lady in a hospital bed
holding me when I was a baby.
So I figured it out.
You're a very smart little girl.
It never bothered me.
Because she always loved me so much
and made me feel so happy.
And I knew that that's what a real mother did
'Even if she's not your real mom.'
Mr. Lempel, what are you doing?
If we hold the ceremony in the next hour
we'll beat sunset.
You can't leave now.
- Why, am I dying? - No, you're not dying.
Fantastic.
Stupendous.
All the more reason to start celebrating.
(Gates) 'But your bronchoscopy showed'
a hypersensitivity pneumonitis.
It's an immune reaction to fungal spores.
- Mushroom worker's lung. - You've heard of it?
Well, of course. I've heard of it.
Pleurotus cornucopiae is a likely culprit.
I knew it was just a matter of time.
Gentleman, lady.
Thank you very much.
This place is..
...nowhere near as bad as its reputation.
Wait, you need to stay and be treated.
- Nah. - What do you mean, "nah"?
Well, I don't know why you need me to tell you this
but the only definitive treatment for
Mushroom Worker's Lung is to stay away from mushrooms.
That, my friends, is not an option.
You'd rather have lung disease than stay away from mushrooms?
If mushrooms be the food of love...play on.
* If we shadows have offended *
* Say but this that all is mended **
- What was that? - Sorry?
Why'd you pull that stunt up there?
Put the squeeze on him like that?
To see that the right thing happens.
I was gonna tell him myself, handle it my own way.
Well, it didn't seem like that.
What? Now you wanna judge me?
- I'm trying to help. - Well, stop!
Last thing I need is them knowing I opened up my mouth.
Just the two I was looking for.
Dr. Morris, it turns out
there was an incident that some of the guys
didn't feel they wanted to be upfront about.
It's being dealt with now.
- 'Dealt with?' - 'Mm-hmm.'
'The officers involved will be disciplined'
'maybe even prosecuted. We can't abide that kind of infraction.'
Can we, Detective Diaz?
No, sir.
'I appreciate your help.'
We'll make sure to get you a report so that
your records can accurately reflect the cause of injury.
Okay. Thank you.
[buzzing]
So, you got any shifts you want me to work?
Banfield said yes?
Took a little persuading.
Ah, she's no pushover.
- I'll be around. - That's great, man.
You seem good.
(Tracy) 'Thanks for showing me how to tube the effusion.'
Oh, no problem, check a film in an hour
and call me if the fluid re-accumulates.
Grasshopper, the student has become the teacher.
I heard you were lurking about.
- How have you been? - Oh, I've had better days.
I hear the Carter Center's finally opening.
Yes, had a few setbacks
but official opening in a few weeks.
Congratulations. You and Kim must be so proud.
Yeah. So, I'll be around.
I'll buy you a cup of coffee
and tell you tales of Africa.
I look forward to hearing them.
From Dr. Brenner. John!
John!
Call me.
[Earlimart singing "Town Where You Belong"]
* No you don't remember *
* The town where you were born *
* 'Cause they never no no never *
* Opened up the doors *
* In a dream that you were dreaming *
* They'll open them for sure *
* It's the town you don't remember *
* The town where you were born *
* Well you wiped out all your footsteps *
* And you wiped out all your foes *
* For the comfort and the safety *
* That comes when you're alone *
*It's the town you don't remember *
* The town where you were born *
* It's the town that you are leaving *
* The town where you belong *
* Heaven knows the reason *
* Heaven knows for sure **
Uh, what the hell are you doing?
It's freezing out here.
Buono sera, mio dolce cretina.
No, uh.. I'm sorry.
I think I just called you a sweet idiot.
Simon, what are we doing here?
This is the closest that we've gotta a canal for now.
But I am determined..
...so determined, to do better.
- What's this? - Well, that's an IOU.
We take a week off in April
and spring, as you know
is...the perfect time to visit Venice.
You wanna go to Venice?
Yeah. With you.
[sniffling]
Grappa?
Okay.
Alright, I think this qualifies as a romantic gesture.
This? No, this is nothing.
This is just the beginning.
