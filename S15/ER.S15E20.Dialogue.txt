(female narrator) Previously on"ER.."
[gunfire]
I told you to get a desk job.
Bastard shot me in the back.
Lucien, I've withdrawn my application.
'I'm not staying at County.'
Talking about every stupid damn thing that-that bothers me? No!
No!
You know, I truly believe
there's something better out there for both of us.
Better?
Something more right.
[thunder rumbling]
- So. - So.
- Listen-- - I'm sorry.
- I really didn't-- - I'm sorry things got so weird.
I know I kind of sprung things on...you.
Okay...you go first.
[sighs]
I know I've been somewhat closed off about all of this
but I was afraid that if I discussed it with you
you'd convince me to stay.
Well, I certainly would have tried.
But, you know what? It's a good thing you're going.
- It is? - Yep.
Adjusting to a new environment, a new way of doing things
you will gain so much confidence from that.
Oh, but I hope so.
And then when you're sick
of your third-rate community trauma center--
Oh, now it's third-rate? Demoted from b-list.
You will always, always, always have a job here.
- Really? - Yeah.
Six month, six years, I don't know.
I'm not sure, but you will be back.
County is in your blood.
And until then, my friend, good luck.
Get out of here.
[sighs]
Lucien, I don't know if I can do this without you.
Of course you can.
You'll see.
You'll see.
Now, go. Get out of here, please.
Go. Please.
[sighs]
The MRI is gonna tell us if there's blood in his brain.
That's the hard part.
And if there is, then what?
Brain surgery?
Possibly.
Jay, I-I know how much you need to talk to him.
Okay, I'm gonna do everything, that I can, to make that happen.
Oh, no. He has to wake up.
(Jay) 'Dr. Brenner? Dr. Brenner? '
(woman on PA) 'Your attention please, the change of gate announcement'
'for flight J-R-2-3-0-9. This flight has now been cancelled.'
Hey, where you been? Frank really outdid himself.
Oh, yeah? I took Mr. Walters up to the MRI suite.
They're going to try and squeeze him in.
- What? - Nothing.
If it does turn out to be an aneurysm
they can embolize it if it's caught early.
You don't think Neela noticed that you weren't there?
I meant to go, but I was dealing with this neuro--
You couldn't find five minutes to stop by?
Gates, I'm signing out to Morris for a while.
It's me. I'm at the airport.
I could really use some of your sage wisdom right now.
Can you call me, when you get this.
Thanks. Bye.
- What can I get you? - Glenfiddich straight, please.
'Need some warming up, do we?'
Off to someplace sunny?
Yes, actually.
'Beach vacation?'
'Business trip?'
Sort of.
Sort of?
It's a new job. I'm moving.
Really? What do you do?
- I, uh-- - 'Neela?'
I couldn't let you go like this.
[theme music]
- What are you drinking? - Uh, what do you got on tap?
No, uh, forget that.
I'll have soda water with a..
...with a lime. Thanks.
Oh, thank God for the storm
or you'd be somewhere over Missouri by now.
Geography's pretty good for a foreigner.
Look, I, um, I just..
...I thought that if I didn't catch you now
then maybe we'd never speak again.
Today's been strange and difficult.
Yeah. Yeah, I know.
For me, too.
Oh, and don't mutter in Spanish when you're angry.
It's a cliche.
I understand a lot more than you think I understand.
Fine! You win. I'll stay home with my hair in curlers
spending my days knitting and baking.
You know that that's not what I'm talking about.
No, no, honey, what would you like? Apple pie or cherry?
Come on! If you just listen to what I'm actually saying--
Give it up, Archie. This conversation is over.
Well, well, okay! Have a great day!
And, and please accept my sincere apology
for giving a rat's ass!
- Everything okay? - Everything's fine.
What've we got?
Uh, one storey fall with LOC. That's all I know.
What the hell is that?
Uh, it's a little something for Neela. It's her last day.
A pinata? What is she five?
It's not just any pinata. I-I had this custom-made.
It's a Gandhi pinata.
That is scary.
Ha-ha not to mention offensive.
Yeah, who's gonna want to bash Gandhi's head in with a bat?
You have no sense of culture.
Gary Walters, 53.
Fell head first down a flight of stairs after a few too many.
'I slipped on the rug.'
Observed LOC, awake at the scene, but disoriented.
Mr. Walters, do you know what day it is?
I told you, I slipped on the rug.
Okay, Gates, what do you want?
Uh, head CT, C-spine, trauma labs
tox screen, and an ETOH level.
- I'm on it. - Good.
And, uh, get him to surgery
they're gonna need to see him.
Neela's already on the floor.
She's clotting, how's the CBC?
- First one was good. - The tides have changed.
- Send the repeat now. - Does anything hurt you, ma'am?
Gravity is the horse's force.
(Neela) Do you remember what happened today?
'Nobody'll listen.'
She drove her motorcycle into the museum
of science and industry, warning people
about the end of the world.
- Psych history? - Yeah, so it seems.
I'll check and see if she has a record here.
- 'Equilibrium is shifting.' - Oh, for you, too?
I thought that was just me on account
of it being my last day here.
It's Claudia's first day back at work.
- 'Good for her.' - Is it?
I mean, I'm not sure it is.
LFTs and lipase are normal.
I think, ma'am, you might be my last surgical case.
I thought I was okay with it. You know, I really did.
It's her job and I respect that.
But she got shot.
Now why couldn't I fall for a nice librarian or something?
You know, a librarian in Springfield died last month.
'Bookshelf fell on her.'
I swear, it's in the paper.
Guys, we need a surgeon in here.
Andrew, check the tox screen and let Dubenko know
we've got a possible laparotomy.
- What have you got? - 53-year-old male.
Fell down a staircase.
Multiple contusions to head, hip and back.
32 French and draw up some Lido.
Decreased on the left with SATs in the 80's.
Hello, I'm Dr. Rasgotra. Do you remember falling?
I was dizzy. I guess I tripped.
Smells like ETOH was involved.
Belly's benign, but I figured you'd want to sign off.
Oh, happy to help.
(female #1) 'Oh, thank God.'
- I'm fine. - You're not fine!
Just a few scrapes. And this headache won't go away.
Alright, little pinch here.
What are you doing?
Well, he may have broken a rib
when he fell, punctured a lung.
- The tube will inflate it. - When is this gonna stop?
- It's not even 10:00 a.m. - Hey, mom, don't start.
I woke up this morning with a headache.
It's called a hangover.
I just needed a little something for the pain.
He's a drunk, huh, but you've probably
figured that out by now.
Come on. Let the doctors work.
Two people ahead of us for CT.
Type and cross and let me know
when the scan is back, please.
Excuse, sorry, uh, my mother's
been through some messy stuff.
No worries.
(Neela) We all have messes in our past.
I shouldn't have been so hard on you
it wasn't the best way to end things, really.
You were right.
I was righteous. Which isn't my best quality, honestly.
For my whole adult life, I've been doing..
...exactly what you said.
I'm not sure what you mean.
Disappearing.
Using sex as an escape.
Or worse, as a weapon, a way of disarming people.
' Look at you two.'
So sweet. Like nobody else is in the room.
You want another round?
- Uh...sure. - Yeah.
I'm in. O-silk, Elastoplast.
I'll get the thoroseal.
Hey, guys, look.
Irregular rhythm, looks like A-fib.
Nice pickup.
Do you have a history of atrial fibrillation?
He didn't tell you? You didn't tell them?
I don't know. I forgot.
Forgot? That's a load of crap.
It's okay.
What meds is he on?
Uh, calcium blockers
and-and some other pill to thin his blood.
Coumadin.
He's bad about taking his meds.
He drinks. He forgets.
Or at least that's what he says.
But really, it's a death wish.
He thinks if he doesn't take his pills
he'll figure out a way to disappear.
Don't talk about me like I'm not here.
Today, of all days, you couldn't control yourself?
What's so special about today?
- It's been ten years-- - Oh, here we go.
He has this pathetic need to tell everyone.
Mom, please.
Um, today is the anniversary of their son's death
so everyone's a bit...tense.
My dad blames himself.
I let Timmy go.
I'll be outside.
'Mom.'
Sam, add an INR and rush the head scan, please.
I keep thinking it's gonna get easier...doesn't.
(Neela) 'Hey, we've got a staircase fall in one'
with a pneumo and a headache
and motorcycle crash in two with a seat belt sign.
Okay, sounds good. Who do you want me to see first?
Well, motorcycle girl looks like she might
need the OR, and you know what?
- What? - This'll be case number 2,500.
- 2,500? No way. - Yeah, can you believe it?
I have logged 2,499 surgeries since internship.
Well, that's impressive.
- Serial crits? - Not back yet.
Ah, surgeons perfect timing. I have a question for you.
- How is she doing? - FAST is negative. CBC's good.
Hi, I'm Dr. Dubenko.
- Reckoning is here! - Okay.
Uh, why are eschatological delusions
so common among psychotic patients?
- Escha what? - Eschatology.
Pertaining to the end of the world.
I checked the records. No psych hospitalizations at county.
Oh, she definitely doesn't look familiar.
There's no hiding from the fifth cycle.
Okay. Sweet dreams, my dear.
So, your girlfriend gets shot on the job.
- Uh-huh. - Okay.
And seeing that you care about her
and want her to I don't know, not die.
You gently suggest that she might do another job.
- Is that sexist? - No.
- Yes. - No.
- Yeah. - No, no.
- Tomato, tomahto. - What?
Rigid abdomen, probably needs the OR.
Andrew, you can scrub in on this.
Awesome. She's seizing.
- Look out. - I see that.
- Two of Ativan. - Crank up the O2.
Haldol lowers the seizure threshold.
Call me when she's ready for the scanner.
I'll swing by and take a look. Andrew, let's go.
Do you want me to stay back and cover the ER?
No, forget about the ER. Meet us upstairs.
You've got to log case number 2,500.
What's with him?
(Neela) Denial. Avoidance.
Fear.
There's so many things I've missed out on
'cause I was afraid.
Well, you're obviously not afraid
to fly in really bad weather.
[chuckles]
You know, when I was six, my, um..
...aunt took me to a toy store and gave me five pounds
and said I could buy anything I wanted.
I wandered around the store for what seemed like hours
terrified that I'd choose the wrong thing.
Wrong doll my sister would laugh.
Wrong book, my brothers would take it.
Wrong teddy, the kids at school would think I was a baby.
I left the store with nothing.
My father put the money in the bank.
- Sensible kid. - Well, the point is..
...is that, for as long as I can remember
I've carried this irrational dread of making a mistake.
It's with me all the time.
And-and why on earth
I decided to become a doctor
where the cost of a mistake is so high, it's insane.
- Yeah, it's masochistic. - I know.
This is all my way of saying I, I know I helped screw things up.
I'm not following.
Well, just..
[sighs] ...so many times in my life, I've
I've failed to take a chance.
Even when it was clear to everyone else
including me, that I should have.
That's why I got to go
I, you know, even if it's..
...scares the hell out of me. I just don't want to be
that person anymore, you know.
Me, either.
Don't worry, Neela.
I'm not here to try and convince you to stay.
Then why are you here?
I really-really don't know.
[chuckles]
You know, how did you get past security?
Don't you have to have a ticket?
You bought a ticket.
So, you got any, um, good ideas
of things to do in Detroit?
Detroit?
Yeah, well, it was the only way.
It just seemed wrong.
Just seemed terribly wrong
to let you go and not even say goodbye.
Do you want to take a walk?
Head looks good, Mr. Walters, no bleeding.
Yeah.
You didn't need to stay for this.
I know. I wanted to.
Jay was my boy's best friend.
He pulled Tim out of the water.
Did CPR for an hour
'till the Coast Guard got there.'
Let's not go there, okay?
After the funeral
everyone got on with their lives.
But Jay came by every day just to check on us.
That was just an excuse to flirt with your daughter.
Well, looks like it worked.
I've been married three years now.
I lost Tim.
'But you became like a son to me.'
Alright, alright.
At least you're affectionate when you're drunk.
(Lucien) 'What, are you guys having a party in here?'
'We need the scanner.'
Hello, mister..
Walters.
How are you feeling?
My head's killing me.
But the, uh, CT is clear.
No bleed, no edema?
- Who is that? - Uh, the other case.
Staircase fall.
Uh, did you think of tapping him?
Uh, tap him? Why?
Well, I don't want to miss a subarachnoid bleed.
Could be the cause of his symptoms and not show up on CT.
Well, that-that's pretty rare.
Extremely rare.
I know, but the cause of his dizziness
the headache before the fall--
Well, he was drinking.
Well, his ETOH level wasn't all that high
not for chronic alcoholic.
We don't tap all our negative CTs.
Well, if it was up to me, we would.
Let's not risk missing something we could fix.
You on board with this?
Me? I-I trust her instincts.
She's going to be her own boss starting tomorrow, so..
'Don't have much leverage, really.'
The ad said, snake charmer.
I brought Tarantulas, too
if you think she'd prefer that.
No, I was thinking of a-a turban and a flute
and a-a snake in a basket.
Not this S and M get up.
People dig the outfit.
It won't work.
Go.
Here.
For your trouble.
What was that?
Ah, you know, when Neela first got here
we kind of got off on the wrong foot.
I said some things I shouldn't have said
about her ethnic background and..
Oh, Frank, come on. That was six years ago.
I'm sure she's over it.
Well, I would just like to show her
how much I have changed.
Why don't you try something simple, like flowers?
- Flowers? - Yeah.
Well, that's not even remotely original or cultural.
Just because her parents were born in India
doesn't mean she's going to appreciate
some kind of Indian cliche.
In fact, she may very well find it offensive.
What?
She's English, Frank.
Okay, so a Gandhi pinata
or a turbaned snake charmer
is gonna end up working against you here.
Well, thank you, Sam.
I'll take that under advisement.
No free fluid.
- Aorta's intact. - And the IVC.
- Kidneys look functional. - As do the ureters.
I know how to read an abdominal scan.
- Of course you do. - What's going on?
Make sure the head's clear. I'll meet you in the OR.
The OR? But the scan's perfect.
She's got a rigid abdomen. It's surgical.
Doesn't matter what the scan says.
Her vitals are good. Her counts are unchanged.
Why not watch her in the ICU
'move her at the first sign of instability?'
Because, by then, she'll be unstable.
Lucien, you--
Small bowel perforation, mesenteric injury.
Let's not risk missing something we can fix. Right?
Meet you in the OR in ten.
Sometimes there can be a head bleed which we can't see on CT.
A more sensitive test
is to place a small needle into the spinal canal
and remove some fluid.
If the lab finds red blood cells
then we know there's a problem.
What are the risks?
Infection and bleeding are the main ones, but we'll
we'll take precautions to avoid both.
What do you think, Jay?
Alright, you know what, fluoro's here so we should step out.
Hang in there, dad.
Dr. Brenner, no disrespect but, uh..
This is stupid.
Look, his mental status is getting worse.
We don't have a good explanation.
Subarachnoid bleed is a reasonable theory.
Except for the fact that he's on Coumadin
which means the chance of creating
bleeding complications is much higher
than even finding a problem.
His INR is less than two.
Clearly, there is something subtle
that led Neela to ask for this.
Yeah, it's her last day. She doesn't want to make a mistake.
But she'll feel just as bad
if the procedure leads to an uncontrollable spinal bleed.
Got your LP kit.
I'm not gonna do it.
We'll use fluoro, give FFP.
It will be fine.
You will be there to assist.
(Neela) 'Maybe we can go in laproscopically'
have a quick look.
We'll be doing it open.
Her recovery time would be so much easier.
I'm aware of the advantages of laparoscopy.
Well, serial ultrasounds are fine.
Normal CT, vitals are good. Crit is stable.
You're the one who wanted to log 2,500 surgeries.
Don't rush a patient's surgery because you're mad at me.
I'm not mad at you.
I'm amused by your narcissism
but the patient has a surgical abdomen, okay?
I suggest, perhaps, that it is your judgment
that's been clouded by the significance of the day.
Lucien, please.
Why don't you just say what you need to say?
I don't need to say anything.
You know, one minute, you're strange and loopy.
The next, you're gritting your teeth.
Look, it isn't personal.
Maybe you can just wish me luck.
I'd like to, but I can't.
What? I can't accept the fact
that you've accepted a job at an academically
and clinically inferior institution just to spite me.
Oh, now who's being a narcissist?
(Andrew) Patient is prepped. Ancef is running.
I can't wish you luck because I want you to hate it.
You're unbelievable.
I haven't spent all these years
helping you to become this incredible talent
just so you could move away to a second-rate city
and work at a B-list institution.
- '10-blade to Dr. Wade.' - Sweet.
It's not B-list. You're being a snob.
You know you're better than that place.
They have a busy trauma service
and a catchment area that extends over half a state.
Come on. No medical school, no research.
Which allows me to have my time
in the OR instead of a lab.
Why can't you respect that?
I'd just imagined something better for you.
No, it's not what you imagined for you.
Which is fine, but it's my life.
You know, if I stay here, I'll always be your protegee.
'Little Neela.'
It's time to move on.
What the hell are you doing? You just contaminated yourself.
Hyperpigmentation.
- Starting the incision. - Andrew, wait, stop.
Go and run and get the Wood's lamp.
- Why? - Just get it! Go now!
- Bingo. - Wow.
- 'Hey, what the hell?' - 'Call Heme.'
- They'll need to admit her. - Heme?
This woman doesn't have an internal bleed.
- She has acute porphyria. - What?
Disorder of the heme synthesis pathway.
Rigid abdomen, hyperpigmentation on the extremities
psychosis, seizures, it all fits.
Yeah, she's the right age for first presentation.
Okay, reverse the anesthesia.
'She doesn't need surgery.'
I guess..
2,499 will have to be enough.
That's a big needle.
Yeah, well, if we've done our job right he won't feel a thing.
You do a lot for their family.
I've no choice. I married into it.
Yeah, Lily's worth it, though.
(Simon) 'That's better. I'm in.'
I don't feel right.
Hold on. Almost done.
- Gary, you okay? - Take the needle out!
- I'm almost done. - Take the needle out, Brenner!
- He's bradying down! - Damn it! Another unit of FFP.
Mr. Walters? Mr. Walters!
- Alright, Jay, talk to him! - 'His heart rate is 48.'
- Wake up! Do you hear me! - Mig of atropine
- 'And transcutaneous pacers.' - 'Atropine in.'
Chase it with an amp of epi. I've lost the pulse.
Oh, my God, what's happening?
His heart is beating dangerously slow.
It could be a vagal reflex or something to do with
'what's going on in his brain.'
(Tony) 'Overdosed on calcium blockers?'
Good call. Let's get 500 of calcium gluconate.
Don't do this!
Atropine and let's sit up for a Doppler infusion.
- Alright, let's pace him. - 'It was a fight, okay?'
It was a stupid fight!
Increase the voltage. We need another set of hands in here!
I meant to tell you so many times it's not what you think.
- No capture. - Increase the volume.
Look, it's not what you think though. He slipped.
He slipped, and it was an accident!
Alright, quiet!
We got capture.
It's a strong carotid.
This is good.
I'm sorry.
I'll go let the family know he's okay.
Jay, what's going on?
(Brenner) I met a man today
who accidentally killed his best friend.
That's awful.
They were on the boat
and they got into a fight over a girl.
And the guy punched his friend
and he tripped and fell overboard.
And that-that was that.
They brought the friend to the ER?
This happened ten years ago.
The guy never told that family
the truth until today.
But for years, though..
Well, their lives just stopped.
- It's sad. - Yeah.
Thank you for helping me see that I was stuck, too.
You know, I'm the last person who should be telling..
Neela, look, you were right.
I can't love anyone until I sort some stuff out.
But maybe because of you, I've started to do that.
Simon..
This is why I came here.
Neela, this really..
God, this mattered so much to me.
Thank you.
[dramatic music]
Thank you for saying that.
You know, it's going to be so weird
not to see you all every day.
Frank, the soft collar ever come down from Central?
- Yes. - Were you going to tell me?
Or keep me waiting?
I forgot. So, shoot me!
Don't tempt me. Could you get it, please?
- No. - 'No?'
Oh, I'm gonna miss this.
Neela? Morris has a complicated hand lac
'he wants you to look at.'
Okay, well, might be my last consult.
(Samantha) 'Curtain three.'
Dr. Rasgotra? Can you lay hands on my rule-out appy?
Page Andrew. I have a plane to catch.
Alright, cool.
(Neela) 'Wow, what happened here?'
Oh, Dr. Rasgotra, This is Ed McDow.
And this is what happens when a tug-of-war gets out of hand.
Get it? Out of hand?
'Company picnic.'
The winning team gets the closed parking for a year.
Wow.
Rope was wrapped around my hand so tight it went numb.
I didn't even feel it cutting through the skin.
Well, you're lucky because it almost took the whole thing off.
I was so focused on the game, you know.
I just couldn't let go.
I was going to have Ortho do it
but the edges approximate nicely
and there's no neurovascular damage so thought I would.. Ow!
- Did it go through the glove? - Uh, yes.
Damn it.
I'm sorry.
It's not your fault, really.
I'll be right back.
You know what? You need to, uh, irrigate that
and go see Employee Health to make a report.
A large bore needle is a very low risk.
I know.
But you still need to check for hepatitis
and HIV serologies on that guy.
I know! Hey, what's going on today?
A PCP vigilante chucks a mayo stand at my head.
A seven-year-old Republican bit me
while I was irrigating his lac
and now this..
Oh, my God.
- I am an ass. - I'm not following.
Dr. Rasgotra, come with me, please.
Frank, I can't. I'm gonna be late.
It's important, I swear.
Frank, I'm be late for the plane..
Surprise!
[instrumental music]
[laughing]
[cheering]
It's amazing!
Frank did it all.
- 'Wow!' - Thank you.
Admit it, you thought we forgot.
No.
- Or didn't care? - Well, maybe.
How could you think that?
Nobody stands up to our bonehead attendings like you do.
Who's going to get all the tough central lines?
Or chew out the lazy radiology residents?
Or teach me how to do, like, everything?
To Neela!
(in unison) Neela!
Haleh?
I think this is what you were looking for.
I didn't know if this wall really existed
or if it was just a rumor.
I knew this day would come.
- But so soon? - Stop it, Haleh.
You'll make me cry.
[dramatic music]
(Neela) Excuse me. Can you help me, sir?
You need to find a triage nurse.
- No, I'm sorry, I work here. - Lucky you.
Uh, I'm supposed to start today.
Neela Rasgotra.
Rag what?
[dramatic music]
(Lucien) You're a really good surgeon, Neela.
A few more years and you could be great.
Thank you.
(Abby) I was wondering you, If you didn't mind too much
do you think you could lead the way
and stand up there with me when we do this?
Do you mean, uh..
Like, be your maid of honor?
I'd be honored.
[dramatic music]
(Michael) But out in the bay this morning, I was, uh..
I was thinking about asking you out.
I was thinking of saying yes.
(Gregory) 32-year-old mother of two.
With a rare blood disorder.
Still alive tonight.
[dramatic music]
(Jay) 'Dr. Brenner.'
'Dr. Brenner!'
[dramatic music]
[phone ringing]
Oh, God.
Thank God, it's you.
Please tell me, I'm not making a horrible mistake.
Of course you're not making a mistake.
But how does one know?
How-how does one ever know?
[sighs] You're doing that thing you do.
What thing?
That existential crisis spin-out thing
that never leads you anywhere.
Hey, maybe you should have a drink.
I've had three.
Oops. Ooh, ooh.
Hey, slow down everybody. Slow down!
Thursday's my day to do this childcare swap thing.
I hate, Thursdays.
Abby..
You'd tell me if you thought, I was making a mistake, right?
I would.
Promise?
Neela, if this doesn't make sense, I don't know what does.
Now, just, get off the phone and get on the damn plane.
Okay.
I'm hanging up now.
Okay.
- You still there? - Yes.
I'm getting on the plane.
Good idea.
'Bye.'
[sighs]
(man on PA) 'Ladies and gentlemen, tower's telling us'
'it'll be at least an hour'
'before they clear us for take off.'
'We apologize for the delay..'
'We'll keep you advised.'
[buzzing]
Hey, Sam, um..
What happened to our staircase guy?
OP came back positive for blood
right as they were signing him into the MRA.
Tony is upstairs with them in angio.
Okay. Thanks.
Hey, Dr. Brenner, have you seen Archie around?
- Uh.. - I'm here.
What is going on?
Come with me.
I stuck myself with a needle today.
And it made me realize that I was an ass, this morning.
About your work thing.
An ass.
I get it, Archie.
What's with the pie?
A symbol, of my temporary chauvinism
and a gesture of apology.
My original idea was to..
Bake you a pie wearing nothing but an apron, but, uh.
I had to work late, and I don't own an apron.
Me either.
See? We're perfect.
So, if you can handle being with a guy
that gets stuck by needles and kicked by patients and..
...takes an occasional slug of radiation to his cojones.
[laughing]
What are you talking about?
Well, then I can certainly stomach some occasional gunfire.
Hmm.
As long as your promise not to get shot again.
Yo hare todo lo me posible, Archie Morris.
What?
See, I just wanted to see how much Spanish
you really understand.
[chuckles]
See that?
Yeah, I think so.
Ten millimeter aneurysm at the tip of basilar junction.
Headache he had this morning was probably the initial leak.
No, leak was tiny.
No way it would show up on a CT.
More contrast, please.
By all rights, this thing should've been missed.
- Nice work. - Neela was right.
(Matthew) 'We use electrolytically detachable coils'
'to fill the lumen.'
- 'Cool.' - Clot forms around the coils.
Blocking off the aneurysm.
(Matthew) 'Leaving the vessel open.'
Down to neck racial..
[beeping]
Damn it! Stop the Heparin.
- 'Stop!' - What's happening?
Coil went beyond the confounds of the road map.
You mean you ruptured the aneurysm?
Looks that way. Contrast!
What? Doesn't he need the OR now?
Not necessarily, If the bleeding stops.
We can potentially continue with softer coil.
I'm not waiting around to test that theory.
(Tony) Heart rate's down again.
This is Dr. Brenner from the ER.
I need an OR and a neuro-surgeon
for an acute cerebral hemorrhage.
Excuse me, doctor, I believe that's my call to make.
Get the portable monitor, get this out of the way.
- Out of the way! - Systolic's only 62.
That's good. That's good. It'll limit the bleeding.
And deprive the brain of oxygen!
- 'What're you doing?' - I'm taking care of my patient.
- Get the thermostat covered. - 'This is totally out of line.'
Maybe.
I'm gonna write you guys up!
[airplane droning]
Hey.
You're still here?
Yeah, I crashed in the call room for a bit.
The, um, the surgeons were able to clip the aneurysm quickly so
the bleeding was contained to a very small area.
Is he gonna have brain damage?
He's got a very good chance of doing well.
But we won't know the answer to that for a while.
[sighs]
Where's your wife?
She went home for a shower.
I don't know what she's gonna do now.
About us.
You two will work through it.
Easy for you to say.
The truth is a time bomb.
'But once it's out, it can't hurt you anymore.'
You can move on, You can move forward.
Get some rest, Jay.
I'll, um..
I'll drop by later.
Thanks.
I appreciate that.
(man on radio) 'Bill to crack down on laboratory experiments'
'on animals is expected to become law today.'
'Animals rights activist have been pushing for the bill'
'over nine years..'
[indistinct radio chatter]
How're you doing?
Fine. You?
Sure. Fine.
Ah, Andrew, what do you think of the patient's tachycardia?
Uh, probably volume-related
but could be due to fever, pain, infection.
Mm-hmm, good. More?
Uh, drug withdrawal, toxins, vascular.
More?
Uh, trauma..
Iatrogenic.
Neela never taught you vindicate?
- No. - 'It's my favorite mnemonic.'
For post-op rounds. Excuse us, Dr. Brenner.
If you run through this on all your post-ops
you will never miss a major complication, okay?
- Mm-hmm. - V is for?
(Andrew) 'Vascular.'
(Lucien) 'I is for?'
Um, infection? Inflammation?
(Lucien) 'Don't ask me. Tell me, okay?'
'And I love the fact that you knew the meaning..'
[dramatic music]
[upbeat music]
[dramatic music]
You can come in now.
What happened to you?
Um..
I'm sorry.
I've been up all night.
I see.
So, how was your week?
[sighs]
[dramatic music]
[music continues]
Can you excuse me for a second?
Thanks.
Finally.
You're really here.
Yeah.
I really am.
