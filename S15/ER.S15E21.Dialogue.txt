(female narrator) Previously, on "ER.."
I'll be with you in a second!
I found a baby. I think it's dying.
I'm gonna need to appoint someone
from the hospital staff
to be his protective custodian
while he's in here.
You up for it?
So many times in my life
I've-I've failed to take a chance.
Don't worry, Neela, I'm not here
to try and convince you to stay.
If you can handle being with a guy
who gets stuck by needles
and kicked by patients and..
...takes an occasional slug
of radiation to his cajones..
...well, then, I can certainly stomach
some occasional gunfire.
I got a meeting at 9:00.
Maybe the weekend would be better.
Well, he's getting discharged tomorrow.
You're about to start a shift.
I can get someone to cover.
Look, it's okay to be nervous.
We don't know anything about this baby.
Most times, you don't.
He seems pretty perfect right now.
I'd rather do this when we can spend
some real time with him.
Well, let's just start with five minutes
and take it from there.
- Good morning. - Yes, it is.
I will pick you up at 8:30.
- What should I wear? - Something fancy.
- I hate surprises. - Okay, okay.
It involves fine dining
and some other things.
- Archie! - It's going to be a big night.
Big night?
- Popping the question? - What, are you crazy?
We're still in the honeymoon phase.
A year from now, we could hate each other's guts.
And I thought romance was dead.
No, the big surprise
is I have been studying
an instructional DVD for two weeks.
Morris, what happens in your bedroom stays in your bedroom.
I'm taking her salsa dancing.
She's Puerto Rican, it's in her blood
and I have to work on it.
- Yes, you do. - Dr. Morris.
You should be dressed for work
before you start your shift.
No, no, I'm not on today.
I'm volunteering at Camp Del Corazon.
- Is that today? - Camp del what?
Yeah, it's a program for kids who have had open heart surgery.
Kids with heart disease running around?
Yeah, so we should get some business down here.
No, it's nothing too strenuous.
Arts and crafts, face-painting
maybe a little charades.
Excuse me, Cate. Ca-can we..
I-I'm gonna go upstairs and check on--
Felix Kirsh, found unconscious in Lincoln Park.
Scalp hematoma and blood from his right ear.
- Trauma rooms are full. - Curtain two.
Started seizing as we pulled up. Gave four of Ativan.
Alright, draw up another two. Did he fall?
Might've been mugged. Police were there.
We've got to consider cardiac
'metabolic, and toxicologic etiologies.'
Alright, that's more like it.
Um, I'll-I'll just start 'em off.
(Chuny) 'Ready? One, two, three.'
Now.
Felix, open your eyes, look at me, Felix.
He's postictal, did you call his parents?
- Didn't have time for that. - Here's his ID.
Ruptured his eardrum.
I can come back after work.
Pupils equal and reactive.
Since you got everything under control
I'm going to pediatrics for a few minutes.
Alright, gram of Dilantin over 20.
(Cate) 'How are you doing today, hmm?'
Did you get a good night's sleep?
Did you, did you?
He likes the rocker.
I want you to meet someone.
I want you to meet my husband.
- His name's Russell. - Hello.
- Did you wash your hands? - Yes.
[baby cooing]
Settle down, little man.
Settle down, settle down.
You know, I think he seemed happier with you.
Y-y-you want to take..
Oh, n-n-no, no need to fuss.
Russell's a good guy.
That's better.
That's better, yeah.
He's tracking objects with his eyes.
- 'And he smiles at people.' - 'Yes, you do.'
Yeah, the developmental milestones of a two-month-old.
Oh, you're a very advanced young man.
Uh-huh.
[laughing]
My protective custodianship
is over when he's discharged.
Uh-huh.
If we're serious about adopting
we have to take a state certified
parenting class.
When do we start, huh?
Let's start now.
[theme music]
* And it wouldn't be a bad thing *
* But I don't get no lovin' *
* And that's no lie *
* We spent the night in Frisco *
* At every kind of disco *
* From that night I kissed our love goodbye *
* Don't blame it on the sunshine *
* Don't blame it on the moonlight *
* Don't blame it on the good times.. *
Hey, Archie.
Archie Morris?
- Yeah. - I'm Vera.
Um, you need to see The Big Kahuna.
- Hey, Kahuna, this is Archie. - 'Okay'.
Hey, been looking forward to meeting you.
- Hi. - Why don't you jump in?
And, uh, just follow my lead?
* I've changed my life completely *
* I've seen the lightning leave me *
* My baby just can't take her eyes off me *
* Don't blame it on the sunshine *
* Don't blame it on the moonlight *
* Don't blame it on the good times *
* Blame it on the boogie *
* Don't you blame it on the sunshine.. *
You know, on a second thought
see that kid over there? His name is Logan.
'See if you can get him to join us.'
- Okay, alright. - Yeah.
* I just can't control my feet *
* I just can't I just can't I just can't control my feet *
* Whoo I just can't *
* I just can't I just can't control my feet.. *
Hey, Logan.
How's it going?
* I just can't control my feet.. *
Looks like fun out there.
It's lame.
Yeah, yeah, I'm..
I never cared much for, uh, dancing
when I was a kid either.
* Don't blame it on the moonlight.. **
You play.. You play basketball?
No.
What do you.. What do you like?
'You're wasting your time'
because I don't want to be here, okay?
My parents made me come.
Have you been out of the country?
Uh, two months ago, Machu Picchu.
Uh, I might not need a scalpel then.
- Kayson called about a biopsy. - Yeah, I'll call him back.
He faxed the report.
Thanks.
Hey, doc. Do I need a tetanus shot?
Uh, if it's been more than five years, yeah.
Oh, my god.
Botfly larvae, it's, uh, endemic to South America.
Are the-are they taking over my body?
The fly lays eggs on you
and the larvae burrows under the skin.
You'd know if there's any more. I'll be back.
- Your bookshelves are empty. - 'You need some artwork.'
(Neela) 'Yeah, I'm still in boxes.'
'The way they're working me'
'it'll be a good year'
'before I get settled in.'
Neela's showing us her office.
Hey, look, Simon's here.
Hey, there, this is my new home.
That's impressive.
Oh, check this out.
(Tony) 'Wow, assistant professor of surgery.'
We get residents from Tulane.
So, I do have a faculty position.
Well, I'll be sure to tell Dubenko.
I brought you your stuff you wanted from home.
- Who are you talking to? - County.
Oh, yeah? Hey, guys.
- Hi, Ray. - Ray.
Um, I'm gonna be late for the OR.
I just wanted to check in.
- Call anytime. - Yeah, we miss you.
Take care.
Bye.
[cheering]
Yeah!
Okay, so the rule of the friendship bracelet
is that you can't keep it for yourself.
You have to give it to someone really special.
Who are you giving yours to, Xena?
I haven't decided yet.
You can give it to your husband.
I don't have one of those.
Do you have a boyfriend?
Not right now.
Do you?
A boyfriend?
Yeah, right.
Why not?
Guys tend to avoid me.
What? Come on.
You're pretty and you're smart.
I'm a freak with scars and a bad heart.
I had a cardiac arrest in math class
and the paramedics had to came
'and give me CPR.'
It's kind of a buzzkill to the guys.
That and my internal defibrillator.
What's your heart defect?
Tetralogy of Fallot.
- So, you had a BT shunt? - Mm-hmm.
I had hypo plastic left heart syndrome.
'I needed a Norwood, Glenn'
'and Fontan before my transplants.'
You know, the great thing about camp
is that we all fit in.
You don't have to worry about your scar.
Just be yourself and go crazy.
(male #1) 'Put it up, put it up.'
- Whoo! - 'Nice shot, nice shot.'
[panting]
What's up, Xena?
Oh, just a little arts and crafts.
Oh, I got to cool down.
Hey, Emily, you wanna, you wanna
to check out the slime slide?
Um, I, uh, have to get
something from my backpack.
Is she not suppose to exercise?
No, she's in good shape, it's just this is her
first time at camp and her parents really don't
let her do very much.
Thread to 40 centimeters.
Taking needle out, opsite.
We'll titrate to 10cc's an hour.
You did great, Felix.
This is Dr. Kirsh, Felix's dad.
Hi, I'm Dr. Gates.
I'm Dr. Banfield.
'We spoke.'
Hey, there.
Hey.
Are you a physician?
No, physics professor.
At the world famous Enrico Fermi Institute.
Are you okay?
'How'd you hit your head so hard?'
I don't remember.
We're trying to figure out if he fell
or if something made him faint.
(Kirsch) 'You know, I've heard that, uh..'
sometimes, sleep deprivation
can lead to seizures.
It can.
'He was up all last week'
burning the midnight oil
but he aced all his midterms.
Indeed, I did.
You wanna have a seat?
Thank you.
(Cate) 'Yeah, it could be a while'
'before they take him upstairs.'
"How much of human life is lost in waiting?"
Ralph Waldo Emerson.
We'll be right back.
Okay if I take him to the curtains?
Uh, that'll be fine.
Can you imagine having a dad like that?
I like him.
He's concerned, devoted.
Think about the pressure that kid's under.
Fits the profile, acting out, doing drugs.
Well, check it out, but I doubt it.
I'll have psych come down for an assessment.
Knock yourself out.
Dr. Banfield.
There's someone here to see you.
Mm, okay.
(Frank) 'That's Megan.'
I dropped off a baby a couple of weeks ago.
I remember.
I can't sleep at night.
The baby is doing fine.
- He is? - Yes.
He's well taken care of.
Are you alright?
No. No.
I made a mistake, I want him back.
I wanna keep him.
My mom says she can help.
And I'll be getting a check from the state
SO, we'll be okay.
What about high school?
I can go back.
You know, being a mom isn't so easy.
I see girls younger than me doing it.
So, you're sure about this?
Okay, I'll talk to our social worker
but, uh, it might be a while.
I'll wait.
Megan.
You know..
You just seem a little confused.
Are you sure you don't want
to think about this some more?
I already have.
I made a bad decision and..
I just want to do what's right.
Alright, so there's a tear in the dura mater.
The outermost, toughest
of the three meninges covering the brain.
AP Biology.
Okay, well, you're gonna be on bed rest
for about five days till it heals.
I cancelled all my appointments but I've got
a couple of classes, okay if I'm back at six?
- No problem. - I'm not going anywhere.
Alright.
Cell phone's on.
See you, kiddo.
Okay, what do you remember about this morning?
I cut through the park on my way to school.
Sometimes, I jump over these rocks.
I guess I slipped.
Anything else?
So, tell me, how does a freshman
end up in AP Biology?
All my classes are AP.
Sounds like a lot of stress.
Not really.
Have you been sad lately?
Alex on line two.
- He says it's important. - Alright.
You know, after a concussion
as time goes by you can start
to remember more so make sure
to tell me if that happens.
I got something to tell you when you're done.
Alright.
Hello.
What do you mean it doesn't fit?
I specifically ordered
for a '65 dashboard.
- How was camp? - Amazing.
- I wish I could stay all day. - Alright.
I'll call for a return authorization.
No, they were not supposed to send a six-CD changer.
Okay, okay, bye.
Getting a new stereo?
No, actually. My-my car got broken into.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Oh, PD has some new info.
Witnesses saw a fight in Lincoln Park, this morning
where they found your kid, at least four teenagers
grabbing and shoving each other.
- Frank? - Thanks.
What's Neela doing on your computer?
It's a screen shot. You missed her video chat.
Oh, how is she?
Never thought she'd be happy
in Louisiana, but I was wrong.
She looks good, she sounds good.
I got three new ones to present.
Come on. Why am I the only attending on the floor?
Good afternoon.
Hedda Lanford, 24 weeks pregnant.
Congratulations.
Complains of left leg pain and swelling.
It got so bad, I couldn't walk.
- Any shortness of breath? - No, just the leg.
- They're good vitals. - Okay, trauma two.
Dr. Brenner, paramedics are five minutes out with a hot MI.
Okay, call the cath lab
and grab me when they're here.
- Has the baby been moving? - Mm-hmm, maybe a little less.
But, I could be imagining things.
Let's get some fetal heart tones and prep the SonoSite.
- Simon. - Yeah?
- Want me to take her upstairs? - What for?
After 20 weeks, we like to send them to OB.
The baby's viable, they get better monitoring.
That'd be fine if she had belly pain.
- They can check out her leg. - Well, we'll do a better job.
I'm worried about a blood clot
and mom comes first not the baby.
Alright, then she needs an NST.
- So get a fetal monitor. - Are you okay?
- Yeah. - You seem a little--
Look, there's supposed to be double attending coverage
but I'm looking after 40 patients by myself.
Set up a duplex scan.
Keep going, man.
[bell clanging]
Yeah! Yeah. Good job, kid.
[cheering]
Good job!
Oh, this is pretty cool.
It's a baby wall.
I've been up on one
like, twice that size.
You wanna race me to the top?
I'll give you ten bucks if you win.
You think you can bribe me?
- That is so pathetic. - 'No, I can't.'
(Vera) 'It's not as hard as it looks, really.'
- It's-it's fun, It's.. - I don't want to.
Hey, what's going on?
She's afraid to try.
You know what?
Have you ever had a dream where you were flying?
What was it like?
Don't look at the ground.
One more step!
No, I'm...you know, I'm
I'm coming down, guys.
No! Keep going.
Okay, I'm gonna..
I'm gonna keep going.
Oh, no!
I don't think I can do this.
[bell clanging]
[cheering]
Yeah!
- You got it! - 'Two.'
- Three! - 'You got it!'
- Whoa! - Yeah!
Good job right there!
You, too.
Hey!
That was awesome.
Oh.
Hey.
Russ, I got some bad news.
Definite DVT, there's a large blood clot in the thigh.
How does that happen?
As the uterus grows
it compresses the pelvic veins.
Pregnancy makes the blood more coagulable.
So, we need to treat you
with a blood thinner called heparin.
Is that safe for the baby?
- Yeah. - Are you sure?
It took us three years to get pregnant.
Well, heparin doesn't cross the placenta.
What if you don't give it to me?
Well, a piece of the blood clot
could break off
and travel to your lungs.
It's called a pulmonary embolism.
And you can die from that.
Um, my brother-in-law's an OB.
Do you mind if we discuss this with him?
That's a good idea.
Look, I think we're wasting valuable time.
This is a no-brainer. Heparin's safe.
It'll save your life. It'll save your baby's life.
So, let's prep a 5,000 unit bolus, please.
Excuse me.
Hey? Hey!
What is their problem?
They just need a little time.
Well, Banfield can deal with them
'cause I'm supposed to go over to this heart camp.
Oh, well, they're going to love you with that attitude.
Well, maybe I won't go.
Look, I know it's a hard time.
It'll get better.
What are you talking about?
Neela.
Neela, look, Sam
tell your gossip circle not to worry.
I've moved on, and I'm fine, okay?
You really need me here?
You're my designated runner.
Okay.
Oh! Oh! Oh!
(Archie) 'Okay, okay.'
(The Big Kahuna) 'Alright, two down.'
'Bases loaded.'
Bring me home, baby.
'Bring me home, Vera.'
Yeah!
[indistinct]
Vera, pour it on faster!
We can get a grand slam. Bring it home!
[grunts]
(The Big Kahuna) 'What happened?'
- Okay. - What's going on, honey?
My defibrillator's firing.
Let me check the carotid.
[grunts]
I think she's in V-tach.
[indistinct chatter]
(Cate) 'And I'll do a Hennepin with him sitting up.'
Back in the socket.
Alright, immobilizer
and a post-reduction film.
When we lived in San Diego
I saw a surfer throw his shoulder out.
San Diego's nice.
We were there for about two years.
Oh, how long have you lived here?
Since September.
- Are you having any eye pain? - Uh-uh.
Look, Archie, I know I volunteered
but if you've got enough help, then I--
No, we're completely short-staffed now.
You need to get over there.
This is so not necessary.
Well, good, 'cause it's not gonna take very long.
- ICD discharge. - You want a 12 lead?
I gotta grab the programmer.
We're gonna interrogate.
- Who is that? - The Big Kahuna.
Chief of pediatric cardiology at Rush.
'He runs the camp.'
Normal sinus, 84.
Okay, send Lytes and a troponin.
Hey, I'm Vera.
Felix, what happened?
I have a defibrillator in my chest.
Cool.
I think it shocked me by accident.
Did it hurt?
'A little.'
Like a horse kicked me.
Hey, Rojo, Xena, um, can you call upstairs
and tell them I'm alright?
Rojo? Xena?
Okay, so Vera says she's fine
and she'll be back really soon.
[cheering]
(Chuny) 'You ready?'
Okay, so what we have to do is
we all have to get from this side to the other side
without going through the same hole twice.
Can I go first?
Sure, go ahead.
[cheering]
Wow, it's like cirque du soleil.
Good job!
Don't touch the web.
Hey.
what?
Well, if everyone goes through the web
- It kind of builds a team. - That's stupid.
He doesn't have to do it if he doesn't want to.
It would mean a lot to the kids
if you'd join in.
It wouldn't mean a lot to me.
Why don't you do it for them?
You really want me to go to the other side?
Yeah.
[yelling]
I did it.
'Look at me. I'm on the other side.'
Bingo.
That'll tell you if it was V-tach?
This will tell us everything.
Oh.
- Excuse me. - Mm-hmm.
Felix is getting a bed at 7:00.
- How's your headache? - I think it's better.
(Vera) 'So, how'd you get a name like Felix?'
After Felix Bloch.
He was a physicist who won
the Nobel Prize for nuclear magnetic resonance.
- Like in MRI scans. - 'Yeah.'
His work led to that.
He was a giant.
Studied with Heisenberg and Schrodinger.
Schrodinger had a cat.
You know about that?
He didn't actually have a cat.
It was like a thought experiment.
Uh, the cat in the box is either alive
or dead depending on a random event.
Okay, I am completely confused.
That makes two of us.
(The Big Kahuna) 'Great news.'
It was just sinus tach.
When you ran, your pulse rate went up to 180.
That means she can go back?
Well, she got shocked six times
so I think we got to keep you in the hospital.
I'm not getting admitted.
- 'Not during camp.' - Honey.
This thing zaps you at a heart rate of 160.
So, if you exert yourself at all--
Why don't you set it higher?
That's a good idea.
'We could do that.'
'Okay.'
Okay, no shocks..
until 200.
But only till after the dance, alright?
'Huh?'
All right.
Two weeks later, and she can just
walk in the door like nothing happened?
That's what she did.
'There must be some kind of a time limit.'
There isn't.
She's in high school.
We're in a much better position to care for that baby.
- That isn't the issue. - We have resources.
We have a home.
We have maturity. Doesn't that count for something?
She's his mother.
That counts more than anything.
'It's not a done deal.'
The case worker still has to talk
to the mom and the grandmother.
It will take a week for the determination.
You let me know how that goes.
Russ, come on.
You know the system.
Maybe there's something else to do.
We keep working, we keep praying, we keep going.
I've been doing that for seven years.
There you go.
(Archie) 'They really need me'
and I have to cancel tonight.
Well, you can come down here.
You would? Really?
Do you.. Do you own a sleeping bag?
It was nice to meet you.
Maybe I'll see you around?
Yeah.
We could take Felix to the dance.
It's only for kids who've had open-heart surgery.
- He has an open skull fracture. - That's close.
Not to mention a catheter in his spinal column.
He has to stay on bed rest.
Lemme see what I can do.
So, how's it going in here?
(Felix) 'Okay.'
Dr. Gates, would you take a seat.
I-I get very frustrated because I like to get
to the bottom of things.
I need to know the truth.
Did you know Felix's parents have to move every year or two?
Academic careers.
New universities.
Doesn't give you much chance to put down roots
'make friends.'
When you feel like an outsider
sometimes you fall in with kids who do dangerous things.
- Like drugs. - My urine test was negative.
You have Tardieu spots.
'Little red dots near your eyes.'
'Now, maybe you don't remember'
but it can happen when someone tries to choke you.
Felix?
Felix?
Did someone grab you around the neck?
Not the neck.
The chest.
It's called suffocation roulette.
You hold your breath and someone squeezes
you from behind.
The first one to pass out loses.
Kids die from playing that game.
Or get brain damage.
You're too smart a kid to be doing that.
They're my friends.
(Samantha) 'Dr. Banfield.'
We need you in Trauma Two right away.
[intense music]
My pregnant DVT lady has sudden onset chest pain.
- She's on heparin? - For the past hour.
- What's her pressure? - 110/65.
I already did the EKG.
[groaning]
Alright, tell me about your pain.
Hurts when I take a breath.
Could a blood clot have gone to her lung?
I would say yes.
There's a new right axis
deviation and S-one Q-three.
But she's on heparin.
Well, it's not a perfect drug.
What do we do now?
Okay, we could try TPA.
It's a powerful clot-busting medicine.
If it works, she's back to normal
with only a one percent risk of death.
What about the baby?
(Cate) 'There are no good studies.'
TPA definitely carries
a risk of miscarriage or fetal death.
How big of a risk?
- Ten percent, maybe more. - 'Oh, God.'
What about a vena cava filter?
If we put a filter in your main vein here
'we could prevent future clots'
'from traveling to your lung'
but it takes time.
We...we don't wanna hurt the baby.
What would you do?
I don't care.
I don't care if we have to stay in here all day.
Yeah, me, neither.
They keep bugging me to play their stupid games.
Well, they don't get it.
They don't understand.
Hey, we could.. We could flush some
tennis balls down the toilets.
That would back them up for days.
Or.. I know where there's some spray paint.
We could tag, camp sucks
all over the walls of the gym.
Huh?
Or we can pull some fire alarms
make 'em evacuate all the patients from the hospital.
Or, you know, we can..
We can just sit here and...and do nothing.
You think I'm being a jerk.
No, I think that you're not letting yourself
have a good time.
It's not a good time..
...because Sean's not here.
Sean?
I met him in September.
We were in for heart caths.
We both had truncus arteriosus.
You know what that is?
Yeah.
Ever since we were babies
we had the same operations
and were on the same meds.
He had never been to camp.
I kept telling him how great it was.
'We made plans.'
We talked and texted every day.
He thought he could win the Kahuna's fart contest.
'We were gonna have so much fun.'
He had to go to surgery last week
for a conduit replacement.
Died on the table.
Logan, I'm sorry.
(cellphone ringing)
Hello.
'Yeah, I know.. I know.'
I'll.. I'll be there as soon I can.
Not a good week all around.
What?
A good friend of mine is in the ICU.
Yeah.
I tried really hard to get her a heart transplant
but...now she's back in rejection.
It's pretty bad.
What are you doing here?
Well, I...I stopped by
but she's in a coma.
I've been intubated like ten times.
When I'm deeply sedated
I can hear everything.
I can even tell who's in the room.
She'll know if you're there.
Trached a month ago for myasthenia gravis.
Was bleeding this morning, opened up at Triage.
It's a tracheo- innominate fistula
from pressure necrosis.
(Tony) 'Alright, four units of O-neg.'
Have thoracic surgery hold an OR.
'He's pouring out faster than we can transfuse.'
Overinflate the trach cuff.
That can tamponade the bleeder.
You want the rapid infuser?
Absolutely.
'Alright, this isn't helping.'
Any more air, and I'll burst the cuff.
Give me a number four Shiley.
- That's a pediatric size. - No, wait and see.
(Chuny) 'Hemocue's only 8.2.'
(Cate) 'Okay, now you can put your finger in the trach hole'
'and compress against the posterior sternum.'
- Like this? - 'Well done.'
Now, get your ass up to the OR.
Thank you.
Hey, we took her to radiology for the filter.
She crashed before they started.
BP 70 palp, tachy to 120.
'We may need to intubate her.'
What's going on?
More than likely, it's another blood clot.
I think we need to think about TPA.
(male #2) 'No, we decided we didn't want it'
we don't wanna hurt the baby.
Things have changed since then.
No...honey, honey..
honey, honey, talk to me.
I...honey, I need your help here.
Wait, what are you doing?
Wait, wait, wait!
What-what are you doing?
[heavy breathing]
(Cate) 'Baby looks great.'
'Placenta is perfect.'
No sign of bleeding.
Thank you.
And the clot in your lung
has completely dissolved.
[sighs] For a minute, I thought
I was gonna lose both of you.
We like it when things work out.
Dr. Banfield, you gave TPA without consent.
Yes, I did.
Well, what if there had been a bad outcome?
She's young and healthy and was about to die.
Do I need consent to shock her heart
if she has cardiac arrest?
I guess you got lucky.
You saved that lady?
Yep...and her baby, too.
Uh, I'll get these to the lab.
You're still here?
The guy with the bleeding neck?
He's okay after surgery.
Is there someplace we could talk?
In here.
What's on your mind?
I've been thinking about it, and..
I want him to be proud of me.
Yes.
To do that, though..
..I would wanna make something of myself.
And I would be somebody who..
Who did something important.
Like you.
Like me?
Make a difference, you know?
That's a good goal.
I don't know if I'd really be able to do that
if I quit school right now.
Having a kid, it's going to be really hard.
That's true.
The nurses told me you were the custodian of the baby?
Does that mean you wanted to adopt him?
My husband and I were thinking about it.
I'm just scared I'll never see him again.
That-that-that doesn't have to happen.
You can watch him grow up.
Get to know him, be a part of his life.
It's..
...called an open adoption.
How do we do that?
If-if we all agree
we can work it out.
[sighs]
[instrumental music]
What is taking so long?
(Vera) 'Uh, give us two minutes.'
I'm timing you.
Tony, we're on next.
We didn't even do a sound check.
(Vera) 'Just start without us.'
Go in, I'll wait.
(Claudia) 'Archie!'
Hey!
I am so glad you're here!
His name is Rojo. Who are you?
Uh, this is my friend, Claudia.
Do you have a scar?
A big one. From here to here.
What do you think?
Hey, beautiful!
(Tony) 'Looking good there, Felix.'
- Good to be the king. - Alright, let's go!
[cheering]
[instrumental music]
(Archie over PA) 'Hello? Is this thing on?'
Alright, hello, Chicago!
[cheering]
Yeah!
Alright, prepare to be blown away.
[cheering]
Here we go!
[instrumental music]
I have one question.
How you feelin' out there?
[cheering]
(Archie) 'I can't hear you!'
I said, how you feelin'?!
[cheering]
Hey, Rojo
how do you feel?
[instrumental music]
Wow!
* I feel good *
* I knew that I would now *
* Well I feel good *
* I knew that I would now *
* So good *
* So good *
* I got you *
* Wha I feel nice *
* Like sugar and spice *
* I feel nice *
* Like some sugar and spice *
* So nice *
* So nice *

* Mmm when I hold you *

* Ah.. Yeah *
- Dr. Brenner. - Hey.
What are we stopping in here for?
Checking on a patient.
* I feel good.. *
You people have some very unusual therapies.
* Well I feel good *
* Like I knew I would *
They seem quite effective.
* So good *
* So good *
* I got you.. *
* And I feel nice *
[humming]
- Like sugar-- - Alright, shh, shh, shh.
[whispering] Everybody's sleeping.
This is room 209.
Hey, can I stay for a little while?
- We'll be quiet. - You need to get back to camp.
And visiting hours were over three hours ago.
Come on, you can say good night.
- Good night. - Night.
(Samantha) 'Good luck, Felix.'
Alright. Hey, give them some privacy.
Quite a day today, huh?
Yeah.
Oh, thank you for coming out to dinner with my mom.
You're welcome.
Took the heat off of me.
For some reason she loves you.
Well..
You wanna come to her colonoscopy with me next week?
Excuse me? Privacy?
[instrumental music]
(Archie) 'Hey!'
- 'Oh-oh!' - 'Busted..'
Back to your tent.
'Boys stay on the boys' side.'
'Got that?'
[laughing]
Alright, let me know if you hear anything out there, alright?
- Yes, sir. - Alright.
- Thirsty? - No.
- You hungry? - Ugh.
I had too many s'mores.
Not quite as good as Charlie Trotter's would have been.
- This was way more fun. - Really?
Definitely.
You are something else.
You went from a night on the town
to a night in a pup tent without a hitch.
Yeah, life's too short to whine.
It is.
You know, you spend a day with these kids..
...you realize..
This...this is totally random..
...but sometimes I imagine a night..
...you know, in-in the future..
...a night where I would take you out..
...spend money and make a big deal about it...
And it would end like this..
...when I ask you to marry me.
What do you think?
I think I'd say yes.
(Vera) 'Dr. Morris?'
I can't fall asleep.
Yeah, she's never been to a sleepover before.
She's homesick.
Well, what do you.. What do you need, Em?
My dad tells me a bedtime story every night.
Not a problem. Alright.
Okay, let me see.
Once upon a time..
there was a little blood cell
...who couldn't find his way to the lungs.
Now he was.. He was blue all the time
but he wished that he was red.
He needs a Rastelli operation.
(Archie) 'Wha..'
'No, no, no, a Blalock-Taussig.'
He has tetralogy.
Hey, who's telling the story anyway, huh?
[Emily chuckle]
[Archie laughing]
(Russell) 'Three ounces down the hatch.'
How about a...nice burp for Russell?
Okay.
- Oh. - Oh!
[laughing]
Hey, that was a good one.
That was a quick one.
There we go.
High five. Yes!
Now tomorrow, we're going to work on that fist bump.
Okay?
[baby cooing]
Mmm.
[baby fussing]
Oh.
There we go. There we go..
[indistinct]
