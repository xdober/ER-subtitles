[theme music]
(male narrator) Previously on "ER."
I don't believe we've been properly introduced.
I'm Cate Banfield.
How can you let him leave?
I don't like it, either, but he forced our hand.
Lucien, don't be an idiot. Come back to work.
My work makes it difficult to have a normal social life.
Me, too.
We're work colleagues, and that's all.
I don't wanna go for coffee
or drinks with you, not now, not ever.
Ah, the new interns.
Welcome to County.
The adventure is just beginning.
[siren wailing]
Daria's assessment was atypical chest pain, which I agree with.
He's going home after two normal troponins and EKGs.
Not during rounds.
And when he drops dead in his own kitchen
it will be because we missed a..
- PE? - No.
Symptoms are too intermittent.
Are you thinking variant angina?
He complained of abdominal pain.
Am I boring you, Dr. Gates?
No. I'm sorry. It's a 6 a.m. shift.
'My brain's here, but my body isn't.'
If there's pain above and below the diaphragm
think aortic dissection. Get a CT.
That's a great teaching point, Dr. Banfield.
If you can learn something new on every case
you'll be brilliant by the time you finish your training.
So, in order to get to the next level
each intern will get a mentor.
Gates, you get Wade.
Uh, Brenner, Martin.
Morris, Sanchez.
Mentors, as they go, so you go.
(Morris) 'Well, I guess Brenner's gone'
seeing as he likes to demoralize when he teaches.
Bite me.
There will be two-way critiques on a daily basis.
- Now get to work. - Let's go get a patient.
Well, the paramedics just brought in an eye injury.
This is ridiculous. I don't need interns critiquing me.
That's too bad, 'cause I was gonna give you
some advice on that tie.
What's wrong with my tie?
- Someone called for a consult? - Yup.
This-this tie is Italian.
- Looks fine. - Don't touch me.
Okay, present your patients to me before you run any tests
and, uh, we can discuss a differential
and come up with a plan together.
Or I could come up with a plan myself
and then you can tell me whether
or not you agree with it later?
(Dawn) 'Four of Ativan.'
- Hi, Surgery. - Hey.
Triple hit of LSD peyote and crack last night.
That's pretty hardcore.
(Brenner) Stabbed his belly with a potato peeler.
Okay. It looks superficial. Andrew?
- One percent with epi? - Exactly right.
You glad to be back?
Yes, I am, and I appreciate what you did for me.
Well, I just helped it along a bit. It was really Neela.
Thought it was your idea.
Well, they need you up there.
Well, if you ever need anything, Dr. Brenner
you just let me know.
I owe you one.
I know. I know.
I love Lake Geneva.
I was just hoping we could stay here.
Sorry it's broken. Try down the street.
[sighs]
I've been away from Chicago so long
just being home feels like a vacation.
Alright, next month, I promise we will go to the lake.
Okay, now go back to work and make us some money.
I'll call you later.
[grunts]
- Oh, God! - I got a gun. I got a gun.
- Just pass me your wallet. - Doesn't have any cash in it.
Lady, are you stupid? Come on. Hand it over.
[grunting]
[theme music]
[soft music]
Me? Go out. Come on, Ray.
[beeping]
Hey, I do have a life.
Last weekend, I went out with friends for drinks.
I'm not lying.
Who are my friends?
Alright, fine.
You know, I-I fell asleep
watching three Tracy Hepburn movies, and..
Stop laughing at me.
I am not a loser.
You saw how it cleaned up the corneal rust, right?
Yeah. It was kind of scary.
I mean, you can't drill into the eye, right?
No, the blades only go down a millimeter.
[groaning]
I can't breathe. What the hell did you do to me?
Another kick, I'd have put you in the morgue.
Oh, hear that? She's threatening me!
Victim of assault.
Self-defense. He tried to mug me.
- She crushed my chest. - Are you okay?
- I'm fine. - Blunt chest trauma.
- Decent vitals, pulse is okay. - Gimme something for the pain.
- You need to be checked out. - No, forget it.
No, you've got a pretty big contusion.
Listen, all I need is some ice.
- Inferior orbit fracture. - Alright, quickly.
Come on.
Decreased breath sounds on the left.
I agree.
[groaning]
I can't believe I mugged a doctor.
Not just a doctor. She's the chief.
What the hell that supposed to mean?
Is she an Apache or something?
- No, she runs this joint. - Oh, God, kill me now.
Okay, tenderness over the fifth and sixth ribs.
- Four of morphine. - Mid-axillary line.
What should we do, Tracy?
Uh, obvious rib fractures.
'Collapsed lung. He needs a chest tube.'
- That's right. - Oh, no, no.
Not necessarily.
If it's a pure pneumothorax
we can manage him with a Heimlich valve.
- Okay, let's do it. - You're holding back, are you?
- No, I don't think so. - Me, either.
With a trauma, he needs a chest tube
in case there's any bleeding.
- I like to use a 32 French. - I'll open one up.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, why stick a garden hose in his chest
when we can get by with a swizzle stick?
- Makes a lot of sense. - Pulse ox 98. BP 122 over 78.
Well, he's stable for now.
We can wait for the chest x-ray
and then decide on a course of action.
Yeah, and when there's no hemothorax
we can do it my way.
To the left. Right.
Up, and then down.
Yeah, extraocular movements are intact.
Yeah. You really did a number on that guy.
Yeah. I took Tae Kwan Do for the workout.
Never thought I'd have to use it.
Well, it came in handy.
When you have an orbital blowout
the inferior rectus can get trapped
and you can lack upgaze.
I'm thinking facial series.
No, I don't need x-rays.
Alright, how about bacitracin on the, uh, abrasions.
Is that alright?
- It's broken, huh? - Yes.
My husband gave it to me on our first anniversary.
Want me to call him, have him come pick you up?
No, not while the market's open.
- He's a commodities trader. - Dr. Banfield--
Besides, I'm not leaving. What?
- You should go home. - We have a full board.
We'll take care of it.
We got a run, five minutes out.
- You okay, Dr. Banfield? - Yeah, I'm fine.
- Your tetanus up to date? - Yeah. Of course it is.
- How far in? - About three inches.
Now attach the Heimlich valve.
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
You put a gun to her back
and all you can say is you're sorry?
It wasn't a gun. It wasn't a gun.
Who the hell robs somebody with a pink highlighter?
A runner-up for the Darwin Awards, that's who.
And the connective tubing goes to this collection bag.
But the valve leaflets only flow one ways
so no air or blood can reenter the chest.
Unusual approach with the Heimlich.
Yeah, it's a pure pneumothorax.
Let's get him off to the jail ward.
Jail ward? I don't wanna go to the jail ward.
(Banfield) 'Yeah. They'll ignore him there.'
Let's keep him for observation.
I thought the jail ward nurses could handle it.
He's a moron, but he's still our patient.
Yeah, listen to her.
She's the chief.
- See you. - Hey. How was your sleep-over?
- Fun. - Yeah?
You all ready for your soccer tournament?
Judy's mom's picking me up in an hour.
Good. I'm sorry I can't be there.
It's her first time being a left wing.
Oh, Daria, Sarah. Sarah, Daria.
- Hey. Kick butt today. - Thanks.
(Gates) 'What are you guys doing after?'
Pizza, movie.
Why are you talking like that?
- Like what? - Like what?
- Toothache. - Oh. Open your mouth.
- You're not a dentist. - Open your mouth.
- A tongue ring? - Ah, it's only a stud.
When did you get that?
Last night at Heather's sleep-over.
Her big sister took us to get it.
- Isn't it cool? - No, it's not cool.
Look, don't you have to get a-a parent
to sign off on something like this?
You're acting like I killed someone.
You did! Me! Now go wait in the break room.
What.. I don't get it.
What's this whole fad about a tongue stud?
Girls do it, you know, to pleasure the boys.
So I've heard.
Julie O'Fallon. Fell off a six-foot wall to cement surface.
Head trauma and obvious femur fracture.
Alright. How you doing, Julie?
I'm okay. I'm just really dizzy.
- Uh-huh. - Is she gonna get shots?
She hates shots, and blood, too.
Alright, let's just check you out first.
You're gonna be okay, sweetheart.
Alright, let's get a trauma panel
and portable x-rays. Let's go.
I keep telling her that if she wants to be a serious gymnast
that she has to practice hard, but that-that wall
'is not a balance beam.'
Pupils equal and reactive.
- Good breath sounds. - It hurts.
They're gonna fix you up, sweetie.
105 over 70. Tachy at 120.
Is that bad?
Uh, it could be from all the pain.
So give her something.
Well, it also could be
from the internal bleeding
'in which case pain meds could be dangerous'
'so just give us a second, okay?'
Dr. Gates?
Blunt head trauma.
Femur fracture.
I'm going to clear the belly and the neck
and then, uh, send her to head CT.
Alright. Sounds like a plan.
(girl) What does this thing do?
Oh, that's a rapid infuser
'but your sister doesn't need that.'
(Gates) 'Liver and spleen look good.'
Is this where you keep all the tubes and stuff?
No. Uh, move away from there.
Claire, what did I tell you
about touching things? Will you come over here?
Will you just stay here next to me?
Foot pulses two plus and equal.
Pressure's down to 80 systolic.
Alright, bolus 20 per kilo.
- Julie, you okay? - Mommy.
- Mom. - You okay, Julie?
I have to..
Sats are only 88.
Hundred percent nonrebreather.
Give me an intubation tray and a 6-0 tube.
What's happening?
Could be the head injury
or maybe there's blood loss in the thigh.
Alright, give her some oxygen.
Okay, good news, Freda.
You didn't break your hip.
Are you sure? Feels broken to me.
- It's a bad bruise. - I think it's broken.
What do you think of the belly?
Pretty benign.
The epigastric pain's an ongoing problem.
I, uh, saw your post-op Billroth wound infection.
- And? - We'll admit him.
- Glad you agree. - Andrew, H and P in Curtain 2.
- You mind if I go, Dr. Dubenko? - No, not a problem.
I've got reflux esophagitis.
I've tried everything. Nothing helps.
Well, maybe if you'd stop smoking cigarettes.
Why don't you ruin my day altogether?
I'm 80 years old. This is my only joy.
Oh, I do a little X, too.
What do you have, nursing home raves?
You'd be surprised what a girl's libido does at my age.
Look, Freda, I don't want you to fall again.
I've organized for a nurse to come around
and give you a home safety assessment.
You're gonna need a night light and a walker.
And I'd lay off the X.
Do you make house calls, Simon?
I get up from my nap at 7.
You listen to Dr. Brenner, Freda.
You'll be fine. Listen to him.
Dr. Morris. Interesting use of the Heimlich valve this morning.
- Yeah, how's he doing? - He's doing well on room air.
- How's Dr. Banfield? - Unfazed. She's still working.
Hey! What are you doing here?
Hey. Oh, pilates.
I fell off the reformer.
Ryan, finish those charts, then find me.
I will take it from here.
This is one of my VIP patients.
Pressure's up and so are the sats.
She's doing much better.
Do we really have to intubate her?
Trust me, you don't want her off
in CT without an airway.
We're gonna put a tube in your mouth, Julie
'and when you wake up, it's gonna help you breathe.'
I don't want that.
It won't be too bad, I promise.
Mom, I have to go to the bathroom.
Alright, premedicate with lido, fent and atropine.
Alright, you have time.
'We have to wait at least three minutes.'
Okay, we'll be right back.
(Gates) 'Alright, etomidate and sux. Let's go.'
Alright, bag her up. Get ready.
- My mom said I fell. - I checked the cuff.
I didn't fall.
She pushed me.
'She pushed me.'
So how have you been?
Okay.
It's been hard.
My whole life revolved around my mom.
- It's good that you had that. - Yeah.
Packing up her things was weird.
You know, our entire lives get reduced to a garage sale.
And if you can't get rid of your parents' stuff
on a Saturday morning
then you're dropping it off
at Goodwill on Sunday night.
I know. My dad died a year ago.
I'm still not over it.
You know, I haven't even disconnected her phone yet.
Sometimes I call it and..
...just to listen to the sound of her voice on the machine.
Sit tight. I'm gonna go order an x-ray.
Hey, did you see my clotted dialysis shunt?
Yeah. I put in a Quinton.
Lucien, wait up.
Got something to discuss with you.
Uh, Dr. Rasgotra discovered
an abscess on the, uh, Billroth patient.
- Was there a delay? - No, no, not at all.
- No, I just, uh.. - What?
I thought you could help me out.
- What? - I wanted to thank her.
Oh. No, no, no. Absolutely not.
- Why? - I'm a surgeon, not a yenta.
[chuckles] No, but..
But you're colleagues, you're friends.
No, we're work friends, okay?
I know nothing about her personal life.
You know what she likes, what she doesn't like.
In the OR.
When I walk out of the hospital
that's the end of our personal relationship, okay?
Can I make a quick suggestion?
Find somebody else to bang and cast aside, okay?
Neela doesn't deserve that.
Lots of times when parents encourage their kids
to do their best, they lose their patience.
I don't believe this.
She said you pushed her.
Are you kidding me?
We got her x-rays back.
She has multiple old fractures.
- She's an athlete. - She's 13.
[sighs] Claire.
Get over here.
You saw your sister fall.
Tell them what happened.
Alright, now is not the time to be bashful.
What did you see?
I was in my room..
...and I heard her scream.
Keep going.
Let her talk, Mrs. O'Fallon.
And then I looked outside my window
and she was on the ground.
And I wasn't anywhere near her, right?
Right.
That's when I came and got you.
In your room.
There.
You heard her.
Claire, you can go back in.
'Well, we're still gonna have to call Social Services.'
They're gonna have to review this.
What? What do you think, I coached her?
This is crazy. Do whatever you have to do.
Just please take care of my daughter.
This is your first trauma with me.
- Watch and learn. - Okay. Great.
Sixty-year-old belted passenger, T-boned with intrusion.
Alert, tachy to 110.
Some guy ran a red light.
I didn't even see him coming.
Her son Chuck was walking
on scene, refused treatment.
I'm Dr. Brenner. This is Dr. Martin.
Look, she's in a lot of pain. How bad is she hurt?
Probable rib, humerus and pelvic fractures.
None of that sounds too serious. She'll be fine.
We need to do a complete exam before assessing her prognosis.
How'd your respiratory physiology exam go?
Uh, I think I flunked it.
I used to feel the same way after every med school test.
Well, maybe I just need a good mentor.
I hear you're a real rock star.
- You did? - Mm-hmm.
I've been looking for you.
- Judy's mom's outside. - Oh, alright.
Well, good luck, and make sure you come back after the game.
- What about pizza and a movie? - That's not gonna happen.
I've instructed Judy's mom to bring you back here after
the game and take that thing out of your tongue.
- No. - Yes!
- I'm not gonna do it. - Take it out of your tongue!
I'm not gonna do it!
You're gonna do it when you come back!
If I have to get the pliers out..
[groans]
You need to have the talk.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Tony, if she's gonna have oral sex..
La-la-la-la- la-la-la-la.
She can get an STD. Hey! It's not a joke.
I'm not laughing.
A woman should have that talk with her.
In fact, why don't you have the talk?
It's not my place.
Look, if-if Alex ever needs
to have the man talk
I'll return the favor.
Alex is 15.
I had that conversation
with him when he was ten.
- Ten? - Yeah.
Isn't that a little young?
Trauma panel, type and cross four.
C-spine, chest, pelvis and left humerus.
Head CT, abdominal CT, pelvic CT.
- Easy, Tracy. - Foley, NG and..
Let's just start with the labs
and plain films first.
Where are you hurting, Mrs. Holmes?
Everywhere.
Richard..
...call the insurance company.
Those jerks tried to rip me off in '67.
Mom, it's Chuck. You gotta calm down.
Flail chest on the right
decreased breath sounds.
BP is 95 over 60.
Somebody, turn on the grill.
'I was thinking about making some brisket.'
(Chuck) 'She's got Alzheimer's.'
My mom can get loopy.
Okay.
Tracy, start a second line.
Do you want a subclavian?
Just a peripheral 18 gauge.
Has she had any other medical problems?
No, she used to be healthy as a horse.
Wouldn't even take aspirin.
'Loved the outdoors.'
'That's why I was taking her for a drive.'
- 'BP's down to 80 systolic.' - Okay, call Surgery.
She needs intubation, chest tube, and central line.
Somebody, get the door.
Wow, this is a great teaching case.
Where do you live, Mrs. O'Fallon?
We just moved to Bridgeport.
The company that I work for opened a new store there.
This is our third move in two years.
Must be tough relocating all the time.
No, it's not hard. We travel well.
You know, everyone gets mad at their kids.
What do you do when that happens, Mrs. O'Fallon?
I, uh, count to ten.
Uh, I ask them to sit down
think about what they did, and then we talk about it.
Hey, we're out of suction catheters.
I'll be right back.
Do you ever raise your voice?
Yeah. What, is that not allowed?
Have you ever been physical with Julie?
Be honest. She's gonna talk to both your kids.
Yeah, maybe once or twice, when they weren't listening.
You know how you grab a kid
say, "Stop touching the stove."
What was it like when you did that?
- What do you mean? - How did it make you feel?
Look, my father beat the crap out of me.
And I wasn't gonna do that to my girls.
[rapid beeping]
What's going on in there?
Sats are dropping.
I don't know what's wrong.
Do something.
I don't think she's breathing.
(Banfield) 'Pulse is weak and thready.'
'Cycle the dynamap.'
What's the story?
She's got a hemopneumothor--
MVA PSI, hemopneumothorax
pubic ramus and humerus fractures.
Okay, how's the belly?
FAST scan negative.
Were you drinking? Is that how this happened?
- Someone hit us, dad. - How do we know that?
Chest tube output?
- 300 cc's so far. - Not so bad.
Did you give him a Breathalyzer?
He's a drunk.
I've been clean for eight months.
You haven't been clean since you were 16.
(Dawn) 'Second two units are up.'
Okay, right-sided rib fractures.
Probably the liver.
I looked, there's nothing there.
Yeah, let's look again.
Shouldn't we check the pelvis?
It's unlikely with an anterior fracture.
- I think it's in the chest. - Chest? Probably a contusion.
(Brenner) 'We need to think about a right-sided thoracotomy.'
- You crazy? - Right-sided?
It's not the chest.
Bradying down.
Give me the ultrasound.
- Heart rate 40. - Amp of atropine.
Look at this. There's blood pooling in the hemithorax.
- He's right. Thoracotomy tray. - Neela?
(Tracy) 'We lost a pulse.'
Okay, start compressions.
If she's not okay... so help me God.
(Taggart) 'Systolic's down to 70.'
Bolus 250 of saline.
- 'What's happening?' - Pulse ox in the low 80s.
Think she dropped a lung?
- Is she dying? - No.
Breath sounds good bilaterally.
Call for a portable chest.
Someone talk to me.
What about a fat embolus?
What is that?
Uh, when you break a large bone, like she did in her thigh
fat from the bone marrow
'can travel up and damage the lungs.'
- Okay. - It can be very serious.
Why is she only on 21 percent oxygen?
I had it at 100.
- Somebody turned off the O2. - What?
I mean, that would explain it.
(Taggart) 'I had the rate at 16 after the ABG.'
Oh, God, please.
(Gates) 'Sure you didn't fiddle with the FIO2?'
No. I mean, I don't think so.
It is a touch screen, though. I could've--
Has this happened before?
No.
Alright, repeat a blood gas in 20 minutes.
Gates, recheck Doppler pulses
in her foot and call Ortho
and see how long before they can take her to the OR.
You people should have been in here
instead of outside grilling me.
I'm not so sure if the mom pushed her.
You heard her.
Yeah, she said, "She pushed me."
I think it was the daughter.
- What, the 12-year-old? - Mm-hmm.
The mother displays all the
classic signs of child abuse.
Unrealistic expectations.
She moves around a lot. She's unemployed.
- Dr. Gates. - Depression.
She was abused as a child.
Did you see the way she grabbed those kids?
I've seen it. I grew up with it.
Okay, okay.
We'll let Social Services decide.
Fine.
How's that board look?
Oh, we're down to 44 in the waiting room.
That's great. I mean, it's usually closer to 100.
And, uh, two tele admissions are going upstairs.
That'll free up some beds.
- So what's up? - No broken bones on the x-ray.
- Just a sprain. - Should I get a stirrup?
No, an ACE bandage is fine.
You know the drill. Ice, rest, elevation--
And early weight bearing
gives superior functional results
compared to immobilization.
2004, "Cochran Review."
Are you back in school for physical therapy?
- Started a month ago. - Great.
[sighs] All set.
Well, it was, uh, great seeing you again...Christine.
Hopefully you'll stay on the pilates machine next time.
[laughing] Uh, yeah, I'll try.
- Oh, here. - Oh, uh, thank you.
Look, I was just wondering if..
...maybe you were free later.
Oh, um..
Well, I'm-I'm-I'm..
I'm flattered, Christine, but, um..
we have a policy against dating patients.
Technically, she's my patient.
Yeah... well, I'm sorry.
- 'I can't.' - 'Dr. Morris?'
I can't.
Well..
Here.
If you change your mind..
...call me.
Thank you.
What the hell was that about?
(Rasgotra) 'Suction, Andrew.'
Let's hope we don't have to access the aorta.
I'll divert the tube to the left main stem.
(Andrew) 'Why would you do that?'
Makes it easier for Neela
to clamp the right hilum.
(Neela) 'Fifth unit is up.'
Okay...Satinsky to Neela.
That's better.
I see the hilum.
She's not perfusing.
And we're clamped.
- More suction. - Breath sounds on the left.
Good call. Looks dry.
- Heart rate up to 50. - Got a femoral pulse.
- That's good, right? - It's great.
- It's excellent. - Okay, page Ortho.
We're gonna meet them in the OR.
- Can we follow? - You stay here.
Until you prove you're not drunk
I don't want you anywhere near your mother.
She likes salsa dancing and screwball comedies.
You hurt her, I'll remove your gallbladder.
- Not good. - She implicated the mother?
Yells, loses her temper
from time to time, spanks them.
I need to get Child Protective Services involved.
Think you'll be able to keep the kids together?
Since the dad's not in the picture, Claire will probably
'go into foster care. By the time her sister's released'
'maybe a relative will step up and take them.'
If all goes well, she'll be discharged in a week.
Great, I'll start the paperwork.
Well...that's settled.
This blood test will show us your alcohol level.
Which will be zero.
Look, can you guys rush this
so my dad can calm down?
One test is not gonna solve the problem.
Trust me, I know.
Alright, you're all set.
Your mom will be out of surgery in a couple hours.
I'll go get some coffee, give my dad some space.
Hate to get all"Jerry Springer" in the waiting room.
Thanks.
And back in Oz, we don't waste
tax dollars on family disputes.
We talk it out over a beer.
[Tracy chuckles]
Well, that was nice of you.
What's so funny?
Your accent. It's cute.
I dated this guy in New Zealand once.
I spent a summer there in college
teaching Maori kids science.
[chuckling] New Zealand?
It's...it's totally different.
Oh, well, if you say so.
The shopping sucked.
Do you miss Sydney?
Every now and again.
Where are you from?
Newton, Mass.
You didn't want to train at the Brigham?
No, I'm all about Michigan Avenue.
Get Banfield!
[intense music]
My God, what happened?
Get security.
I saw a piece of glass in Julie's leg
and I wanted to get it out with the tweezers
but I wanted to sterilize them with a flame first
so she didn't get an infection.
But I accidentally dropped it on the bed sheet.
Take her to another room and
don't let her leave your sight.
Looks like 15 percent body surface area
nothing circumferential.
'Let's go.'
I didn't mean it. I was just helping!
What should I do?
Hang another liter of Ringer's.
Dr. Brenner, call the burn unit.
And get back to your other patients.
Who are you, Stevie Wonder?
Did you see her smile, her legs?
- Isn't she lovely? - Forget lovely.
I'm not doing it.
Why? Give me one good reason.
You're gay. Not that there's anything wrong with that.
- I'm not gay. - You're seeing someone.
- She.. - Impotent?
She's a patient.
A technicality.
Do it for the team.
Okay, here it is, Sanchez, okay?
She's a call girl.
Yeah, a whore, an escort.
So it's even better than I thought.
[sighs]
We're all whores.
You prescribe antibiotics from some drug companies
that give you stethoscopes and free lunch...whore.
Hey, look.
I am done with dating, Ryan.
The last girl I really liked
took my heart to Caracas.
So you're just gonna sit on the sidelines forever?
Yeah, that's the plan.
- Then, I need another mentor. - Why?
Because I want someone who's well-rounded
and understands interpersonal relationships.
I understand them.
Then, get in the game, Archibald.
It's time.
Keep the Ringer's at 85 cc's per hour.
Ortho's ready for her in the OR
and then she has a burn unit bed.
Well, let's move her to Surgery.
Why does she need that?
They need to pin the femur.
- 'She gonna be okay?' - She's gonna be fine.
But we need to talk about something else.
I'm afraid Claire
is a danger to others, Mrs. O'Fallon.
No, it was an accident like she said.
There was no glass in Julie's leg.
How do you know if her legs were burned?
- Look, I realize this is hard. - Claire is a good kid.
Has she been depressed lately?
No. I mean, maybe a little.
Uh, her friend got hit by a car last spring
but I thought she was over that.
Someone from Psychiatry
needs to talk to her.
Why?
She's just acting out.
Well, we'll see if they agree.
And if they don't?
Then she might need to spend
some time in the hospital.
My kids are okay.
Claire's down the hall.
You're welcome to go be with her.
You know, physical and psychological things
can push kids to do all kinds of stuff.
I know, Dr. Gates.
And if this woman is hurting them
then all of this makes sense.
We're both trying to get to the bottom of it.
Go clear some patients.
[siren wailing]
You score any goals?
They got to go get pizza and see a movie
and I'm stuck here.
Why can't I go home?
You take that thing out?
No, it's my body
and I can do what I want with it.
Sarah, I know it's your body.
This is something we have to discuss.
You know, you're getting to that age where you
you know, you're starting to get curious about boys
and...sex.
What does a tongue stud have to do with sex?
Come on, Sarah, don't play dumb with me.
That's not why I got it.
Do you have a boyfriend?
No.
And I'm not having sex.
We thought it would be fun.
I was gonna do my belly button
but they bet me ten bucks to do my tongue.
Well, I'll give you 20 bucks to take it out.
Tony.
Listen, I want you to take that out
before you go back to school Monday.
Fine.
I think you're overreacting.
I know this is weird.
You know, and it's weird for me, too
but do me a favor.
Next time you think about..
...piercing something else on your body or..
...if you wanna talk about sex
then you come to me, okay?
'Cause I'm here for you.
I'll just wait over here.
Alright, give me a minute.
You know, it killed me
to put her in a nursing home.
After a while, I couldn't deny
that she put the eggs in the hamper
ice in the microwave.
Alzheimer's is hard.
No, it kills you.
She doesn't remember me half the time.
And him?
He can't even help out.
His blood alcohol level came back.
It was zero.
None detected.
The other driver ran a red light, Mr. Holmes.
Now, I know your son's made mistakes in the past
but let him show you that he's changed.
He's trying.
- How is she? - The surgery went well.
And we were able to repair her pulmonary artery and vein.
Good...that's good, right?
I mean, at her age, her rehab could be a while
but she's already starting to wake up.
Thank God.
When can I..
When can we see her?
Come on, I'll take you to Recovery.
That seems like a cause for a celebration.
"Bringing Up Baby" is playing at the Limelight.
We should...we should go.
I...can't. I'm working here late.
Or we could, we could grab a quick coffee
at the Jumbo Mart.
Think of it as an olive branch.
Alright, coffee it is.
Great. I will meet you out front in one hour.
Well, it's a good thing you weren't seriously hurt.
Been a few muggings recently in the area
that didn't end so well.
How much time will he get for this?
Depends on his priors.
You'll be called for a court date.
I don't have time for court.
Unless he takes a deal
it's the only way we can put him behind bars.
Here. If you have any questions...call me.
Thanks.
How you doing?
I'm fine, Dr. Morris.
You know, I don't get it.
You get mugged, you beat him up.
You're injured, but you still go through the day.
I don't buckle, Dr. Morris.
Okay.
Sometimes you might wanna give yourself a break.
[chuckling] No.
'Cause then I might have to give someone else one.
[door opens]
Just wait outside for me.
Mm-hmm, sure.
So how you doing, Claire?
I'm fine.
You know, you never told me what grade you were in.
Sixth.
What do you think of school?
It's boring.
You know, some kids, when they're bored
they cut class.
I've never done that.
Your mom said you did.
School's a waste of time.
I'm smarter than most of the teachers.
[chuckles]
How do you and your sister get along?
Okay.
She thinks she's going to the Olympics.
What happens when you fight?
My sister and I always fought.
It really sucks, 'cause she's always right.
She's little Miss Perfect..
...and even if she starts it, my mom always sides with her.
That must bug you.
It's every day.
If she breaks a plate, it's because I bumped into her.
How do you get back at someone for doing that?
Teach her a lesson.
By doing what?
Nothing.
Are you sure?
Claire, we have video cameras
in the ceilings of our trauma rooms.
We saw you adjust the ventilator
and light the sheet on fire.
I didn't want to kill her.
I just wanted to mess her up.
You did?
If she's in the hospital
Mom will see what a good girl I am.
She won't be blaming me for everything.
Is that why you pushed her off the wall?
Claire.
They're accusing your mother of child abuse.
'Which means she could go to jail'
'and your sister and you'
could both go to foster homes.
Now...something tells me
that she doesn't hit you two
and she didn't push your sister.
Did you do it, Claire?
Did you?
It was cool seeing her lying there..
...all pale, with blood coming out.
And then when she couldn't move
and her legs were getting burned..
...it was great.
That made you feel good?
Really good.
Hmm.
Well..
It'll probably be better
if you stay in the hospital for a while.
Why? I'm not sick.
We just think it would be a good idea.
No.
I won't.
I won't!
Wha..
No, I won't!
I won't! I won't!
- Claire, Claire! - I got her.
'Get me a gurney! Get me a gurney!'
- Mommy! - Call the Psych ward!
Mommy, we can hang out now that Julie is in the hospital.
What's happening?
Alright, Claire, relax, come on.
- Mommy, help me! - Claire, relax.
Let us take care of her, Ms. O'Fallon.
Relax. Get off of me!
.5 of Haldol, Ativan.
Get the hard restraints.
It's just for a short time, right?
Then I can take her home soon. She'll be alright.
I will kill you!
I will kill you!
I will kill you!
I'm gonna cut you up into little pieces!
I can't remember the last time
we did a right-sided thoracotomy.
That guy's lucky to be alive.
Well, I, uh, lost a trucker in Sydney
with a right hilar tear.
You miss it once, you never forget.
I guess you're right.
We should go, uh, salsa dancing sometime.
How do you know I like dancing and old comedies?
I do my research.
We're just gonna be friends.
I'm sorry if I gave you the wrong impression.
What...you mean sleeping with me?
An awkward shag... on a horrible day
doesn't count as... "sleeping with you."
It counts as poor judgment.
[sighing] You romantic fool.
I thought we fit well together.
Okay.
Alright. I'm not gonna hound you. I'm not gonna beg.
But one day you will wake up next to me
and you're gonna wonder
"How did this happen?"
and I'm gonna smile and remind you
that I predicted this over coffees
and chocolate-glazed doughnuts.
You're a cocky bastard.
Yeah, but I will be a correct..
...cocky bastard, and that's all that will matter.
You ready to go?
Are you alright?
Oh, Claire left her coat down here.
You know, about a month ago I, uh..
I caught her throwing rocks at the neighbor's dog
and then a few days later, she was trying to stick
a metal rod through one of the fish in our tank.
And I just tried to pretend it was normal.
You know, just a kid acting out.
I don't get it.
Why her? Why our family?
I don't know.
That's all you can say?
'You can't lie to me'
'and tell me that she's gonna be okay?'
That she's gonna grow up to be a normal girl?
[chuckles]
I mean, that's why we come here. To get answers.
You're gonna have to do better than that.
I'm sorry. That's all I have.
Well, that's not good enough, doctor.
That's not good enough.
[indistinct chattering]
