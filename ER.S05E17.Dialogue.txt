PREVIOUSLY ON E.R.:
HER HUSBAND FREAKED OUT...
CALLED 911, BUT WOULDN'T LET US IN.
SHE WAS BLEEDING ALL OVER.
Jeanie: ALL THIS TIME
I'M WORRYING ABOUT HIV AND I GET HEPATITIS "C"?
MY WIFE, IS SHE DEAD?
KERRY, CAN YOU GET MARK?
SURE, I CAN DO THAT.
AND SECURITY.
I'M GOING TO RESIGN.
YOU WANT HIM
TO GO? I LOVE HIM LIKE A BROTHER
BUT I CAN'T DO THIS ANYMORE.
IT'S TOO HARD.
I CAN'T REM-REMEMBER A TIME WHEN I DIDN'T LOVE HIM.
YOU'RE NOT COMING WITH ME, ARE YOU?
YOU GOT TO LOVE THIS NIGHT SHIFT.
NO, YOU DON'T.
HOW'S YOUR RIDE-ALONG?
IT HAS BEEN WILD.
FIRST, WE HAD THESE TWO OLD GUYS
SWIMMING NAKED IN THE LAKE, NEARLY FROZE THEIR, UH...
OKAY, THANK YOU, WE GET IT.
WE GOT THIS CRAZY LADY OUT IN THE RIG. OH, YEAH?
YEAH.
BRING YOUR COAT.
( coos )
Man: TRIED TO EAT THE LOVEBIRDS
AT THE DELAWARE HOTEL.
YOU'RE RIGHT.
SHE'S CRAZY.
( woman coos ) ACUTELY PSYCHOTIC.
SHE'S COMBATIVE.
SHE LOCKED HERSELF IN.
WE'LL TRY
A LITTLE HALDOL
BEFORE WE CALL FOR THE BOLT CUTTERS.
( straining ): ONE, TWO, THREE.
( squawks )
AH, WHAT DOES SHE THINK
SHE'S SOME KIND OF HAWK?
HAWKS ATTACK WITH THEIR CLAWS, JERRY
NOT THEIR TEETH.
SHE'S STARING AT ME.
MAYBE SHE LIKES YOU.
YOU'RE THREATENING HER WITH YOUR GAZE. LOOK AWAY.
I-I'M LOOKING AWAY.
( squawks ) FINE.
Woman: ...and you're looking at it right now
on Nicole's lovely wrist.
It's a winner.
It's a knockout.
It really is.
It's a bracelet that is memorable.
It's a bracelet you'll want to wear every single day.
It's wide, it's bold, it's beautiful
and you know what else?
It's reversible.
How hard would it be for you
to flip that over for me, Nicole?
Watch the other side.
Gorgeous-- matte gold on the other side.
This beautiful, soft, satiny matte gold finish
on the other side
and, then, a high-polished glam look on the front side...
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, YOU WANT ME TO WAIT FOR JERRY?
HE LIKES THIS KIND OF STUFF.
WHAT STUFF?
STRANGE DUDES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.
THEY'RE CALLED PATIENTS, MALIK, AND I'M NOT WAITING.
MR. KORNBERG, HI.
HI. I'M, UH, DR. WEAVER.
NICE TO MEET YOU.
NICE TO MEET YOU.
HERE YOU GO.
HE TWISTED HIS KNEE WRESTLING.
HUH, AT 3:00 IN THE MORNING?
NO, IN LAST NIGHT'S MATCH.
WASN'T SO BAD TILL I GOT UP TO PEE.
THEN IT REALLY STARTED HURTING.
OKAY, LET'S TAKE A LOOK.
HOW'D YOU DO IT, FLYING DROPKICK?
JACKKNIFE POWER BOMB.
I THOUGHT YOU GUYS NEVER REALLY GOT HURT.
WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN? MALIK...
NOW, COME ON, MAN, EVERYBODY KNOW PRO WRESTLING'S FAKE.
WHO ARE YOU CALLING FAKE?
MALIK, I THINK THAT'S ENOUGH.
YO, MAN
YOU AND YOUR BOYS ARE A BUNCH OF FAKES.
IS THAT RIGHT, YEAH?
I'LL SHOW YOU FAKE.
HEY, HEY! HEY, MAN!
HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY!
HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY!
Weaver: MR. KORNBERG, I SAID
PUT HIM DOWN RIGHT NOW!
( yelling )
OW!
CALL SECURITY!
I NEED SOME HELP HERE.
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
( laughing )
I GOT YOU GOOD.
OH, MAN.
I WISH JERRY COULD'VE SEEN THIS.
( laughing )
( laughing )
SORRY.
HE REALLY WANTED TO DO THAT.
HE AND HIS WIFE LEFT.
THEY SAID THEY'D ONLY BE A FEW MINUTES.
THEY PICKED A GREAT TIME.
MRS. FONG, DON'T WORRY.
YOU'RE FINE. YOU'RE FINE.
WE'RE TAKING YOU BACK TO YOUR ROOM NOW, OKAY?
IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?
YES, EVERYTHING'S FINE.
( speaking Mandarin )
( speaking Mandarin )
DID MY MOTHER HAVE
ANOTHER SEIZURE?
SHE DOESN'T REMEMBER WE TOLD HER WE WERE LEAVING.
SHE'S FINE.
SHE JUST GOT BACK FROM HER HEAD C.T.
IT'S BEST IF YOU STAY CLOSE.
I DON'T SPEAK CHINESE AND IT'S DIFFICULT
TO FIND AN INTERPRETER AT 4:30 IN THE MORNING.
WE NEEDED TO GET THE PO CHAI.
THE PO CHAI WHAT?
TO SETTLE HER STOMACH.
OH, I DON'T THINK SHE SHOULD TAKE THAT NOW.
IT'S ONLY HERBS THAT MAKE HER FEEL BETTER.
IF YOU DON'T MIND
I WOULD RATHER WAIT
UNTIL ALL THE TEST RESULTS COME BACK
BEFORE GIVING HER ANYTHING.
Carter: HOW'S SHE DOING?
HALDOL'S KICKED IN
AND MAINTENANCE IS HERE TO CUT OPEN THE CAGE.
PSYCH SHOULD BE DOWN IN A FEW MINUTES.
YO, JOHN, GOT TO GO.
OKAY. HEY, WE'RE SORRY TO DUMP HER ON YOU.
HEY, THAT'S OUR JOB.
CARTER, YOU WOULDN'T BE STEALING
THOSE SUPPLIES, WOULD YOU?
OF COURSE NOT.
THANK YOU, YOSH.
DIDN'T THINK SO.
MALIK...
AH, DR. WEAVER.
YEAH, ABOUT MR. KORNBERG...
YEAH, LOOK, I ASKED HIM FIRST.
HE COULD'VE SAID NO.
A PATIENT WITH A BAD KNEE
AND YOU WANT HIM TO DO TRICKS?
THAT'S WHAT THEY DO.
KORNBERG'S A MAJOR CONTENDER.
HE'S THE MAN.
OKAY, LET'S BREAK IT UP.
HEY, UH, LET ME GET ONE FOR MY MOM.
OKAY.
JERRY...
UH, OKAY, EVERYBODY, THAT'S IT FOR NOW.
NO, THAT'S IT, PERIOD.
YOU'RE LOOKING GOOD.
YOU READY TO TAKE ON THE HYBRID? OH, YEAH.
MALIK, I THINK
I CAN HANDLE THIS ON MY OWN, THANK YOU.
SURE.
MR. KORNBERG, I'M SORRY ABOUT ALL THIS ATTENTION.
THAT'S OKAY.
I'M USED TO IT.
OKAY, YOU HAVE SOME BLEEDING INSIDE THE KNEE.
SO, I'M GOING TO NUMB IT AND TAP THE JOINT.
THAT SHOULD DECREASE SOME OF THE PAIN.
I'VE HAD THAT DONE BEFORE.
OH, THIS ISN'T YOUR FIRST INJURY?
YOU NAME IT, I BROKE IT.
THAT SOUNDS LIKE A ROUGH SPORT.
LIVING ON THE ROAD 200 NIGHTS A YEAR
AND GETTING MOBBED BY 40,000 SCREAMING FANS
THAT'S WHAT'S ROUGH.
OH, I'VE ONLY SURFED BY ON CABLE, BUT IT...
YOU KNOW, IT SEEMS LIKE A PROFESSION FOR SHOWOFFS.
YOU DON'T... YOU DON'T LIKE THE CELEBRITY, HUH?
WELL, JUST GIVE THEM WHAT THEY WANT.
WHAT WOULD YOU RATHER DO?
YOU'D LAUGH IF I TOLD YOU.
I WILL TRY NOT TO.
I'D LIKE TO MOVE TO MONTANA...
LOTS OF LAND, PEACE AND QUIET.
OH.
YOU'D RAISE CATTLE?
NAH, I'D LIKE TO HAVE A FARM... GROW SUGAR BEETS.
REALLY.
GO AHEAD.
I'M-I'M NOT GOING TO LAUGH.
THAT'S OKAY. I DO.
OKAY...
THERE... DOES THAT FEEL BETTER?
OH, YEAH.
GOOD.
Doyle: GOING TO WAKE MALONEY?
NOT AT THIS HOUR.
HE ONLY GETS UP
FOR ADMISSIONS AND CODE BLUES.
WANT ME TO TALK TO THEM?
NO, I CAN DO IT.
UM, MR. AND MRS. FONG, I'M AFRAID I HAVE SOME BAD NEWS.
EMILY, WHY DON'T YOU GO INSIDE
AND KEEP YOUR GRANDMOTHER COMPANY?
IN A MINUTE.
I THINK IT'D BE BETTER IF YOU...
IT'S OKAY, DAD.
YES, MISS KNIGHT?
UH, YOUR MOTHER HAS A TUMOR IN HER LUNG
AND IT HAS SPREAD TO HER BRAIN.
THAT'S WHAT CAUSED THE SEIZURES.
IT'S CANCER AT A VERY ADVANCED STAGE.
OH, GOD.
I KNOW THIS NEWS IS DIFFICULT TO TAKE IN.
WE'VE KNOWN ABOUT THE CANCER FOR A YEAR.
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?
YOU WERE AWAY, AT SCHOOL.
YOU COULDN'T CALL?
UH, MAYBE IF YOU TAKE SOME TIME TO DISCUSS THIS...
WE DID NOT WANT TO UPSET YOU.
WELL, THIS IS WORSE, NOT EVEN KNOWING.
WHY DON'T I LET YOU TALK ABOUT THIS AND I WILL COME BACK
AND REVIEW THE RESULTS WITH YOUR MOTHER, OKAY?
THAT WON'T BE NECESSARY.
MY MOTHER DOES NOT KNOW
ABOUT THE CANCER.
Emily: YOU HAVEN'T TOLD HER?
WE'RE NOT GOING TO TELL HER.
SHE SHOULD BE SEEING AN ONCOLOGIST
AND GETTING TREATMENT.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY YOU'RE DOING THIS.
THIS NEWS WILL ONLY DEPRESS HER.
SHE WILL DIE SOONER FOR KNOWING.
RADIATION THERAPY CAN IMPROVE THE QUALITY
OF HER LIFE AND STOP THE SEIZURES
BUT SHE HAS TO BE INFORMED.
WE ARE NOT TELLING HER
AND WE DO NOT WANT YOU TO TELL HER.
YOU'RE RIGHT, MISS KNIGHT.
YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND.
CAN'T TALK TO THEM WHEN THEY'RE LIKE THIS.
LIKE WHAT?
TRADITIONAL.
I GUESS THAT'S THE POLITE WORD.
WHAT'S HER PROGNOSIS?
IT'S A STAGE-FOUR CANCER.
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
SHE PROBABLY HAS A FEW MONTHS.
WISH THEY'D TOLD ME.
I COULD'VE SPENT MORE TIME WITH HER.
YOU SAID SOMETHING ABOUT TREATMENT.
WELL, SHE COULD HAVE RADIATION THERAPY
AND MAYBE CHEMO, BUT I DON'T KNOW
HOW WE'D TREAT HER IF WE CAN'T TELL HER.
THEY THINK IF SHE HEARS
ABOUT THE CANCER, SHE'LL LOSE HER WILL
TO LIVE.
AND WHAT DO YOU THINK?
YOU THINK SHE'D WANT TO KNOW?
I THINK SHE'S A TOUGH LADY.
SHE'D WANT TO FIGHT THIS.
Weaver: MALIK, WHAT DO YOU GOT?
MR. KINGSLEY STARTED VOMITING AT 2:00 A.M.
I ATE THE STEAK TARTARE AT FLETCHER'S.
NEVER AGAIN.
STEAK WHAT?
RAW BEEF, RAW EGG YOLK.
( Malik groans )
START HIM
ON FIVE OF COMPAZINE, A LITER OF SALINE.
IS THAT WHO I THINK IT IS?
WHAT, YOU KNOW KORNBERG, MAN?
KNOW HIM?
HE'S THE BEST SINCE FREDDIE BLASSIE.
WAIT A MINUTE-- FREDDIE, WHO?
HE USED TO BITE THE HELL OUT OF HIS OPPONENTS' FOREHEADS
IN THE '60s.
OH, YOU'RE TOO YOUNG.
( moans )
JERRY, I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU
TO LEAVE MR. KORNBERG ALONE.
IT'S OKAY.
NO, IT'S NOT.
I'M TAKING HIM UP TO RADIOLOGY.
WELL, WHAT HAPPENED TO TRANSPORT?
THEY WERE BACKED UP, SO I THOUGHT
I'D LEND THEM A HAND.
HEY, DUDE, REMEMBER THAT ONE PAY-PER-VIEW
WHEN JERICHO MESSED UP YOUR SHOULDER
AND YOU WENT DOWN FOR A TWO COUNT?
YEAH.
YEAH, BUT YOU HAD TO COME BACK
WITH THE JACKHAMMER SLIDE SLAM, RIGHT?
THAT'S RIGHT.
KORNBERG'S THE BOMB.
( laughing ) JERRY...
OKAY, OKAY, COME ON, DUDE. MALIK...
HEY, HOW COME
YOU NEVER WRESTLED TAG-TEAM, MAN?
YOU AND STINGER WOULD BE UNBEATABLE.
HE'S GOT THAT CORNER DROP THAT'S LIKE...
( grunting )
AND YOU HAVE YOUR LEG-LOCK THING.
YOU KNOW, THE ONE...
I CALLED THE FLOOR.
BED'LL BE READY AT 7:00.
OKAY, THANKS.
( speaking Mandarin )
MRS. FONG, WHO DO YOU WANT
TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT YOUR HEALTH?
( speaking Mandarin )
( speaking Mandarin )
SHE SAYS TO TALK TO MY FATHER.
I DON'T KNOW
MAYBE WE SHOULDN'T DO THIS.
IF THERE IS ANY NEWS ABOUT YOUR CONDITION, GOOD OR BAD
WHO DO YOU WANT US TO TALK TO?
SHE SAYS A YEAR AGO
MY FATHER TOLD HER SHE HAD TUBERCULOSIS.
THEY MUST'VE TOLD HER THAT
INSTEAD OF TELLING HER SHE HAD CANCER.
CANCER?
Man: REPEAT--
UNIT 47 REQUESTING POLICE BACKUP
3800 BLOCK OF DREXEL.
SONS OF BITCHES, THEY THREATENED TO BURN DOWN MY BUILDING!
SETTLE DOWN, MR. LEONELLI.
Boy: YEAH, AND WE STILL MIGHT.
ONLY WAY WE KEEP WARM.
WHY DON'T YOU HAVE A SEAT UP HERE?
Carter: WHY DIDN'T YOU CALL THE COPS?
THEY'D HAUL HIS ASS OFF TO JAIL.
LANDLORDS CAN'T PULL THAT CRAP.
SHUT UP, FELONIA!
YOU HAVEN'T PAID
YOUR RENT IN TWO MONTHS.
TAKE THE OTHER SIDE.
MY GRANDMOTHER'S UPSTAIRS FREEZING TO DEATH.
GET A JOB, YOU DUMB ASS.
YOU'RE THE DUMB ASS.
HEY, BACK OFF!
LET'S GET HIM OUT OF HERE.
THEY COULD HAVE KILLED ME.
LOOK AT THIS.
TURN THE HEAT ON, MAN.
PAY YOUR RENT, I'LL TURN IT ON.
HEY, HEY!
THROW YOUR BEER BOTTLES AT ME.
( all clamoring )
TAKE IT EASY, EVERYBODY.
THIS ISN'T HELPING ANYTHING.
GET BACK.
WHITE, YOU OKAY?
YEAH, I GOT BLOOD IN MY EYES.
GET OUT OF HERE.
THEY'RE ANIMALS.
IS LARS TRYING TO BE A DIPLOMAT?
Lars: JUST BACK UP A STEP.
GET ME OUT OF HERE.
WHEN DID IT START, LILY?
ABOUT TWO MINUTES AGO.
Mr. Fong: SOMEBODY HELP HER.
I'VE GOT MORE ATIVAN.
PUSH ANOTHER TWO.
DO SOMETHING, PLEASE.
DILANTIN'S ON BOARD.
YOU DID THIS.
YOU UPSET HER.
WHAT'S HE TALKING ABOUT, LUCY?
YOU TOLD HER ABOUT THE CANCER.
LOOK WHAT IT'S DONE.
PULSE OX? 96.
WE ASKED YOU NOT TO, BUT YOU WOULDN'T LISTEN.
THIS IS YOUR FAULT.
ALL YOUR FAULT.
DISPATCH FROM RA-47, STILL WAITING FOR POLICE BACKUP.
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.
NOW YOU'RE TALKING.
LARS OKAY?
I DON'T KNOW.
HE'S ALL RIGHT.
HE'S HAVING TROUBLE GETTING THROUGH.
THEY DON'T WANT HIM, THEY WANT YOU.
GET OUT OF HERE!
HOW DO YOU WORK THE P.A.?
BOTTOM BUTTON.
EVERYBODY STAND AWAY FROM THE VEHICLE.
We're coming through.
STEP BACK FROM THE VEHICLE.
STAND BACK!
WE'RE COMING THROUGH.
Get off the car.
Everybody, please stand back.
GET AWAY FROM THE RIG.
COMING THROUGH, NICE AND EASY.
Nice and easy, that's it.
Carter: WHAT WAS THAT?
I DON'T KNOW.
I THINK WE RAN OVER SOMETHING.
IT MUST'VE BEEN THE CURB.
LOOK OUT THE BACK.
THERE'S A GUY DOWN. LARS IS WITH HIM.
DID I RUN HIM OVER?
I DON'T KNOW.
WE GOT TO STOP.
WE GOT TO GO.
WE GOT TO PICK HIM UP.
THEY'LL FINISH THIS GUY OFF FIRST.
OH, GOD.
White: THIS IS UNIT 47
REQUESTING SECOND PARAMEDIC UNIT
3800 BLOCK OF DREXEL.
A MAN IS DOWN.
AMBULANCE VERSUS PEDESTRIAN.
OH, GOD.
MORNING!
HEY, MARK.
ANOTHER HEADACHE?
SAME AS YESTERDAY.
MMM.
DID IT EVER GO AWAY?
IN THE AFTERNOON.
LIKE I SAID YESTERDAY, YOU SHOULD LET ME DO A C.T.
I DON'T NEED A HEAD C.T., MARK.
WELL, AT LEAST LET ME DO A NEURO EXAM.
MARK, YOU HAVE TO STOP THINKING LIKE A DOCTOR.
WE BOTH KNOW WHAT'S CAUSING THESE HEADACHES.
HOW'S YOUR INSOMNIA?
IT'S GONE.
( groaning ): DID YOU TALK TO HIM?
NO. WE BOTH THOUGHT IT WAS BETTER
NOT CALLING FOR A WHILE, YOU KNOW?
GIVE IT SOME TIME.
YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T NEED ME TO TELL YOU THIS
BUT IT'S OKAY FOR YOU TO MISS HIM.
HELL, I MISS HIM.
I KNOW.
I'M OKAY, THOUGH, YOU KNOW?
I-I ACTUALLY LIKE COMING TO WORK.
REALLY? NOW I AM
WORRIED ABOUT YOU.
MOVE OVER.
THESE GUYS SAVED MY ASS-- THEY REALLY DID.
IF YOU'D TURNED ON THE HEAT, WE WOULDN'T HAVE HAD TO.
Weaver: DR. CARTER.
HE'S GOT NO NEURO DEFICITS.
JUST THAT HEAD LAC. WHAT HAPPENED?
MR. LEONELLI DECIDED TO INSTIGATE A LITTLE CIVIL UNREST.
YOUR TYPICAL "ANGRY MOB" KIND OF THING.
THEY STARTED IT, NOT ME.
DISPATCH, CAN YOU TELL ME
WHAT UNIT WAS SENT TO 38th AND DREXEL?
THEY STILL ON-SCENE? WHAT'S THEIR E.T.A.?
HERE. YOU SHOULD CHANGE THAT.
OH, THANKS.
OKAY, FOLLOW MY FINGER WITH YOUR EYES.
HERE WE GO. GOOD.
THIS TIME'S GOING TO TEACH THEM A LESSON, ISN'T IT?
THE LESSON, MR. LEONELLI, IS YOU NEED TO FIGURE OUT A BETTER WAY
OF DEALING WITH YOUR TENANTS. CARTER, OUTSIDE.
WHAT DO YOU KNOW? THEY DON'T PAY THEIR RENT.
THEY LEAVE THE PLACE A MESS!
SO TURNING OFF THE HEAT-- THAT'S THE WAY
TO SOLVE THAT?
CARTER, I SAID OUTSIDE, NOW.
THERE SEEMS TO BE A PROBLEM WITH THIS PATIENT.
HE'LL BE FINE.
WELL, THEN, THE PROBLEM'S WITH YOU.
SO WHY DON'T YOU GO COOL OFF
AND I'LL FINISH HIM UP?
GO ON.
WILL SHE WAKE UP?
IT'S HARD TO SAY.
AND IF SHE DOES
WILL THERE BE PERMANENT DAMAGE?
AFTER A PROLONGED SEIZURE
THERE COULD BE SOME CONFUSION OR MEMORY LOSS.
SHE COULD HAVE HAD A STROKE.
UH, I WANT TO TALK TO A MORE SENIOR PHYSICIAN.
I'M NOT HAPPY WITH HER CARE.
EVERYTHING WAS DONE PROPERLY, MR. FONG.
A MEDICINE ATTENDING WILL SEE HER WHEN SHE'S UPSTAIRS
AND WE'LL CHECK BACK IN A WHILE.
...PICKS HIM UP, THROWS HIM DOWN...
I TOOK MR. LEONELLI TO X RAY.
HE'LL BE THERE FOR A WHILE.
EH, THANKS. THANKS, YOSH.
Jerry: GOOD MORNING. ALWAYS A PLEASURE
TO WELCOME THE DAY SHIFT.
HEY, JERRY, WHAT'S WITH THE BOXES?
THEY'RE FOR PEDES.
WELL, WHY AREN'T THEY IN THE PEDES ROOM?
THEY'RE ADDRESSED TO DR. ROSS, SO I'M NOT SURE
IF I'M SUPPOSED TO KEEP THEM OR SEND THEM SOMEWHERE ELSE.
JERRY, WE'RE STILL SEEING KIDS
JUST LIKE WE DID BEFORE WE HAD A PEDES ATTENDING.
COME ON, JERRY. HELP ME WITH THE BOXES.
SO, KERRY, HOW WAS THE GRAVEYARD SHIFT?
WELL, IT WAS FAIRLY TYPICAL.
JUST A FEW "STRANGE DUDES" AS MALIK WOULD SAY--
INCLUDING DR. CARTER.
OH, I THOUGHT HE WAS ON A RIDE-ALONG.
( sighing ): HE WAS.
DR. CARTER, WE WERE TALKING ABOUT YOU. DID YOU SETTLE DOWN?
YEAH. WELL, MR. LEONELLI'S BACK IN X RAY
IF YOU WANT TO TELL HIM THAT YOU'RE SORRY...
I GOT A BIGGER PROBLEM.
WE GOT AN M.V.A. COMING IN.
AMBULANCE VERSUS PEDESTRIAN, AND WE WERE THE AMBULANCE.
JUST, UH, SET THEM DOWN HERE?
YEAH. ANYWHERE'S FINE.
THANKS, JER.
SURE.
AVERY CAMPBELL, 17, CRUSHED PELVIS.
B.P., 70 AT THE SCENE
UP TO 80 WITH TWO LITERS.
LARS, ARE YOU OKAY?
YEAH. I'M FINE.
THEY WEREN'T MAD AT ME.
THIS GUY NEEDS AN AIRWAY.
OKAY. ONE OF PAVULON, TWO OF VERSED, 100 OF SUX.
NUMBER EIGHT E.T. TUBE.
C.B.C., TYPE AND CROSS FOR EIGHT.
CHEM 20. LET'S GET A PORTABLE CHEST.
A.P. PELVIS IN PREP FOR A CENTRAL LINE.
B.P. 75 PALP, PULSE OX 88.
TWO UNITS OF O-NEG.
WHAT DO WE GOT?
Greene: AMBULANCE RAN OVER THIS GUY'S PELVIS.
HOPE YOU WEREN'T DRIVING, DORIS.
NO. IT WAS ME.
AND YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO DRIVE.
I KNOW THAT. ARE YOU IN?
YEAH, I'M IN. BAG HIM.
WHERE WERE THE PARAMEDICS?
I GOT TRAPPED OUTSIDE IN THE CROWD.
HOW'S THE AIRWAY?
GOOD BREATH SOUNDS.
WHAT ABOUT ZADRO?
HE WAS BLEEDING. COULDN'T SEE.
BLOOD AT THE MEATUS.
DAMN. COULD HAVE TORN HIS URETHRA. I'LL PREP FOR
A RETROGRADE URETHROGRAM.
I'LL NEED A SUPRAUMBILICAL
PERITONEAL LAVAGE.
WHY DIDN'T YOU CALL THE COPS? WE DID.
WHY DIDN'T YOU WAIT FOR THEM?
HOOK THIS UP TO THE RAPID INFUSER.
I NEED BETADINE, STERILE GLOVES AND A FOLEY.
COME ON!
HEY, JEANIE.
GOOD MORNING.
GETTING SETTLED BACK IN?
YEAH. I'M DOING OKAY.
ANY SIDE EFFECTS FROM THE INTERFERON?
NO. GOOD.
MAYBE YOU SHOULD DO FAST TRACK TODAY--
SORE THROATS, SPRAINED ANKLES.
EASY STUFF.
I THINK I'LL STICK WITH TRIAGE AND PAPERWORK.
OKAY. UH, JEANIE...
AL CALLED HERE LAST NIGHT.
DID YOU SPEAK TO HIM?
YEAH. HE WAS UPSET ABOUT THE MESSAGE THAT YOU LEFT.
HE COULDN'T REACH YOU, SO...
YEAH. WELL, THANKS, KERRY, BUT I CAN HANDLE THIS.
I KNOW. IT'S JUST THAT HE SOUNDED CONCERNED.
RIGHT. WELL, I'VE HAD EVERY CONVERSATION WITH AL
I'LL EVER NEED TO HAVE.
I FIND OUT ON TOP OF EVERYTHING ELSE
THAT HE'S GIVEN ME HEPATITIS "C"
SO THERE'S REALLY NOTHING ELSE
TO TALK ABOUT.
I GOT TO COVER A MEETING FOR ROMANO
BUT DO YOU WANT TO GRAB A BITE TO EAT LATER?
NO, THANKS. I'M HAVING LUNCH WITH A FRIEND.
OKAY. SURE.
GOT A RUPTURED BLADDER AND AN OPEN BOOK FRACTURE.
LAVAGE IS NEGATIVE.
PRESSURE'S UP TO 95.
LET'S GET HIM TO ANGIO.
GOOD WORK, CARTER.
NOT OUT OF THE WOODS YET.
I'LL TRACK DOWN UROLOGY AND ORTHO
LET THEM KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON.
HIS DAD'S OUTSIDE. WANTS TO TALK TO SOMEONE.
I SHOULD DO THAT.
I DON'T THINK THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.
WELL, I WAS THERE. OH, RIGHT, I DID IT.
EXACTLY.
STILL, IT'S MY RESPONSIBILITY.
ALL RIGHT, BUT REMEMBER, YOU'RE THIS KID'S DOCTOR FIRST.
OKAY? ONLY TALK TO THE FATHER ABOUT HIS MEDICAL CONDITION.
OH, CARTER...
I WANT YOU AND ZADRO AND AUDIA TO FIND ME
AND FILL ME IN ON EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED, OKAY.
THAT WAY, I CAN DEFEND
YOUR ACTIONS TO THE POLICE
THE HOSPITAL ADMINISTRATION
FIRE DEPARTMENT, AND THE MEDIA, IF NECESSARY.
DOES THAT MAKE SENSE?
MR. CAMPBELL...
MY GOD. IS HE ALL RIGHT?
I'M DR. CARTER.
MR. CAMPBELL, AVERY'S GOT A BROKEN PELVIS
AND SOME INTERNAL BLEEDING.
DOES THAT MEAN YOU HAVE TO OPERATE?
NO. NOT NECESSARILY.
A RADIOLOGIST WILL USE A CATHETER
TO STOP THE BLEEDING IN HIS PELVIC ARTERIES.
HEY, AVERY...
UM, HOW LONG DOES THAT TAKE?
ABOUT AN HOUR OR SO.
THEY SAID AN AMBULANCE RAN HIM OVER.
IS THAT RIGHT?
UH... UH, I BELIEVE SO.
YEAH, BUT I MEAN, HOW COULD THAT HAPPEN, HUH?
AS I SAY, WE'LL KNOW MORE ABOUT HIS CONDITION
IN ABOUT AN HOUR.
SORRY, I DON'T MEAN TO BUG YOU
BUT... I SURE AS HELL AM GOING TO BUG SOMEBODY
BECAUSE SOMEBODY HERE'S GOING TO HAVE TO PAY FOR THAT.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, DOCTOR, OKAY.
LOOKS GOOD, DEBBIE.
ANY PAIN?
IT'S BEEN KIND OF THROBBING.
I HAD A LOT OF TROUBLE SLEEPING.
THAT SHOULDN'T LAST FOR LONG.
WILL IT BE GONE BY TONIGHT?
I MEAN, A LOT OF TROUBLE.
WE'LL GIVE YOU SOMETHING.
JEANIE, LET'S WRITE HER FOR A FEW VICODIN.
I'LL SEE YOU IN THE OFFICE IN TWO DAYS.
DO I KEEP THE SPLINT ON?
YEAH. YOU HAVE TO LET THE TENDON HEAL.
WHERE'S MY PRESCRIPTION PAD?
DID YOU DROP IT?
I HATE WHEN THIS HAPPENS.
CAROL, HOW'S YOUR HEADACHE?
OH, NOT BAD.
YEAH? STILL THERE?
MARK, YOU HAVE TO STOP TREATING ME LIKE I HAVE A BRAIN TUMOR.
OKAY. OKAY. JERRY, WHO IS THAT
BIG GUY OVER THERE IN CURTAIN AREA TWO?
HE LOOKS FAMILIAR.
YEAH, NO KIDDING HE LOOKS FAMILIAR.
IT'S KORNBERG.
OH, RIGHT, THAT'S WHO IT IS.
I HATE TO BE SUCH A GIRL, BUT...
WHO'S KORNBERG?
USED TO BE A DEFENSIVE END FOR THE DENVER BRONCOS.
OH. IF ANYBODY NEEDS ME, I'M IN THE SUTURE ROOM.
OBVIOUSLY, DR. GREENE IS NOT A WRESTLING FAN.
WHAT?
JERRY, WOULD YOU HAND ME A PEN, PLEASE?
SURE. THANK YOU.
PHARMACY'S ON THE SECOND FLOOR.
HERE YOU GO.
THANK YOU.
SO, UH, DID YOU GET MY MESSAGE ABOUT SATURDAY NIGHT?
YEAH. I'VE BEEN MEANING TO CALL.
I'M AFRAID I CAN'T MAKE IT.
REALLY? I HAVE RESERVATIONS AT CHARLIE TROTTER'S.
THAT SOUNDS GREAT, BUT I CAN'T.
LET'S DO IT SUNDAY, IF THAT'S BETTER.
ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW, GRAHAM, I NEED
TO TELL YOU SOMETHING.
I FEEL REALLY AWKWARD
BECAUSE I SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE UP FRONT
FROM THE GET GO, BUT, UH...
I'M SEEING SOMEONE ELSE.
OH.
RIGHT.
I'M SORRY.
I'LL SEE YOU AROUND, THEN.
YEAH.
Wright: HELLO. CAN WE HELP YOU?
( alarm blaring )
DOES THIS THING EVEN WORK?
USED TO.
JERRY, WHAT DID YOU DO?
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.
IT'S THE ALARM INSIDE THE BATHROOM.
HELLO. WHICH BATHROOM?
TRAUMA HALLWAY.
INTERCOM DOESN'T SEEM TO WORK.
OH, MY GOD. I SENT MR. KINGSLEY IN THERE FOR A STOOL SAMPLE.
HAVE YOU SEEN MR. KINGSLEY?
HE WASN'T FEELING SO WELL.
IT'S PROBABLY JUST A FALSE ALARM, RIGHT?
MR. KINGSLEY!
MR. KINGSLEY, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
LET ME SEE.
IT'S DEFINITELY LOCKED.
WHERE'S THE KEY?
WHAT? I'M SUPPOSED TO HAVE IT?
CALL SECURITY!
HE MAY HAVE VASO-VAGALLED AND PASSED OUT.
HE COULD HAVE HAD AN M.I.
MIGHT BE DEAD.
JERRY! MR. KINGSLEY!
WE NEED TO GET THIS DOOR OPEN RIGHT NOW.
EXCUSE ME. STAND BACK.
( yelling )
MR. KINGSLEY!
LYDIA, GET A GURNEY!
DUDE, THAT WAS AWESOME.
MR. KORNBERG, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
YEAH.
MAKE IT TWO GURNEYS.
MAN, ALL THE GOOD STUFF
HAPPENS ON THE NIGHT SHIFT.
THIS PHOTO'S GOING TO BE FRAMED
AND PUT UP ON THE MANTELPIECE.
THE UNBEATABLE TAG TEAM OF MARKOVIC AND KORNBERG.
OH, I DON'T THINK SO, JER.
WHAT? I COULD HAVE BEEN A CONTENDER.
I'M THE TRANSPORT, COUNTY JAIL.
I'M LOOKING FOR DR. MARK GREENE.
I'VE GOT AN INMATE HE'S TREATED BEFORE.
MOBILAJE EKABO.
MOBALAGE.
HASN'T BEEN EATING OR DRINKING.
HE'S DEHYDRATED.
WE NEED TO GET HIM ON I.V. FLUIDS.
RANDI, GET MARK GREENE.
HEY, CARTER, IS THIS THE KID?
HOW'S HE DOING?
YEAH. NO, HE'S... HANG ONE SECOND.
MR. LEONELLI?
I JUST WANT TO APOLOGIZE.
I THINK IN ALL THE EXCITEMENT EARLIER
I GOT A LITTLE HEATED
AND I DIDN'T MEAN TO TAKE IT OUT ON YOU.
KID, I GOT THICKER SKIN THAN THAT.
IT'LL BE A HELL OF A DAY WHEN I LET SOME
DO-GOODER BABY DOC GET TO ME.
RIGHT. SO YOU'RE FEELING BETTER?
FEELING GREAT.
GOING TO HAVE A NICE, BIG SCAR
TO SHOW THE JUDGE
WHEN I TAKE THESE FREELOADING BASTARDS TO COURT.
Greene: HOW'S AVERY DOING?
Wright: TAKING HIM UP TO THE O.R.
THEY EMBOLIZED THE BLEEDERS
AND HIS PRESSURE'S UP TO 120.
WHAT ABOUT HIS SPINE?
HE STARTED MOVING HIS LEGS IN RADIOLOGY.
SO HE'S GOING TO MAKE IT?
HE'LL BE UP IN A COUPLE OF WEEKS.
THANK GOD. EXCELLENT.
NICE WORK, CARTER.
WE NEEDED A GOOD OUTCOME ON THIS.
DR. GREENE?
CAROL IS LOOKING FOR YOU.
ALL RIGHT.
WHY DID YOU EVEN TRY THAT?
WHEN YOU'RE MY SIZE, IT'S KIND OF EXPECTED.
LIKE SIGNING AUTOGRAPHS, HUH?
YEAH. DON'T HURT ANYBODY'S FEELINGS.
KEEP EVERYONE HAPPY.
EVEN IF IT DOESN'T MAKE YOU HAPPY?
NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT IT.
GROWING UP, I WAS THE BIG GUY.
COACHES WANTED ME TO PLAY FOOTBALL AND WRESTLE.
FRIENDS ASKED ME TO HELP THEM MOVE.
I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MANY TIMES I PLAYED SANTA CLAUS.
SO, YOU DO.
HAS HE SAID ANYTHING?
NOTHING.
SHERIFF SAID HE HASN'T SPOKEN
SINCE HIS FIRST DAY IN JAIL.
CAN YOU UNDO THAT, PLEASE?
Guard: SURE.
Greene: HI, MOBALAGE.
HOW YOU DOING?
LISTEN, YOU'RE DEHYDRATED
AND WE NEED YOUR PERMISSION TO GIVE YOU INTRAVENOUS FLUIDS.
DO YOU HAVE ANY OBJECTIONS?
HAS ANYONE FILLED
YOU IN ON KUBBY?
SHE'S UPSTAIRS IN THE INTENSIVE CARE UNIT.
THE SURGERY WENT WELL, BUT SHE'S IN A COMA.
HOWEVER, THERE'S A VERY GOOD CHANCE
THAT SHE'LL WAKE UP.
YOU'LL FEEL A LITTLE NEEDLE STICK.
I'VE SEEN HOW MUCH YOU LOVE YOUR WIFE, MOBALAGE.
I KNOW YOU DIDN'T INTEND TO HURT HER.
I BELIEVE THAT YOUR RESPONSE WAS OUT OF YOUR CONTROL.
ALL WE WANT TO DO IS HELP YOU.
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?
MY FATHER DIDN'T WANT ME TO GET YOU.
MY GRANDMOTHER WOKE UP, BUT SHE'S VERY CONFUSED.
THE FACT THAT SHE'S CONSCIOUS IS A GOOD SIGN.
( all speaking Mandarin )
SHE DOESN'T EVEN REMEMBER COMING TO THE HOSPITAL.
WELL, THERE'S BEEN SOME MEMORY LOSS.
TELL HER SHE HAD A SEIZURE.
I WANT ANOTHER DOCTOR.
MR. FONG...
I'M JUST TRYING TO HELP YOUR MOTHER.
ALL I'M ASKING YOU TO DO
IS TO TELL HER THAT SHE HAD A SEIZURE.
( speaking Mandarin )
( speaking Mandarin )
SHE WANTS TO KNOW WHY.
WHAT YOU'VE EXPERIENCED IS FAIRLY COMMON
SO YOU DON'T NEED TO WORRY.
YOU HAD A SEIZURE
BECAUSE YOU HAVE A CONDITION CALLED EPILEPSY
BUT YOU'RE GOING TO BE FINE.
THANK YOU, DOCTOR.
( phone ringing )
E.R.
JEANIE, YOU GOT A CALL ON LINE THREE.
SOME PHARMACY.
OKAY.
HI.
THANKS. HI.
HOW CAN IT BE THIS COLD IN MARCH?
YEAH. I'VE GOT A PHONE CALL.
THAT'S OKAY. I'M JUST DOING
A REPORT ON A D.U.I. I BROUGHT IN EARLIER.
I'LL CATCH YOU LATER.
OKAY. ALL RIGHT.
THIS IS JEANIE BOULET.
YEAH, IT WAS A PRESCRIPTION FOR, UH, DEBBIE ANDERSON.
SHE WAS IN HERE EARLIER WITH A HAND LACERATION.
NO. IT'S FOR FOUR TABLETS, NOT 40.
CAN YOU FAX IT OVER?
OKAY. JUST SEND HER BACK HERE.
WE'LL TAKE CARE OF IT.
THANK YOU.
RANDI, LET ME KNOW WHEN A FAX COMES IN
FROM BLUE HILLS PHARMACY.
ELIZABETH, I WAS JUST ABOUT TO TRY CALLING YOU.
ABOUT KUBBY EKABO? HOW'D YOU KNOW?
I HEARD HER HUSBAND CAME IN.
SHE'S HAD SOME SPONTANEOUS EYE OPENING.
THAT IS A GOOD SIGN.
YEP. HOW'S HE DOING?
LET'S JUST SAY I DON'T FEEL SO BAD
HAVING INSOMNIA AND HEADACHES.
YOU'RE HAVING HEADACHES?
I THOUGHT OF ANOTHER REASON YOU'D BE HAVING THOSE.
MARK'S TRYING TO CURE ME.
CARBON MONOXIDE
POISONING. YOU HAVE AN OLD HOUSE?
YES, SHE DOES. FAULTY FURNACE.
NOT VENTING THE EXHAUST.
YOU WAKE UP WITH THEM?
YES, SHE DOES.
COULD BE THAT, THEN.
WE... WE SHOULD GET A CARBOXYHEMOGLOBIN.
WHO'S ON FOR TRAUMA? I AM.
IF YOU NEED ME.
12-YEAR-OLD, TEN-FOOT FALL
FIVE MINUTES OUT.
I'M GOING TO NEED YOU.
EXCUSE ME?
SIR?
EXCUSE ME.
I, I'M GOING TO HAVE TO ASK YOU
TO LEAVE MR. KORNBERG ALONE.
I AM MR. KORNBERG.
SENIOR.
HEY, DOC
THIS IS MY DAD. HOW DO YOU DO?
HOW DO YOU DO?
AND HIS BIGGEST FAN.
THANK YOU, DOCTOR
FOR TAKING WONDERFUL CARE OF MY BOY, EXCEPT WE'LL WANT
HIS TRAINER TO LOOK AT THAT HAND.
DAD, REALLY, I'M FINE.
YOU KNOW, I'M SO SORRY
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED.
NONSENSE.
MY SON PERFORMED A MITZVAH.
UH, AN ACT OF VIRTUE.
YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE WHAT A PUBLICIST
CAN DO WITH THAT.
UH, BY THE WAY, DO YOU HAVE, UH, A CHILDREN'S WARD?
YES. UPSTAIRS.
GOOD.
WE'RE GOING.
EXCUSE ME?
VISIT THE SICK KIDS.
NO. I'M SORRY, HE NEEDS...
HE NEEDS TO REST.
HE CAN'T SHAKE HANDS WITH A FEW
UNFORTUNATE CHILDREN?
BRING A LITTLE JOY INTO THEIR LIVES?
FOR MILLIONS, MY SON IS A HERO.
MARCI CANCHOLA.
FELL FROM A SECOND STORY BALCONY
RIGHT ONTO A WROUGHT IRON FENCE.
FIRE DEPARTMENT CUT IT AWAY.
GOOD VITALS, BUT NO ROOM TO INTUBATE.
OKAY, EVERYBODY, LET'S DO THIS NICE AND GENTLE.
READY, AND GO.
I NEED SUCTION.
DON'T WORRY, WE'RE GOING TO TAKE GOOD CARE OF YOU.
PARENTS ARE ON THE WAY, IN HYSTERICS.
I NEED A FULL TRAUMA PANEL.
TYPE AND CROSS FOR FOUR.
I CAN'T GET A LARYNGOSCOPE IN HERE.
NO ROOM FOR A CRIKE.
GET A FIBEROPTIC SCOPE
AND A NUMBER SIX E.T. TUBE.
PULSE OX IS 92.
OXYGEN UP TO 15 LITERS.
B.P.'s 100 PALP.
PULSE 120.
OKAY... HIGH ON THE SUCTION.
PULSE OX DOWN TO 87.
HURRY UP, MARK.
UH... I CAN'T SEE.
NO, I CAN'T SEE A THING.
THERE'S TOO MUCH BLOOD.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
PREP THE NECK.
( running footsteps )
I NEED SUCTION. I CAN'T SEE THE CORDS.
Corday: PULSE OX IS STILL FALLING.
Oligario: B.P.'s DOWN TO 70 PALP.
I'VE GOT A PEDIATRIC NEEDLE CRIKE KIT.
DOUG ORDERED THEM.
TRY AND GET THE NEEDLE IN.
Greene: SHE'S THROWING P.V.C.s.
PULSE OX IS 85.
ASPIRATE AIR.
MAKE SURE YOU'RE IN THE TRACHEA.
NOW IT'S JUST THE SELDINGER TECHNIQUE
WITH A GUIDE WIRE.
OKAY...
TUBE, PLEASE?
RIGHT HERE.
GET READY TO BAG HER.
OKAY...
THAT'S PRETTY NIFTY.
GOOD BREATH SOUNDS.
PULSE OX IS UP TO 89.
DR. CORDAY, THEY NEED YOU
IN THE SICU.
OKAY, WE CAN TAKE IT FROM HERE.
OKAY.
GOOD THING THOSE SUPPLIES CAME IN TODAY, HUH?
YEAH. LOOKS LIKE DOUG JUST SAVED ANOTHER KID.
ACTUALLY, CAROL, I'D SAY YOU DID.
YOU WANT ME TO ARREST HER?
WELL, SHE FORGED THE PRESCRIPTION.
CHANGED "FOUR" TO "40," F-O-U-R-T-Y.
THAT'S FRAUD, VIOLATION OF D.E.A. LAWS.
IF I ARREST HER, YOU'LL HAVE TO FILE A REPORT
SPEND TWO DAYS IN COURT
THEN WATCH THE JUDGE THROW THE CASE OUT OF COURT
BECAUSE IT'S PROBABLY A FIRST OFFENSE. GREAT. ARREST HER.
MY ADVICE? WRITE A NEW SCRIPT FOR FIVE PILLS.
SHE CAN'T CHANGE THAT TO "50"
SHE'S HAPPY, AND YOU CAN HAVE LUNCH WITH ME.
I CAN'T HAVE LUNCH WITH YOU.
THEN DINNER.
I CAN'T.
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO TAKE THIS OUT ON ME, ARE YOU?
NO, REGGIE.
IT'S JUST... YOU KNOW, I NEED TO TELL YOU SOMETHING.
I HAVEN'T BEEN COMPLETELY HONEST WITH YOU.
NO TIME LIKE THE PRESENT.
I'M SEEING SOMEONE ELSE.
I THOUGHT WE HAD SOMETHING GOING HERE.
I KNOW, AND I'M SORRY.
IT'S JUST... IT JUST ISN'T GOING TO WORK OUT.
I NEED TO GET BACK TO WORK.
CAN WE AT LEAST TALK ABOUT THIS LATER?
I DON'T THINK SO.
I'M GOING TO CALL YOU.
County, this is Zadro of Rescue 47.
My partner's been shot.
47, WHAT ARE THE VITAL SIGNS?
I can't get them.
It's bad. He's unconscious.
HEY, ZADRO, THIS IS CARTER.
WHAT HAPPENED?
We got ambushed. They shot Lars.
SHOT HIM WHERE? WHERE ARE HIS WOUNDS?
I can't tell. There's blood everywhere.
ALL RIGHT, WELL, JUST GET HERE, GET HERE.
LUNGS SOUND GOOD.
HI, KUBBY.
HOW YOU FEELING?
DR. GREENE
WHERE IS MY HUSBAND?
KUBBY...
YOU WERE STABBED AND YOU'VE BEEN IN A COMA.
I DON'T THINK MOBALAGE INTENDED TO HURT YOU.
HE WASN'T HIMSELF.
OH, GOD...
MOBALAGE...
THAT IS NOT TRUE.
I THINK YOUR HUSBAND SUFFERS
FROM WHAT'S KNOWN AS POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS.
NO. HE DID NOT HURT ME.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
I WAN... I WANTED TO DIE.
I WAS SO ASHAMED...
I, I TOOK THE KNIFE...
I DID THIS.
( ambulance approaches )
OH, GOD.
GIVE ME A C-COLLAR.
LOOKS LIKE HEAD
NECK, CHEST.
I GOT A FAINT PULSE. READY WITH THE BACKBOARD.
HANG ON. HANG ON.
OKAY, SLIDE IT IN.
( grunting )
HOW'S HIS AIRWAY?
SHALLOW ARREST.
GET READY TO BAG, CONNIE.
OKAY, LET'S MOVE!
ALL RIGHT, VERY CAREFUL.
CHEST TUBE'S IN. WHAT'S HIS PRESSURE?
80 PALP.
THORASEAL? WAIT A SECOND.
I'VE GOT THE SUBCLAVIAN.
LET'S HANG THE TYPE SPECIFIC.
SET UP ANOTHER CENTRAL LINE.
I'VE ALREADY GOT ONE. WE SHOULD HAVE TWO.
ONE IS ENOUGH.
WHAT IF IT INFILTRATES?
IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.
EVEN IF IT DOES
WE'VE GOT TWO LARGE-BORE ANTECUBITALS.
HOW'S HE DOING?
GETTING READY TO GO TO THE O.R.
CAME AROUND THE CORNER, THERE THEY WERE
JUST WAITING FOR US.
WAS LARS DRIVING?
IT WENT DOWN SO FAST, I COULDN'T...
DWIGHT, WAS LARS DRIVING?
YEAH.
THEY WERE SHOOTING FOR ME.
I WAS DRIVING LAST NIGHT.
THEY WANTED ME.
MR. KORNBERG...
YOU WERE LOOKING FOR ME?
I JUST WANTED TO SAY THANK YOU.
WE'RE GOING TO BE LEAVING NOW
AS SOON AS MY DAD GETS DONE WITH THAT PHOTOGRAPHER.
OH, PHOTOS FROM THE PEDIATRICS WARD, HUH?
NURSES HANDED OUT THESE BALLOONS.
LITTLE BOY INSISTED I HAVE HIS.
YOU CAN'T GET AWAY FROM IT, CAN YOU?
THE KIDS ALL SEEM TO KNOW WHO I AM.
THEIR FACES LIGHT UP.
PLUS, IT MAKES MY DAD PROUD.
YOU KNOW HOW PARENTS CAN BE.
THANKS AGAIN, DOC.
TAKE CARE.
YOU'RE WELCOME.
Zadro: I WANT TO GO IN.
LET US DO OUR WORK.
WE'LL EXPLORE THE CHEST, STOP THE BLEEDING
THEN GET THE NEUROSURGEON WORKING...
LET ME KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON.
I'LL BE WITH HIM THE WHOLE TIME.
YOU BETTER STAY HERE.
CARTER, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
SCRUBBING IN.
AREN'T YOU ON DUTY IN THE E.R.?
NO. I WORKED LAST NIGHT.
THAT WAS THE RIDE-ALONG
WITH THIS FELLA, RIGHT?
THAT'S RIGHT.
I DON'T THINK THERE'S ENOUGH ROOM.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
WE'VE GOT GENERAL SURGERY, NEUROSURGERY AND THORACIC
WORKING TOGETHER. I'LL SCRUB OUT IF I HAVE TO.
WE APPRECIATE YOUR CONCERN, DOCTOR
BUT IT MIGHT BE BEST
IF YOU WATCH FROM THE OBSERVATION GALLERY.
FEELING BETTER?
THE FLUIDS SHOULD HELP.
I TALKED TO KUBBY.
SHE WOKE UP, AND SHE'S DOING
MUCH BETTER.
SHE ALSO TOLD ME THAT YOU DIDN'T HURT HER.
WHEN THE PARAMEDICS SHOWED UP--
THE FLASHING LIGHTS AND THE SIRENS--
THE POUNDING ON THE DOOR--
THEY MUST HAVE SCARED YOU.
( quietly ): YES.
IS THAT WHY YOU RAN AWAY?
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL THE POLICE?
WHY DID YOU SAY IT WAS YOUR FAULT?
IT WAS MY FAULT, WHAT HAPPENED TO HER.
WHEN I LEFT NIGERIA
THE SOLDIERS CAME, AND THEY RAPED HER...
BECAUSE OF ME.
I HAD LEFT HER ALONE.
WHEN SHE TOLD ME
I COULDN'T LOOK AT HER.
I COULDN'T TALK TO HER.
SHE WAS ALONE AGAIN, AND THAT'S WHEN SHE TOOK THE...
SHE TOOK THE KNIFE.
SHE NEEDED ME...
BUT I HAD LEFT HER.
SHE NEEDS YOU NOW.
I NEED MORE SUCTION.
2-0 VICRYL.
OKAY. HE'S OOZING ALL OVER THE PLACE.
SHIRLEY, GIVE ME SOME F.F.P.
AND PLATELETS, NOW!
HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON IN THERE?
WHAT ARE THEY DOING?
I'M GOING TO THE BLOOD BANK.
ARE THEY USING THE CELL SAVER? YES.
HAVE THEY CALLED NEUROSURGERY?
I DON'T KNOW, CARTER.
I NEED TO GET BLOOD.
SHOULD WE SET UP FOR BYPASS?
NOT NECESSARY.
Anspaugh: THERE ARE NO INTERCARDIAC INJURIES.
VASCULAR CLAMP.
HAVE YOU CALLED NEUROSURGERY YET?
WE WILL, CARTER.
WE WILL.
YEAH, HI. I NEED NEUROSURGERY TO O.R. THREE, PLEASE.
O.R. THREE.
Hamer: WE TOOK HER STATEMENT.
D.A. AGREED TO DROP THE CHARGES.
I WISH IT WAS ALL GOOD NEWS.
WHAT'S UP?
IMMIGRATION SERVICE CONTACTED THE DEPARTMENT.
IT TURNS OUT MR. EKABO
CAME INTO THE COUNTRY ON A FORGED VISA.
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
HE'S AN ILLEGAL.
DON'T TELL ME YOU'LL TAKE HIM BACK TO JAIL.
NO, BUT THE I.N.S. WILL START A DEPORTATION HEARING.
TO SEND HIM BACK TO NIGERIA?
THAT'S THE WAY IT WORKS.
HEY, ARE YOU FROM NEUROSURGERY?
NO. RADIOLOGY. I GOT THE C.T.s
I'LL TAKE THESE.
UH, FILMS SHOW BULLET FRAGMENTS IN THE RIGHT PARIETAL LOBE.
NECK WOUND-- SHATTERED C4.
THANK YOU, DR. CARTER.
I DIDN'T KNOW WHETHER YOU'D BE ABLE TO READ THEM.
NEUROSURGERY WANTS THE FILMS. WHAT DID THEY SAY?
THEY SAID THEY WERE CALLED IN TOO SOON. ( alarm sounds )
V FIB. STARTING INTERNAL COMPRESSIONS.
Benton: GIVE ME THE PADDLES.
CHARGE TO 15.
GIVE HIM AN AMP OF EPI.
HEART'S EMPTY. HE NEEDS VOLUME.
Benton: HERE WE GO. CLEAR.
OKAY. LET'S GO AGAIN.
CHARGE TO 30.
CLEAR.
OKAY. CHARGE AGAIN.
CLEAR.
HEY, JEANIE.
HEY.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
JUST CHECKING OUT SOME OLD CHARTS.
LOOKING FOR ANYTHING SPECIFIC?
YEAH. I TALKED TO AL TODAY.
HE TESTED NEGATIVE FOR HEPATITIS "C."
HE EVEN FAXED ME HIS RESULTS.
WHICH MEANS I PROBABLY GOT IT FROM A PATIENT.
WE'RE ALL SO WORRIED; ME WORKING HERE WITH H.I.V.--
THE CHANCE OF ME INFECTING SOMEONE.
NEVER EVEN THOUGHT ABOUT A PATIENT INFECTING ME.
BUT IT COULD HAVE HAPPENED TO ANY ONE OF US, RIGHT?
YEAH.
HEY... JEANIE, DO YOU WANT TO...
WANT TO GO GET A CUP OF COFFEE, OR SOMETHING?
NO, THANKS. I'M GOING TO STAY HERE.
OKAY.
I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW.
OKAY, KERRY.
Corday: CAROL?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
OH, UNLOADING THESE BOXES.
DOUG ORDERED A LOT OF SUPPLIES.
HAVE YOU SPOKEN WITH HIM?
THOUGHT ABOUT IT A LOT LAST NIGHT.
I ENDED UP CALLING THE HOME SHOPPING NETWORK
AND ORDERED MYSELF A PAIR OF FLEECE BOOTIES.
SO, DID MARK MANAGE TO STRAP YOU DOWN--
GET A BLOOD GAS?
FINALLY TALKED ME INTO IT.
IT'S EASIER DOING THAT THAN LISTENING TO HIM.
MY CARBON MONOXIDE LEVEL WAS NORMAL.
OH, WELL. IT WAS A GOOD GUESS.
MARK'S JUST TRYING TO BE A FRIEND IN THAT
ENDEARING-SLIGHTLY-INEPT-MALE KIND OF WAY.
I KNOW.
I'M A WEEK LATE.
YOU'RE WHAT?
AT FIRST, I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST STRESS.
BUT IT'S NOT.
I'M PREGNANT.
YEAH.
THAT WAS A...
IT WAS A GOOD EFFORT.
YEAH.
THANK YOU, EVERYONE.
CARTER, LET'S GO.
I'M JUST GOING TO STAY FOR A SECOND.
