PREVIOUSLY ONE.R.:
A DRINK SOUNDS GREAT.
CAN WE ALSO EAT SOMETHING?
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
YOU WENT OUT WITH HER.
WE SHOULD EMBRACE OUR MISTAKES
AND LEARN FROM THEM TO IMPROVE THE SYSTEM.
Doctor: I'M GOING TO PUT THE MICROPHONE HOLDER RIGHT BEHIND THE EAR.
I WANTED TO POSTPONE REESE'S OPERATION.
ARE YOU COUGHING UP BLOOD?
THAT WOMAN HAS TUBERCULOSIS.
IT'S HIGHLY CONTAGIOUS.
THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT ME
THAT JUST BRINGS OUT THE WORST IN PEOPLE.
MERRY CHRISTMAS, AMANDA.
Radio broadcaster: Overnight storm dropped a ton of snow.
Be sure you allow extra time to dig out the car...
The good news is we finally made it to the weekend.
It's Friday, time to kick the weekend into gear
on 101.9 FM, the Mix.
YOU REALLY SHOULD TALK TO KERRY ABOUT THE HEAT IN HERE.
WELL, IT WAS PRETTY HOT IN HERE A MINUTE AGO.
YEAH, THANKS.
I'LL PICK YOU UP TONIGHT AROUND 9:00?
AH, I SAID I'D THINK ABOUT IT.
COME ON, MY FRIENDS ARE DYING TO MEET YOU.
GIRLS NIGHT OUT.
I'D FEEL LIKE I WAS ON DISPLAY.
IT'S GOT TO BEAT BABY-SITTING A MED STUDENT.
LUCY'S PRESENTING CHIEF ROUNDS TOMORROW.
IT'S A BIG DEAL.
AND LUCY IS A BIG GIRL.
I'D RATHER SPEND THE NIGHT WITH YOU.
ONLY WITH YOU.
JOHN, WHAT IS THAT?
OH, THAT IS A MAJOR DRAG.
HEY.
SORRY, YOU WERE AN EASY TARGET.
YOU'VE GOT QUITE AN ARM.
MY GRANDFATHER WAS A PITCHER FOR THE CINCINNATI REDS.
MUST BE IN THE GENES.
SOMEONE NOT NOTICE THAT THIS IS AN EMERGENCY ENTRANCE.
THE SNOW PLOW COMES IN
AND KIND OF PUSHES THE SNOW FROM ONE SIDE TO THE OTHER.
I'LL GIVE MAINTENANCE A CALL.
DON'T BOTHER.
BY THE TIME THEY GET HERE, IT WILL BE SPRING.
FRESH SNOW ALWAYS REMINDS ME
OF THE YEAR I SPENT WORKING IN ALASKA.
YOU'VE DONE IT ALL.
I TRY.
YOU GOT SOMETHING ON YOUR BACK THERE.
OOH, THAT'S COLD.
OH, YOU THINK THAT'S FUNNY, HUH?
OH...
YOU OKAY?
I'M SORRY. I'M FINE.
I'M VIBRATING.
WHAT?
MY PAGER.
OH.
SEE YOU INSIDE.
YEAH.
SO MARK SAID DINNER PLANS
ARE, QUOTE, "OPTIONAL."
IF EVERYTHING'S GOING WELL WITH AMANDA, WE SHOULD VAMOOSE.
YEAH, I HOPE THINGS GO WELL.
HE DESERVES IT.
YOU THINK THEY'VE SLEPT TOGETHER YET?
NOT IF THEY OBSERVED THE THREE-DATE RULE.
WHAT'S THE THREE-DATE RULE?
FIRST DATE, YOU GO OUT.
SECOND, YOU GET INVITED IN.
THIRD, YOU CLOSE THE DEAL.
IF YOU RECALL, WE CLOSED THE DEAL
ON THE FIRST DATE.
OH, YEAH, I WAS NEVER MUCH FOR RULES.
( loud bang )
HANG ON, HANG ON.
CALL IN A CODE WHITE.
GET A GURNEY AND A CRASH CART.
JOI ABBOTT.
FAINTED; TACHYCARDIC AT 130.
I'M FINE, REALLY.
LIPS ARE DRY, PROBABLY DEHYDRATED.
EXAMS TWO'S OPEN; WE GOT IT FROM HERE, DOUG.
OKAY.
EXCUSE ME.
YO, CAN I HELP YOU?
YEAH, WHO ARE YOU?
WHO ARE YOU?
WHO IS THIS GUY?
DOUG ROSS, PEDES E.R. ATTENDING
MEET TONY FIG, TRANSPORT DISPATCHER.
HE'S BEEN TURFED UP HERE WHILE JERRY AND RANDI ARE BOTH SICK.
HEY, SOME DUDE FROM NASA CALLED WANTING TO KNOW
IF YOU GOT YOUR PHASE TWO APPLICATION PACKET.
NASA, AS IN THE SPACE PROGRAM?
PROBABLY NASSAU AS IN TRYING TO SELL ME A TIME SHARE.
THERE'S NO PHONE NUMBER.
SAID THEY'D CALL BACK.
BET IT WAS JERRY MAKING A CRANK CALL.
HE'S MADE TWO FROM HOME ALL READY.
DOUG, I D.C.'d THE OTITIS MEDIA.
WE'RE FREE AND CLEAR.
Man: EXCUSE ME.
FOR A NANOSECOND... YES, OFFICER.
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?
SCOTT PEW-- THOUGHT IT'D BE COOL
TO BUMPER SKI ON MY PATROL CAR
UNTIL I MADE A U-TURN AND HE SHOT INTO A HEDGE.
SAYS HE BROKE HIS ARM.
LOOKS MORE LIKE HIS ELBOW, PROXIMAL RADIUS FRACTURE.
I'LL SIT YOU DOWN HERE.
COULD BE A GOOD CANDIDATE FOR OUR PAIN MEDICATION STUDY.
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA, JEANIE.
I'LL GET HIS PARENTS' CONSENT.
WOULD YOU MIND TAKING A LOOK AT MY HAND?
GOT A SPLINTER WHEN I PULLED HIM FROM THE BUSHES.
I'M WORKING PEDES TODAY, I'LL FIND YOU SOMEONE ELSE.
I'M A KID AT HEART.
OKAY, I'LL MEET YOU IN THE SUTURE ROOM
IN A MINUTE.
I REALLY NEED TO GO.
COULD YOU BE PREGNANT?
NO, MY HUSBAND AND I ARE SEPARATED.
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU HAD ANYTHING TO EAT?
I DON'T KNOW.
LUNCH YESTERDAY...
YOUR BODY'S MALNOURISHED.
MY SON'S UPSTAIRS GETTING AN M.R.I.
IF I'M NOT THERE WHEN HE'S DONE...
WE CAN CALL UPSTAIRS.
I'M SURE THEY'D KEEP AN EYE ON HIM.
HE GETS SCARED IF I'M NOT THERE.
AND WE HAVE TO GET TO THE CLINIC.
WE HAVE A CLINIC HERE.
RICKY GOES TO THE GENETICS CLINIC.
WILL YOU TAKE THIS OUT, PLEASE?
JOI, WHAT'S YOUR SON'S MEDICAL CONDITION?
A.L.D.--
ADRENOLEUKODYSTROPHY.
ADVANCED?
MM-HMM.
ARE YOU GIVING HIM OILS?
IT'S TOO LATE FOR THAT.
WE'LL HAVE YOUR LAB RESULTS
BACK IN ABOUT AN HOUR, IF YOU'D LIKE TO COME BACK.
MAYBE.
THANKS.
WELL, WE TRIED.
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO OUR DOUBLE DATE THIS EVENING.
OH, ME, TOO.
IF YOU DON'T MIND ME ASKING...
HAVE YOU AND MARK EVER BEEN INTIMATE?
ME AND MARK?
NO. WHY?
WELL, I JUST WONDERED
IF HE MAKES IT A HABIT OF SEDUCING COWORKERS.
HE'S BEEN SO AGGRESSIVE.
REALLY?
OH, DON'T GET ME WRONG.
I'VE NEVER BEEN AS SATISFIED WITH ANYONE
AS I AM WITH THIS MAN.
BUT WHEN SOMEONE'S THAT INVENTIVE, YOU KNOW...
I SORT OF SUSPECT HE'S A DON JUAN.
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT MARK GREENE?
LAST NIGHT, ON HIS FIRE ESCAPE...
I'LL DROP THESE AT THE LAB.
MUST HAVE GOTTEN IT FROM THAT WOMAN IN THE PROJECTS.
ANY NIGHT SWEATS OR FEVER?
NO.
A POSITIVE TEST DOESN'T MEAN I HAVE T.B.
IT JUST MEANS I'VE BEEN EXPOSED.
BUT YOU'LL STILL NEED A CHEST X RAY.
AND I.N.H. PROPHYLAXIS FOR AT LEAST SIX MONTHS.
I KNOW THE DRILL.
I'M REALLY SORRY.
THAT'S THE RISK OF BEING A DOCTOR.
I'M GLAD YOU'RE NEGATIVE.
CARTER, ROXANNE, LINE TWO.
OH, THANKS, LILY.
AH, I HAVE TO CANCEL OUR STUDY PLANS THIS EVENING.
FRIDAY NIGHT, SOMETHING'S COME UP.
NO PROBLEM.
MAYBE YOU AND BERNARD CAN REVIEW TOGETHER.
HEY, WHAT'S UP?
YOU HATED IT.
NO, I HAVEN'T HAD TIME TO READ IT THOROUGHLY.
DO YOU THINK I HAVE A SHOT AT GETTING IT PUBLISHED?
WELL, IT IS CONTROVERSIAL.
AND THAT'S BAD?
FOR YOU, RIGHT NOW, OH, YEAH.
WE'LL SEE IF ANSPAUGH AGREES.
DR. BENTON, IN THERE--
THE PATIENT'S GRANDMOTHER REQUESTED YOU PERSONALLY.
AH, DR. PARKS, THIS IS A SURPRISE.
WHERE'S YOUR INTERPRETER?
I CAN DO THAT.
MY NAME IS GWEN.
OH, YOU CAN HEAR.
GRANDMA THINKS I HAVE APPENDI...
APPENDICITIS?
YEAH, THAT'S IT.
WHERE DOES IT HURT?
AROUND MY BELLYBUTTON.
WHEN DID IT START?
WHILE GRANDMA WAS DRIVING ME TO SCHOOL
SHE HAD TO PULL OVER SO I COULD THROW UP.
TELL YOUR GRANDMOTHER
I THINK YOU HAVE GASTROENTERITIS.
CAN YOU SPELL THAT?
I'M SORRY, STOMACH FLU.
YOU'RE WRONG.
THERE'S NO LOCALIZED TENDERNESS
IN THE RIGHT LOWER QUADRANT.
GRANDMA WANTS TO DO THE ULTRASOUND.
I'LL REEXAMINE HER IN A COUPLE OF HOURS.
SEE IF THE PROBLEM DECLARES ITSELF.
WHAT DID SHE SAY?
UH, SHE SAID SHE WANTS TO DO THE ULTRASOUND.
FINE.
I DON'T SEE A SPLINTER, BUT THERE IS SOMETHING.
GOOD. I'D HATE FOR YOU TO THINK I MADE THIS UP
JUST SO I COULD
SPEND TIME WITH YOU.
THAT SMILE IS WORTH A THOUSAND SPLINTERS.
OW.
GOT IT.
SORRY. I DIDN'T MEAN TO HURT YOU.
YOU CAN MAKE IT UP TO ME; LET ME TAKE YOU OUT.
I DIDN'T HURT YOU THAT BAD.
YOU WILL IF YOU SAY NO.
I DON'T THINK SO.
SO, YOU'VE DECIDED NOT TO LIKE ME.
I DON'T EVEN KNOW YOU.
RIGHT, SO WE GO OUT, YOU GET TO KNOW ME.
OFFICER...
CALL ME REGGIE.
REGGIE, I'M JUST NOT LOOKING TO OUT WITH ANYONE RIGHT NOW.
IF IT'S BECAUSE YOU'RE HIV-POSITIVE
I'M COOL WITH THAT.
( chuckles )
YOU'RE COOL WITH THAT?
LUCKY ME.
WHOA, WHOA.
I WASN'T TALKING ABOUT SEX.
I LIKE TO GET TO KNOW A WOMAN FIRST.
SO, HOW ABOUT WE CROSS THAT BRIDGE IF WE COME TO IT.
OH, DR. WEAVER, I ALMOST FORGOT.
YOUR MOM CALLED.
MY MOM?
YEP, THIS MORNING, BEFORE I LEFT THE HOUSE.
WHAT DID SHE SAY EXACTLY?
SHE'D TRY LATER.
( phone rings )
AM I SUPPOSED TO GET THAT?
NO, I GOT IT.
DID SHE ASK FOR ME BY NAME?
YOUR MOM?
Hathaway: COUNTY GENERAL, GO AHEAD.
Dispatch: A commuter plane crash
at Meig's Field.
Anticipating up to 14 trauma patients.
How many can you handle? Over.
WE CAN TAKE THREE MAJOR, SEVEN MINOR.
DO YOU HAVE AN E.T.A.? OVER.
Negative. Only reports from the scene.
ALL RIGHT, THIS IS COUNTY GENERAL.
CLEAR ON MED NINE.
OKAY, EVERYONE, WE HAVE A MASS CASUALTY INCIDENT.
IMPLEMENT DISASTER PROTOCOL.
CAROL, SET UP CURTAINS ONE AND TWO--
TRAUMA TWO AND THREE FOR CRITICAL PATIENTS.
JOHN, WILL YOU PUT I.V. STANDS
AND GURNEYS IN THE HALLWAY?
I NEED WARM SALINE, RAPID INFUSERS
AND TWO UNITS OF O-NEGATIVE AVAILABLE AT EVERY BEDSIDE.
I APPRECIATE YOUR HARD WORK
BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE FOR PUBLICATION.
HOW CAN WE EFFECT CHANGE UNLESS WE CREATE AN OPEN FORUM?
I SUPPORT CHANGE, ELIZABETH
BUT I DON'T BELIEVE YOUR PAPER IS THE PROPER TOOL.
YOU OBJECT TO ME REFERENCING MY OWN MISTAKE
BECAUSE IT PAINTS COUNTY GENERAL IN A POOR LIGHT.
NO, IT PAINTS YOU IN A POOR LIGHT.
IT HAS A CONFESSIONAL QUALITY THAT CONCERNS ME.
I SUGGEST YOU FIND OUT
THE TRUE MOTIVES FOR WRITING THIS PAPER
BEFORE YOU BECOME HELL-BENT
ON SHARING IT WITH THE WORLD.
NOTHING LIKE A MULTI-VICTIM TRAUMA
TO GET THE BLOOD PUMPING.
I DON'T BELIEVE WE'VE MET.
I'M DALE EDSON, THIRD-YEAR SURGICAL RESIDENT.
LUCY KNIGHT, THIRD-YEAR MEDICAL STUDENT.
WORKING WITH THE ESTEEMED JOHN CARTER
FORMER SURGICAL INTERN.
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.
WAIT UNTIL YOU DO SURGICAL ROTATION.
YOU'LL FIND IT MAKES EMERGENCY MEDICINE LOOK LIKE CHILD'S PLAY.
LET ME HELP YOU.
THANKS.
YOU EVER BEEN ON A RIVERBOAT CASINO?
LIKE IN NEW ORLEANS?
LIKE IN ELGIN.
IT'S A STELLAR BOAT--
THE GRAND VICTORIA.
I'M HEADING UP THERE THIS EVENING.
WOULD YOU LIKE TO JOIN ME?
I'VE NEVER BEEN GAMBLING BEFORE.
LUCY, DON'T YOU NEED TO PREPARE FOR CHIEF ROUNDS TOMORROW?
OH, RIGHT. I PROBABLY SHOULDN'T.
WHEN YOU'RE THROUGH HERE, CHECK THE O-NEG SUPPLY.
I CAN HELP YOU ON IT DURING THE DRIVE UP--
I MEAN, IF YOU WANT ME TO.
THAT WOULD BE GREAT.
COME ON, WE GOT WORK TO DO.
THIS PLACE WON'T BE THE SAME WITHOUT YOU.
AM I GOING SOMEPLACE?
YOU DON'T HAVE TO PLAY DUMB, DOUG.
MATT RICHMOND PHONED.
I DOWNPLAYED YOU, OF COURSE; I'M NOT AN IDIOT.
WELL, I AM, BECAUSE I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.
WHO'S THIS RICHMOND GUY?
HE RUNS AN HMO IN PORTLAND.
THEY'RE LOOKING FOR SOMEONE TO SET UP PEDIATRIC E.R.'s
IN THEIR FACILITIES AROUND THE COUNTRY.
DR. LEE, BLOOD BANK'S ON THE PHONE FOR YOU.
DON'T WORRY, AMANDA, I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE.
GLAD TO HEAR IT.
SO YOU ACTUALLY APPLIED TO THE SPACE PROGRAM?
MY SECOND YEAR OF RESIDENCY.
I MADE THE FIRST CUT.
WHAT HAPPENED?
RACHEL WAS JUST BARELY OUT OF DIAPERS
AND JEN WAS STARTING LAW SCHOOL.
I TRIED TO DEFER, BUT THEY WOULDN'T LET ME.
SO THAT CALL FROM NASA COULD HAVE BEEN FOR REAL.
I DOUBT IT.
TRAUMA ROOM'S READY.
GREAT. THANKS, YOU GUYS.
YOU TWO SEEM TO BE MOVING RIGHT ALONG.
SHE'S KIND OF PLAYING HARD TO GET.
CARTER, LUCY AND LILY WILL HANDLE MINORS IN THE MAIN HALL.
GOT IT.
MARK, I'VE ASSIGNED YOU AND CAROL TO TRAUMA ONE.
KERRY, YOU AND CHUNY IN TRAUMA TWO.
LYDIA AND I WILL FLOAT.
Dispatch: Come in, County General.
ANY CRITICAL PEDES, JEANIE AND I WILL TAKE THEM IN CURTAIN THREE.
THIS IS COUNTY. OVER.
EVERYBODY HEAR THAT?
CRITICAL PEDES, CURTAIN THREE.
Be advised your facility
has been instructed to stand down. Over.
COMMAND CENTER, WE'RE PREPARED.
WE'RE READY TO HANDLE PATIENTS. OVER.
STAND DOWN? STOP PREPPING.
There were no survivors on scene.
Repeat, no survivors. Over.
ANY MESSAGES FOR ME?
AND YOU ARE...?
DR. WEAVER. "WEAVER."
YEAH. ONE; SOUNDED KIND OF IMPORTANT.
FROM MY MOTHER? YOUR DENTIST.
OKAY, ANY CALLS FOR ME, BUSINESS OR OTHERWISE, PAGE ME.
I GOT YOU COVERED. DR. GREENE.
OVERNIGHT DELIVERY. CHECK OUT THE RETURN ADDRESS.
NASA. YOU DESERTING ME?
NO, OF COURSE NOT.
( door slams open )
GOT ANOTHER ONE BEHIND US.
OKAY, I'LL TAKE THIS ONE.
AMANDA. YEAH.
42-YEAR-OLD FEMALE.
BLUNT HEAD TRAUMA FROM A COLLAPSED CHIMNEY.
CHIMNEY?
POSSIBLE L.O.C., COMPLAINS OF HEADACHE
SHORTNESS OF BREATH. HELP ME! HELP... ME!
WHAT'S HER NAME? EDIE HARVELLE.
EDIE, YOU'RE IN GOOD HANDS.
BLUNT TRAUMA TO THE ABDOMEN FROM FALLING BRICKS.
COMPLAINS OF ABDOMINAL PAIN. VITALS?
B.P. 100 PALP, PULSE 110.
Greene: ON MY COUNT. ONE, TWO, THREE.
( gasping ): HELP... ME...
PUPILS EQUAL.
REACT TO LIGHT.
GO... HOME...
TACHYPNEIC AND TACHYCARDIC.
EDIE, DO YOU HAVE ANY CHEST PAIN?
PAIN... EVERY... WHERE.
B.P.'s 130/82.
POSSIBLE PNEUMOTHORAX.
I WANT A C.B.C., A CHEM PANEL, AND SEND OFF CARDIAC ENZYMES.
WE'VE GOT TO RULE OUT AN M.I.
SHE'S YOUNG FOR AN M.I.
YEAH, BUT I DON'T WANT TO TAKE ANY CHANCES.
DO YOU MIND CHECKING ON KERRY?
PRESSURE'S HOLDING AT 100.
HE'S A PSYCHOLOGIST, SAID HE WAS TREATING YOUR PATIENT
WHEN THE ACCIDENT OCCURRED.
WHAT WERE YOU TREATING HER FOR?
AGORAPHOBIA.
EDIE'S TERRIFIED OF PUBLIC PLACES.
LUNGS ARE CLEAR.
INCLUDING HOSPITALS?
PULSE OX LOOKS GOOD: 98.
I WAS USING A DESENSITIZATION APPROACH.
I GOT HER TO STEP OUTSIDE HER HOUSE
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN FIVE YEARS
WHEN A CHIMNEY FELL ON TOP OF US; IT WAS FREAKISH.
CALL C.T.-- RIGHT UPPER-QUADRANT TENDERNESS.
DOES SHE HAVE PANIC ATTACKS?
UP TO 30 A DAY.
GREAT. C.T. CAN TAKE HIM NOW.
LET'S GET HIM UPSTAIRS.
SHE HAS RELAXATION MUSIC WITH HER.
THAT MAY HELP.
( Edie gasping )
E.K.G. NORMAL.
LIPS... NUMB.
EDIE, MY NAME IS DR. GREENE.
YOU'RE IN A HOSPITAL.
NOTHING BAD CAN HAPPEN TO YOU HERE.
HOSPITALS... BAD...
HALEH, I WANT YOU TO TRY AND FIND A YANNI TAPE.
KEEP BREATHING.
ALL RIGHT...
YEAH, THERE'S SOME FLUID AROUND THE EDEMATOUS APPENDIX.
E-D-E...
MOM.
THAT'S MY MOM.
SHE WAS ON A FIELD TRIP WITH HER STUDENTS
WHILE GRANDMA CALLED HER.
HEY... WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?
"FATHER"-- SHE SAYS YOU'RE THE FATHER OF THE DEAF BOY.
DO ME A FAVOR.
TELL YOUR MOTHER AND YOUR GRANDMA... NEVER MIND.
UM... HEY, HEY, EXCUSE ME.
UH, LISTEN, SHE, UM...
UH, UM... SHEESH...
AH, APPENDIX.
APPENDIX-- YEAH, YEAH.
RIGHT.
I'M GOING TO HAVE AN OPERATION?
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. BUT IT... I-I-IT'S FINE.
WAIT!
MOM NEEDS A SIGNER.
GRANDMA'S NOT A SURGEON.
"I NEED TO ASK QUESTIONS.
THE HOSPITAL NEEDS TO PROVIDE ONE."
YEAH, YEAH. THAT'S FINE.
I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT. IT'S NO PROBLEM.
( pager beeps )
AM I GOING TO BE OKAY?
YOU'LL BE FINE.
EDIE...
THIS MASK'LL HELP YOU BREATHE.
OKAY, NOW JUST INHALE LIKE THIS.
NICE AND EASY.
MASK OFF.
NO, NO, NO-- MASK ON.
MASK OFF.
( gasping )
MARK.
BAD NEWS. C.T.'s DOWN.
OH... I'M NOT GETTING THROUGH TO HER.
I DON'T WANT TO PUT HER ON SEDATION
UNTIL WE RULE OUT AN INTRACRANIAL BLEED
BUT WE MAY HAVE NO CHOICE.
LET ME TRY SOMETHING.
OKAY, EDIE...
I WANT YOU TO CLOSE YOUR EYES.
NO... I... CAN'T...
SURE, YOU CAN.
CLOSE YOUR EYES
AND I WANT YOU TO IMAGINE YOURSELF AS A LITTLE GIRL
SOMEPLACE WARM AND SAFE.
IT'S... DARK. NO, IT'S NOT.
CLOSE YOUR EYES.
IT'S LIGHT AND IT'S AIRY
AND IT'S WARM AND IT'S SAFE.
CAN YOU TELL ME WHERE YOU ARE?
I'M IN THE KITCHEN.
UH-HUH. GOOD.
AND WHO'S WITH YOU?
MOM.
YOUR MOM.
SHE'S BAKING SOMETHING.
IT SMELLS REALLY YUMMY.
CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT SHE'S BAKING?
COOKIES.
COOKIES. THAT'S GOOD.
THAT'S GOOD.
( exhaling uneasily )
SHH...
THAT'S GOOD.
I'M SORRY IF I OFFENDED YOU EARLIER.
IT'S THE LAST THING I MEANT TO DO.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
I WANT TO TELL YOU SOMETHING ABOUT MYSELF
TO EVEN THE PLAYING FIELD.
REGGIE, THAT'S NOT NECESSARY.
HOW I'M BROKE, OR GOT SUSPENDED...
IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE.
NOTHING IN MY LIFE COMPARES TO...
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
DON'T FEEL SORRY FOR ME. I'M DOING GREAT.
WHERE DID YOU LEARN THAT?
I DID RESEARCH ON PHOBIAS IN MED SCHOOL.
ACTUALLY GOT PUBLISHED IN THE CORNELL MEDICAL JOURNAL
WHICH IS A PRETTY BIG DEAL FOR A THIRD-YEAR.
I'D LOVE TO READ IT. DO YOU HAVE A COPY?
FILED IN A BOX SOMEWHERE.
MARK, AMBULANCE PULLING UP.
I'LL TAKE THAT.
IT'S ENDLESS PSYCHOBABBLE.
YOU'D BE BORED TO TEARS.
I DOUBT IT.
CAROL.
HEY, I JUST GOT THE LABS BACK ON JOI ABBOTT.
WHO?
THE WOMAN WHO FAINTED IN THE CAFETERIA.
SHE HAS MICROCYTIC ANEMIA.
GIVE HER SOME IRON.
SHE'LL BE FINE IN A COUPLE WEEKS.
I DOUBT IT. HER SON HAS A.L.D.
HOW OLD IS HE?
EIGHT. WHY?
THEY USUALLY DON'T MAKE IT PAST TEN.
HIS BROTHER DIED OF IT THREE YEARS AGO.
IT'S INHERITED FROM THE MOTHER.
IT ONLY STRIKES BOYS.
NO WONDER JOI LOOKS LIKE SHE'S BEEN THROUGH HELL.
SIMON SAYS...
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU PAGED ME FOR THIS.
WHEN A CHILD ACTS OUT
IT'S USUALLY AN INDICATION THAT THERE'S A PROBLEM.
IF REESE BIT A KID, IT'S PROBABLY BECAUSE HE WAS PROVOKED.
ACTUALLY, THIS ISN'T THE FIRST TIME HE'S DISRUPTED THE CLASS.
YESTERDAY, REESE THREW A FIT WHEN IT WAS SING-ALONG TIME
AND HE WANTED TO CONTINUE PAINTING.
MAYBE THAT'S BECAUSE HE CAN'T SING ALONG.
I UNDERSTAND, BUT WE DON'T HAVE THE PERSONNEL
TO LET EACH CHILD DO THEIR OWN ACTIVITIES.
I ALREADY SPEND EXTRA TIME WITH REESE
TALKING TO HIM, AND MAKING SURE HE UNDERSTANDS...
OKAY, OKAY, OKAY.
LISTEN. LISTEN, WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?
PERHAPS YOU SHOULD CONSIDER A SPECIAL-NEEDS ENVIRONMENT
WHERE REESE CAN GET MORE PERSONAL ATTENTION.
I THINK IT MAY BE THE BEST FOR ALL CONCERNED.
GOOD BREATH SOUNDS BILATERALLY.
YOU'RE DOING AWESOME, ROBIN.
FETAL HEART TONES PRESENT AT 140.
ARE YOU FEELING ANY PAIN HERE?
ONLY WITH THE CONTRACTIONS. IS OUR BABY ALL RIGHT?
SO FAR, SO GOOD.
Haleh: HEMOGLOBIN IS 12.8.
WHAT HAVE WE GOT?
ROBIN GAMBRELL, 28 YEARS OLD.
RESTRAINED PASSENGER
INVOLVED IN A TWO-CAR M.V.A.
FULL-TERM PREGNANCY AND SHE'S IN ACTIVE LABOR.
IT WAS MY FAULT. I SHOULDN'T
HAVE BEEN DRIVING SO FAST.
THEY JUST BROUGHT IN THE OTHER VICTIM.
I THINK THEY NEED YOU NEXT DOOR.
OKAY.
I HOPE THAT GUY'S OKAY.
I NEVER SAW HIM COMING.
OKAY, WE'LL DO A QUICK PELVIC EXAM
BEFORE WE BRING YOU UP TO O.B.
MIKE, DID YOU HURT YOUR BACK?
I'M OKAY-- DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME, BABY.
LYDIA...
LET'S GET A TRAUMA PANEL ON MR. GAMBRELL.
I WANT TO MAKE SURE HE DIDN'T DAMAGE HIS KIDNEYS.
UH-OH. HERE COMES ANOTHER ONE!
OKAY, BABY, BREATHE NOW.
BREATHE THROUGH THE PAIN.
Lucy: AARON DRANE; PRIVATE IN THE ARMY.
B.P.'s DOWN TO 60.
COULD BE INTRAABDOMINAL HEMORRHAGE.
I NEED THE PERITONEAL LAVAGE KIT-- PREP THE BELLY.
ANOTHER TWO UNITS OF O-NEG; SQUEEZE IT IN.
HEART RATE'S UP TO 130.
RIGHT, LUCY-- HOOK UP THE ADAPTER
TO THE SYRINGE.
OKAY, I'M IN.
PULL BACK ON THE SYRINGE.
GROSS BLOOD.
( alarm sounds )
UH, V-FIB.
Lee: CRASH CART.
CHARGE TO 200.
CLEAR!
DO YOU KNOW HOW TO NAVIGATE THE INTERNET?
MY MIDDLE INITIALS ARE W.W.W.
I'M TRYING TO FIND AN ARTICLE
ON THE CORNELL MEDICAL SCHOOL JOURNAL WEBSITE, AND...
YOU GOT BACKSLASHES INSTEAD OF FORWARD SLASHES.
COMMON BEGINNER'S MISTAKE.
AUTHOR'S NAME?
UH, AMANDA LEE.
SUBJECT WOULD BE PHOBIAS.
I GOT AN A.W. LEE--
WROTE SOMETHING CALLED "FEARING FEAR."
COULD YOU PRINT THAT UP FOR ME?
ALREADY DID.
LISTEN, CALL DOWN TO THE LIBRARY
AND HAVE THEM SEND UP ANY ARTICLES
BY THE SAME AUTHOR.
HEY, FOR YOU, DR. G.
Lee: ONE MORE TIME.
CHARGE TO 50.
CHARGING. CLEAR.
HE'S STILL ASYSTOLE.
ME AND SOME FRIENDS WERE HANGING OUT
AFTER MY SHIFT WHEN ROBIN CALLED
AND TOLD ME THAT HER WATER BROKE.
I KIND OF FREAKED OUT.
THAT'S PRETTY COMMON WITH FIRST-TIME DADS.
MIKE'S BEEN WORKING DOUBLES
SO HE CAN TAKE TIME OFF AFTER THE BABY'S BORN.
I DON'T WANT ROBIN GOING THROUGH THIS ALONE.
SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE GREAT PARENTS.
THAT'S A GOOD-LOOKING BABY.
PLACENTA LOOKS FINE. THERE'S NO ABRUPTION.
THANK YOU, GOD.
WHAT'S GOING ON IN THERE?
HOW'S THE OTHER DRIVER DOING?
EVERYTHING'S FINE, BABY.
DON'T WORRY.
DON'T WORRY.
"THIS TIME, WITH THE WIND AFT, AND A GOOD ONE
THE SWALLOW FAIRLY RACED TO THE ISLAND..."
HI, JOI.
OH, HI.
SORRY. I COULDN'T MAKE IT BACK DOWN.
I DECIDED TO COME TO YOU INSTEAD.
THAT'S NICE OF YOU.
THIS MUST BE RICKY.
I'M CAROL.
HI.
HE JUST STARTED HAVING TROUBLE TALKING A FEW DAYS AGO.
HE USED TO BE SUCH A CHATTERBOX.
SO, I GOT SOME TERRIBLE DISEASE, TOO?
NO, BUT YOUR BLOOD TEST CONFIRMED THAT YOU'RE ANEMIC.
TAKE THOSE IRON PILLS THREE TIMES A DAY
AND YOU'LL FEEL BETTER.
I WOULD LIKE YOU TO COME BACK
TO THE E.R. CLINIC IN THREE WEEKS
SO I CAN RECHECK YOUR BLOOD.
IT'S HARD TO PLAN THAT FAR AHEAD.
TIME TO EAT.
GOT CHOCOLATE TODAY.
DO YOU HAVE ANY HELP WITH RICKY?
MY DAUGHTER CELIA PLAYS WITH HIM SOMETIMES.
NO, I WAS ACTUALLY THINKING MORE MEDICALLY.
UH... I TAKE CARE OF ALL THAT.
YOU KNOW, I COULD ARRANGE FOR SOME RESPITE CARE--
SOMEONE WHO COULD WATCH RICKY A COUPLE HOURS A DAY
WHILE YOU REGAIN YOUR STRENGTH.
I APPRECIATE THE OFFER
BUT RICKY'S MY RESPONSIBILITY.
JOI, IF YOU DON'T START TAKING CARE OF YOURSELF
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE VERY MUCH HELP TO HIM
OR YOUR DAUGHTER, EITHER.
GOOD EFFORT IN THERE, AMANDA.
YOU WIN SOME, YOU LOSE SOME.
OH, I WAS TRYING TO FIND YOUR JOURNAL ARTICLE
BUT I CAME UP WITH THIS, WRITTEN BY A.W. LEE
PICTURE OF A 40-YEAR-OLD ASIAN GUY.
YEAH, AND WHO WAS A CLASSMATE OF MINE AT CORNELL.
NOT A VERY GOOD ONE, I MIGHT ADD.
PEOPLE WERE CONSTANTLY GETTING US MIXED UP.
SO, YOU WROTE THE ARTICLE, BUT THEY PRINTED HIS PHOTO.
YEAH. THEY PRINTED A CORRECTION IN THE NEXT ISSUE
BUT BY THEN, THE DAMAGE WAS DONE.
AND THIS IS ON THE INTERNET...
YEAH.
...A GLOBAL SOURCE OF MISINFORMATION.
HEY, TONY, WHY DON'T YOU GET THE EDITOR
OF THE CORNELL JOURNAL OF MEDICINE FOR ME?
MARK, IT'S REALLY NOT NECESSARY.
YOU SHOULD GET CREDIT FOR YOUR WORK, AMANDA.
WHERE'S CORNELL?
E.R.
YES, OFFICER?
I'M FOLLOWING UP ON THE M.V.A.
I WANTED TO KNOW HOW EVERYONE WAS DOING.
YEAH, MRS. GAMBRELL AND THE BABY ARE DOING FINE.
UNFORTUNATELY, THE DRIVER OF THE OTHER CAR EXPIRED.
AND, UH... MICHAEL GAMBRELL
THE DRIVER WHO CAUSED THE ACCIDENT?
JUST SOME MINOR CUTS AND ABRASIONS.
WE HAVE SOME WITNESSES
SAYING HE WAS DRIVING ERRATICALLY.
DID YOU GET A BLOOD ALCOHOL ON HIM?
UH, JUST A C.B.C. AND A CHEM PANEL.
CAN YOU GET A B.A.L. OFF THAT?
I REALLY DON'T THINK THAT'S NECESSARY.
IT'S STANDARD PROCEDURE.
I CAN TAKE HIM DOWN TO THE STATION.
I'LL ADD IT TO HIS ORDERS.
APPRECIATE IT.
Carter: JUST TRY AND RELAX, MR. WONG.
PULSE OX 87.
I CAN'T FIND THE RADIAL ARTERY.
TRY A BRACHIAL STICK.
GOT A PULSE.
MR. WONG, I'M GOING
TO STICK YOU NOW.
OKAY?
I'M GETTING BLOOD.
YOU SEE? ALL IT TAKES IS A LITTLE PRACTICE.
OW!
LILY, TAKE OVER
FOR LUCY.
DR. CARTER...
GO TO THE SUTURE ROOM, FLUSH OUT THE WOUND.
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.
LUCY...
WELL, SOUNDS LIKE AN ASTRONAUT TO ME.
IT'S NOT LIKE I'LL FLY THE THING.
WHAT'S A PAYLOAD SPECIALIST DO, ANYWAY?
ONBOARD EXPERIMENTS.
THIS GUY I WENT TO SCHOOL WITH
IS HEADING UP A MEDICAL TEAM
AND WANTED TO SEE IF I WAS INTERESTED.
THAT'S SOME PRETTY INTENSE
PHYSICAL TRAINING, RIGHT?
I WON'T BE PHYSICALLY IN SHAPE?
THEY LET JOHN GLENN BACK UP THERE
AND HE'S, LIKE, IN HIS LATE 70s.
THANKS, CAROL. ( Hathaway laughing )
SOUNDS LIKE THE OPPORTUNITY OF A LIFETIME, YOU KNOW?
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU HAVE RACHEL AND JEN TO TIE YOU DOWN.
TIE HIM DOWN?
IT'S NOT LIKE I WAS LOOKING FOR IT, YOU KNOW.
IT JUST KIND OF FOUND ME.
YO, DR. G.!
THOSE A.W. LEE ARTICLES YOU WANTED?
THEY'RE CHECKED OUT.
ALL OF THEM? BY WHO?
DIDN'T ASK.
WHEN?
DIDN'T ASK.
DID THAT EDITOR FROM CORNELL
RETURN MY CALL?
NADA.
LISTEN, CHECK WITH THE LIBRARY
AND SEE WHAT ELSE YOU CAN FIND OUT.
DONALD, CAN I TALK TO YOU?
I'M LATE FOR SURGERY, MARK.
IT'LL JUST TAKE A SECOND.
YOU KNOW ANYBODY AT THE CORNELL MEDICAL SCHOOL?
CAN'T SAY THAT I DO.
TALK TO DR. LEE.
YOU NEVER SPOKE TO ANYBODY THERE ABOUT HER?
I DIDN'T SEE THE NEED.
YOU SAW HER LETTERS OF RECOMMENDATION.
THEY WERE GLOWING.
YES. YES, THEY WERE.
AN OLD ARMY BUDDY OF MINE
WHO WORKED WITH HER IN ATLANTA
SAID THAT SHE WAS THE BEST RESIDENT HE'S EVER HAD.
REALLY? THAT'S GOOD TO HEAR.
IF THERE'S A PROBLEM...
NO. NO PROBLEM. SORRY TO BOTHER YOU.
C.T. JUST CALLED.
THEY'RE READY FOR THE FREAKY CHICA.
WHY DON'T YOU STICK WITH ME?
I MAY NEED YOUR TRANSPO EXPERTISE.
LUCY...
I'M SO SORRY.
IT'S OKAY. IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.
NO. I SHOULD HAVE WARNED THE PATIENT
THAT I WAS GOING TO STICK HIM.
LIKE YOU SAID
RISK COMES WITH THE JOB.
WHAT DO I DO?
WE'RE GOING TO SEND A SAMPLE OF THE PATIENT'S BLOOD
DOWN TO THE LAB FOR A RAPID HIV TEST.
CAN WE DO THAT WITHOUT HIS PERMISSION?
YES, SINCE WE ALREADY HAVE A SAMPLE.
LET ME TAKE A LOOK.
IF HE TURNS OUT TO BE HIV-POSITIVE--
WHICH I'M SURE HE WON'T--
THEN WE'LL TELL HIM THE TEST RESULTS.
AND IF HE'S POSITIVE
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO START PROPHYLAXIS.
LET'S... JUST TAKE THIS ONE STEP AT A TIME.
OKAY?
OKAY.
HASN'T THE INTERPRETER ARRIVED YET?
THE NURSE SAYS SHE'S BUSY.
ANOTHER ONE IS DRIVING IN.
OKAY, YOU KNOW, UH, WE REALLY SHOULDN'T
WAIT ON THIS.
SHE SAID OKAY.
GRANDMA WANTS TO WATCH.
NO. NO. NO. NO. THAT'S NOT NECESSARY.
OKAY. OKAY. FINE.
I LOVE YOU.
I LOVE YOU BOTH.
WE'RE GOING TO BE IN AND OUT OF THERE
IN LESS THAN 20 MINUTES.
DON'T LEAVE.
DON'T WORRY. I'M RIGHT HERE.
HOW DOES IT LOOK?
( imitating Star Trek's Scotty): COAST IS CLEAR, CAPTAIN.
EDIE, WHY DON'T YOU
CLOSE YOUR EYES AND IMAGINE YOURSELF IN...
HOW ABOUT OUTER SPACE?
WHAT?
YEAH. YOU KNOW, YOU'RE FLOATING AROUND THE GALAXY
IN THE BLACK EXPANSE
AND EARTH IS A TINY SPECK IN THE DISTANCE, OKAY?
ARE THERE COOKIES?
COOKIES? SURE. YEAH.
YOU CAN EAT COOKIES IN OUTER SPACE.
WASH THEM DOWN WITH TANG...
Corday: COMING THROUGH! I NEED BLOOD NOW!
CAN'T...! DON'T... MAKE ME!
CAN'T...! LET'S GO BACK.
WE'RE GOING TO GO BACK.
( gasping )
LET'S TAKE HER BACK.
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE YOU BACK.
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE YOU BACK.
EXCUSE ME. WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR OVER 45 MINUTES
AND NO ONE WILL TELL US ABOUT OUR SON.
I'M SORRY. I'M SURE THE DOCTOR'S TIED UP.
I DON'T WANT YOUR DAMN EXCUSES.
I WANT TO KNOW ABOUT MY SON.
WHY CAN'T WE SEE HIM?
WHAT'S GOING ON?
WHAT'S YOUR SON'S NAME?
AARON DRANE.
HE'S A PRIVATE IN THE U.S. ARMY.
HE WAS IN A CAR ACCIDENT.
I'M NOT AWARE OF HIS STATUS.
LET ME SEE WHAT I CAN FIND OUT.
HE WAS JUST HOME ON LEAVE; HE WAS DRIVING BACK TO BASE.
WE'RE GOING TO GO BACK THERE.
YOU CAN'T STOP US.
JUST WAIT ONE MINUTE.
EXCUSE ME... MR. DRANE
UH, MRS. DRANE, I'M OFFICER MOORE.
I'M VERY SORRY TO HAVE TO TELL YOU THIS
BUT YOUR SON, AARON, WAS VERY SERIOUSLY INJURED
AND HE DIED.
THE DOCTORS HERE DID EVERYTHING THEY COULD TO SAVE HIM.
( Mrs. Drane weeping )
HI, AMANDA. WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN HERE?
I'M CUTTING OUT SOME FASCINATING ARTICLES ON CONN'S SYNDROME.
AREN'T THOSE HOSPITAL COPIES?
YEAH. THEY WERE EXTRAS.
UNFORTUNATELY, I HAVE TO CANCEL ON TONIGHT.
THERE'S A KILLER MIGRAINE
THAT'S LIKE A FREIGHT TRAIN RUNNING THROUGH MY HEAD.
HAVE YOU EVER TRIED JUST PRESSING...?
YOU NAME IT, I'VE TRIED IT.
I THINK THE BEST THING FOR ME IS JUST TO GO HOME
AND PULL THE COVERS UP OVER MY HEAD.
BUT MARK AND I WILL DEFINITELY
RESCHEDULE, OKAY? OKAY.
OKAY.
OH, DR. WEAVER.
MIKE GAMBRELL'S BLOOD ALCOHOL CAME BACK.
.086.
JUST OVER THE LIMIT.
NOT GOOD, HUH?
NO. NOT GOOD AT ALL.
I AM OKAY.
NOTHING BAD CAN HAPPEN TO ME.
I AM IN CONTROL.
THAT'S IT.
JUST KEEP NICE, POSITIVE THOUGHTS.
THAT'S GOOD.
I AM... I AM IN CONTROL.
HOW WEIRD IS THAT?
WHAT?!
NOTHING. NOTHING.
WE'RE, UH, JUST GOING TO WAIT FOR THE NEXT ELEVATOR
'CAUSE THIS ONE'S FULL.
ALL RIGHT, THERE IT IS.
ONE INFLAMED APPY WITH FIBRINOUS EXUDATE.
Anspaugh: YOU KNOW, I'VE NEVER COME ACROSS A DEAF DOCTOR.
QUITE AN AMAZING FEAT THAT SHE'S PULLED OFF.
ALL RIGHT, PREPARING TO CLAMP.
HOW DID SHE MANAGE A RESIDENCY--
ESPECIALLY A SURGICAL ROTATION?
A MASK ON, HER HANDS OCCUPIED.
DON'T WORRY. SHE CAN'T READ OUR LIPS.
YEAH, BUT STILL, IT'S RUDE
TO TALK ABOUT HER WHEN SHE'S STANDING
RIGHT IN FRONT OF US.
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.
MY APOLOGIES.
WHERE YOU BEEN?
PHONE'S BEEN RINGING OFF THE HOOK.
HELPING DR. G. GET A PATIENT TO C.T.
AND LET ME TELL YOU, IT WAS NO PICNIC.
OH, HE WANTED THIS CORNELL CALL.
WONDER IF MAYBE I SHOULD RUN IT UP TO HIM?
I'M HEADING THAT WAY.
I OWE YOU ONE.
LOOK, HE HAD A COUPLE OF BEERS
WITH NO INTENTION OF DRIVING
AND THEN, HIS WIFE CALLS, IN LABOR.
HE KILLED A MAN.
THAT'S INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER.
YES, AND HE'S WILLING TO TAKE FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR HIS ACTIONS.
HE JUST WANTS TO STAY WITH HIS WIFE THROUGH THE DELIVERY.
LOOK, I DON'T LIKE THIS ANY MORE THAN YOU DO
BUT MY JOB IS TO ARREST HIM NOW.
YEAH, BUT SHOULD HIS WIFE AND CHILD HAVE TO PAY AS WELL?
ALL RIGHT. HE CAN STAY UNTIL SHE DELIVERS
BUT THEN I'M TAKING HIM IN.
THANK YOU.
THANKS.
GREAT NEWS.
MR. WONG'S TEST RESULTS CAME BACK.
HE'S NEGATIVE.
ARE YOU SURE?
I WENT TO THE LAB MYSELF TO CONFIRM THE RESULTS.
THANK YOU. THANK YOU.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
DON'T THANK ME.
I'M THE ONE THAT GOT YOU INTO THIS.
WELL, I APPRECIATE YOU
STICKING THROUGH IT WITH ME.
I STILL WANT YOU TO GET TESTED AGAIN.
SIX MONTHS, JUST TO BE ON THE SAFE SIDE.
ABSOLUTELY.
MAN... I'M SO RELIEVED.
TELL ME ABOUT IT.
DONE?
YOU PASSED WITH FLYING COLORS.
I'LL BE RIGHT IN.
WHY DON'T YOU GO AHEAD AND PROCESS THOSE?
I AM OKAY.
YES, YOU ARE.
AND THE SCAN CONFIRMED THAT THERE'S
NO BLEEDING IN THE BRAIN.
( Edie shivering )
EDIE, IF YOU WANT ME TO UNSTRAP YOU
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO LET GO OF MY HAND.
I THOUGHT YOU WERE DIFFERENT.
I THOUGHT YOU UNDERSTOOD THE REAL ME.
OBVIOUSLY, I WAS MISTAKEN.
AMANDA, WHAT'S GOING ON?
UNSTRAP...
I'M A FINE DOCTOR, MARK.
I HAVE WHAT IT TAKES.
I KNOW THAT.
THEN WHY DID YOU DOUBT ME?!
NO!
IF THIS IS ABOUT THE ARTICLE, WE CAN TALK...
WHY IS THIS DOOR LOCKED?
THE DOOR'S LOCKED?
I LOVED YOU MORE THAN ANY MAN
HAS A RIGHT TO BE LOVED.
WHAT?!
I NEVER EXPECTED TO FEEL LIKE THIS.
I HATE FEELING LIKE THIS!
AMANDA, I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT!
IF YOU JUST OPEN THIS DOOR...
PLEASE!
IT'S TOO PAINFUL FOR ME TO BE NEAR YOU RIGHT NOW.
CAN WE TALK ABOUT THIS?
NO.
Edie: CAN'T... CAN'T BREATHE!
( gasping )
IT'S OKAY, EDIE. JUST KEEP BREATHING.
KEEP BREATHING.
AMANDA, I WANT TO UNDERSTAND.
IT'S TOO LATE FOR THAT, MARK.
IT'S OVER.
BUT I WILL NEVER FORGET YOU.
AMANDA, WAIT!
AMANDA, WAIT!
LET US OUT OF HERE!
DYING!
( gasping )
IT'S OKAY. OKAY. OKAY.
THEY WERE LOCKED IN THERE HOW LONG?
OVER AN HOUR.
HAVE THEY FOUND DR. LEE YET?
MISSING IN ACTION.
GET THIS.
AMANDA LEE, ALSO KNOWN AS BARBARA HARDIN
ALSO KNOWN AS JANICE ENGLEHART.
SHE NEVER EVEN GOT HER M.D.
SHE'S NOT A REAL DOCTOR?
UNBELIEVABLE.
FROM WHAT THEY CAN TELL
SHE STOLE A.W. LEE'S MEDICAL SCHOOL TRANSCRIPTS
AND USED THEM TO GET INTO A RESIDENCY PROGRAM.
WHY DIDN'T I THINK OF THAT?
IT'S NOT HER FIRST TIME, EITHER.
ACCORDING TO HER RECORDS
SHE ALSO POSED AS A LAWYER AND AN ARCHITECT.
DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY PATIENTS SHE TREATED?
HOSPITAL'S GOING TO HAVE A LIABILITY NIGHTMARE.
I THOUGHT SHE WAS SUCH A GOOD DOCTOR.
CERTAINLY HAD ME FOOLED.
ME, TOO.
WONDER IF MY PORTLAND JOB OFFER WAS MADE UP, TOO?
WHAT JOB OFFER?
EDIE?
OH, DR. GREENE...
I WANT TO THANK YOU.
FOR WHAT?
GETTING YOU HELD HOSTAGE BY A CRAZED LUNATIC?
OH, I HAVEN'T...
I HAVEN'T FELT THIS GOOD IN YEARS.
THAT'S GREAT.
YEAH, I MEAN, IF I CAN SURVIVE THIS HELLHOLE
I CAN SURVIVE ANYTHING.
CAN I CALL YOU A CAB?
NO. NO, THANK YOU.
I THINK I'M JUST GOING TO WALK.
CERVIX IS AT SEVEN CENTIMETERS.
SHOULDN'T BE LONG.
WE'LL GET YOU UPSTAIRS RIGHT NOW.
IS THAT HIM? YES, YES.
I'M TREATING A PATIENT HERE.
HE KILLED MY SON.
Robin: OH, MY GOD.
I'M SORRY.
YOU GOT TO BELIEVE ME.
I DIDN'T MEAN IT.
ARREST HIM.
BABY'S HEART RATE IS SLOWING.
GET HER ON OXYGEN. DON'T LEAVE ME.
I'M RIGHT HERE, BABY.
JUST WANTS TO SEE HIS WIFE THROUGH LABOR.
I'LL STAY WITH HIM.
HE ONLY NEEDS A FEW MORE HOURS.
I WOULD HAVE LIKED A FEW MORE HOURS WITH MY SON.
I'VE GOT TO DO THIS.
MR. GAMBRELL, YOU SHOULD GO WITH THE OFFICER.
YOU CAN POST BAIL.
HOPEFULLY YOU'LL BE BACK BEFORE THE BIRTH.
I'M NOT LEAVING.
I THINK YOU HAVE TO.
NO, HE DOESN'T.
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE VERY GOOD CARE OF HER.
UM... GOOD PICK UP.
SO HOW DO YOU THINK
SHE'S GOTTEN AWAY WITH THIS CHARADE FOR SO LONG?
OBVIOUSLY, DR. LEE'S A FIRST-CLASS PATHOLOGICAL LIAR.
E.R.; IF YOU'RE SICK, WE'LL FIX YOU QUICK.
HEY, DALE.
LISTEN, UM...
LUCY'S A GOOD KID
SO... TRY TO BE NICE.
JOHN, I'M ALWAYS NICE.
SHE TOLD ME ABOUT GETTING NEEDLE-STUCK.
THE GUY TESTED HIV-NEGATIVE, RIGHT?
YEAH, THANK GOD.
I'LL SAY.
MEANS I GOT A CHANCE AT SCORING TONIGHT AFTER ALL.
Lucy: DR. CARTER, DO YOU HAVE
A LUCKY NUMBER YOU WANT ME TO BET ON?
NO, THANKS.
NOT FEELING VERY LUCKY TONIGHT.
I AM.
SHALL WE, LUCY?
BYE.
YES. IF I MUST.
I'M TRYING TO APPRISE THE C.E.O.
ABOUT DR. LEE
BUT HE KEEPS PUTTING ME ON HOLD.
I THOUGHT YOU SHOULD KNOW--
A PATIENT DIED UNDER HERS AND MY CARE TODAY.
WELL, THAT'S JUST WHAT I DIDN'T NEED TO HEAR.
HOWEVER, I... I DON'T BELIEVE EITHER OF US MADE ANY ERRORS.
WELL, I'M SURE THE HOSPITAL ATTORNEYS WILL WANT
TO SPEAK TO YOU ABOUT IT.
I'VE ALSO BEEN THINKING
ABOUT WHAT YOU SAID EARLIER
AND, UM, I INTEND TO PURSUE THE PUBLICATION OF MY PAPER.
YES. YES. I'M HERE.
CAN YOU HOLD ONE SECOND, PLEASE?
IN LIGHT OF THE AMANDA LEE DEBACLE
IT'S OBVIOUS NONE OF US ARE ABOVE REPROACH.
I ADMIRE YOUR DIRECTNESS.
ALL RIGHT, GIVE ME A LIST OF THE JOURNALS
YOU'D LIKE TO SUBMIT TO
AND I'LL ATTACH A COVER LETTER.
THANK YOU, DONALD.
YEAH. WHERE WERE WE?
HOW WE DOING?
SHE'S CROWNING.
MIKE'S NOT GOING TO MAKE IT, IS HE?
NO, BUT WE'RE GOING TO GET THROUGH THIS, ROBIN, OKAY?
( screaming )
NOW, TAKE A DEEP BREATH
AND PUSH. THERE YOU GO.
BEGINNING TO GUIDE THE HEAD OUT.
DEEP BREATH... AND PUSH AGAIN.
( screaming )
GOOD.
MARK'S MADE SOME BAD CHOICES IN WOMEN BEFORE
BUT I THINK HE OUTDID HIMSELF THIS TIME.
I KNEW THERE WAS SOMETHING OFF ABOUT HER.
I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT.
CAN I JUST ASK YOU A QUESTION?
WAS THE FIRE ESCAPE THING FOR REAL?
WHAT FIRE ESCAPE?
NEVER MIND.
UH-OH. THINK WE SHOULD OPEN IT?
TOO THIN TO BE A BOMB.
WHAT IS IT?
"THIS IS FOR YOU.
"IT IS A POEM YOU INSPIRED ME TO WRITE.
"BECAUSE TWO BODIES, NAKED AND ENTWINED
"LEAP OVER TIME
"THEY ARE INVULNERABLE.
"NOTHING CAN TOUCH THEM.
Takata and Greene: "THEY RETURN TO THE SOURCE."
"THERE'S NO YOU, NO I...
NO TOMORROW..."
OCTAVIO PAZ, MY FAVORITE POET.
THERE YOU GO.
LOOKS LIKE YOU INSPIRED HER TO PLAGIARIZE.
JUST GO.
SO, DINNER FOR THREE?
I'M GOING TO HIT THE GYM FIRST.
CAROL... I THOUGHT I'D MISSED YOU.
HEY, JOI, IS SOMETHING WRONG?
I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT WHAT YOU SAID
ABOUT RESPITE CARE.
MY DAUGHTER HAS A DANCE RECITAL NEXT WEEK.
IT WOULD MEAN A LOT TO HER IF I WAS THERE.
OF COURSE. I'LL MAKE SOME CALLS
FIRST THING IN THE MORNING
AND FIND SOMEONE TO HELP.
I APPRECIATE THAT.
HEY, KIDDO, HOW YOU DOING?
FINE. YEAH?
HE'S GOT A LITTLE CONJUNCTIVITIS IN HIS LEFT EYE.
I MEANT TO HAVE THE DOCTOR UPSTAIRS CHECK
BUT THERE WERE SO MANY TESTS.
IT'S ALL RIGHT. I'LL WRITE
A PRESCRIPTION FOR GENTAMICIN.
WE'LL GET HIM CLEARED RIGHT UP.
OKAY.
WELL, THIS IS GETTING A LITTLE RIDICULOUS.
I WAS COMING BY TO SEE HOW THE GAMBRELL WIFE AND BABY ARE DOING.
ACCORDING TO DR. WEAVER, MOTHER AND DAUGHTER ARE FINE.
WELL, I'LL CALL IN
AND HAVE THEM TELL THE DAD.
IT'S A SHAME, REALLY. HE'S NOT A BAD GUY.
HE JUST MADE ONE REALLY DUMB MISTAKE.
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.
IT IS A SHAME.
YOU HAVE A GOOD ONE, JEANIE.
HEY, REGGIE.
HMM?
I'VE GOT PLANS FOR TONIGHT
BUT YOU WANT TO CATCH A MOVIE TOMORROW NIGHT?
LET ME THINK ABOUT IT.
OKAY.
OKAY.
GOOD NIGHT. GOOD NIGHT.
HI, DR. WEAVER.
HEY.
I.N.H.
OH, YOU CONVERTED, HUH?
HEY, YOUR MOM, SHE, UH... SHE NEVER CALLED BACK.
MY MOM'S DEAD.
UH, I WAS ADOPTED.
POSSIBLE THAT CALL WAS FROM MY BIRTH MOTHER.
WOW. I, UH, I DIDN'T KNOW.
YEAH, WELL, PROBABLY A WRONG NUMBER
SO, FALSE ALARM.
HAVE YOU BEEN LOOKING FOR HER?
I PUT MY NAME ON THE INTERNET ABOUT A MONTH AGO.
MY PARENTS
MY-MY ADOPTED... PARENTS
HAVE BEEN GONE ABOUT A YEAR NOW, SO...
WELL, I WOULD THINK THAT THERE WOULD BE AGENCIES--
YEAH, THERE ARE.
THERE ARE.
GO ON, IT'S FRIDAY NIGHT.
I'LL MISS MY CURTAIN IF I DON'T MOVE IT.
HAVE A GOOD TIME.
HEY, THANKS.
( door closes )
HEY.
HEY.
WHAT'S HAPPENING, REESE?
HUH?
( gurgling )
WHAT?
( laughing )
HEY... HEY... HEY...
YOU KNOW WHO I AM?
HUH?
REESE, YOU KNOW WHO I AM?
WHO AM I? HUH?
CAN YOU SAY "FATHER"?
COME ON, MAN.
LET ME SHOW YOU. LOOK.
CAN YOU SAY "DADDY"?
HUH?
SEE WHAT I LEARNED: "DADDY." SEE, "DADDY"?
COME ON, REESE.
EH... NEVER MIND.
YEAH. HEY...
( laughing )
HEY, MAN.
( playful growling )
( gurgling )
