PREVIOUSLY ON E.R.:
NO!
GIVE HIM BACK TO ME! GIVE HIM TO ME!
COCO.
GROUP THERAPY YOUR FIRST WEEK?
ALL I DID WAS OBSERVE THE FIRST TWO WEEKS OF MY PSYCH ROTATION.
I'M GOING TO HAVE A BABY.
I HEARD THERE MIGHT BE A SURGICAL TRAUMA
FELLOWSHIP RUN OUT OF THE E.R.
IT WAS MY IDEA.
I BROUGHT IT TO GREENE AND WEAVER.
I NEED TIME FOR REESE.
DON'T USE HIM AS AN EXCUSE TO SCREW ME OVER.
HEY, I'LL FIND SOMETHING ELSE.
NO, I DON'T WANT YOU TO FORFEIT IT TO ME.
IF YOU WANT IT, BY ALL MEANS, YOU GO FOR IT.
I'LL STILL GET IT.
MORNING, CAROL.
MORNING.
DID YOU SEE THAT BEAUTIFUL BLUE SKY?
OH, NOT YET. I CAME IN WHEN IT WAS STILL DARK.
NO, THANKS. CRACKER?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
I WOKE UP WITH AN URGE TO CLEAN.
DO YOU REALIZE THIS PERITONEAL LAVAGE KIT
EXPIRED IN 1996?
LISTEN, IF YOUR SYMPTOMS PERSIST
MAYBE YOU COULD WORK YOUR MAGIC ON THE ADMIT AREA.
YEAH, I THINK I'VE BEEN CURED, THANKS.
WELL, IT WAS WORTH A SHOT.
MORNING, DOC. MORNING.
WHOA. I'M SORRY. EXCUSE ME.
NO, IT'S MY FAULT. I WASN'T LOOKING WHERE I WAS GOING.
YOU'RE LOOKING BRIGHT.
OH, WELL, UH, YEAH, I'M PRESENTING ON A PANEL THIS AFTERNOON
AT THE CHICAGO SOCIETY OF TRAUMA PHYSICIANS.
I'LL STOP GRIPING ABOUT HAVING TO ATTEND.
WHAT'S YOUR TOPIC?
ULTRASOUND VERSUS C.T. IN BLUNT ABDOMINAL TRAUMA.
I'VE GOT SOME PROMISING FINDINGS, ACTUALLY.
I LOOK FORWARD TO IT.
OW!
HEY, MAN, YOU WANT TO TRY GETTING IT TO ME NEXT TIME?
THE PROPER WAY TO THROW A FRISBEE
IS OFF THE MIDDLE FINGER, SIDE-ARM.
FOR ME, IT'S THE, UH...
FLICK OF THE WRIST THAT GIVES IT THAT ROTATION.
GREAT CATCH.
FOR ME, THE KEY TO FRISBEE IS A LIGHT TOUCH.
SO YOU'RE ON YOUR WAY TO WORK.
YES, MY SHIFT BEGINS IN 15 MINUTES
AND TODAY'S MY LAST DAY.
OH, I THOUGHT EVERYTHING WAS GOING WELL WITH THE I.N.S.
OH, IT IS. I GOT AMNESTY.
CONGRATULATIONS.
THANK YOU.
I'M GOING TO SCHOOL TO GET MY CIVIL ENGINEERING LICENSE.
YOU AND KUBBY GOING TO STAY HERE IN CHICAGO?
YES.
GREAT.
CAROL, DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT THIS WOMAN, COCO ROBBINS?
OH, YEAH. HER AND HER BABY
ARE COMING INTO THE CLINIC TODAY, RIGHT?
SHE'S SCHIZOPHRENIC AND SOCIAL SERVICES
IS HAVING US MONITOR HER BABY CARE?
WELL, I HAD TO MAKE SURE SHE'S TAKING HER MEDS.
WELL, IT'S A PRETTY RISKY PROPOSITION, ISN'T IT?
SHE DESERVES A CHANCE.
SO THIS WAS YOUR IDEA?
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT, LYNETTE.
I AM IN TOUCH WITH THE HALFWAY HOUSE
WHERE HER AND HER BABY ARE LIVING
AND I'LL VOLUNTEER TO BE THERE FOR ALL HER APPOINTMENTS.
YOU ASKED ME TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CLINIC, REMEMBER?
AND I DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THIS.
YOU'RE RIGHT.
I'M SORRY.
I SHOULD HAVE TOLD YOU
ABOUT THE ARRANGEMENTS I'D MADE.
NO, CAROL.
YOU SHOULD HAVE ASKED.
SHE'S DUE IN A FEW MINUTES.
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING?
DRAFTING TEAMS FOR ROTISSERIE BASEBALL.
YOU WANT IN?
CAN I DRAFT KEN GRIFFEY?
HE'S MINE.
I ALREADY GOT SAMMY SOSA.
'CAUSE HE'S GOT
THE CUTEST BUNS IN BASEBALL.
CARTER! HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO PERFORM A RIGHTEOUS ACT
AND MAKE ME A HAPPY MAN ALL AT ONCE?
ALL RIGHT.
DEAN SIGNED US ON FOR A MENTORING PROJECT
AT THE MATH-SCIENCE MAGNET SCHOOL.
IT'S P.R., YOU KNOW. THEY PUT SOME OF THEIR
TOP HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS INTO AREA HOSPITALS
LIKE A, UH, AN INDEPENDENT STUDY PROGRAM.
SO WE'RE GETTING ONE WHETHER WE LIKE IT OR NOT.
I NEED YOU TO HOLD HIS HAND
AND GIVE HIM A FEW ERRANDS TO RUN.
AH, OKAY.
GOOD. IT IS A PUBLIC SCHOOL, BUT I'M ASSURED
THE KID IS NOT A CONVICTED FELON.
WHEN'S THIS ALL SUPPOSED TO TAKE PLACE?
ANY TIME NOW.
KID'S NAME IS ANTOINE.
OH, TODAY?
YEAH, AND DON'T LEAVE HIM UNATTENDED
AROUND THE DRUG LOCKUP.
THANK YOU.
WHAT'S WRONG?
NOTHING. ARE YOU BACK?
NO, I'M STILL ON PSYCH.
YOU'LL BE BACK DOING REAL MEDICINE SOON
SO DON'T GET TOO USED TO THE CUSH LIFE.
YEAH, I WON'T.
SALLY McKENNA?
DID THEY GET THE GLASS OUT OF HIS EYE?
THE DOCTOR'S STILL WITH YOUR HUSBAND.
MY NAME IS LUCY KNIGHT.
I'M A STUDENT DOCTOR IN PSYCHIATRY.
CAN I ASK YOU A FEW QUESTIONS?
LISTEN, MICHAEL'S BEEN VERY STRESSED OUT.
I MEAN, HE'S IN LAW SCHOOL
BUT HE'S NEVER DONE ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE.
THE DOCTOR SAID HE ATTACKED A CAR?
HE WAS WORKING ON A PAPER FOR THE LAST FEW DAYS
SO I-I LEFT HIM ALONE, AND TODAY I WOKE UP
AND-AND HE WAS IN THE STREET SMASHING OUR CAR
WITH AN ALUMINUM BAT.
AND DOES MICHAEL HAVE ANY HISTORY
OF PSYCHIATRIC PROBLEMS?
NO, NOT AT ALL.
MICHAEL EVER USE ANY DRUGS?
NO. NEVER.
I MEAN, HE'LL DRINK A FEW BEERS, BUT I MEAN, A FEW BEERS
DOESN'T MAKE A PERSON FREAK OUT LIKE THAT, YOU KNOW.
I MEAN, I-I THINK IT'S JUST, IT'S JUST A BUILDUP OF STRESS.
WELL, I WILL GO TALK TO YOUR HUSBAND
AS SOON AS THE E.R. DOCS ARE DONE WITH HIM.
Benton: HEY, JEANIE.
STILL DOING TRIAGE?
UH-HUH.
SO, HOW YOU FEELING?
NOT BAD.
ANY, UH... SIDE EFFECTS FROM THE RIBAVIRIN?
NO.
NAUSEA? FATIGUE?
PETER, PLEASE. I'M FINE.
YOU LOOK A LITTLE TIRED. LET ME CHECK YOUR L.F.T.s.
IF THE HEP MEDS AREN'T WORKING
THE SOONER WE KNOW, THE BETTER.
I'VE GOT A LAB APPOINTMENT
THIS AFTERNOON.
LISTEN, IF, UM... YOU KNOW, IF YOU NEED ME...
THANKS. EXCUSE ME.
I'VE GOT PATIENTS I NEED TO TRIAGE.
CAROL, YOUR APPOINTMENT HASN'T SHOWN UP.
WHAT?
COCO ROBBINS AND HER BABY-- THEY'RE LATE.
DID SHE CALL?
I TRIED CALLING HER.
NO ONE AT THE HALFWAY HOUSE
HAS SEEN HER ALL MORNING.
MAYBE I SHOULD GO OVER THERE.
MAYBE YOU SHOULD CALL
CHILDREN AND FAMILY SERVICES OR THE POLICE.
GOD, I DIDN'T THINK SHE'D DO THIS.
IF SHE DOESN'T STAY ON MEDS, THERE'S NOTHING WE CAN DO.
Jerry: HEY, CAROL.
THERE'S SOMEONE HERE TO SEE YOU, A COCO ROBBINS.
COCO.
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?
ON MY WAY HERE. I KNOW I'M EARLY
BUT I WASN'T SURE I SHOULD BOTHER YOU.
EARLY?
12:00 NOON?
YEAH, THEY WROTE IT DOWN FOR ME.
OH. I MUST HAVE WRITTEN IT DOWN WRONG IN THE BOOK.
IS IT STILL OKAY?
YEAH, IT'S FINE.
NURSE HATHAWAY WILL TAKE YOU INTO THE CLINIC.
COME ON, COCO.
HOW'S HE DOING?
REALLY GOOD.
HE'S SO BEAUTIFUL, ISN'T HE?
HE IS BEAUTIFUL.
MORNING, PETER.
HEY.
I UNDERSTAND THE TRAUMA FELLOWSHIP'S GOING TO HAPPEN.
ANSPAUGH'S MADE A FORMAL ANNOUNCEMENT.
LOOK, I'M-I'M SORRY
I CAME DOWN SO HARD ON YOU
ABOUT YOUR INTEREST.
UM... IT WAS REALLY SILLY OF ME TO BE
SO PROPRIETARY ABOUT IT.
WELL, APPARENTLY THEY'RE EXPECTING
AT LEAST 15 APPLICANTS.
REALLY?
SO, UM...
HAVE YOU GIVEN UP THE CARDIOTHORACIC?
HMM?
HAVEN'T MADE UP MY MIND YET.
WELL, BY ALL MEANS FEEL FREE TO APPLY
FOR THE TRAUMA FELLOWSHIP.
I APPRECIATE THAT.
IF YOU DO, WE HAVE THE INSIDE TRACK.
YOU KNOW, HOME TEAM ADVANTAGE.
YEAH.
SO, UM...
ARE YOU PLANNING ON GOING
TO THE TRAUMA CONFERENCE THIS AFTERNOON?
NO, I COULDN'T GET AWAY.
ROMANO HAS ME DOING A KEYHOLE CARDIAC BYPASS.
OH, VERY FANCY.
WELL, I DON'T THINK YOU'LL BE MISSING MUCH.
I UNDERSTAND IT'S A RATHER DULL AFFAIR.
YEAH, YEAH, PROBABLY.
OKAY. WELL, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME
I HAVE A PARTIAL GASTRECTOMY TO GET TO.
LUCY, TELL ME ABOUT MICHAEL McKENNA
THAT PATIENT WHO SMASHED UP HIS CAR.
I WAS JUST GOING IN TO SEE HIM.
YOU HAVEN'T WORKED HIM UP YET?
THE E.R. JUST GOT DONE WITH HIM.
LUCY, WHAT I NEED YOU FOR
IS TO PULL THE INFORMATION AND PRESENT THE PATIENT
SO I CAN QUICKLY DECIDE
IF THEY NEED TO BE ADMITTED OR MEDICATED.
HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE YOU?
15 MINUTES.
I'LL SEE YOU IN TEN.
ENJOYING YOUR PSYCH ROTATION?
I GUESS YOU HEARD THAT.
A LITTLE ADVICE-- AS A MED STUDENT
YOUR JOB IS TO GET TO KNOW PATIENTS
NOT BE HAND SERVANT TO YOUR RESIDENT
AND WORK UP ALL
HIS PATIENTS FOR HIM.
BUT MED STUDENTS WHO HELP THEIR RESIDENTS GET BETTER GRADES.
NOW IS THE TIME TO LEARN
ABOUT TALKING AND LISTENING TO PATIENTS.
DON'T LET THAT GET LOST IN THE SHUFFLE.
RIGHT. THANKS. YOU'RE WELCOME.
HER CHEST SOUNDS A LITTLE TIGHT.
SHE'LL NEED TO STAY FOR AN ALBUTEROL TREATMENT.
WILL SHE BE OKAY?
SHE'LL BE FINE.
HEY, NITA. IT'S REVEREND LYNN.
WOULD YOU CANCEL ALL MY MORNING APPOINTMENTS?
YEAH, LOOKS LIKE I'LL BE HERE FOR A WHILE.
YEAH, RIGHT. BYE.
SORRY THIS IS TAKING SO LONG.
YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY BUSY.
I CAN WAIT.
HOW'D YOU DO THAT TO YOUR THUMB?
HAMMERING THE GUTTER ON MY CHURCH.
IT HURTS LIKE HELL.
I'M MATTHEW LYNN.
HI. JEANIE BOULET.
YOU'RE A MINISTER?
SOUTH STREET A.M.E.
DO YOU KNOW IT?
I'M NOT MUCH OF A CHURCHGOER.
I HAD MY FILL AS A CHILD BEING TOLD WHAT I COULDN'T DO.
I HEAR YOU.
YOU HAVE A SUBUNGUAL HEMATOMA--
A COLLECTION OF BLOOD UNDER YOUR NAIL.
IT'S A SIMPLE PROCEDURE TO DRAIN IT
SO I WILL CALL A DOCTOR
AND GIVE YOU SOMETHING FOR THE PAIN.
LOOKS LIKE YOU ALSO HAVE
SOME SWOLLEN JOINTS.
RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS.
I'VE HAD IT FOR YEARS.
I TAKE A BUNCH OF PILLS FOR THE INFLAMMATION
THEN I TAKE ANOTHER BUNCH
TO KEEP THE FIRST BUNCH FROM GIVING ME AN ULCER.
THAT'S NOT MUCH FUN.
OH, I'M PRETTY LUCKY.
I'VE SEEN WORSE.
WELL, I WOULD LAY OFF THE HAMMERING FOR A WHILE.
I DON'T WANT YOU HAVING ANOTHER ACCIDENT.
I DON'T BELIEVE IN ACCIDENTS.
IF I HADN'T HIT MY THUMB, WE WOULD NEVER HAVE MET.
SO THIS IS A DIVINE INTERVENTION.
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
YOU ANTOINE BELL?
MM-HMM.
AH, I'M DR. CARTER.
HOW YOU DOING?
ALL RIGHT.
YOU'LL BE SPENDING SOME TIME WITH US, HUH?
COME ON. LET ME SHOW YOU AROUND.
IT'S A LITTLE SLOW RIGHT NOW
BUT THAT CAN ALWAYS CHANGE.
Anspaugh: SORRY I COULDN'T MAKE THE TRAUMA CONFERENCE.
I HAD A CONFLICT
WITH THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE.
I'LL CAUTERIZE THAT BLEEDER IN THE ABDOMINAL WALL.
MM-HMM.
IF YOU LIKE, I CAN LEAVE A COPY
OF MY TALK IN YOUR OFFICE.
YOU KNOW, I FOUND THE POSITIVE PREDICTIVE VALUE OF ULTRASOUND
IS ACTUALLY HIGHER THAN PREVIOUSLY REPORTED.
EXCELLENT.
AND BY THE WAY
WHAT DID YOU THINK OF, UH, PETER'S STUDY?
HE TOLD ME HE WASN'T PRESENTING TODAY.
NO, NO, NO. I'M TALKING ABOUT THE STERNAL SAW PAPER
HE AND KERRY WEAVER HAD ACCEPTED
BY THE ANNALS OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE.
QUITE PROVOCATIVE.
REALLY?
YES. IT COULD ATTRACT THE GRANT MONEY WE'LL BE NEEDING
TO KEEP THE TRAUMA FELLOWSHIP RUNNING.
HMM.
I LOOK FORWARD TO READING IT.
MICHAEL?
HI.
I'M LUCY KNIGHT.
HOW ARE YOU FEELING?
PRETTY EMBARRASSED.
I'M FROM PSYCHIATRY
AND I JUST WANT TO TALK TO YOU BRIEFLY.
SO, LAW SCHOOL'S BEEN PRETTY ROUGH GOING, YOUR WIFE SAID?
IT HAS, BUT I GOT OUT OF MY SYSTEM WHAT I NEEDED TO GET OUT
AND I'M FINE NOW.
I'VE FELT LIKE SMASHING THINGS BEFORE.
WHAT GOT YOU TO THE POINT WHERE YOU ACTUALLY DID IT?
UH, YOU KNOW...
PRESSURE... THINGS.
AND HOW HAVE THE LAST FEW DAYS BEEN?
JUST... FORMULATING MY THOUGHTS.
AND HOW DO YOU COPE WITH YOUR STRESS, USUALLY?
NOT MUCH CAN BE DONE.
DO YOU EVER
HAVE A DRINK?
MAYBE A FEW BEERS?
I-I DO.
AND HAVE YOU BEEN DRINKING MORE RECENTLY
TO COPE WITH THE STRESS?
HOW MUCH HAVE YOU HAD TO DRINK
IN THE LAST FEW DAYS?
DRINKING... HELPS.
OH, GOD.
IT-IT HELPS YOU RELAX?
IT HELPS THEM BE...
MORE QUIET.
WHO DOES IT MAKE MORE QUIET?
MY DEMONS.
YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME, BUT...
I HEAR THEM.
ARE YOU HEARING THEM NOW?
MICHAEL?
I'LL CALL DR. MYERS.
I WOULD NEVER HURT MY WIFE.
I'M STRONGER THAN THEY ARE.
THEY... I WOULDN'T DO WHAT THEY SAID.
I HIT THE CAR INSTEAD.
THEY WANTED ME TO DO IT TO HER, BUT...
I HIT THE CAR.
AT 4:25 THIS MORNING AND HE BURPED AT 4:47.
HE PEED AT 5:05...
YOU'RE WRITING THIS ALL DOWN?
IS THAT OKAY?
OF COURSE.
I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE
PEOPLE SEE THAT I'M GETTING IT ALL RIGHT.
COULD YOU LISTEN TO HIS HEART?
IT BEATS SO FAST.
BABIES' HEARTS BEAT FASTER THAN ADULTS.
IT'S PERFECTLY NORMAL.
OH, GOOD. I THOUGHT MAYBE SOMETHING
WAS WRONG, WHICH IS WHY I CAME A LITTLE EARLY.
NO, HE'S FINE.
AREN'T YOU?
SOMETIMES HE SPITS UP A LITTLE AFTER HE EATS.
MM-HMM, WHICH IS PERFECTLY NORMAL
FOR A HAPPY, HEALTHY BABY.
YOU CAN RELAX, COCO.
HE'S DOING GREAT
AND YOU'RE DOING GREAT.
I THINK HE'S A VERY LUCKY LITTLE BOY.
I HAVE TO DO RIGHT WITH THIS.
BETTER THAN... BETTER THAN RIGHT.
I KNOW, AND YOU ARE.
IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG, I KNOW I'LL LOSE HIM.
YOU TAKING YOUR MEDS?
YEAH, YEAH. IT'S RIGHT HERE.
LOOK AT MY JOURNAL.
EVERYTHING'S GOING GOOD AT THE HALFWAY HOUSE?
GREAT. THERE'S ANOTHER WOMAN THERE WITH A TWO-MONTH-OLD GIRL.
EVERYONE'S SO NICE.
THEY JUST LOVE HAVING THESE LITTLE BABIES AROUND.
WHAT'S NOT TO LOVE?
ANY QUESTIONS?
YOU'LL BE BACK IN TWO DAYS?
TWO DAYS, 10:00 A.M.
I'LL BE HERE.
Greene: YOU'LL HAVE TO DO BETTER
CONTROLLING YOUR TEMPER, MR. PIPITONE.
NO MORE PUTTING YOUR FOOT THROUGH PICTURE FRAMES.
MY PASSION GOT THE BETTER OF ME.
WHAT CAN I TELL YOU?
SHE'S LUCKY THAT'S ALL I PUT MY FOOT THROUGH.
ARE YOU MARRIED?
DIVORCED.
DATING ANYBODY STEADY?
NOT RIGHT NOW.
THERE YOU GO-- FAST AND LOOSE.
DON'T LET THEM GET THEIR HOOKS INTO YOU.
FROM THE AGE THEY GROW BOOBS TILL THE DAY THEY DIE
THEY CAN MAKE YOU CRAZY.
DO I TELL THE TRUTH?
YEAH.
ALL RIGHT, IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE
TO STAY OFF THIS FOOT FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS.
A COUPLE OF WEEKS?
DOC, I CAN'T DO THAT.
I GOT TO GET BACK OUT ON THE DANCE FLOOR.
I GO BALLROOM DANCING A COUPLE, THREE TIMES A WEEK.
Takata: REALLY?
YOU DANCE?
NO.
WHAT YOU GOT AGAINST DANCING?
IT'LL TURN YOU INTO A CHICK MAGNET.
I'D LIKE TO DANCE.
I JUST NEVER LEARNED HOW...
EXCEPT FOR MY WEDDING.
I LEARNED TO TANGO.
AH, THE TANGO.
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.
ALL RIGHT, MR. PIPITONE.
I'LL CHECK IN WITH YOU LATER.
TWO WEEKS, HUH?
WITH THE FOOT?
TWO WEEKS.
Jerry: HEY, CARTER
WHERE'S YOUR "SCARED STRAIGHT" KID?
I WANT TO GIVE HIM
THE OBLIGATORY TOUR OF THE MORGUE.
HE'S NOT A "SCARED STRAIGHT" KID.
HE'S FROM THE MATH-SCIENCE MAGNET SCHOOL.
WHO SAID HE WAS A "SCARED STRAIGHT" KID?
NO ONE. MY MISTAKE.
IF YOU SEE HIM, TELL HIM I'M LOOKING FOR HIM.
HEY, ANTOINE, WE GOT A TRAUMA COMING IN.
PARAMEDICS ARE BRINGING IN A STABBING VICTIM.
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE HIM INTO THAT TRAUMA ROOM RIGHT THERE
AND I WANT YOU TO FOLLOW ALONG, ALL RIGHT?
ALL RIGHT. JUST HANG BACK.
SETH WILLOWS?
HERE WE ARE.
Carol: MRS. WILLOWS?
NO. MY NAME IS LEILA MORGAN.
THIS IS MY FOSTER SON, SETH.
HI, SETH.
I'M NURSE HATHAWAY.
WHAT HAPPENED HERE?
HE PUT HIS HAND THROUGH A WINDOW.
CAN I TAKE A LOOK...?
NO.
IT WON'T HURT.
NO!
( grunts )
SETH, STOP THIS!
CAROL, YOU OKAY?
YEP.
OKAY, SETH
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE A SEAT?
SIT DOWN RIGHT THERE NOW... PLEASE.
I'M SO SORRY. WE'RE HAVING SUCH TROUBLE WITH HIM.
I'M GOING TO GET HIM INTO AN EXAM ROOM
TAKE A LOOK AT THE HAND.
I'M ALSO GOING TO CALL FOR A PSYCH CONSULT.
WE GOT A 55-YEAR-OLD MAN STABBED IN THE NECK
DURING A ROBBERY.
B.P.'s 135/82, PULSE 110.
AIRWAY SEEMS OKAY.
WE GOT A ZONE TWO NECK INJURY.
GOOD CAROTID PULSE.
CAN YOU SEE?
WHAT ELSE ABOUT THE THIRD MAN?
WAS HE BIG, SMALL?
SKINNY, NOT BIG.
EXCUSE ME, SIR, ARE YOU USUALLY HOARSE LIKE THIS?
NO.
ALL RIGHT, COULD BE A NERVE INJURY.
OR AN EXPANDING HEMATOMA.
CALL X RAY. I NEED A NECK FILM.
PULSE OX 96.
Carter: YOU WANT TO EXPLORE HIM IN THE O.R.?
Corday: NO, HE'S PRETTY STABLE.
"SKINNY" AND WHAT ELSE, MR. CHO?
WHAT WAS HE WEARING?
I DON'T KNOW. DARK CLOTHES...
ALL RIGHT, ON MY COUNT. ONE, TWO, THREE.
HE NEEDS A TETANUS BOOSTER.
GRAM OF ANCEF?
NO, LET'S GIVE HIM THREE OF UNASYN.
WHY WASN'T I PAGED?
DIDN'T NEED YOU.
OKAY, HERE'S THE PLAN.
CHEST IS CLEAR.
WE NEED AN ANGIOGRAPHY, ESOPHAGOSCOPY, LARYNGOSCOPY.
WE SHOULD PROTECT HIS AIRWAY FIRST.
I'M COVERING THE E.R., ALL RIGHT?
FINE. I'M FINISHED HERE.
Carter: CHUNI, DRAW UP FOUR OF VERSED AND TEN OF NORCURON.
WE'RE GIVING YOU SOME MEDICINE.
IT WILL MAKE YOU SLEEP.
WHEN YOU WAKE UP
A TUBE WILL BE IN YOUR MOUTH.
NO. I GOT TO FINISH THE DESCRIPTIONS.
HE NEEDS TO BE SEDATED AND INTUBATED.
HIS WIFE IS D.O.A. THE KILLERS ARE AT LARGE.
JUST GIVE ME A MINUTE TO GET THE DESCRIPTION.
PLEASE...
ALL RIGHT.
MR. CHO, THE TEENAGER-- WAS HE DARK-SKINNED? LIGHT-SKINNED?
Cho: MEDIUM.
GOING MY WAY?
IF YOU'RE GOING UP TO THE O.R., I AM.
WHY SO GLUM ON THIS BRIGHT SPRING DAY?
I'VE GOT A LOT ON MY MIND.
WOULD THAT BE THE TRAUMA FELLOWSHIP
I HEAR YOU'VE APPLIED FOR?
MIGHT BE.
I'LL HAVE TO INVITE MYSELF
TO SIT ON THE SELECTION COMMITTEE.
ANSPAUGH SAYS YOU'VE GOT A FIGHTING CHANCE.
WELL, I DID HAVE
BEFORE PETER DECIDED TO APPLY.
PETER'S APPLIED FOR THE TRAUMA FELLOWSHIP?
YEAH. HAVEN'T YOU HEARD?
NO. I MUST BE OUT OF THE LOOP.
I'M SURE HE WAS
PLANNING ON TELLING YOU.
YES, I'M SURE IT WAS JUST AN OVERSIGHT.
I AM SO SORRY FOR THE WAIT.
SOMEONE WILL BE IN SOON.
THE SUN IS SHINING, THE BIRDS ARE SINGING
AND AFTER THAT VICODIN, I'M FEELING NO PAIN.
OKAY.
WAIT.
WHY DON'T YOU DO MY...
WHAT DID YOU CALL IT?
SUBUNGUAL HEMATOMA.
I SEE YOU'RE A PHYSICIAN ASSISTANT.
WELL, I'M WORKING TRIAGE TODAY.
YOU SAID IT'S A VERY SIMPLE PROCEDURE.
TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH, I'M NOT DOING
PROCEDURES ANYMORE. "ANYMORE"?
I HAVE HEPATITIS C, REVEREND LYNN
AND I DON'T WANT TO RISK INFECTING YOU.
HOW COULD YOU INFECT ME?
WELL, IF I CUT MYSELF...
CUT YOURSELF?
ON WHAT?
I THOUGHT YOU JUST NEEDED TO DRAIN
THE BLOOD BLISTER.
THAT'S TRUE.
SO, IF YOU'RE CAREFUL, IT SHOULDN'T BE ANY PROBLEM.
RIGHT.
REMEMBER, I DON'T BELIEVE IN ACCIDENTS.
HMM?
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR KID, CARTER?
YOU THINK THE BLOOD FREAKED HIM OUT?
MAYBE THE COP FREAKED HIM OUT.
WHAT WAS HE LOCKED UP FOR, ANYWAY?
ANTOINE IS NOT A JUVENILE OFFENDER.
HE ATTENDS THE SOUTHSIDE MATH-SCIENCE HIGH SCHOOL
AND HE'S HERE FOR AN INDEPENDENT STUDY PROJECT.
HI, I'M LUCY KNIGHT
AND THIS MUST BE SETH.
HEY, SETH, HOW YOU DOING IN THERE?
I'VE ONLY HAD HIM A FEW WEEKS.
HE GOT KICKED OUT OF A GROUP HOME.
I THOUGHT I'D TAKE HIM ON.
I'VE HANDLED SOME TOUGH ONES.
WHY WAS HE KICKED OUT?
TOO MUCH OF A HANDFUL.
HE'S BEEN SHUTTLED FROM FOSTER HOME TO FOSTER HOME
FOR THE PAST THREE YEARS.
HOW ARE YOU FEELING, SETH?
( grunts )
I'M SORRY ABOUT HIM KICKING THAT NURSE.
I GAVE HIM SOME INDERAL.
HE SHOULDN'T TRY TO ATTACK YOU.
HE'S ON INDERAL?
THEY JUST PUT HIM ON IT. THAT'S THE LATEST.
WHAT OTHER MEDICATIONS IS HE ON?
THIS IS WHAT THEY GAVE ME AT THE GROUP HOME.
TEGRETOL TO CONTROL HIS IMPULSIVENESS
RITALIN AND CLONIDINE
FOR ATTENTION DEFICIT
AND MELLARIL AT BEDTIME TO CALM HIM DOWN.
SOUNDS LIKE HE'S BEING OVERMEDICATED.
HEY, SETH, DO YOU WANT A COOKIE?
SO, HOW ARE THINGS GOING?
OKAY.
DO YOU EVER GET DIZZY SOMETIMES?
SOMETIMES I DO GET A BUZZY FEELING IN MY HEAD.
DO YOU FIND THAT HE'S CLUMSY?
HE CAN BE.
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED HERE.
HE FELL AGAINST A WINDOW.
HE PUT HIS HAND THROUGH TRYING TO BREAK THE FALL.
THIS WASN'T FROM AN OUTBURST.
I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR YOU.
YOU TOOK OFF RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF ALL THE ACTION.
WAS IT THE RECURRENT LARYNGEAL NERVE?
THAT KOREAN... YOU SAID HE HAD A NERVE INJURY
THAT MADE HIM HOARSE. WAS IT THE RECURRENT
LARYNGEAL NERVE THAT GOT INJURED?
YEAH, PROBABLY.
SUPPLIES THE VOCAL CORD MUSCLES.
THAT'S RIGHT.
I LIKE THIS BOOK.
FRANK PUTNAM, PUNCTURE WOUND BELOW THE NIPPLE.
TRIPPED AND FELL
ON A SPRINKLER HEAD WHILE JOGGING.
B.P. IS 95/65, PULSE 120.
DECREASED BREATH SOUNDS ON THE LEFT.
HURTS TO TAKE A BREATH.
Greene: PREP FOR A CHEST TUBE, 32 FRENCH.
WHERE'S MY WIFE?
SHE'S ON HER WAY.
OKAY, EVERYBODY, ON MY COUNT.
ONE, TWO, THREE.
( gasps )
YOU OKAY?
YEAH. I JUST PINCHED MY FINGER.
IT'S ALL HER FAULT.
Greene: BETADINE
NUMBER TEN BLADE AND ONE OF VERSED.
ALL WHO'S FAULT?
MY WIFE...
FORCING ME TO EXERCISE.
I SHOULD HAVE STAYED ON THE COUCH.
Greene: CAROL, CHEST TUBE TRAY.
Putnam: "IT'S A BEAUTIFUL DAY."
"YOU SHOULD BE OUT OF THE HOUSE."
THAT'S THE LAST TIME I LISTEN TO HER.
OKAY, MR. PUTNAM, JUST RELAX.
I'LL DO THE CONSULT. YOU SHOULD FINISH YOUR ROUNDS.
COME ON. I'LL BE ADMITTING THIS PATIENT ANYWAY.
WHAT HAVE WE GOT?
CHEST IMPALEMENT, SIXTH INTERCOSTAL SPACE.
THERE COULD BE INJURIES BELOW THE DIAPHRAGM.
SET UP THE ULTRASOUND.
ABDOMEN'S SOFT AND NON-TENDER.
I THINK IT'S JUST A CHEST INJURY.
WELL, WE CAN'T BE TOO SURE, PETER.
OKAY, TUBE'S IN.
HOOK UP THE THORASEAL, CAROL.
WHERE'S CAROL?
PRESSURE'S 110.
THERE'S NO WAY HE GOT THE SPLEEN.
BETTER SAFE THAN SORRY.
200cc's OUT OF THE CHEST TUBE.
WHAT DID I TELL YOU?
FINE. STILL COULD HAVE NICKED THE DIAPHRAGM.
DIDN'T I SAY THERE WAS NO POSSIBILITY?
ARE WE TAKING HIM TO THE O.R.?
I WANT TO GIVE HIM A LAPAROTOMY.
CHECK HIS DIAPHRAGM.
I'D PREFER LAPAROSCOPY.
YEAH, BUT YOU MIGHT MISS A HOLLOW VISCUS INJURY.
OKAY, LOOK, WHY DON'T YOU GUYS TAKE A MOMENT
AND FIGURE OUT WHAT YOU WANT TO DO?
MARK, I NEED YOUR HELP.
ARE YOU OKAY?
I WAS CRAMPING AND NOW I'M SPOTTING.
IS IT TIME FOR YOUR PERIOD?
NO, MARK.
I'M PREGNANT.
DO YOU SEE A HEARTBEAT?
CAN'T TELL. IT'S HARD TO GET A GOOD VIEW.
COME ON, MARK.
NO.
I DON'T SEE A HEARTBEAT.
( sighing ): OH, MAN.
CAROL, IT'S NOT NECESSARILY A BLIGHTED OVUM.
IT'S PROBABLY JUST TOO EARLY TO SEE WITH THIS.
I'LL CALL RADIOLOGY AND I'LL SET UP AN APPOINTMENT
FOR A VAGINAL ULTRASOUND, ALL RIGHT?
SO YOU, UH, PLANNING ON GOING THROUGH THE PREGNANCY?
( sighs )
I WAS HOPING TO, YEAH.
WHAT DOES DOUG THINK?
UH... I FIGURED I'D WAIT ON THAT ONE.
YOU KNOW, GET THROUGH THE FIRST TRIMESTER.
I MEAN, IF I MISCARRY, THERE'S NOT MUCH TO TELL.
HE'D PROBABLY WANT TO KNOW EITHER WAY.
YEAH, AND I WILL-- I'LL TELL HIM AT SOME POINT.
I'M JUST TRYING TO GET USED TO THIS MYSELF RIGHT NOW
AND... THINGS ARE COMPLICATED ENOUGH.
OKAY.
I'LL CALL FOR THAT APPOINTMENT.
THANKS, MARK.
Carter: AND YOU SAY HE'S BEEN IRRITABLE?
OFF AND ON. KIND OF GROUCHY FROM ALL THE SPITTING UP
AND HIS STOMACH HURTING, PROBABLY.
HAS HE LOST ANY WEIGHT?
I THINK SO, NOW THAT YOU SAY THAT.
HIS PANTS USED TO BE SNUG, AND NOW THEY'RE LOOSER.
WHERE DO YOU LIVE?
SOME APARTMENTS ON COTTAGE GROVE.
PRETTY OLD BUILDING?
YEAH, I'D SAY SO.
THE ROACHES BE HAVING FAMILY REUNIONS.
PEELING PAINT?
PEELING EVERYTHING.
I BET LONNIE LIKES TO PUT THINGS IN HIS MOUTH.
YEAH, HE DO.
HAS HE BEEN SCREENED FOR LEAD?
LEAD? NO.
WHAT'S WRONG WITH HIM, DOCTOR?
WE'LL RUN SOME MORE TESTS
TO TRY AND GET A BETTER SENSE OF WHAT'S WRONG.
SO LET'S GET A C.B.C.
AND A LEAD LEVEL.
RIGHT.
I WANT TO FIND OUT
IF LONNIE'S SYMPTOMS
ARE A RESULT OF LEAD POISONING.
MAYBE FROM EATING FLAKES OF PAINT, WHICH KIDS DO.
THE LEAD LEVEL RESULTS
WON'T BE BACK FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS
BUT THERE ARE THINGS WE CAN LEARN FROM THE BLOOD WORK.
OKAY. WHATEVER. JUST... MAKE HIM BETTER.
MM-HMM.
EASE UP. DOWN.
Romano: DISSECT AND MOBILIZE THE INTERNAL MAMMARY.
GOT IT.
EXCELLENT, PETER.
YOU DEFINITELY HAVE THE DEXTERITY
FOR CARDIOTHORACIC, NO DOUBT ABOUT IT.
THIS IS AMAZING.
IT'S LIKE OPERATING A MARIONETTE.
THE CUTTING EDGE OF CARDIAC BYPASS SURGERY.
DIDN'T I TELL YOU?
YOU TOLD ME.
ALL RIGHT, LET'S KEEP FLOODING THE FIELD WITH CO2.
WE'LL SPOON UP THE CORONARY ARTERY
AND LIFT IT OFF THE ANTERIOR WALL
AND THEN WE'LL ANASTOMOSE THE INTERNAL MAMMARY
TO THE ANTERIOR DESCENDING BRANCH OF THE LEFT CORONARY--
MAKE AN END RUN AROUND THE DISEASED ARTERY.
YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH THE CONCEPT OF AN "END RUN"
AREN'T YOU, DR. BENTON?
OF COURSE I AM.
YES. I KNOW THAT YOU ARE.
NOW, HIGH LEVELS OF LEAD CAN CAUSE
BASOPHILIC STIPPLING IN THE BLOOD CELLS.
AND THERE IT IS.
SEE THIS?
YEP.
AND THE RED CELLS ARE HYPOCHROMIC
OR LESS RED THAN NORMAL RED CELLS...
WHICH IS A SIGN OF ANEMIA.
ANEMIA-- LOW IRON IN THE HEMOGLOBIN.
THAT'S RIGHT.
RED BLOOD CELLS NEED IRON
SO THEY CAN DELIVER OXYGEN TO THE TISSUES.
RIGHT.
KIDS WHO ARE ANEMIC LACK IRON
WHICH MAKES IT VERY EASY
FOR THE LEAD TO BIND TO THE RED BLOOD CELLS.
SO YOU CAN SEE HOW THIS PUTS KIDS LIKE LONNIE
IN A DOUBLY BAD POSITION.
HOW?
WELL, POOR CHILDREN ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE ANEMIC
BECAUSE OF INADEQUATE DIET
AND POOR KIDS ARE MORE LIKELY
TO BE EXPOSED TO LEAD PAINT...
BECAUSE OF LIVING IN OLDER BUILDINGS
INSTEAD OF NEWER ONES.
YES. SO THIS KID'S GOT LEAD POISONING?
MM-HMM. IT LOOKS LIKE A PRETTY SEVERE CASE.
Benton: DR. ROMANO
ARE YOU UPSET ABOUT SOMETHING?
WHY WOULD I BE UPSET?
I'VE BEEN TALKING YOU UP FOR THE CARDIOTHORACIC FELLOWSHIP
TO ANYBODY WHO'LL LISTEN TO ME...
AND THEN TODAY I FIND OUT
YOU'VE THROWN YOUR HAT IN THE RING
FOR THE E.R. TRAUMA FELLOWSHIP.
IT'S A BIT CONFUSING.
WELL, I WASN'T TAKING
THE CARDIOTHORACIC FELLOWSHIP FOR GRANTED.
HMM... SO THE TRAUMA FELLOWSHIP IS JUST A FALLBACK. I SEE.
AND IF YOU WERE SELECTED FOR BOTH, YOU WOULD CHOOSE...?
CARDIOTHORACIC.
ANY INDECISION YOU'RE FEELING ABOUT YOUR FUTURE, DR. BENTON
I CAN HELP.
JUST SAY THE WORD AND I WILL TAKE
THE CARDIOTHORACIC FELLOWSHIP OFF THE TABLE.
NO. IT'S MY FIRST CHOICE.
JUST BE CLEAR, PETER.
FOR YOUR OWN SAKE...
AND MINE.
HEY... CAROL, RADIOLOGY CALLED.
THEY CAN SEE YOU AT 5:00 FOR THE ULTRASOUND.
GREAT. THANKS.
LISTEN, WHY DON'T WE GET OUT OF HERE...
TAKE A WALK, GRAB A MOVIE?
I THOUGHT YOU HAD TO GO TO A TRAUMA CONFERENCE.
UH... WHO WANTS TO HANG OUT IN A ROOM
WITH A BUNCH OF DOCTORS?
GO TO THE CONFERENCE.
I'M FINE.
I KNOW. I JUST THOUGHT...
ACTUALLY, I COULD USE THIS TIME
BY MYSELF RIGHT NOW.
ALL RIGHT, BUT I'M AROUND IF YOU NEED TO TALK.
I KNOW.
OH, I TOLD KERRY THAT YOU WEREN'T FEELING WELL
SO IF YOU HAVE TO TAKE OFF EARLY...
THANKS, MARK.
NURSE HATHAWAY?
COCO, WHAT ARE YOU DOING BACK HERE?
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
IF I DIDN'T DO SOMETHING RIGHT WITH THE BABY
WOULD YOU HAVE TO TELL ON ME?
HOW YOU DOING, SETH?
GOT ANY MORE COOKIES?
SURE, I DO.
I WAS TALKING TO YOUR FOSTER MOM.
SHE SEEMS LIKE A PRETTY NICE LADY.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
SHE'S NEW.
SHE SAID YOUR NATURAL MOM DIED A FEW YEARS AGO.
I NEVER KNEW MY DAD.
IT'S HARD TO GROW UP WITHOUT A PARENT.
SHE DIED IN A CAR CRASH.
IT WAS MY DAD'S FAULT.
THAT'S AN AWFUL THING TO HAPPEN.
DO YOU THINK ABOUT IT A LOT?
NO.
DOES IT MAKE YOU MAD SOMETIMES?
GOT ANY MORE COOKIES?
THOSE WERE MY LAST ONES.
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT YOUR MOM AND DAD
WE DON'T HAVE TO.
WHY DO YOU WANT TO?
I LIKE TALKING TO YOU.
I WANT TO KNOW WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND.
MY DAD GETS DRUNK A LOT.
THAT'S WHY YOU HAVE STAY WITH FOSTER PARENTS SOMETIMES, HUH?
HE'S AN ALCOHOLIC.
A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE THAT PROBLEM.
MAKES IT KIND OF TOUGH ON YOU, THOUGH.
I ONLY WISH THAT MY DAD WOULD COME AND SEE ME SOMETIME.
Corday: TAXI!
TAXI!
( groaning ): COME ON!
HEY...
TAXI!
TAX...
HEY!
HEY! THANK YOU...
VERY MUCH!
Greene: ELIZABETH?
YOU ALL RIGHT?
I CANNOT GET A CAB
IN THIS BLOODY CITY.
LISTEN, UH... YOU COULD TAKE THE EL.
IT GOES RIGHT NEAR THE HOTEL.
ARE YOU SURE?
YEAH, YEAH.
I JUST... I WASN'T SURE ABOUT THE BATH.
NOBODY SHOWED ME. I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.
YES, YOU DID. YOU KNEW TO COME BACK AND ASK FOR HELP.
I WAS AFRAID TO LOOK STUPID.
WELL, YOU DID THE RIGHT THING.
HI.
JUST SUPPORT HIM WITH YOUR HAND, LIKE THAT...
AND THEN JUST GENTLY
WASH HIM WITH A MILD...
SOAP. YES.
YOU'RE GOOD AT THIS.
YOU MUST DO IT A LOT.
NO, NOT REALLY.
YOU'LL GET GOOD AT IT, TOO.
HERE. WHY DON'T YOU GIVE IT A TRY?
( gurgling )
YES.
...WITH THE BUTTON-DOWN...
THE UGLY SHOES...
HEY!
HEY, DR. CARTER. DID YOU NEED ME?
YEAH. COME ON IN.
CRACKING THE WHIP ON YOU, 'TWAN.
ALL RIGHT, THEN. WE OUT.
THOSE FRIENDS OF YOURS FROM SCHOOL?
FRIENDS FROM THE NEIGHBORHOOD.
YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THE TIE.
IT'S NOT NECESSARY.
OH, MY MOM SAID TO WEAR IT.
HAVE YOU EVER HAD A JOB BEFORE, ANTOINE?
NO.
I REALIZE THAT THIS ISN'T A JOB
BUT THERE'S SOME THINGS I FEEL LIKE I OUGHT TO TELL YOU
NOT TO GIVE YOU A HARD TIME, BUT...
YOU'RE A BRIGHT PERSON-- THESE ARE THINGS
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO LEARN ANYWAY.
IT MIGHT AS WELL BE NOW.
ALL RIGHT? ALL RIGHT.
WITH ANY JOB THAT YOU HAVE IN THE FUTURE...
THINGS ARE GOING TO BE EXPECTED OF YOU
AND THAT MEANS YOU CAN'T GO HANGING OUT
WITH YOUR BUDDIES.
I HAD A REASON FOR DOING THAT...
I DON'T WANT REASONS.
I'M NOT GIVING YOU A HARD TIME.
I'M JUST LETTING YOU KNOW
WHAT I EXPECT OF YOU, ALL RIGHT?
YES, SIR.
ALL RIGHT.
Greene: WHAT'S NEXT?
SPECIFICITY.
NO... UH...
I GOT SENSITIVITY. IT'S A LITTLE CRUMPLED.
I'LL TAKE IT.
METHODOLOGIES?
NO.
FALSE NEGATIVE RATES?
BINGO.
OKAY... OUTCOMES?
UH... IT'S GOT A FOOTPRINT ON IT
BUT IT LOOKS KIND OF INTERESTING.
OH, IT'S... NOT VERY SEXY.
IT'S JUST MATTER ANALYSIS.
I THOUGHT IT MIGHT HELP ME
BAG THE TRAUMA FELLOWSHIP.
YEAH, CAN'T HURT.
IT'D BE BETTER IF I HAD IT PUBLISHED.
LOOK, I'M REALLY SORRY ABOUT THAT CHEST WOUND TODAY.
WHY ARE YOU SORRY? YOU DID A GREAT JOB.
YEAH, THE TRAUMA ROOM SHOULDN'T BE A BATTLEGROUND FOR SURGEONS.
OH, YOU MEAN PETER.
YEP.
WELL, THAT MUST BE TOUGH.
WHAT?
COMPETING WITH YOUR BOYFRIEND.
NOT BOYFRIEND. JUST COMPETING.
I THOUGHT YOU TWO WERE...
HISTORY.
I GOT TO GET BETTER SOURCES.
THIS IS US.
DO YOU THINK THEY'LL STILL LET ME SPEAK?
TEN MINUTES-- THAT'S NOTHING.
YEAH, I WAS SUPPOSED TO GO FIRST.
YEAH, WELL, YOU WERE BUSY SAVING SOMEONE IN THE E.R.
FOUR HOURS AGO?
WORK WITH ME HERE.
SO WHY AREN'T WE STOPPING?
I GUESS IT DOESN'T STOP HERE ON WEEKENDS.
DON'T WORRY, WE CAN GET OFF AT THE NEXT STOP.
DOES THAT FEEL BETTER?
MUCH.
YOU SHOULD BE TAKING CARE OF PEOPLE...
NOT WORKING UP FRONT
CHECKING PULSES AND DOING PAPERWORK.
HEY, JEANIE, I'M SORRY IT TOOK SO LONG.
I GOT HELD UP IN THE O.R.
HEY, REVEREND LYNN, HOW'RE YOU DOING?
I CAN'T COMPLAIN.
MISS BOULET HAS BEEN TAKING GOOD CARE OF ME.
YOU TWO KNOW EACH OTHER?
SINCE PETER
WAS A LITTLE BOY WITH STRAIGHT "A's."
I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU AROUND LATELY.
YEAH, WELL, YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN PRETTY BUSY HERE
AND TAKING CARE OF REESE.
MY MOTHER USED TO ATTEND REVEREND LYNN'S CHURCH.
ARE YOU THE JEANIE THAT WORKED WITH MRS. BENTON?
I AM.
SHE SPOKE OF YOU.
JUST BEFORE SHE PASSED, SHE TOLD ME
YOU WERE HER ANGEL...
THAT YOU BROUGHT HER COMFORT.
YEAH...
I'LL NEVER FORGET HOW MUCH YOU MEANT TO MY MOTHER.
YOU SEE?
I TOLD YOU WE DIDN'T MEET BY ACCIDENT.
SO DR. BENTON AND I
ARE BOTH IN YOUR DEBT.
I'D LIKE TO OFFER SOME HEALING PRAYERS.
I NEED ALL THE HELP I CAN GET.
( chuckles )
YOU MEAN RIGHT NOW?
WHILE THE SPIRIT IS MOVING.
( laughs )
AMEN.
THAT WASN'T SO BAD.
NO.
UH... CONFERENCE ROOM C.
WHICH WAY?
I DON'T KNOW.
BUT YOU'VE BEEN HERE BEFORE? YEAH, BUT I
DON'T KNOW THE ROOMS.
UH, CONFERENCE ROOMS-- RIGHT.
Man: "...BUT I'M SERIOUS.
I'M GOING TO MARRY THIS GIRL."
SORRY.
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.
EXCUSE ME, COULD YOU TELL US WHERE THE TRAUMA
PHYSICIANS CONFERENCE IS?
DID YOU CHECK THE DIRECTORY?
YEAH, CONFERENCE ROOM C
BUT THERE'S A WEDDING IN THERE.
THAT'S BALLROOM C. CONFERENCE ROOM C IS ON THE LOWER LEVEL.
OF COURSE. WHERE'S THE ELEVATOR?
THROUGH THE BAR.
MAKES SENSE. THANK YOU.
WANT A DRINK?
SURE. WE GOT TIME.
OH, LOOK, A GIANT PIG ICE SCULPTURE.
( laughing )
Corday: OH!
SORRY.
( laughing )
SHE'S HAD A LITTLE TOO MUCH TO DRINK.
SO, ARE YOU HERE FOR THE CONFERENCE?
( stifled laughter )
THIS IS TAKING TOO LONG.
YEAH, LET'S TAKE THE STAIRS.
OH, GOOD IDEA.
Corday: YOU'RE TERRIBLE.
ME. YOU'RE THE ONE WHO RAN INTO THEM. HURRY UP.
I'M IN HEELS.
YEAH, WELL, TAKE THEM OFF, WOMAN.
"WOMAN"? DID YOU CALL ME "WOMAN"?
( laughing ): WHO, ME?
YEAH, I'LL LET IT SLIDE SEEING AS YOU RUSHED TO MY RESCUE.
YEAH, WELL, I HAVEN'T SAVED YOU YET.
WELL, AT LEAST WE CAN MAKE AN APPEARANCE.
IT'S A DEAD END.
UH-OH.
HA-HA-HA, VERY FUNNY.
NO, REALLY, IT'S LOCKED.
YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME.
( chuckling )
I THINK SOMEBODY DIDN'T WANT US TO MAKE THIS CONFERENCE.
Antoine: DR. CARTER?
MM-HMM?
UM, COULD I SEE YOU OVER HERE FOR A MINUTE, PLEASE?
THIS IS SHARICE HAINES AND THIS IS HER SON ANDRE.
I THINK HE MIGHT HAVE LEAD POISONING.
COULD YOU TAKE A LOOK?
SURE.
HOW YOU DOING?
HI.
HE'S BEEN FEELING SICK.
I DON'T KNOW WHY.
I SENT SOME OF MY FRIENDS
TO GO BRING ANDRE AND HIS MOTHER IN.
YEAH, I CAN EXAMINE HIM RIGHT NOW.
AND DO THOSE BLOOD TESTS, RIGHT?
WELL, IF THAT'S WHAT'S CALLED FOR.
FIRST THING IS TO TAKE A HISTORY
AND DO A PHYSICAL EXAM.
MAY I SEE YOUR SON?
YEAH.
LET ME ASK YOU A FEW QUESTIONS.
DR. CARTER...
I KNOW IT'S PAST 4:00
BUT CAN I HANG AROUND AND SEE HOW THIS GOES?
ABSOLUTELY.
THANK YOU.
DOES IT HURT WHEN I DO THAT, ANDRE...
WHEN I PRESS ON HERE?
SETH IS BEING DRASTICALLY OVERMEDICATED.
HE'S BEEN SENT FROM FOSTER HOME TO FOSTER HOME.
EACH TIME, HE GETS PUT ON A NEW MED
WITHOUT REGARD TO THE OLD ONES.
LOOKS LIKE YOU FOUND OUT JUST IN TIME.
THE CREDIT REALLY GOES TO MY STUDENT.
LUCY TALKED TO THE BOY AND THE FOSTER MOM.
FOUND THE PROBLEM RIGHT AWAY.
GOOD FOR YOU, MISS KNIGHT.
NOW WE CAN PUT SETH ON THE PROPER MEDICATION.
ACTUALLY, DR. DERAAD, I THINK HE COULD BENEFIT
FROM PSYCHOTHERAPY AS WELL.
ALL SETH REALLY NEEDS IS
SOMEONE TO LISTEN TO HIM AND TO CARE.
I'M GLAD TO HEAR YOU SAY THAT.
MOST STUDENTS THINK IT'S JUST ABOUT PUSHING MEDS.
THEY DON'T TAKE TIME TO DO THERAPY.
A LOT OF RESIDENTS ARE LIKE THAT, TOO.
ISN'T THAT RIGHT, DR. MYERS?
Myers: I SUPPOSE SO.
YOU MIGHT LEARN SOMETHING FROM YOUR STUDENT.
I WAS WONDERING IF I COULD CONTINUE COUNSELING THIS KID.
YOUR PSYCH ROTATION'S ALMOST OVER.
AND THEN I START
MY SECOND E.R. ROTATION
BUT I'D STILL LIKE TO SEE SETH IF I COULD.
I'LL SUPERVISE YOU MYSELF.
I THINK THIS WOULD BE
A GREAT CASE FOR YOU, MISS KNIGHT.
WELL?
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
YOU KNOW, WE CAN LOOK INTO TRANSPLANTS
TALK TO SOME EXPERTS...
THEY'RE FINE.
WHAT?
MY LIVER FUNCTION TESTS ARE ALMOST NORMAL.
I GUESS THE MEDICATION MUST BE WORKING.
YEAH, I'LL SAY.
MAYBE I STRESSED MYSELF OUT; MADE MYSELF SICK.
YEAH. UH...
I GUESS YOU CAN'T UNDERESTIMATE
THE POWER OF PRAYER, HUH?
( chuckles )
( chuckles )
OKAY, WE NEED YOU TO TAKE EVERYTHING OFF, PUT ON THE GOWN
AND THE RADIOLOGIST WILL BE IN
IN JUST A MINUTE, OKAY?
WE HAVE A STRUGGLING NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE.
YOU HAVE TO WAIT AGES FOR NON-EMERGENCIES, BUT I BELIEVE IN IT.
NO, I MEANT FOR THE SURGEONS.
I MEAN, YOU SEEM SO DESPERATE TO STAY.
( laughing )
AM I THAT TRANSPARENT?
WELL, NOT DESPERATE.
WELL, I LIKE IT HERE.
IT SUITS ME.
YOU DON'T GET HOMESICK?
A LITTLE.
I DO GET LONELY SOMETIMES.
I COMPLAIN ABOUT WORK
BUT IT'S MY MOST LOYAL COMPANION, REALLY.
IT'S HARD TO GET USED TO IT, YOU KNOW, BEING ALONE...
BUT, UH...
I, UH...
( chuckles )
AFTER A WHILE, YOU EXPECT IT
AND THEN YOU START TO APPRECIATE IT.
YOU REALLY BELIEVE THAT?
I'M FULL OF CRAP.
( laughing )
( door opening )
YOU TWO LOCKED IN?
YES. OH. YES!
( sighs )
STILL WANT THAT DRINK?
YOU GOT IT.
WELL, I SEE YOU HAVEN'T LEARNED YOUR LESSON.
IT'S A CHARACTER FLAW.
I'M A STUBBORN OLD MULE.
( laughing )
I HEAR YOU.
SO, YOU'RE HERE.
IT'S A START.
IS THERE A HEARTBEAT?
YOU SAID YOU'VE HAD SOME CRAMPING?
A LITTLE, AND EARLIER TODAY, SOME SPOTTING.
THERE WE GO.
RIGHT THERE-- STRONG, STEADY HEARTBEAT.
ARE YOU SURE?
NO DOUBT ABOUT IT.
( relieved sigh )
THANK GOD.
NOT 100-PERCENT GUARANTEE
THAT EVERYTHING'LL BE OKAY
BUT IT'S A GOOD SIGN.
Corday: BUBONIC PLAGUE?
Greene: I WAS NINE YEARS OLD.
THE COUNSELOR TOLD US NOT TO FEED THE SQUIRRELS
'CAUSE WE MIGHT CATCH BUBONIC PLAGUE.
COULD YOU?
I DON'T KNOW, BUT TIMMY FED THE SQUIRRELS.
( laughing )
SO JIMMY HAD TO BE LOCKED IN THE CABIN.
TIMMY... NOT JIMMY.
I SAID, "TIMMY."
IT SOUNDED LIKE, "JIMMY."
( laughing )
( tango playing )
OH, LISTEN.
( laughing )
WHAT?
IT'S WEIRD.
WHAT'S WEIRD?
THEY'RE PLAYING A TANGO.
YOU KNOW THE TANGO?
WANT TO CRASH A WEDDING?
YOU KNOW HOW TO DO THIS?
IT'S A TRADITIONAL AMERICAN WEDDING DANCE.
'CAUSE I'M NOT SURE.
JUST FOLLOW MY LEAD.
( tango music playing )
( Corday laughs )
