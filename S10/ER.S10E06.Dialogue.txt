Previously on ER:
( groans )
Sam Taggart. New Nurse.
I started my surgical rotation today.
I'm back in med school.
So, no more nursing?
No, I'm still going to be taking
a few shifts for a while. I need the money.
What are you nut-meats doing?
Clearing Triage.
We'll provide good care, and we're going to do it faster.
You're going to form a line down the hall,
and you'll be examined three at a time.
It's your new hospital? Yep.
It's even crappier than the last one.
I'm a 71-year-old man who's going blind.
I've considered everything.
Promise me you're not going to kill yourself
in the next 72 hours.
But, but Monday would be okay?
I'm off the hook by then.
LEWIS: "The friend had, in a weak hour,
"spoken with sobs of his own death.
"He had delivered a melancholy oration
"previous to his funeral,
"and had doubtless in the packet of letters,
"presented various keepsakes to relatives.
"But he had not died,
"and thus he had delivered himself
into the hands of the youth."
( grinding )
Oh, sorry.
Are you taking your enalapril?
Uh, yeah.
Do you want me to bump up your Lasix?
Coffee does the same thing.
It also raises your blood pressure.
Well, as luck would have it, you gave me a pill for that too.
You want... you want more espresso?
Not unless I'm going to fly to work.
"The latter felt immensely superior to his friend,
but he inclined toward condescension."
You don't... you don't have to keep doing this.
Well, I've got time to finish the chapter.
I've never read this before. It's good.
You, you don't have to keep... keep coming here.
I don't have this book.
Keep it. I'm...
I'm never going to read it again.
That's why I'm here. That and the coffee.
He died at 29.
Stephen Crane.
TB.
Just a little trivia.
Nice. Very cheery.
"He adopted toward him
"an air of patronizing good humor.
His self-pride was now entirely restored."
I like this place already.
I don't think they're going to be giving away
free donuts every day.
Why not? Bars give away free peanuts.
Only so you'll get thirsty and buy more beer.
They gave away donuts, people would buy more coffee.
Please! Can you help me?
I think I'm having a miscarriage.
How many weeks? 24.
First pregnancy?
First one to last this long.
Oh, she's adorable.
Yeah, I found six of them behind my apartment.
She's the last one.
They don't allow pets in my building.
They're not allowed in here either.
Hey, buddy, you want a donut?
Frank!
What? Dogs love donuts.
Want a pooch? Free to a good home.
Dogs irritate my asthma.
Hi, I'm Terra King from Ladokern.
I have gifts and some snacks for the residents.
Is there someplace I can set up?
Lester, Lester, can you take care of this, please?
What's wrong with him?
C'mon. Punch it, cat daddy.
What are you guys watching?
Carjacking.
Pratt...
He needs to get on Lower Wacker to lose the chopper.
This is Denny. She's having vaginal bleeding at 24 weeks.
Can you take her?
Sure, sure, let's go.
You cheering for the carjacker to get away?
No, no, we just want him to get a few more blocks.
Once he's south of Van Buren
he'll be out of our catchment and goes to Mercy.
If there's a crash....
There's always a crash.
Turn left. Get on the expressway...
Yes, yes, go, go! Oh, oh! Go, go!
Ooh... Damn it.
I realize you have friends downstairs.
You mustn't let them take advantage of you.
Well, the patient was borderline.
Which is precisely my point.
He needs to stay in the ER under observation.
If his condition worsens, I'll go back down.
You know as well as I do they're only too happy
to free up beds by dumping patients onto surgery.
Dr. Corday, they need you in post-op
and the ER is calling for a gallstone panck consult.
All right, you go down there.
Make your assessment and call me.
Be strong.
Collies fracture.
Put on a sugar tong splint and have him come back
in two days for casting after the swelling goes down.
Vicodin for pain.
What about a wrist film?
It's not deformed. Distal neuro-circ intact.
We'll get an x-ray when we cast.
Malik, get six units of O-neg down here
before the car crash starts rolling in.
I already ordered eight.
Tell me about the gallbladder.
Um, fat and 40 with a history of gallstones.
I gave her a shot of Toradol.
She's afebrile. Abdomen is non-tender.
Good. Send her home.
No ultrasound?
No. No labs, no IV, no x-rays.
Tell her to stick to a low-fat diet.
How'd you do this?
I was using a utility knife to open up a box.
Be more careful. Keep it clean and dry.
Come back in two days for a wound check.
What's this?
A 24-year-old female with bladder infection,
positive for leuks, icon is negative.
I ordered Bactrim and Pyridium.
Good. Tell her to pee after she has sex.
It's a good way to prevent UTIs.
Coop, your subconjunctival hemorrhage
probably happened from sneezing
and it will get better in a week.
Reassure your patient that he won't go blind
and get him out of here.
( applause )
Five patients in two minutes.
That's got to be some kind of record.
Just make sure you're not skimping.
Skimping? Yeah, on the billing.
Check off a few more boxes next time.
I'm not billing for treatment we didn't provide.
It's called capitalism, Kovac. It pays your salary.
Okay, there's the heartbeat.
Amniotic fluid index is good.
Excellent fetal movement.
He's good?
Yeah, but you're dilated three centimeters.
I've already had two miscarriages.
I was supposed to start bed rest next week.
I can't go through this again.
I'm going to give you some medicine
to prevent you from going into labor.
Junior needs a few more weeks before he's done.
Start with .25 of terbutaline sub-Q
and give four grams of mag.
Here, magnesium might make you a little queasy.
I'll be back in a few minutes to check on you, okay?
Hey, Jerry, what's the ETA on our car crash?
Two minutes and counting.
Dr. Pratt, can I present a patient?
Oh, you better make it fast.
23-year-old woman with sudden onset occipital headache,
grade 8 out of 10.
Worst headache of her life?
Close, but not quite.
Thunderclap onset?
More like two minutes. No history of migraine.
Neuro exam is non-focal.
Okay, okay, get a head CT,
and rule out subarachnoid hemorrhage,
and get ten of MS for the pain.
Thanks.
Kevin Dunn, 32-year-old driver, high-speed MVA
with prolonged extraction.
The jacker or the victim?
Jacker. The victim's right behind us.
Lap belt. Front-end impact. BP: 104/84, pulse 106.
Creamed the next guy real good.
Yeah, I know. We were watching.
Should have turned left on Stanton, Sparky.
I would have got away if that jerk didn't cut me off.
( screaming )
Oh, looks like a big flail segment
and a closed clavicle fracture.
Let's put him in Trauma Two.
Driver numero dos.
Thomas Collins-- aka innocent victim.
High-speed restrained impact with head injury.
Turn him. Turn him. Turn him.
Let's go. Come on. Come on.
I put Mrs. Walters in Exam Two.
She needs a little TLC, maybe some Zoloft.
That makes two of us. Look at them.
They're like kids in a candy store.
One hospital I worked at tried to ban the drug reps,
but the residents all complained
because they like all the free food.
Yeah, that's how they get you hooked:
free food, free equipment...
Oh, don't forget the boobs.
I imagine they have to pay for those.
Keep Kovac away from her.
He's been known to give away free physicals.
Okay, Ernie, where were we?
I got worms.
What the hell is this?
Uh, looks like a hospital bill.
Accounting's on the fifth floor.
No, I was already there. They wouldn't help me.
Well, I can't either. This is the ER.
All right, Ernie, those are maggots.
When was the last time you changed this bandage?
Look, look, I was already there, okay?
I sat in here for 11 hours
with my sick kid
to have some quack
tell me it was a virus and he'd get better on his own.
Did he?
They didn't do anything for him
and I get a bill for over two grand?
I want to see the doctor who stiffed me.
Carter. I want to see this Carter guy.
He doesn't work here anymore.
( yells ) All right, Ernie.
Here's what we're going to do.
Fix you up with a nurse,
maybe have something to eat,
and a bath.
But your friends there-- they gotta go.
I want this fixed!
I wouldn't do that, sir.
Are you going to do something about this bill?
Are you going to get off your ass and do something?!
No...
But he is.
Dr. Kovac!
Zack Isley, six-foot fall onto gravel,
no LOC, GCS 15.
Superficial lacs and abrasions on head
and right upper extremity.
Complaining of right shoulder pain.
Hey, Zack. I'm Dr. Kovac.
What happened?
Nothing really. Just goofing around, took a header.
Can you straighten your arm?
Ah... Okay, Curtain Two.
I just sprained it.
Why don't you let me decide that.
We'll get you an x-ray.
Clean those cuts and scrapes.
Might even need some stitches.
Really?
Ah, don't worry. We'll numb you up.
You won't even feel it.
No, ah, no medicine. I can take it.
Tough guy, huh?
Trauma panel, a clot, lateral C-spine,
chest x-ray and AP pelvis.
Poor guy's driving down the street,
minding his own business, then bam!
Wakes up two days later in the ICU.
If he wakes up.
Can't see the pupils-- too much blood.
Laps and saline for Abby. Chest is clear.
BP is 140/94, pulse 72. IV is blown.
How are we doing in here?
Well, he's going to need to be tubed.
But we got it covered. Thanks.
Abby, can you start an IV?
Nurses start IVs.
Surgical students do cut-downs.
Spank 'em, Abby. That's the way.
Somebody get me a central line kit?
Yeah, I'll send one back.
On the monitor, BP: 106/80,
tachy at 111.
They need a triple lurnen kit next door.
I can't see into his oral airway.
No blood in the nares or around the mouth. You're good.
SonoSite for Dr. Cooper.
Pain meds on the fly, but let's complete the survey.
He's decreased on the left. Size six sterile gloves, please.
BP's 104/86. Sats 92.
All right, kids, you're on. Show Dr. Chen what you know.
Free fluid in the abdomen and pericolic gutter.
Try there.
You could use a little more jelly on your belly.
You're the attending.
NEELA: And in Morrison's pouch.
Meaning?
Intra-abdominal injury
secondary to high-speed mechanism.
He'll need the OR.
Start the chest tube. I'll be right back.
Don't be a stranger.
The guy next door needs a surgeon.
I'll call Corday.
Mommy, Mommy, come save me.
I'll decide if he needs surgery.
He's only responding to pain.
Urine output's good. Okay, laryngoscope.
Ah, no, Surgi-Girl, go next door.
Start the workup.
Yeah, I was going to intubate.
Next time. Now, go, go, shoo.
Get me a staple gun.
I'll start putting this guy back together.
I can feel the inside of the chest wall.
Surgery is here. Hello, surgery.
( alarm beeping ) Abby, can you turn that damn thing off?
Yeah.
Okay, leave the guide finger in
with the other hand.
Slide the tube through.
Got it. Got it.
Sats are up. 98%.
Thanks. Nice job.
Okay, Abby, give me the bullet.
I, I was trying to fix the monitor.
Oh, you're a med student, a nurse, and a technician now.
What's next, cowgirl?
Yo, Abby. I'm pushing the drugs.
You want this or not? Yes.
I told you to evaluate this patient.
I can do it.
I don't care who does it, as long as it gets done.
Neela, go with Dr. Pratt.
You can come back and sew these in when you're done.
Well?
No fracture or dislocation.
You probably just strained the ligaments a bit.
Told you.
Maybe you should be a doctor.
Yeah, not with my grades.
I wasn't a great student at your age.
I almost failed lunch. Ow! Ow!
Sorry.
Kovac, this guy's here for your patient.
Ron Kennedy, I'm a social worker from Stanton House.
We're a foster care facility. Zack's one of our residents.
You mean prisoners. Relax.
I'm his case worker.
Zack hopped a fence
while we were on an outing and ran off.
I escaped, you Nazi.
Listen, you'll have to call my mom.
I'm not going back there.
Zack has a conduct disorder. Screw you!
Hey, could you give us a moment, please?
I think he's off his meds.
Back off, man! Hey, stop it, Zack.
He needs Haldol.
And you need to go back to the waiting room, okay?
Get the hell out of here!
Get back in bed, Zack.
He needs to be sedated!
Out!
Hey!
I'm not going back there.
Please, don't let them take me back.
Please....
Third crit is down to 29. Done.
All right, let's roll.
Call Corday, and tell her
I'm sending her up a gift basket.
That looks good, but if it comes out,
you owe Dr. Chen and me a beer.
I'm more of a cosmo girl.
The drink or the magazine? A little of both.
Did neurosurgery agree?
Yeah, diffuse axonal injury.
No operative lesion.
They'll sign off after the second apnea test.
He's brain-dead? Yes.
Bad guy gets patched up.
His victim ends up a vegetable.
Well, we haven't saved this guy yet.
You can change that head dressing, Abby.
Okay. Which OR is he going to?
That's not your business. Call UNOS.
Your butt's down here until the coordinator arrives.
Aah! Ow!
You wouldn't feel it
if you let me use just a little analgesic gel.
For six months I've been on Tegretol, lithium,
Risperdal, clonidine, Benadryl and Klonopin, okay?
I've been so doped up I didn't know what day it was.
Have you been cheeking your meds?
Had to. Today's the first day I felt normal in months.
That why you ran away?
I got tired of being a freaking zombie.
Did you call my parents?
Your mother's on her way.
You're not going to let them take me back, are you?
We'll talk about it
when your mom gets here, okay?
Hey, Pratt?
Huh?
This scan's negative.
Yeah. I'm still waiting
on a neurology consult
to evaluate a possible subarachnoid.
Do an LP.
No. They'll be here any minute.
You're wasting time and resources.
What's his problem?
You mean besides being tackled
in the waiting room?
Possible new onset angina.
I've ordered nitro,
CBC, chem panel, serial... troponins
and a chest x-ray.
And I'm still waiting on cards.
EKG's normal?
Yeah.
You smoke?
No.
Hypertension?
High cholesterol, diabetes?
No. I'm healthy.
I run about 12 miles a week.
Okay, let me guess.
The pain started after your incident
in the waiting room.
Yeah.
It's an anxiety attack.
Over this stupid hospital bill?
Probably.
Let me see it.
What was the complaint?
My kid came in with a fever.
Your son didn't need that.
Certainly didn't need a chem panel
and two sets of blood cultures.
You should have only been charged for, what-- $300.
Thanks.
Hey, Slavko.
What the hell do you think this is--
some Zagreb Yugo dealership?
On the rare occasion
when we do get a patient with insurance,
we don't give them deals.
I expect that kind of idiocy from Pratt, not from you.
I thought I was his favorite.
Hi. I'm Terra King.
Have you heard of Quinamax?
It's our new once-a-day antibiotic
with excellent coverage for bronchitis
and otitis media.
Neither of which needs treatment with antibiotics.
Now, it has great gram-positive coverage,
making it ideal for cellulitis.
LEWIS: I have a patient
coming in at 3:00 to check a didge level--
Ben Hollander.
When he shows up, just let him in
and come find me, okay?
Sure thing.
Hey, what's up?
I've got a 27-year-old G3P-zero,
history of cervical incompetence,
EGA 24 weeks.
Presented in early labor,
cervical dilation progressed from three to six
on terb and mag.
Any fetal distress?
No. It looks good.
Heart rates in the 160s, good variability.
Can you repeat the terb?
No. We maxed out, and she's tachy.
Send her up to labor and delivery, and tell them
to have a pedes resuscitation team standing by.
If she's progressing on tocolytics,
there's nothing we can do.
She's revealing both her upper
and lower teeth when she laughs.
What?
Chen. It's a sign of flirting.
There. Hair touching--
that's another one.
You better get in there, sport,
before it's too late.
What are you talking about?
I was a cop 25 years.
You learn body language.
Look at that.
She's mirroring his motion.
20 bucks says she touches him next.
( laughing )
So what? She slapped him.
First it's a slap, then it's a tickle.
Before you know it, she'll be spanking his ass.
Hey, Jerry, can you call up to L&D and tell them
to make sure that they have my...?
I need to find a fire hydrant.
Hey, that's a cute puppy. Can I hold it?
You can have it.
43-year-old man with left flank pain
radiating to the groin.
Denies fever, vomiting.
Exams notable for CVA tenderness on the left.
Urine heme-positive.
Okay. Diagnosis?
Kidney stones.
What else?
CBC, chem panel, and CT urogram.
Okay. And give 30 of ketorolac IV push.
No.
No CBC, no chem panel, and no CT.
You don't even need a damn IV.
It's expensive and it takes up nursing time.
Give him 60 of ketorolac IM
and a bedside ultrasound to rule out hydronephrosis.
But you won't see where the stone is.
Look, hospital policy says...
90% of cases
pass on their own.
He's afebrile, and his UA is negative.
And if it's too big to pass?
It'll cause hydronephrosis, and he'll come back.
He still thinks he's in the Congo.
Get the CT.
You need to take him up.
That's not how it works.
I come down, I see, I present.
Yeah, I know how it works.
And I'm telling you as a surgeon and head of the ER,
you need to take this guy up to your service.
What do you need me to do, write you a damn note?
"Dear Dr. Corday, please admit Abby's patient to your service.
"He's very sick today and requires an exp lap
before he gets septic and dies."
You hanging in there?
By a thread.
Dr. Lewis, can you help me?
Sure. Which patient?
Actually, it's about the doctors.
I'm getting conflicting advice from Pratt and Kovac.
Welcome to County.
Kovac is the attending. Pratt isn't.
Abby,
this is Patricia Collins.
Her husband was involved in the car chase.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Hi. Abby Lockhart. Hi.
I'm Neela. Hi.
I worked on your husband.
Would you like to see him?
Yes.
I'll take Mrs. Collins in
while you're waiting for the UNOS team.
This way, please.
I'm beginning to hate her.
She's a med student.
I'm a med student.
You know, now that you mention it,
she's pissing me off, too.
Come on. Let's hate her together.
Now, the medicine I gave you hasn't stopped you
from going into labor.
Your contractions are increasing in frequency,
and your cervix is continuing to dilate.
My husband had to go to Seattle for work.
He didn't want to go,
but I said, "Don't worry. I'll be fine."
I can't believe I'm having another miscarriage.
No. You're not miscarrying, Denny.
You're going to have this baby.
I'm sending you up to obstetrics.
They're set up to handle a preemie delivery.
I don't want a preemie.
Our NICU cares for babies like this all the time.
Yeah, babies with brain damage.
My sister-in-law had a preemie.
It was sick for months.
They spent every day in the NICU, and it still died.
This baby has a chance.
I don't want it this way!
Okay.
Okay.
Problem?
She doesn't want to have the baby.
She's 24 weeks.
What's the weight?
520 grams on the ultrasound.
24 weeks, over 500 grams--
that's the hospital's viability threshold.
So what? We're going to spend
half a million dollars
keeping one baby alive
while we shut down the lead
eradication program?
I've admitted three kids for chelation this week.
Why stamp out lead poisoning
when you can shoot your wad on one little gorker
who can enjoy a lifetime of special ed?
Good thinking, Pratt.
What am I supposed to do?
Mom doesn't want to do anything to save this baby.
She doesn't have any rights.
It's not up to Mom.
If it's over 500 grams,
pedes is going to resuscitate.
Aren't you on a surgical rotation?
Yup. Then rotate.
What's this kid's chance of having a normal life?
10%? Less?
It's hospital policy, Luka.
Then maybe she needs to change the hospital.
Another good idea.
Let's send her
to Santa Nina Muerta Hospital.
It's called natural selection, Pratt.
You ever heard of it?
It's worked for a few million years.
So, tell me, what should I do now?
Hospital policy exists for a reason.
First learn the rules, then learn when to break them.
What's in her best interest?
The laceration is superficial,
and his shoulder is only bruised,
but, uh, I do have some concerns
about the medication he's on.
Zack's had some problems.
Had.
I'm fine now.
I think he may be overmedicated.
Well, they told me that was for his own good.
I had a drug problem.
I let him run wild.
And then he was always doing this crazy stuff.
He got into fights.
It's called self-defense.
He stole a car.
One time.
I'm not doing that anymore.
They blamed it on me.
They said I was an unfit mother.
Do you have custody?
Not at the moment.
Has Ben Hollander shown up yet?
Not that I've seen.
Can you look at a possible scaphoid fracture in Exam Three?
Uh, yeah. Hold on a second.
Mrs. Collins refused to donate her husband's organs.
I've heard minority families seldom agree
to organ donation anyway.
Well, what, did you just let her leave?
I thought she could sit with the body
until he went up to the ICU.
I'm looking for Dr. Pratt.
Greg!
There he is.
It's 2003. Who doesn't have an answering machine?
He promised me. We had a therapeutic contract.
Look, I'm sure he's just running late.
Maybe he stopped to get a coffee or...
Jump off a bridge?
Hi. Are you from neonatology?
Yeah. Vargas. Where's your patient?
Her name is Den...
Hey, Lily, where's Denny?
I haven't seen her.
Well, can you check the women's bathrooms
for me, please?
Sure. Just give me one second, all right?
I'll find her.
She left.
Who?
My pregnant patient.
Did you talk to her?
No.
Well, she took your advice.
She eloped. That was always her prerogative.
( banging on window )
I need a doctor out here!
That doesn't mean
it was the best thing for her to do.
Hey, you're supposed to be teaching me here.
I'm trying, but you're not listening.
Some lady is in the back of my cab,
and I think she's bleeding to death.
Denny, what happened?
I tried to make it to Saint Joe's,
but the baby's coming.
Is she dying?
No. Run inside and tell them
I need a gurney and a BOA kit. Go!
This was in her best interest?
She wouldn't have left if you'd done what she asked.
KOVAC: Type and cross Mom
for four units, two large-bore IVs
and a liter of LR running now.
It's too soon.
All right, Denny, one big push.
( grunts )
Come on. Cord clamp.
It's a boy.
His eyelids are still fused.
Placenta's delivered.
( alarm beeping )
Bleeding's picking up.
Heart rate's in the 130s.
Yeah, uterine atony from the tocolytics.
Run in another liter of LR and 20 of pit.
Do we have a pulse?
Yeah. It's slow, under 100.
Should I start compressions?
Bag him up first.
No. You need to weigh him first
before you do anything else.
Less than 500 grams, we stop.
All right, draw up some epi and get ready with the tube.
KOVAC: Do not tube that baby
until you get a weight.
DENNY: No, please.
506.
( sighs )
Pratt, she doesn't want this.
I'm following hospital rules.
That doesn't make it right.
This kid is alive.
Systolic's down to 78.
.2 milligrams of Methergine IM
and rush the blood bank.
Oh, all right, I'm in.
Bag him and give two cc's of surfactant through the tube.
You got it.
Mrs. Collins, can I get you anything,
or anyone I can call?
Tom's sister is coming.
She wanted to say good-bye.
( pager beeps )
Sorry.
PRATT: Umbilical line kit
and a sterile 6 is for Neela.
She's gonna place the UVC.
KOVAC: We shouldn't be doing this, Pratt.
She has the right to demand a natural death.
We have a Family Room,
if you'd like to wait for your sister-in-law in there.
It's a little more quiet.
I want to stay with him as long as I can.
Okay.
What's happening?
They're trying to save a premature baby.
We just started trying to have kids.
Mrs. Collins, did Neela talk to you
about recovering your husband's organs?
I told her I didn't want that.
He's been through enough.
Why? Does he have something
that could help the mom or her baby?
I don't know.
Maybe.
But there are lots of others who would benefit.
Tom was always going out of his way
to do stuff for other people...
to the point where they would take advantage of him, but he didn't care.
I would always tell him,
"Don't you know nice guys finish last?"
He would always say,
"Guys who finish last are nice."
He was so stupid.
What would they do... if he was a donor?
The recovery team would take him to the ICU,
and they run tests and they start matching his organs
to people who need them.
Like his kidneys?
Mm-hmm.
Several organs can be recovered.
He could help as many as 50 different people.
Tom would like that.
What all would they take?
Well, his kidneys,
which would go to two people with end-stage renal disease,
and that would free them from a lifetime of dialysis...
Ben Hollander, Susan Lewis.
No, I'm the doctor. He's my patient.
County General.
Okay, then I'll talk to the watch commander.
My mom around?
She's in a trauma.
You want to wait in the Doctor's lounge?
Nah.
You get any freaks in here today?
You know, guys with elephant man disease
and axes stuck in their heads?
No.
Should you be looking at that?
I'm going to become a doctor.
Dollars to donuts that kid
is already dissecting the neighborhood pets.
Every time you put me on hold,
you're increasing the chance he's in trouble.
Sure. Hey.
You want to see a puppy?
Why?
I don't know. Because she's cute?
Where's the morgue?
Your mom says we aren't allowed to let you go to the morgue.
I'll give you five bucks.
Does that kid ever give you the creeps?
He's right at the age where it starts.
Teen rebellion?
Devil worship. Keep an eye on that puppy.
You were supposed to be here hours ago.
Oh, I'm-I'm sorry.
Oh, these, uh, these are... these are for you.
Sort of a peace offering
to make up, you know, for my...
my-my tardiness.
You didn't have to do that.
Well, there's a guy outside,
you know, selling them on the street,
so it's, you know, it's no big deal.
Oh, and I...
I brought you, uh...
I brought you this.
We're not finished reading it.
Well, I, you know, I know how it ends.
Lily, can you set Ben up for a blood draw?
Sure. This way, sir.
That patient brought you flowers?
And a book. He's a real Civil War buff.
I've been reading it to him.
He's losing his eyesight.
What? You're going to his house?
Yeah. The guy was a possible OD on didge a couple weeks ago.
I'm still not sure it wasn't attempted suicide.
I just want to make sure he's re-engaged
before I cut him loose.
This is a first edition.
Sounds like he's engaged with you.
He has no one. He's going blind.
He sacrificed everything for his career and now he has nothing.
No one should end up like that.
Where the hell is OB?
Paged them three times.
Denny, stay with us here.
EBL 1500cc's.
I'm hitting resistance.
When it bounces back like that, you're in the liver.
Start over and thread it again.
Get him upstairs, Pratt.
Kovac, I need to talk to you.
I'm kinda busy here.
What's the holdup with that kid from Stanton House?
His caseworker is threatening legal action.
Still waiting on a Tegretol level to come back.
No you're not. It's back.
He can't go back there, Kerry.
Their treatment program is basically keeping him so drugged
that he can't think straight.
BP's up to 98/55.
Good. He's a nice kid.
And you know him better than the psychiatrist
who's been treating him for two years?
She's got too many patients to treat properly.
She also has privileges in this hospital
and she's on her way to administer Haldol
because the ER physician apparently refused.
Everybody's so concerned about the rules and policy
that they're forgetting there is a kid caught in the middle of all this.
Reform the foster care system on your own time.
Neela, come with me.
Discharge this patient.
Damn it, Kerry!
Take the baby. Pratt, I need you here.
Somebody call for OB?
Now, that was fast. Fill her in, Pratt.
Mom just delivered a 24-weeker
now with severe atony, EBL 1500cc's.
What's happening?
You're doing good.
It looks worse than it is.
The tube in his mouth helps him breathe.
The catheters in his umbilical cord
give him fluid, nutrition and medication.
But underneath it all, he looks good for a 24-weeker.
Really...
Where's Zack?
Zack? Zack?
What did she give him?
Four milligrams Haldol IM.
Just to tide him over till his PO meds kick in.
I'm sorry.
You never let me finish telling you about Quinamax.
Now, it's our new once-a-day antibiotic
with excellent coverage for bronchitis and otitis media.
Now, I could put together some packages for you to take to the Congo.
I've heard that's a pet project of yours.
Quinamax would be wonderful
for all the important work you're doing over there.
You want me to take your overpriced antibiotic to Africa?
It has great coverage for pneumococcus and H. flu.
Why hasn't there been a new drug for malaria in three decades?
That's a really good question.
Because there's no profit in treating poor people.
My company...
Your company spends twice as much in marketing
as it does in development,
which is why prescription drug costs have tripled
in the last ten years.
Get out of here. I want you out of here.
You know, if this is a bad time...
Frank, I'm going to go get some coffee.
Page me if you need me.
Okay, Dr. Kovac, if you could...
You know, I'll just come back
when you're not so busy.
Everything looks good.
Don't sound so surprised.
Ben, I really appreciate the gesture,
but I can't accept this.
Well, you said you liked it.
I do, but that book is worth a lot of money.
No, no, my first edition Brontes are worth a lot of money.
I just think it's... inappropriate.
I didn't mean to hurt your feelings.
No, you didn't.
It's just that
you've done a lot for me,
and you know, I just wanted
to show my appreciation.
I certainly never meant to make you feel uncomfortable.
No, no, you didn't make me feel uncomf...
It's no big deal.
I can help you get a ride home
if you can wait a while.
You know, I'll grab a cab.
Okay, same time next week for another level.
Thank you for the flowers.
I feel officially lousy.
So, is it "Jing-My" or "Jing-May"?
I'm getting conflicting information.
Call me Deb.
Okay. What are you doing after this, Deb?
You want to grab a beer, shoot a little pool?
I can't.
I'm taking my parents to the airport.
We can go out after we drop them off.
You'll drive my mother and father to the airport?
Sure. It'll be good for some embarrassing childhood stories.
No, not my parents.
They're a little distant, bordering on xenophobic.
My dad has six toes. Just on one foot.
Has anyone seen Alex?
Yeah, he was hanging around here earlier.
Could you find him for me, please?
You should use your fireball.
This your first time playing?
Nope.
You want me to show you how to do the dragon punch?
Nope.
He's going to kill you with his psychocrusher move.
Told you.
I'm thirsty.
That's a good sign.
Can she have some ice chips?
Let's hold off for a little while.
You lost a lot of blood in your delivery.
We had to give you a transfusion,
but the bleeding's stopped now.
You're going to be fine.
And we're taking your baby up to the NICU.
Good.
He's doing better.
Just take him away.
Denny, just... Please.
Has Abby shown up yet?
OR Four.
Doing what?
I was paging you.
I was with this patient.
So I hear.
( sighing )
You convinced the family to donate his organs?
Spending this much time with a patient
is a luxury we don't usually have.
You missed out on an interesting volvulus repair.
Well, I just felt like his wife needed me.
You already do this well, Abby.
Sometimes being a doctor
is about distancing yourself from your patient.
You don't have to stay.
I'd like to stick around if that's okay.
( door closes )
( sighing )
What the hell is this?
A Labrador retriever.
Wrong answer.
Some sort of spaniel-- a terrier?
Who brought it into the hospital?
Was it Pratt?
I'm sorry, Dr. Romano.
I did. She belongs to me.
This isn't a petting zoo.
She's not a pet.
She's a seeing-eye dog, aren't you?
Oh, how could you hate a face this cute?
All right, come on. Let's go home. Bye.
So, where is my son?
Did you tell him where the morgue is?
I couldn't find him.
He's across the street in the new Jumbo Mart.
Got you now.
That's cheating.
I thought you were good at this game.
SAM: What the hell are you doing?
My shift ended an hour ago. Why?
I'm not talking to you.
You cannot just wander off
without telling me where you're going.
Did you eat all this?
Where did you get the money?
He bought it for me.
Do you know what time it is?
Did you take your shot? No?
Look at him.
He's hyperglycemic and ketotic.
Did you not notice anything strange about his behavior?
He's diabetic.
God, I can smell it from here.
I thought he was a street kid.
I didn't know he was your patient.
He's my son.
Hi. Sorry to bother you.
A-Are you stalking me?
I've got his first x-ray.
His heart and lungs look good.
He's fighting.
I told you.
Look, Denny, maybe you should get off your feet for...
I'm just want to stay here a little while.
He shouldn't have to die alone.
Was this a bad idea?
Oh, no, no, I love, I love dogs.
I-I grew up with dogs.
My parents had a cattle farm outside of Gary.
So, you were a farm boy?
I still would be if my mother hadn't insisted
on my going to college.
What about your parents?
Want to hold her? Oh, yeah.
My mom is a secretary.
Was a secretary.
She wanted me to be a flight attendant.
Really?
Yeah, that wasn't happening.
She, uh, died a few years ago.
Oh, I'm, I'm sorry.
What about your father?
He's still in Chicago.
He's a test pilot for Barcalounger.
He must be pretty proud of you.
You're, uh, you're not close?
Not really.
That's a shame.
Yeah.
It, uh, it happens.
I have a daughter named, named Karen.
Yeah?
Yeah, I haven't...
I haven't talked to her in years.
You should try to reconnect.
No, it's not, not going to happen.
You should call her.
No, she, uh, she blames me for things
when... when my wife died.
I didn't see that coming, either.
Your wife died suddenly?
No, no, not really.
She, she had cancer.
She fought it for a long time,
but we both knew she wasn't... she wasn't going to beat it.
Still, I just, I never expected it
to end that way, you know.
I just had trouble... I had a hard time
accepting the... finality of it, of it all.
Yeah.
340.
I didn't know he had diabetes.
He's a kid. You're an adult.
You're supposed to be a doctor.
You didn't notice he was acting weird?
Lots of kids his age are weird.
What are you doing playing video games
with a nine-year-old, anyway?
You gave him ice cream, candy... What's up with that?
Can I discharge Mrs. Fionelli?
Find another attending. I'm off.
Oh, all right.
Her pelvic sonogram results came back.
She's got an ovarian cyst,
so I was just going to put her on a non-steroidal.
She had an abdominal CT scan?
We were thinking diverticulitis.
Flip over your chart.
What?
On the back of your chart,
there's a price list of all tests and labs.
You ordered a CBC-- that's what?
$140.
A chem panel and UA?
$350 and $90.
What else?
GC and chlamydia cultures-- $300.
IV start and a liter of saline-- at least $200.
Morphine's another $50.
Abdomen and pelvic CT, $3,000 easy.
Did I miss anything?
Pelvic ultrasound-- $750.
$4,880.
You could have done a negative urine ICON
to rule out ectopic for 15 bucks,
performed a thorough physical exam
and treated her with a $2 dose of ibuprofen.
And this is why we can't provide
health care for everyone.
Hey, where's Logan?
Rule out subarachnoid?
She was in Curtain Two.
Dr. Kovac discharged her.
Oh, Neurology finally came down?
Nope. I did an LP about four hours ago.
You did what?
She'd been waiting all day.
Her fluid was clear--
no blood, no xanthochromia, no subarachnoid.
A spinal tap is the quickest
and easiest way to rule out an SAH,
and it's 100% sensitive.
She was my patient.
Yes,
and if I hadn't treated her, she'd still be here.
Now she's at home and feeling better.
Oh, so, that's it?
This is how I'm supposed to learn?
Either I do it your way,
or you take it away from me?
Pratt, I'm trying to teach you
that the way you practice medicine here is inefficient.
Oh, and letting babies die is?
You really think you saved that kid today?
For what--
24-hour nursing care?
He's going to probably require
a lifetime of commitment.
Are you going to be around to give it to him?
Listen, I'm sorry I'm not in some mud hut
doing amputations with a pocketknife.
We have the technology and the expertise
to give that kid a chance.
What's the sense of having it if we don't use it?
That kid has about a five percent chance
of having a normal life.
Do you have any idea how many other kids
we could have treated with those resources?
I do everything that I can for my patients.
That's how I practice medicine.
This is Chicago, not the damn Congo.
Maybe you should just go back to Africa.
Maybe you should go to Africa.
I know you didn't just say that to me.
Maybe then you'd learn there's more to being a doctor
than ordering tests and calling consults
for every patient just to cover your ass.
Stay away from my patients.
From now on I'll present to another attending.
You can just take big bites, you know.
The mortician will do what he can.
I need the practice.
All right, well, take your time.
He's not going anywhere.
PATRICIA: What all will they take?
LOCKHART: His kidneys,
which would go to two people with end-stage renal disease,
and that would free them from a lifetime of dialysis.
His heart and lungs could go to as many as three people
with cardiac and pulmonary disease.
His pancreas and intestines would go
to children as well as adults.
His corneas
would allow two people to see again.
His skin, bones and other tissue
will help treat burn victims.
And his liver will be split into multiple transplants
and used for children with birth defects that used to be fatal.
