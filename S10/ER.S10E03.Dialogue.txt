Previously, on ER:
My car's just up the street.
You want a ride? Dr. Romano, you're back.
Yeah, try to hide
your wild enthusiasm at my return.
I find overt displays of emotion embarrassing.
Do you even think about me?
Yes. Okay, what did you think?
Ah.
Where am I going? Home!
Give this to Abby when you see her.
ABBY: On any given day
this emergency department will treat 300 patients.
Another 40 will leave without ever being seen.
In order to not get buried,
you have to maintain adequate patient flow.
This all starts with the nurses.
Treat them with respect,
they'll get you through your shift.
Treat them as your own personal scut slaves,
you'll be lucky to get out of here alive.
Triage is our first line of defense.
Patients are signed in and vitalled
by whoever's working the cage. The cage?
Yeah, like a shark cage.
You can see them out there circling around,
but they can't get at you.
When's Kovac getting here?
His flight was supposed to land at 7:30.
What about Carter?
Can you rack this?
Triage nurse starts the chart, which is racked at Admit.
TAKATA: You need to put your name in for the lottery.
Okay, once the patients are brought back,
their name is put on the board,
along with time, location, and chief complaint.
Dr. Pratt is also a second-year resident.
Pratt, this is three of our new R2s.
Sofun, Morris, Cooper.
Welcome to the zoo.
What can I give a ten-year-old
with painful road rash? Acetaminophen's easy on the stomach,
but ibuprofen's better for inflammation.
Med students work up the patients
and present them to the residents.
You can mentor them, but ultimately every case
has to be looked at by an attending.
MAN: I know my rights!
This is assault and battery!
I'm coming back for you, bitch.
Yeah, yeah, bring me a latte when you do.
Dr. Lewis is one of our attendings.
We usually we have two working.
They have to sign off on every case.
Uh, don't remind me. Second-year residents?
Cooper, Sofun, Morris.
Grab a chart.
Abby, can you set up
the airway box in Exam Three so the med students
can practice assembling laryngoscopes?
Mm-hmm.
Nursing orders go there.
Clerk orders go here.
These are two of our clerks, Jerry and Frank.
Please don't feed them.
And when you're done, the discharge rack is over here.
Any questions?
Yeah, why is the board see-through?
So we can see through it.
Remind me not to get sick anytime soon.
The ambulance pick Luka up yet?
Yeah, about an hour ago.
They should be here any minute.
Is he going to need a bed down here?
No, no, they've got one for him upstairs.
Have you seen the new schedule?
I'm only working four shifts in two weeks.
I only got three. How many do I have?
Two? We're starting a petition.
We've got more beds, but fewer nurses.
And now Romano's cutting senior nurse hours
so he can bring in cheaper travelers.
You're the charge nurse. You need to talk to him.
You lost the triage lottery, Abby.
You've got the cage from 9:00 till 1:00.
Oh, come on, no way!
I lose every time!
That's like statistically impossible.
Abby! What?
Hey, I need you to help me with a GI bleeder.
Okay, two minutes. Just let me say hi to Luka.
( metal crashing )
Sir! You have to stay in bed.
Here, lie down. Lie down.
I need sedation orders over here.
I think Mrs. Dunn's in labor.
She's only 36 weeks.
Explain Braxton Hicks contractions to her.
Her water broke.
Did you nitrazine it?
No, I was just helping her to the bathroom.
Uh, okay, well, page OB and, and call an attending.
( screams )
Hi. Okay, breathe. Don't push.
It's too early.
No, 36 weeks is what we start calling "normal term."
All right, try and relax. I'm going to do a quick exam.
I need a fetal monitor and an IV.
Okay. I got it.
Oh, Lewis needs that in Curtain One.
Thank you.
Can you show me
how to set up the slit lamp?
Yup, just one second.
Luka!
Hey, hey, I think this old lady stopped breathing.
Dr. Romano, hi. How are you today?
I'm busy.
How's the stump feeling?
It's, uh, suffering from delusions of grandeur.
It still thinks it's an arm.
What's that?
Your new prosthesis.
Okay...
I'm sorry. I just assumed as a prosthetist,
that you would have some
rudimentary knowledge of medicine.
I have a degree in bioengineering.
Oh, okay, well, then you have a vague,
civilian concept of what doctors do.
See, I'm what's called a surgeon.
That's why I was very specific about needing a Utah Arm.
Your hospital insurance won't cover
a myoelectric device.
I lost my arm on the roof of this damn hospital
trying to save a patient's life.
The insurance company requires proof
that you can't get by with a traditional
body-powered device.
What am I supposed to do?
Am I supposed to just duct-tape a, a, a...
coat hanger
to my stump?
I can prepare another letter to the insurance company.
I've got two letters for you and the insurance company:
F and U.
It's hurting my arm.
Just a little bit longer.
Why can't I just have my prescription
filled without being tortured?
( pounding on glass )
How much longer? My back is killing me.
I'll let you know.
I don't want to miss my turn.
Then you should sit down.
Okay...
put this in your mouth.
Be a good girl, Ilanna. Open your mouth.
I think it was a black widow.
WOMAN: Darren, don't touch that.
Hey, ooh, hey, hey...
Darren, stop it.
( knocking ): Is it almost my time?
No.
Tell her.
Tell the nurse what you ate, Lisa.
Well, go on! Tell her!
Maybe you should tell me, Mrs. Brandenburg.
I brought my own urine sample to save time.
Could I at least get
a sandwich?
How did you get back here? Security!
Hey, wake up!
She's getting worse.
Do you have asthma, Elle?
No.
Anybody sick at home? Any fevers? No.
Okay, deep breaths.
( coughing )
How long have you had that cough?
Since we went camping.
Uh... a few weeks, maybe.
She lets herself get run down
and she doesn't eat enough.
( alarm beeping )
What's that?
Um, the oxygen level in your blood
is a little bit low,
which can happen with infection.
Frank, what's open?
Curtain One.
Okay, I'm taking this one back.
Come on, Elle.
Going to put you in a bed,
get you some oxygen,
and that should make you feel better.
Oh, Dr. Lewis.
This is Mrs. Ryser and her daughter, Elle--
shortness of breath, sats are 86, bibasilar rales.
Uh, yeah, can you grab a resident?
I think an attending should take a look at her.
Hi, I'm Dr. Lewis. Come on this way.
The rest of her vitals okay?
Tachy at 116. BP's 98/52.
A&O times three.
What are rales?
It's the sound fluid makes when it's in your lungs.
That doesn't sound good.
It's probably just pneumonia.
Great. She never dresses warm enough
and she's always going out with wet hair.
Mom, please...
All right, let's get a chest.
I'll be back to do a full exam, okay?
Thanks.
Are you coming back?
Yeah. Don't worry.
The only thing you can catch from wet hair
is split ends.
Yeah, send her for a chest and draw a CBC.
How's Luka?
I haven't had a chance to get upstairs.
Well, uh, if you do go upstairs,
let me know and maybe I can come.
Okay.
Have you talked to him? Luka?
No, Romano. We gave him the petition.
You better do something quick
or you're going to have a mutiny on your hands.
As soon as I can, I will, I promise.
Frank, where'd they send Kovac?
5 West. He looks good.
You saw him?
Just popped my head in to welcome him back.
Wouldn't hurt you to do the same thing.
Hi, could I get an update on a patient, please? Kovac.
K-O-V-A-C.
Right, malaria.
He's still spiking
on quinine, but lucid between fevers.
And he's asking for a meatball sub.
Either he's delirious or hungry.
Never mind.
Hi. Hi.
I'm Gillian.
Abby. Oh, you're Abby?
John talked a lot about you.
John...
Carter?
Yeah.
I'm sorry. Who did you say you were?
I'm sorry. You don't know.
I'm Gillian. I was working with Luka and John in the Congo.
Ah.
Oh, I have something for you.
Um, John asked Luka to give you this.
He wrote me a letter?
Now there's a lost art.
Uh, well, it's hard to find a phone
and when you do, they seldom work.
Uh, where do I find Dr. Magoo's?
You don't. It burned down.
Thank you. You're welcome.
Nance, I'm taking my break.
Am I interrupting?
Your assistant wasn't at his desk.
We're in the middle of a meeting.
Oh, well, that would explain
why you haven't returned any of my pages.
Hi, I'm Dr. Romano... ( crashing )
Ah, geez.
I'm sorry. Let me get that.
Ow! Okay. Stop.
You know what?
I'm just not very good at using this thing.
You know, maybe if the hospital's worker's comp
had covered a myoelectric arm,
it would be better. Robert...
You know, what do I have to do? Pay for the damn thing myself?
Hey, that'd make a good news story, don't you think?
Amputee surgeon has to pay for his own arm
to work in the hospital where he lost it.
This is not the place or the time to discuss this.
You know, you're right. I've got a lot
of patients to see in the ER,
and, you know, that's where using this hook
really gets kind of dicey.
Well, wish me luck.
Hopefully I won't take someone's eye out with this thing.
We're staging a walkout.
We're all meeting at Dunkin' Donuts
to come up with a plan. What?
If we don't take a stand now,
they're going to replace us all
with part-time nurses so they don't have
to pay benefits.
Yeah, they're welcome to replace me.
Is anybody working here today?
Talk to Dr. Romano.
I will.
You know, a joker just fainted
in the waiting area.
Took a header into an end table.
There's blood everywhere.
Abby?
Why are you telling me this?
Well, according to my watch, your break is over.
That's right.
Leave me to pick up after you.
Hey, wait. Hold up, hold up.
( panting )
Sorry.
I just ran down from CT.
You're Pratt, right?
Nick Cooper, second- year resident.
My friends call me Coop.
Hey, listen, who do I get for an unstable
mandible fracture-- plastics or head and neck?
Call them both and take whoever comes first.
What do I tell the other one?
Tell 'em the patient eloped.
They'll be happy
'cause it's one less consult for their team.
Cool.
Hey, listen, man, you new guys got to start picking it up.
It's only 10:30 and we're already 20 patients behind.
Well, I got six.
Yeah, but the other two are draggin' their asses.
Morris has an LOL with abdominal pain
and altered mental status.
It's a big workup. It's possible LP.
Sofun's still getting the lay of the land.
They're killing me.
Hey, man, don't worry about it.
Look, we'll blast through these.
Let me see what you got.
Epistaxis and vertigo.
Nasal pack for the nosebleed, Meclizine for the vertigo.
They're out the door in 20.
( speaking softly in Punjabi )
How's it going?
Oh. Ah... rather deep.
I used a 4-0 Vicryl subq.
Nice.
What was that that you were just saying?
Nothing.
I heard you talking to him.
It was a prayer.
He's not dying.
It wasn't for him.
It's a private prayer.
Oh, something like, uh...
"Please, Lord, don't let me kill somebody today?"
Somewhere along those lines?
( chuckles )
Neela, I need you to run down to medical records
and get Mr. Perkins' old chart.
If you can't find that,
Cardiology should have his last EKG on file on the fifth floor.
He's got anemia and renal insufficiency
so print out his BUN, creatinine
and CBC trends for the last two years.
Okay.
Hey, there.
Don't forget--
dinner tonight, 8:00.
Oh, they have a dress code, so wear something nice.
How nice?
I'm wearing my little black dress.
( chuckling )
I think I'm in.
You think?
No, no. I'm in.
Hey.
How come I wasn't invited to this party?
Hook up the thoraseal.
Okay, I got it.
Okay, what's next?
Um...
You want 0-silk?
Yes. 0-silk.
MALIK: Girl in two's X rays.
You better check it out.
Not good.
Who is it?
LEWIS: Tachypneic girl in two.
Huge heart.
Call Cards.
She's in failure.
I can't stop drooling.
I'm out.
A nurse will be with you in one minute.
Hey, what about that sandwich?
What about it?
Where's Amanda?
She's supposed to relieve me at 1:00.
Your nursing brethren are all over at Dunkin Donuts
plotting some kind of a coup.
Hey, did you sign this?
No. Smart girl.
Should have.
I want everyone on this petition in the lounge in five minutes.
They staged a walkout.
No, they did not.
They're on a break.
For over an hour?
Well, page them.
Anyone who's not back in five minutes is fired.
You can't fire nurses.
I can if they walk off the job.
I'll go get them.
Hey, you got a hook. Suits you.
Shut up.
Nobody's called my name yet.
They will.
Would it help if I gave a stool sample, too?
No, just...
Yeah.
Are you a nurse?
Check-in's at tria...
What happened to you?
Somebody shot me.
Okay, all right.
Okay, sit down, sit down.
I need a gurney!
What's your name? What's your name?
Bobby.
Okay, Bobby. Okay.
Don't let me die.
I won't. I won't. I won't.
Okay.
Who shot you?
I don't know.
He got dumped by a homeboy ambulance.
You're going to have to hold still, Bobby.
We need to tube him.
Well, get that line in and I will.
Uh-oh.
Bobby? Bobby?
Bobby, open your eyes.
No radial pulse.
Got a carotid, but it's weak.
Get him on the monitor.
Get that blood up, and page surgery.
20 of Etomidate, 120 of sux. Suction.
BP: 64 systolic, pulse is 60.
Saline and a Mig of atropine.
Penetrating trauma with impending arrest.
You gotta crack him.
No, not yet. Tube. Come on.
I'm prepping the chest.
All right, I'm in the hole.
Bag him up, Abby.
( alarm beeping )
Where's Lewis?
Abby, crash cart, now!
Sorry, I had a hot MI.
What are you doing, Pratt?
Talk to Abby. I'm just trying to put in a chest tube.
He was talking to me and now he's about to arrest.
Good breath sounds, airway secure, hypotensive.
Okay, run the code, Pratt.
What are you going to do, crack him by yourself?
Get Corday and order some more 0-neg.
Okay, Lisa, can you, uh, follow my finger, please?
Lisa, can you follow my finger?
( whispers ): Don't stare.
Excuse me.
Morris?
Uh, work the kid up in Curtain Two.
Pressure's only 60 systolic.
Vasculature is collapsed.
Cut-down tray.
Femoral cut down.
Who are they?
Med students.
That makes three of epi.
Good breath sounds with bagging.
Hook up a cell saver.
How much 0-neg?
Four units.
He's only got a faint carotid.
Come on, man. Stay with me.
Another two units of blood.
Let's follow his chest tube output.
PRATT: Here he goes again.
Hey, I have an idea.
How about a thoracotomy?
Wow, that is just so crazy, Abby, it might work.
There's only 300cc's out the chest.
( alarm beeps )
V-fib.
Charge to 200. Look out!
Prep for a thoracotomy.
He's already prepped.
Ten blade, now.
First incision is in the fourth intercostal space
from the lateral sternum
to the posterior axillary line.
Clear.
Hey, what's Carter mean by "unfettered"?
Well, it means...
It means she's been dumped.
You get rid of those nurses?
Yeah, they, uh...
they went up to Nursing Administration
saying something about hiring a hit man.
Hell hath no fury like an RN scorned.
Whose patient is this?!
She's mine.
Well, get her back in bed
and use restraints if you have to.
It's okay. She's harmless.
Hey, can you sign off on a wound infection?
No. Go away and take her with you.
No, seriously. She's cool.
I'm Nick Cooper, by the way. Uh, Coop.
I'm a new resident.
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't realize who you were.
Do me a favor would you, Coop?
Air Rescue's bringing in a bad MVA.
Will you go up on the roof and wave in the chopper?
And make sure you stand
in the middle of the landing pad, so they see you.
You're Rocket Romano.
You were a surgeon-- used to be Chief of Staff.
I still am a surgeon.
Yeah? You got scalpel attachments
for that bad boy?
I'm right-handed.
Lucky.
So, this guy's ten days out of...
Let's get a few things straight, all right, nutmeat?
One: we don't offer remedial medicine here.
Two: You don't talk to me. I talk to you.
Should I be writing this down?
Stay out of my face!
CORDAY: 30 again.
Clear.
LOCKHART: Fine v-fib.
LEWIS: More like coarse asystole.
Resuming compressions.
Units five and six are up.
How long's it been?
35 minutes.
We should be able to shock him into sinus.
Hold CPR.
There's nothing to shock.
High dose epi. Might coarsen his rhythm.
He's been down too long.
He's young and healthy.
With fatal wounds.
His hilum and aorta are cross-clamped.
We've replaced his volume
and maxed out on atropine and epi.
He walked in here.
He was talking to me.
That's it.
Time of death: 13:36.
Abby, can you try and locate the family?
I was coming down the ladder
and I stepped on the cord to my sander.
I only fell about three feet,
but I twisted my ankle pretty good
and my collarbone's killing me.
Well, let's take a look.
Okay.
I heard about your run-in with Dr. Romano.
Someone should have warned you.
He's quite a character.
That's one word for him.
( groans )
What were you sanding?
The hull of a boat.
Fiberglass?
Yeah.
( coughing )
Are you all right?
Hey, Coop, you ready to present some cases?
His asthma's acting up.
All right, give him an albuterol treatment.
Then come find me.
We have to clear this board.
( coughing violently )
So, what's the story?
Call respiratory to set up nitric oxide,
give her more Lasix
and start an isoproteronol drip.
What?
She has primary pulmonary hypertension.
You're kidding.
Can you even diagnose PPHN from an echo?
If you know what to look for.
We'll cath her in the lab to be a hundred percent.
Tough break. Seemed like a nice kid.
Yeah.
( sighs )
Hennessy in Exam Three needs a foley and an IV.
CBC and chem panel on Gininni in Curtain Four
and scalp lac kid in the Suture Room needs a setup.
What, am I the only nurse working today?
Close-- Romano fired six.
Oh, so that leaves four of us for 35 patients.
Looks like you dodged a bullet.
Hey, I'm sorry about the thoracotomy on that kid.
Didn't seem to make a difference.
Maybe if we'd done it sooner.
You reach the parents?
No.
Oh.
Hey, you know, for what it's worth--
I think it's Carter's loss.
What?
Do you know where my parents are?
They went to talk to the doctor.
They said they'd only be a few minutes,
but that was a while ago.
Uh, why don't you hop back into bed
and I'll find them for you, okay?
Okay.
MORRIS: I think he's getting even tighter.
( faintly ): Epi.
RASGOTRA: Try not to talk.
Slow, deep breaths.
( faintly ): Epi. Epi.
Sub-Q epinephrine?
Uh... point three.
His nebulizer's dry.
Okay, we'll try five of albuterol this time.
Push it.
Little stick here, Coop.
Too much. Too much.
We gave you point three.
You said push it all.
You gave one milligram?
That's over three times the dose.
I'll get an attending.
No, no, no. He can handle it.
( alarm beeps )
V-tach.
Crash cart.
What the hell happened?
Too much epi.
Has he got a pulse? Can you hear me, Coop?
Charge to 300. No, no, no, no!
It's stable v-tach.
He only needs 50.
Do you want some Valium first?
This could be a little uncomfortable.
Just do it.
Charged to 50 for synch cardioversion.
Clear.
( yells ): Ah, jeez!
V-tach.
Let's try 100.
Valium. Charged.
Valium.
Clear.
( yells )
( panting )
Okay.
Congratulations.
You just saved your first resident.
You can't just sit here.
The union steward said to stay the entire shift.
But we're getting slammed.
I mean, we'll work it all out tomorrow.
I'm sorry, Abby.
But think about how you're going to feel
ten years from now
when they start replacing you
with minimum-wage grads right out of nursing school.
MALIK: Abby,
Lewis is yelling for you.
Are you nurses?
No. No.
How come you're still working?
I'm an LVN. They don't get no cheaper than me.
Pratt needs a chaperone for a pelvic in Three.
Okay, if you could cath the little boy in Four.
Done deal.
You still with us?
Okay, I also have a guy in Two that needs something.
I can't read it.
What's that say, "nipple lips"?
Oh, all right.
I got a resident who needs a holding help
for a spinal tap on the dirty, old man in Exam Three.
He died.
For real?
Real dead.
Do you think there's any chance
you could cover for me for, like, five minutes
so I could run upstairs?
I got to deal with the whole nursing situation.
I haven't had a chance to see Luka yet.
You're joking. I haven't stopped for six hours.
I had to use a patient's urinal, Abby.
And that Carter letter. Look, I'm sorry.
I know that was pretty harsh.
Okay. How did you hear about this letter?
Jerry.
Jerry.
Excuse me,
Dr. Romano,
if we don't get some help down here,
the patients are going to start dying.
We pulled the registry.
Someone from the service should be here
within a couple of hours.
Uh, Edna's down from Geriatrics.
Edna?
Hey, excuse me, excuse me. Hi.
There is a drunk in Exam Four
that needs two more of Ativan.
I'm sorry, dear. He's a putz.
Who, the drunk?
That Carter boy.
Huh! It's too bad you didn't dump him first!
You've gotta be kidding me.
The big man, he let me read the letter. Ha-ha!
Oh, Abby, the guy in Three
needs another bolus and an emesis basin.
And you call the lab and ask why it's taking over two hours
to get a set of electrolytes.
Malik can do some of this.
Hey!
Okay, did you hear about my letter?
What letter? Good.
Oh, yeah, I need a phenytoin level on my seizure guy,
and your girl in Exam Two needs 20 of Lasix, IV.
Oh, Elle.
I told her I was going to find her parents.
How's she doing?
Well, she has primary pulmonary hypertension.
Won't live to see her 21st birthday.
Other than that, she's fine.
Are you sure?
98%. They won't be certain until after the cath on Monday.
And her parents don't want her to know
until after the tests.
They're not going to tell her for three days?
I know, it's awkward.
It's not awkward, it's stupid.
I mean, she already senses something's wrong.
She deserves to know the truth.
Well, after the cath, she'll know,
and then it'll all be downhill from there.
Just stay out of it. It's the parents' decision.
Excuse me.
Hi, I'm sorry.
We got turned around.
We were supposed to be going to the children's ward
to visit a classmate.
Okay, uh, go back to the elevator.
Go up to the third floor, take a left...
You know what? I'll show you.
Thanks.
Are you a nurse?
Yes, I am a nurse.
Who here wants to be a nurse?
Hey, you know boys can be nurses, too.
I want to be a doctor.
CHILDREN: Me, too! Me, too!
Robert!
Well, to what do we owe this royal visit?
Do you have any idea who that was
in my office this morning?
Well, let me see, do I care? No.
That was totally inappropriate.
Oh, yeah? I'll tell you
what's inappropriate, Kerry. ( crutch clunks on floor )
This hospital boning me with a prosthesis
that has a limited functional field.
I'll develop peripheral neuropathy, overuse syndrome...
Did you fire six nurses today?
Yes, as a matter of fact
it was the only good part of my day.
How'd you like me to fire you?
Well, I've got a, uh, handicap, remember?
Yes. Somehow I don't think that'd be an issue.
Uh, you guys have an audience.
You fire anyone else, even a candy striper,
and you're going with them.
Consider this an official reprimand.
You are one grade "A" bitch!
You know that, Kerry?
You know, Robert, I'm your boss,
and as long as I am,
you're my bitch.
Now get your ass back to work.
Fecal impaction in Four
needs some good old-fashioned finger-digging.
Enjoy.
Jerry!
Can you show them how to get to the Pedes playroom?
Yep.
Thank you.
What is that?
Uh, this is human blood.
( screaming )
Hi, Elle.
Feeling any better?
Yeah.
I can finally take a deep breath.
That's good.
They had a heart doctor come see me.
Mm-hmm.
Why?
I thought it was my lungs, not my heart.
Well, your heart...
Your heart and your lungs are connected,
so it only makes sense that, um,
cardiology would come and take a look at you.
I'm sure Dr. Lewis was just being thorough.
So, was it okay?
My heart?
My parents were acting a little weird.
Well... all parents are a little weird, right?
I'm sure they just want you to get better.
I'm going to go find Dr. Lewis
and see if she's heard anything, okay?
( sighs )
Uh, hey.
Hey.
Um, these are my parents.
Mom? Dad? This is Greg.
PRATT: Hey, how you doing?
Nice to meet you.
Um, they were downtown shopping.
Really?
And, um, now they want to join us for dinner.
I hope you don't mind.
Come on.
( chuckles )
It's-it's okay. How you doing?
Nice to see you.
Sit down.
Thank you.
( sighs )
Much better. The medicine's working.
Dr. Lewis, I heard there was a PPHN in here.
Cardiology said I should listen for a tricuspid regurge murmur.
A what? Is that what I have?
There's something wrong with my heart?
This is not a good teaching case, Neela.
Come with me.
ELLE: No, I-I want her to stay.
I want to know
what's wrong with me.
Okay, I'll be right back, all right?
I've never seen a PPHN before.
She's not a PPHN.
She's a girl who's about to find out
she's going to die a slow, horrible death.
She hasn't been told yet?
There are extenuating circumstances
which you don't know about... Excuse me.
What are you doing?
He-he wasn't eating it.
That doesn't mean you get to.
What's his story?
Um...
Forest Herman.
Just snoozing off pain meds for lower back pain.
Mr. Herman, I'm Do...
Mr. Herman?
Tell me he's sleeping.
Not unless he's taking a dirt nap.
Wait, I feel a pulse.
It's weak. Get a crash cart!
Bag him. What'd you give him?
Just Demerol for back pain.
Somebody page Corday.
( sighs )
Okay, wh-what did I do? What did I miss?
While you were stealing his tuna fish,
he was bleeding out from a triple-A.
He's drifting down. You want more blood?
Yep. Hang it.
This man needs vascular right now.
If we can get his pressure up,
they can do an endovascular procedure.
He probably won't survive an open wound.
I've paged them. They were unimpressed.
Right. Let's page Dr. Dorset again.
Tell him Dr. Corday needs him. Badly.
I tried to get you a room with a fireplace by the pool,
but the guys from Coldplay rented out the whole top floor
for a party.
I can walk.
I know, but, uh, hospital policy says
I have to do the driving.
Where are your parents?
They disappear every half hour.
My mom pretends they're making phone calls for work,
but when they come back, I can tell she's been crying.
So, either the stock market crashed...
or there's something really wrong with me,
and no one's willing to talk about it.
( ragged breathing )
So, what, am I dying?
Do I have cancer or something?
Okay, Elle, the doctors still have some more tests to do,
but so far...
Abby, I need to talk to you.
We're on our way upstairs.
Oh, okay. Hey, Malik,
can you wheel Elle to, uh, Three South?
Yeah.
I need, uh, help with the code.
This is wrong.
You know it.
We're teaching her not to trust us
exactly at the time she should be trusting us the most.
Abby, what is wrong with you today?
You practically start a thoracotomy on your own,
and now you're talking to my patients
when I asked you not to.
Well, somebody should.
It's not your call.
You're not her doctor; you're her nurse,
so when I ask you not to do something, don't do it.
Mind if I watch?
You should be at home in bed.
ABBY: Unit 6 type specific is up.
Pressure's down to 80/40.
Shouldn't we start pressors?
You really do want to kill this guy.
He's not stable.
He was, but your service refused to come down.
Those bastards hate to leave the hot tub.
You... grab some Betadine,
scrub this guy like a sweet potato.
Uh... ectopy.
Kick that tray over here.
You sure you don't want to do this upstairs?
Love to. You didn't leave enough gas in him to get me there.
MORRIS: Scrubbed.
Nicely done. Maybe you can detail
my Jag after work.
Ten blade. Drape this area
here and here.
Suction to Lewis.
Can we try a little more teaching,
a little less stand-up?
Are you serious? My name's on the chart.
Well, it's like we say upstairs:
"What happens in the ER stays in the ER."
Gee, thanks.
ABBY: His BP's still 50.
Cover your eyes, kids.
This is going to be some bad-ass juju.
Midline transperitoneal incision.
There. Pull down a bit, Dr. Corday.
You know, it really is like music
when we work together.
Uh-oh.
You boys remember the Law of Laplace?
Stress on the arterial wall
is pressure times radius, divided by wall thickness?
You two have just been nurse-slapped.
You know what it means?
It means this man's about to die.
Anyone can rip a man's heart out...
but fixing it without looking--
that's why I get
the big money and all the hot chicks.
Right-angled retractor.
CORDAY: Is this where I get to make a joke
about this man bleeding to death?
Only if you're qualified.
Oh, I've got the supraceliac aorta in my hand,
which means we have proximal control.
Don't try this at home.
Or anywhere near this hospital.
You need a clamp?
No, I think it's best if I pull
a Dutch boy and keep my finger in it. Let's roll.
( panting )
MORRIS: How wicked was that?
Guy's got balls the size of my head.
( grunts ): Oops.
I want the blue one.
Well, hey, you know what?
A medical student was crushed to death
working on this computer last year.
I can believe it.
You save any lives today?
Nope.
She saved one.
Hey, I'm Nick Cooper.
My friends call me Coop.
Michael Gallant. Good to meet you.
So, did I miss anything good?
Uh, yeah. Dr. Kovac is back.
He's upstairs. He's doing better.
Abby got a "Dear John" letter from Carter.
And she gave it to you?
Not exactly.
What's it say?
NEELA: I imagine it's private.
Yeah, you're probably right. What's it say?
( clears throat ): "Dear Abby..."
Has anybody not read this letter?
I haven't.
What, you pulled this out of the trash?
I...
You guys are pathetic.
You're not the only one who got a letter today.
We all got 90-day suspensions.
I hate my job!
Don't worry, dear. It'll get better.
LIN: I hope you don't mind, Greg,
but we went ahead and ordered some things
that's not on the menu.
Oh, no, this is okay. It looks good.
Sorry.
LIN: So, Greg,
what do you parents do?
Um, well, my mom passed away when I was 12,
and my father and I never kept in touch.
Well, that's unfortunate.
Family is such a valuable part of one's life.
It's important to have roots.
LIN: Jing-Mei is going to China with us.
She's going to rediscover
her ancestry.
Uh, no, I'm not, Mom.
We talked about this.
It's difficult to know where you're going
if you don't know where you came from.
What's that? Confucius?
Common sense.
Lizzie, burning the midnight oil?
Not if I can help it.
How are you doing?
Very well, thanks.
DORSET: So, is this where all the cool kids hang out?
Not if we can help it.
How's our triple-A?
Not dead yet.
Well, that's encouraging.
Thank you for coming down so quickly.
And...?
And what?
This is where you say, "I owe you one."
What do you want?
Foot rub.
I'll, uh... I'll settle for coffee.
I have to be home in an hour,
and there's nothing fancy--
no coconut-frosted double javaccinos
or anything like that.
Oh, all right.
Good night, Robert.
Elizabeth.
( screams )
( horn honks )
Whoo! ( laughing )
Okay, okay, how bad was that?
What, the jellyfish or the ambush?
I'm so sorry.
You know, they caught me off guard.
Mm-hmm. You know, if it's any consolation,
they didn't hate you.
Oh, is that what they were saying?
They're just old-fashioned.
Taxi! Meaning?
Meaning they want me to be with someone more traditional.
You know, all that talk about going to China?
They just want to find me a husband.
Well, just tell them to relax, all right?
It's not like we're getting married.
Hey, taxi!
Come on.
( sighs )
What?
What are we doing?
You're kidding, right?
We're... we're dating, you know?
We're having fun.
Neither one of us is ready to settle down, right?
Right.
What, did I say something?
Nope.
Then why are you mad?
I'm not mad.
I'm sure you'll find yourself a new bang buddy.
Good night.
( moaning )
( panting )
Thank God I got you a decaf.
( laughing and moaning )
( sighs )
He left.
What are you doing?
Ah, I needed to stretch my legs.
It's good to see you.
Look great.
You look... like hell.
Too much partying on the plane.
So?
So...
So, I met Gillian.
She seems... Yeah, she is.
Must be nice having your own private nurse.
She give you your letter?
( clears throat ): Did you read it?
No.
Well, you're the only one.
I think he wanted to try and explain why he stayed.
He saved my life.
It's different over there.
Changes you.
I think Carter found himself.
I didn't know he was missing.
He's going to be okay.
I don't want to talk about Carter anymore.
I think it was doomed from the start.
I'm glad one of us had the courage to put it out of its misery.
It feels strange to be here.
I think maybe I've changed, too.
Well, change is good, right?
I think I'm way overdue.
I hope he hasn't talked you into helping him escape.
Nope.
You need to take these and get back in bed.
You're still warm.
I'll-I'll stop by tomorrow.
Okay.
Great.
It was really nice to finally meet you.
You, too.
I'm glad you're back.
How you doing, huh?
