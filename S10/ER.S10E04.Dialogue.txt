What do you want?
A foot rub.
I'll...
I'll settle for coffee.
( panting )
I'm Gillian.
I was working with Luka and John in the Congo.
Ah.
John asked Luka to give you this.
He wrote me a letter?
I think he wanted to try and explain why he stayed.
I don't want to talk about Carter anymore.
Why are you mad?
I'm not mad.
I'm sure you'll find yourself a new bang-buddy.
Good night.
You're not her doctor; you're her nurse.
When I ask you not to do something, don't do it.
I hate my job.
Pardon me. Excuse me.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. I need a paper.
We're closed.
Come on, man. Show me some love.
Come on.
Ah.
Old news by now.
So she's had her bath?
Good. Good.
Yeah, could you put her on for me, so I could say good night?
( sighs )
Oh. Um, okay then.
Well, give her a kiss good night for me then
and, uh, I shall see you in the morning.
No, I won't work too hard.
Yeah, okay. Bye.
Everything okay?
Yeah.
She's watching Clifford.
Hmm.
You know, everyone's allowed a little downtime.
Even Ella's mother.
You disagree?
I don't know.
It's just sneaking out of the house like this--
it all feels a little...
unseemly.
You say unseemly. I say sexy.
That, too.
Not to mention fun.
Our shift starts in...
My car's fast.
You've just had a shower.
Water's cheap.
You're half-dressed.
You're not.
Mr. Drake in Two is waiting on his second troponin.
Psych needs to evaluate the woman in Four
who says she's been pregnant for the past seven years.
Eloise is back?
Yup, with the mother of all yeast infections.
I gave her a Fluconazole/Haldol cocktail.
Frequent flyer?
Logs in more hours than me, which is saying something.
Have we met?
No.
Damn, is everybody new around here or what?
Fresh out of nursing school.
Or fresh off the boat.
I haven't seen anything like this
since shore leave in Manila.
Think fast, truant.
You still here, wheezy?
Oh, hell, yeah.
Home sweet home and right on time, buddy.
No, see, this is mi casa, not su casa.
Remember, you're just visiting from Whitebread, Iowa,
or wherever you're from.
That's Whitebread, Florida, actually.
Hey, Pratt.
Is there a warfarin- phenobarb interaction?
Up the warfarin because
you've got increased hepatic metabolism.
Secondly, I'll more than make up for being a few minutes late.
And third, I'm not your buddy.
Hey, Coop, Cubbies, Friday night,
behind home plate, you and me?
Hell, yeah.
Suds and dogs? I'm there, Daddy.
Cool.
You two gonna kiss next?
Ortho on line one for you.
Well, unless there's a phone in the can, take a message.
Uh, Pratt.
We have a rectal mass guy in Two
personally asking for you.
Dr. Pratt, I have a man with urticaria I need to present.
You're going to have to give me a minute.
And can you supervise my pelvic exam?
Yeah, all right, in a sec.
What's the dose of IV Reglan?
Damn, how many of you newbies are there?
That mean med students? There are lots of us.
Yeah. Well, am I the only second-year here?
I'm sorry.
I didn't see Dr. Cooper.
I would've asked Dr. Morris, but, uh...
COOP: He's stuck with a patient in Two.
The sprained ankle?
Damn it, Morris, I have 30 patients on the rack
and 40 in Triage.
A little multitasking on your part would be helpful.
Hey, you're not doing that clown any favors
by picking up his slack.
Okay, not a single chart's been picked up
in the past 45 minutes.
It's called a work ethic, people.
Since when is Weaver on graveyard?
God forbid you should take a patient
the last hour of your shift.
You might have to stay an extra 20 minutes.
Once a month.
She says it's the only way to keep up her skills.
I worked all day, too. You think I'm not tired?
Never thought I'd say this, but I kinda miss Little Stumpy.
Pratt, you forgot to sign your QA forms last night.
MAN: Get me out of here!
You want to grab this first?
I'm off the clock.
Come on, you heard Weaver.
Open tibia fracture
after a motorcycle accident three hours ago.
I never gave permission for this!
You have his films?
Right here.
Name's Mathers and he's not a happy camper.
How you doing, Mr. Mathers?
I don't want to be in this hellhole!
That's how I'm doing!
St. T's shipped him because they...
They dumped me 'cause I don't have insurance.
You're here, sir, because you require
a higher level of care than they're capable of giving.
I work for a living, damn it!
I'm not some county welfare case.
Hey!
This look like TV to you? What are you doing?
Had a gram of Ancef and six of MS.
God, I deserve better than this...
No, the best thing that could've happened to you
was coming to County.
You're about to receive
the finest health care in Chicago.
Isn't anyone going to help deliver my precious baby?!
Eloise, you've been pregnant for seven years,
you can wait ten more minutes.
All right, listen up, listen up.
We're the A team, people.
You know what that means?
That means we have exactly 12 hours to clear this place out
and show those quacks at the day shift how it's done.
WOMAN: Most people are quite pleased with its lifelike appearance
and the attention paid to detail...
Yeah, well, they should've clipped my nails then.
With a minimum of motion,
your own muscle signals will trigger the arm, so that...
Yeah, I read the brochure. Let's go.
To bend the arm, simply contract your biceps.
That's it.
Biceps up, triceps down, biceps up, triceps down.
They actually pay you to state the obvious?
Okay, pausing, as you just did, causes the arm to lock.
How do you unlock it?
Well, it requires a quick co-contraction,
but that's too advanced for now.
No, we're not ready
to move on to the hand yet.
We don't have to.
Look, how do you put it on?
Donning and doffing are much more complex tasks.
Harness first or stump in the socket?
Dr. Romano, it's late...
I want my damn arm, all right?!
I've waited long enough! Let's go.
MATHERS: Screwy thing is if I was on welfare,
Medicaid would've covered me there, right?
Right.
Now, remember.
Open fractures can lead to gram-negative osteomyelitis,
which is why we add gentamycin.
Veins are sclerosed.
Excuse me.
Ever use IV drugs, Mr. Mathers?
Years ago.
Doesn't mean I should be butchered at County.
You're absolutely right.
And that's why we're going
to have our best work your central line.
Neela?
Right.
Wait, what is she? Ten?
No, almost 16.
Lester, I need you to call Ortho.
Tell them that Dr. Pratt's open fracture patient
needs to be in the OR no later
than three hours from now.
It was a pleasure working with you, sir.
Doesn't she need to be supervised?
( sighs )
Hey, Mike.
Can you spot this one for me, man?
Hey.
What?
I've had to take a whiz since I got here.
Freddy!
Freddy, if you don't get up, you're going to lose your gurney
and spend the night on the floor.
But I like a firm mattress.
PRATT: What's his blood alcohol?
429 but it smells a lot higher.
He ain't going anywhere on his own.
Come on, up you go, Freddy.
FREDDY: Anybody ever tell you you're beautiful?
Yeah, all the time. Come on.
Mag and thiamine, keep him till he's sober
and tell housekeeping there's vomit in the hall.
I think I'm going to be sick.
She new?
She's wearing white pants, isn't she?
Why? You want to date her?
Hey, hold on now.
I thought things were good between us.
You know, cards on the table, no hard feelings...
We talked about this.
Oh, none whatsoever.
WEAVER: Pratt.
Ready for you to present.
Okay, let me take a leak first.
No.
Rick Mathers, open tib on Ancef and gent
awaiting Ortho for a washout and ORIF.
He has a history of IVDA, needs a central line.
Better have more than that.
Exam 4, ureteral colic waiting on a CT urogram,
pain-free with Toradol.
How's his renal function?
BUN 15, creatinine 1.1.
Curtain 2, febrile PID, got foxy-doxy.
She's being admitted to GYN.
And in here, we've got Betsy Wimbel, 28,
exacerbation of Crohn's disease
with abdominal pain and diarrhea.
Percocet's not touching her.
It's cramping again.
Another 100 of Demerol for Betsy, please.
Steroids?
Gram of Solumedrol.
And I called GI to get her admitted for intractable pain.
Sounds good.
Yeah.
Should be going upstairs any time now.
Thank you, Dr. Pratt.
I appreciate your going to bat for me.
Oh, it's nothing.
Anything for you, Betsy.
I like your style, man.
Oh, yeah?
Well, get your own.
Numb it! Numb it!
Hold still, Mr. Mathers.
We're almost done.
You aiming for the sternal notch?
( wailing in pain )
Still no flash.
All right, you're too inferior.
Aim more cephalad.
No, she has to avoid the subclavian artery.
NEELA: I know, I know...
Ow! God!
Here, let me try it.
No.
Are you following the landmarks?
Yes!
Oh, God!
CHEN: What's going on in here?
They're stabbing me to death here!
Four attempts at a central line.
Here, I'll take that.
What, a Chink now?
What is this, the damn UN?
You aim above
and posterior to the index finger
in the sternal notch. Hello.
( screaming ): Oh, God.
RASGOTRA: I thought I was.
Advancing...
Got a flash.
Guidewire.
I guess I'm more comfortable with the IJ approach.
Well, you need to learn them both.
( Mathers moaning )
All right, I'm in.
Oh, thank God somebody here knows what they're doing.
Gallant, can you sew it in for me?
I was off an hour ago.
Me, too.
She hates me, doesn't she?
Who? Dr. Chen?
She thinks I'm interested
in her boyfriend, but I'm not.
( chuckles )
Should I talk to her?
I would leave it alone.
They broke up.
She and Dr. Pratt? When?
Last week.
Let go of my sleeve, Freddy.
But I love you.
Dr. Chen?
Let's see if you feel that way in the morning.
Another two of lorazepam.
Do you have a moment?
Uh, actually, I'm on my way out.
Put Freddy in Curtain Two
and give him to Dr. Morris, wherever he is. Thank you.
It's just that I think we got off on the wrong foot
and I'd very much like to remedy that.
What?
Dr. Pratt's a bit of a flirt,
of which I'm sure you're well aware,
but I want you to know, I did nothing to bring it on.
In fact, I think he rather can't help himself.
But if I did anything
to worsen the situation, I apologize,
and I'd hope you wouldn't penalize me
over something which I had no control.
Penalize you?
Be hard on me.
Show me up in front of the others.
Um... look...
Neela.
I'm hard on all my med students,
especially the women, because I have to be,
for their own good.
If I were you, I'd worry more about my skills
and less about Dr. Pratt.
All right, Mr. Coston's discharged;
Mrs. Provost, admitted to Cards;
Lemony Jones is AMA and don't bother me
unless you've got some money for me, please.
FREDDY: * You put your right hand in *
Who's got big mouth Freddy?
* You put your right hand out
Chen assigned him to Morris.
Yeah, well, he's mine now.
* You put your right hand in *
* And you shake it all about
* You do the hokey-pokey
Keep pushing Ativan till he shuts up. Yeah, right.
* Turn yourself around...
Geez!
One more patient.
No, not now. Later.
No, wait, please. You won't even have
to go very far. He's right over here.
His name is, uh... Hey, stop.
Okay? Just stop.
Betsy, nobody's been in to see you yet?
( strained ): No. Is it going to be much longer?
Well, let me get on the horn to GI,
and tell them my girl's tired of waiting on her consult, okay?
ANDY: Um, can I talk now?
Yeah, go ahead. Ed Gamble, 28,
developed an expressive aphasia
while fighting with his wife.
Stopped talking mid-sentence.
It was all very dramatic.
I can talk now though.
Have you done a full neuro exam?
No, but my husband passed the idiot test with flying colors.
( knocks on window )
Excuse me.
What's up? Weaver knows, but just in case,
dislocated shoulder,
check post- reduction film. Mm-hmm.
Pancreatitis, 30 of morphine,
just make sure he's breathing.
And I'm out of here unless you need me to stay.
Now, why would I need that?
Because it's crazy-busy
and there's only one attending on the floor?
Nah, got it this. I was hoping you'd say that.
For you. And Morris is MIA.
He's got an LOL waiting on a pelvic for over 14 hours now.
Okay. You leaving?
Yeah, finally.
PARAMEDIC: 73-year-old female,
chronic emphysema on home 02.
Told her granddaughter she couldn't breathe.
Kid called 9-1-1.
Ma'am, what's your name?
Winnie Crawford, that's her name.
COOP: She's not moving air.
Okay, let's get Miss Crawford into Trauma One.
Abby?
Uh, my shift's over.
You.
You want to be a doctor? Move it!
Um, by the way, uh, your loan's not going to go through.
Not with a FICO of 428.
They gave you my credit rating?
I saw the application on the fax.
Couldn't lease a moped with a score that low.
WEAVER: Get her on 100% non-rebreather.
Is Grandma okay?
We're trying to help her.
Hang a liter of saline. We have an IV yet?
GIRL: She doesn't like hospitals.
DUVATA: Working on it. Pressure's 86/52.
Don't do that!
I need a 7-0 tube and a Mac 3.
Stop it!
Okay, someone get her to the family room.
She wouldn't like it. She's DNR!
What did you say?
WEAVER: Sweetie,
do you know what DNR means?
She doesn't want to be naked.
( Coop sighs )
Hypoxic on 15 liters, respiratory failure.
We have to tube her.
Not if she's DNR.
The child wouldn't know the term unless it had been discussed.
It doesn't matter. Without documentation,
we resuscitate. Am I right?
Put her on a vent, she'll never come off.
Morphine and oxygen until we know different.
Erica, do you know where your parents are?
My mom's out with her boyfriend.
Okay, take her to the family room.
Get a number for the mom.
Come with me, all right?
Okay, shut your eyes and don't let me open them.
You think it's bad?
I asked for a divorce. You didn't ask.
And he starts with the mute act,
which is a childish variation on his cold shoulder act.
( knocking )
Sorry to interrupt.
Excuse me.
Jeez.
Intubated benzo overdose, waiting for an ICU bed.
Radiator fluid burn needs Thermazine dressings.
Incised thrombosed hemorrhoid needs to go home for sitz bath.
So, what are you telling me for?
Those are all Morris'. Man, I've been up and down
this hallway; I cannot find him.
Plus, I'm late for dinner with my folks.
All right, give it to me. Thank you.
Have a good night. Yeah.
He's doing it again.
He's doing what?
Not talking.
Look, obviously, this is Ed's way
of keeping me hooked. That or he's really lost it.
Either way, he needs help.
Okay. Thank you.
Hey, I need you to do me a favor.
I need you to call Psych
for a consult on Mr. Gamble. Yes, Doctor.
Dr. Pratt? What?
I have a patient who was bit by a rat.
All right, come on.
Should I send off a CBC?
For what, rabies?
Nurse? Come on.
That woman blew her nose on my smock.
Well, maybe she's not a Tweety fan.
Hey, I need you to update his tetanus
and I need you to test his flexor tendons.
No, don't test me, man.
Just test the rat. ( screams )
This is not what I went to nursing school for.
I quit.
Irrigate. Put him on Keflex
and chuck the rat in the bio bin.
I've got to take another piss.
Dr. Pratt, I've got a lady with dysmenorrhea.
Mm-mm, mm-mm. Here, take that.
Prostate pain and a baby with a impetigo?
MORRIS: If it's obstruction,
what would the diameter be?
Ten mill... so then over ten millimeters
then I should call surgery?
Son of a bitch.
Hang up!
What?
You're a second-year resident,
not a med student.
You can't be calling your mother, your father
or your cousin who's a podiatrist
to help get through a shift.
Now get out on the floor
and do your damn job!
And for God's sake, light a match or something.
( opens door latch )
Hi.
Hey.
Figured I owed you a visit.
And... Gillian invited me for dinner.
It's 10:00.
Well, I didn't think you'd take me up on it.
Oh.
Uh, sorry,
I can't stay, uh, but there's still
some Thai left in the fridge, if you want.
Uh, see you in a couple months.
Thanks. Okay.
Need any help with that?
No, no, I'm good.
Um, bye, Abby.
Where's she going?
Ah, back to Montreal.
Her boyfriend's been bugging her to go back home.
I thought you two were...
Nah, it's complicated. Mm.
PRATT: This guy Mathers
is approaching the six-hour mark.
He needs a washout in the OR.
or he's going to get some serious osteo...
Yeah, well, we're a little busy down here, too.
Dumb... Your acute abdomen is acutely constipated.
Give him an enema and some Colace.
Now, how did I know you were going to say that?
Because you know you shouldn't have bothered
to call me down in the first place?
Hey, I got a board to clear. Yeah, yeah.
Look, put a fresh saline dressing
on my open fracture guy, would you? Yes, Doctor.
You do speak English, right? Yes, Doctor.
( sighs )
All right, looks like we're making progress.
Only 30 on the board.
And 50 in Triage.
So we better fuel up.
Feel like making a burger run, my treat?
Cafeteria's closed. McDonald's isn't.
You got feet.
Excuse me, Doctor?
Oh, I see you're talking again.
It sort of comes and goes.
Were you able to determine anything?
No, not yet, but we got a special doctor coming to see you,
so you better get into bed before you miss him.
So, you think it's just stress? I don't know.
You pulled me out of a movie for Betsy Wimbel?
Is there a problem?
Yeah, she's in here three times a month
with the same complaints and still somehow manages
to squeeze Demerol out of residents like you
who don't pull her old charts.
Yeah, that's all fine and dandy, but she's got real disease--
guaiac-positive stool and intractable pain.
She's a manipulative drug-seeker
and we are not here to support her habit.
So examine her, put a note in her chart
stating that you won't admit.
Bump her steroids, give her a few Vicodin
and do not call me again.
I'm just asking you to take care of your patient.
Actually, she's your patient now.
Hey, Lester.
Medicate and discharge my Crohn's patient.
Tell her you're sorry, but she won't be admitted.
ABBY: You seem to be getting
your strength back.
I couldn't run a four-minute mile, but I'm doing okay.
Still a little anemic.
Are you glad to be home?
Yes and no.
I miss it.
You're not in your own head all the time.
You're a part of something
that's in constant motion over there.
Any break from it you get is a luxury,
not just something to be taken for granted.
And that's different from County how?
It's its own addiction, I guess.
Yeah, it certainly hooked Carter.
Yeah.
How are you doing with that?
What, without him, you mean?
I'm fine.
I'm better than fine.
So you're happy?
( chuckles )
Getting there.
I made a few decisions.
Like what?
I don't want to jinx myself.
( pager beeps )
Work wants me back.
Tonight?
Pretend you didn't get a page.
I need the money.
See you soon then?
Yeah.
Good night.
DUVATA: Corina Wybel is waiting on amylase
and Mathers is still in Sutures.
He didn't go up to surgery yet?
Hey, I thought you left.
What can I say? The attrition rate for nurses here sucks.
Ha, ha, Tweety girl?
Yeah, writing was on the wall for that one.
It's kind of a drag you got called back in, though.
Not really. Double overtime.
How's it going?
Are you talking to me? Yeah.
Fine.
Glad to hear it.
You're one of the best nurses on the floor.
With all the changes that Robert's been making,
I'd, uh, hate to lose you.
Thanks.
NEELA: Abby, do you know where I can find
paper and crayons for a little girl?
Is she a patient? No, but...
Your evaluation as a med student revolves around
how many patients you can carry,
not how many children you can baby-sit.
Take a cue from some of your colleagues and get busy.
Okay, the wrist film's negative.
Ace wrap and he's out of here with RICE. Got it.
Scombroid patient had two liters,
tolerating POs, discharge with a clear liquid diet. Yes, sir.
Threatened AB is Rh-positive.
Send her home with pelvic rest, no intercourse,
no tampons, no douching. Thanks.
( sighs )
Morris.
Why do I have a board full of nasty
and you're studying radiology?
Uh, Damian here came in with wheezing.
Yeah, he's got a quarter in his upper esophagus.
So, what's your point?
I'm thinking it'll just pass.
In my poop?
So, that's it?
We just wait till it comes out?
No, actually, being that he's symptomatic,
we call in a specialist who can take it out with an endoscope.
Is that an operation?
With no cutting involved.
All right, who's the GI consult on call?
Hampton, a very special friend of mine.
You page her.
COOP: Pratt!
DUMAR: Pulse ox 98 on two liters.
Street racing MVA, first of three.
Sicker one's coming in right behind me.
Witness said car rolled three times.
No, man, it was at least four.
Excuse me.
Janie Timmons, 16, restrained
but loose after several rolls.
Unknown LOC, GCS 234.
Janie, can you hear me?
CSF out the ears.
And blood in the airway.
Page neurosurg and trauma.
Bet you money she's got a bleed in her brain.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Where we going? What's open?
Nothing. Uh, end-stage emphysema in One, a possible DNR.
Possible? Yeah.
Let's go.
Look out.
Triple MVA-- we need this room.
Wait, she needs a monitored bed.
Not if she's a DNR.
We're waiting for confirmation on that.
She's got end-stage emphysema.
Consider it confirmed.
Come on. Let's go.
PRATT: Let's go. Come on.
Come on. Come on. Out. Out.
Out. Out.
His '64 Mustang lost out to a Z28.
Good vitals, unknown LOC, chest abrasion
with closed fracture of the humerus.
The classic people always challenge.
WEAVER: We'll get a C-spine
in CT, but he needs a chest and AP pelvis.
That's going to take a while. They're slammed.
Okay, if CT opens first, we'll have to send him there.
You want to go when he does?
No, I can't. I'm the only attending
and Pratt's the senior on the floor.
Abby, you go.
It's my fault.
They're young. They're allowed to be stupid...
No one's allowed to be that stupid, Mr. Vangoss.
I got bone sticking out of my legs!
Six Flags only better.
Cranial nerves grossly intact.
I've been here six hours!
MORRIS: Somebody needs
to shut him up.
Oh, my God! ...cleared.
Harlin was always like a total G force, you know?
Good breath sounds. Hey, where's Janie?
Yeah, you're just now asking?
The belly's tender.
I don't want to inconvenience anybody.
Take the rectal.
What?
Needs someone to find out
about his girlfriend, doesn't he?
You're going up my butt?
Just one finger.
PRATT: Multiple lac
scalp and occiput.
MORRIS: Hey, Pratt, your guy in Sutures
is having a meltdown.
Later. Looks like a skull fracture
with a step off.
Sats are down to 90.
Threatening to sue
everybody and their brother, but mostly you.
MALIK: Whoa, she's blowing some teeth.
Oh, wow. Hey,
where the hell you're going?
Bathroom.
( alarm beeping )
Sats 88... 86...
Okay.
All right, after I secure the airway,
chest tube and subclavian on the right.
Dr. Pratt, Psych won't see your aphasia patient
unless you clear a head CT first.
The guy's freaking out 'cause his wife's leaving.
He doesn't need a damn head CT.
Okay, give me the tube.
Okay.
Pulse is down to 65.
You better kick it.
JERRY: Pratt, Hampton called from GI.
She's not going to see the quarter kid
till morning, but she plans on seeing Romano first.
I'm in. Is that all she said?
No, actually. She said you're an asshole, too.
Good night.
Wow. If it's 1:00 in the morning, I guess it's lunchtime.
You got to try this.
Mm, sure. What is it?
Dinuguan.
Oh, yeah? What's that?
Cooked pork blood.
Did I ever mention I was half Jewish?
( "I Love the Nightlife" blaring from stereo )
Hey, Randi, I'm still waiting on Ortho
for my open fracture guy.
As soon as they call, you make sure you tell them...
They called. They said that you should irrigate him
because they're kind of busy right now.
Nice.
Neela, find Morris and have him supervise you
on doing a poor man's washout on Mr. Mathers.
Any idea where he is?
No, but that's an MSP-- med student problem.
I love being an R2.
So, what do you think?
I think it's little loud.
Well, if I have to stay up these hours,
so does everybody else.
No. He hasn't gone to radiology yet.
That's the problem.
High-speed MVA, blunt trauma.
He really needs a belly CT.
Can't you just sneak us in?
Thank you.
Okay, Mr. Vangoss, we're going up to the CT room.
I was 17 when that song first came out.
You probably weren't even born yet.
Oh, I was around.
Hi. Hi.
DORSET: Elizabeth, hold the door.
Oh, oh. We're full, I'm afraid.
Oh.
Well, I'll catch the next one.
He's cute.
Did you guys ever get together?
Who?
Dorset.
Didn't he ask you out or something?
Uh, I suppose you could say we're... dating.
Really?
What?
What?
What? You think it's too soon?
I didn't say that.
I think it's too soon.
I... I... I just said he was cute.
Yeah.
Too soon.
( groaning )
You're not too good at this, are you?
It should start to feel numb soon.
What the hell is that stuff?
Sterile saline-- washes the germs out.
And you're just now getting around to this?
We thought you'd be in the OR by now,
but this will buy us an extra hour or two.
Before what?
WEAVER: What do you think
you're doing?
Temporary washout.
WEAVER: Which is not
a procedure a med student performs
without resident supervision.
Oh, great, she's not even a doctor?
Stop what you're doing
and tell me who the resident is on this case.
Dr. Pratt, but he asked Dr. Morris
to supervise on his behalf.
So where's Dr. Morris?
I'm surrounded by incompetents.
MATHERS: Hey! Hey, how do you think I feel?
This one's been trying
to kill me all night.
Oh, my God.
( Bob Marley's "Jammin'" plays )
No mass, no hemorrhage, normal ventricles, no shift.
So he's clear? Crystal.
Hey, Mr. Gamble.
Your head CT looks good.
Everything's fine.
So what do I do now?
Well, I've arranged for you to speak
with one of our mental health specialists.
I'm not crazy.
No, you're not. You're just stressed and...
Then give me something for that, but don't send me to a shrink.
God, the last thing I need is
for Gloria to have proof I'm nuts.
Pratt, dislocated patella.
COPD exacerbation.
I and D on a pilonidal cyst.
And don't pass these off on that idiot Morris.
Look, I know you think I'm a wuss...
Mr. Gamble, I don't have time...
Just give me something to get me through the night.
Hey, I want you to give Ed here two milligrams of obecalp IV
and discharge him.
Obecalp?
You know what Obecalp is?
Yes, Doctor.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Yeah. Whatever works, right?
Yeah.
Erica?
What does DNR mean?
It stands for Do Not Resuscitate,
which means...
someone doesn't want to be kept alive by machines
if they should get very sick.
Let's get you back to the other room
where you can rest.
Can I stay here?
She says she sleeps better with me.
Sure.
Good night.
Night.
I'm glad you have time for a Kodak moment.
I know I sure as hell don't.
We still got 20 on the board
and 35 in Triage.
Sorry. She's by herself here.
It's hard, isn't it?
Learning where your time is best spent,
whether it's with the patient or their family.
Well, you know, that's really rough.
Now if you're done playing house,
do an I and D on Mr. Brier's pilonidal cyst.
Hey, hey.
He's tough, but he's got the goods, you know?
Yeah.
Yeah. Hey, have you ever heard of Obecalp?
Because I can't find it in the PDR.
It's "placebo" spelled backwards.
Oh. Who's prescribing it?
Um...
Dr. Pratt.
WEAVER: Obecalp?
Look, the guy's playing games with his wife.
He gets panicky whenever I mention Psych,
and he begs me to give to him something
to calm his nerves.
So I give him saline.
And it looks like he feels a lot better.
No harm, no fowl.
Do you ever hear of truth-telling?
Deceptive practices? Yeah, but he...
Not only have you breached
every principle of medical ethics,
you've also opened us up to a lawsuit
if this patient finds out what you did.
MALIK: Dr. Weaver, your MVA guy is crashing in CT.
Damn it.
Hey, Severa, I guess you better pull the plug
on Mr. Gamble's Obecalp.
I never gave it to him.
MAN: Doctor,
how long before my son is taken care of?
Your son...
Damian-- the quarter?
Oh, right, right.
Um, well, it looks like the, uh...
the GI doctor who performs the procedure
won't be able to see him till the morning.
Oh. When in the morning?
I'm not sure, but he's stable
and I don't see a problem.
We've been here for 14 hours.
No one's done a damn thing.
Damian's scared to death.
She needs to get to bed. We all do.
Look, I know it's hard...
This is an emergency room, right?
There's a quarter in my son's throat.
He can't breathe.
Now, that's an emergency, isn't it?
( alarms blaring )
What happened?
He got altered,
and his sats drifted down.
Did you finish the scan?
No.
How long has he been down?
Under five minutes.
Let's tube him.
Pulmonary edema?
More than likely.
Okay, stop compressions.
Still no pulse.
Never, never send an even slightly unstable patient
to CT without a doctor.
You told me to bring him...
I'm talking to me.
I'm in.
You coming?
Pratt's trying the old Foley trick.
What?
Yeah, that's what's so cool.
Okay, Foley and a two mac blade.
All right, sats is 96, BP steady.
Mm-hmm.
All right, come on.
Okay, so now,
what we want to do is put this tube
just past the quarter.
And once we do that,
we're going to blow up the little balloon
with saline,
and hopefully pull the quarter
back into his mouth.
Couldn't he aspirate the quarter into his lungs?
Not if I grab it first.
Now, here's the tricky part.
Okay.
And...
presto.
( laughs )
Dr. Pratt.
( laughs )
Here. One for the piggy bank.
( laughs )
( speaking Tagalog )
DUVATA: Oh, Abby, you're back.
Can you cover for Melinda in Triage?
Sure.
Love to. Triage is my personal favorite.
Thanks for asking.
Hey, where's Weaver?
Bars are closing. We're gonna get slammed.
She's still in CT, which means the R2s are in charge,
and that scares me.
You and me, man.
All right, let's get the party started.
( loud music playing )
You! Come on. Come show me some love.
Come here.
Please tell me it's not just 3:00.
Shut the hell up!
How's anybody supposed to sleep around here?!
MALIK: Yo, Abby. Any time now.
Okay, where are we at?
Now serving #47.
This is Jay-Jay. He has a toothache.
Thank you.
Hey, Jay-Jay, how you feeling?
Tooth hurts.
Uh, when did you first notice it?
About a year ago.
Excuse me.
Yep, have a seat. I'll be right with you.
No, we've already been seen.
My son was feeling a little queasy
in the parking lot.
It might just be the anesthesia,
but could you get Dr. Pratt to maybe...
Oh, my God. Pratt!
Pratt!
Damian...
Here, help me lie him down...
What did he come in for?
He swallowed a quarter.
Blood looks arterial.
Page surgery and vascular.
Aorto-esophageal fistula?
Pratt, I need you at Curtain One.
Not now. Get a gurney.
What's going on?
Probable aorto- esophageal fistula
after a foreign body removal in the ER.
You did endoscopy?
I used a foley.
Are you out of your mind?
It worked fine. The quarter he swallowed must've been in there too long.
Ten minutes after he was discharged, this happens.
All right, we'll take it from here.
Tran-esophogeal erosion needs immediate aortic repair.
Apparently, not all ER residents can walk on water.
You know, you're lucky this happened
while they were still here.
Otherwise this boy would be dead.
Add five of Peep once he's on a vent.
Andy, what did the NG aspirate show on Maloney?
Uh, let me find out.
Pratt! Lungs clear.
Let's get some 02 and check a D-stick.
Watch it. Syncopal episode?
Only groans with a sternal rub.
We were getting ready to go
and then he sort of slumped to the floor.
All right, let's get him on the bed.
One, two, three, up.
All right, put him on the monitor,
and get me some vitals.
I'm on it.
I thought he was kidding...
Pupils asymmetric,
mild ptosis.
He was fine other than being a nut case.
Young, healthy guy with transient loss of speech.
SonoSite.
A negative CT. Turn that damn music off.
Listen, man, I got this. It's okay.
Any risk factors for stroke?
No. Decreased tone on the right.
Oh, my God, he had a stroke?
Call CT. Have them clear a room.
Uh, I think I have something here.
This is my patient, all right?
Might be a carotid dissection.
Let me see that.
Tapering occlusion of the left carotid.
What is that?
Your husband has a tear in one of his main arteries
which caused a clot.
Dr. Pratt, your open- fracture patient demands
to be euthanized.
Mr. Mathers is still here?
Go. I got your back on this. Get consent for TPA.
.9 migs per kig.
Okay.
That enough of Triage.
Let it be someone else's turn for a change.
( speaking Tagalog )
And I know you're talking about me.
Hey, Abby, is Exam Two open?
I'm on a break.
Hi, uh, I'd like to find out if I qualify for a cash advance.
Uh, uh, sorry, I have to go.
Neela. Yes?
Grandma's dead.
The little girl's sleeping.
We need the bed.
Hey, how you doing?
Sleepy.
Morphine's kicked in.
That and it's 4:30 in the morning.
Am I gonna lose this thing or what?
My leg.
No.
'Cause I'm...
not the kind of guy who could get along without it.
I work for a living, you know.
Look, I know I've said it before,
but we're gonna get you in the OR real soon.
That's what I hear...
Get Coop to cover for me, would you?
Where do you think you're going?
To take care of something
that should've been done eight hours ago.
Starts screaming bloody murder,
right in the middle of the course.
Makes you wonder what he would've done if he were four over par.
Hey, how you guys doing? Dr. Pratt from the ER.
Size eight-and-a-half gloves, please.
What do you think you're doing?
I'm here to hold your retractors.
Reamer to me. Drill for the cup screws.
Been calling you guys for hours on that open tibia fracture.
Well, now that I'm here to help,
you can free somebody up for the consult.
Just show me where to pull.
Shh, it's all right...
( baby crying )
( baby crying )
Hello?
Hi.
Is Richard here?
Honey, your ex-wife is here.
How old now?
14 months.
( toys clatter )
( baby screaming )
What do you want?
I need a favor.
Abby, it's 8:00 in the morning.
Yeah, I know. I don't have a lot of time.
I need you to co-sign a loan.
Why don't you just declare bankruptcy?
Look, I'm not in trouble, okay?
I just need you...
Want me to support you? No.
I never asked for alimony.
I didn't contest anything in court.
I didn't even take the damn furniture.
You could have if you wanted to.
Look, you must know how much I hate doing this.
I wouldn't do it unless it was absolutely necessary.
I don't want your money,
I just want your signature.
Oh, good morning.
Yeah, hi.
Yeah, I just got in and already I've heard
from the Ortho, Psych, and GI departments,
not to mention our own Dr. Weaver
about your medical hijinks last night.
The carotid clot was a total zebra;
Ortho was taking their time;
and Hampton refused to get her lazy ass down here for a...
You are a screwup,
Pratt.
And just to be clear,
I didn't like you before I knew that.
Mmm, Kenyan roast.
Can't beat it for flavor or punch.
Triple espresso, yes, I can.
Hey, your septic pancreatitis is still waiting on an ICU bed.
Thanks. How'd it go?
Good.
Hey. Hey.
How's the quarter kid?
Corday says he's gonna be fine.
Hey, Coop, I heard you caught
a carotid dissection. Nice.
Thanks, man.
Did a rotation with the stroke team in June.
Anybody could've missed it.
Yeah, well, started Mr. Gamble on anticoagulants,
tear should heal on its own.
And he keeps talking.
You headed home?
Yeah, why? You're not?
I'm going to hit the gym first.
Hey, Coop.
Thanks, man.
Yeah, sure. Anything for a buddy.
