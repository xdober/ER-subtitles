Previously on ER:
You guys met my sister Val?
I was diagnosed with MS
when I was 22,
and before that I was a normal girl.
How advanced is it?
I'm still fully functional.
Look, I know I said I didn't need any help,
but tonight I did.
Thanks for the help.
Hey, Abby, did you get your trinket from Carter?
Gone-native junk for everybody.
KEM: It was my father's.
I want you to have it.
I want you to come back to the States with me.
I want our baby to be born in America.
( alarm rings )
( coughs )
( alarm stops )
Remind me to put the clock on your side of the bed.
Hey, Kem, you down here?
( makes breeze noise )
Been in the kitchen since dawn.
Oh, yeah, she's still adjusting to the time change.
Insisted on making me eggs again.
Oh, that's nice.
That's not nice?
( chuckles )
Good morning.
Hey.
Good morning.
You know, you have got 20 types of tea,
like, six sets of China
and glasses for every possible drink.
Did you have trouble sleeping again?
Um, I had trouble finding the kitchen again.
I need a map.
You get used to it.
You'll be sliding the hall in socks in no time.
Oh, and that wouldn't offend anybody?
Nope.
Although, you should probably stop
making breakfast for Emily.
She doesn't like my cooking.
Doesn't like feeling insecure about her employment.
Oh.
I'm going to miss you today.
You want George to take you around, show you the sights
after your appointment?
Do some shopping? Go to a movie?
I might take a walk.
Would you rather I not work while we're here?
Because I don't have to.
What I'd rather you do...
is give me your socks.
( laughing )
What are you doing?
( speaking French )
What are you doing?
( laughs )
D'accord.
So where's the, uh, bedroom again?
( laughing )
( shouting )
( laughing and shouting )
You coming or what?
Abby, sorry.
It took forever to get Alex out of house,
then I forgot his lunch.
Don't worry about it.
You ready to sign out?
Yes, too bad I can't leave.
Lelma Ramirez in One, vomiting times three,
tolerating sips after ten of reglan.
Stomach flu season already?
So Dr. Lewis would have us believe.
She just called in sick.
Really? How'd she sound?
Better than she should have.
Repeat EKG and troponin on Mr. St. John at 8:00 AM.
Lewis probably has that flight nurse in her bathrobe.
TAGGART: Is he pain free?
Yeah. Miss Clark's had three nebs.
She may need continuous.
Should I call in another attending?
No, Carter's on.
We're good.
So, what's his story?
Richer and better looking than you or I will ever be.
The end.
I feel like crap, okay.
I just want to know if the guy's a jerk. Is he?
She's not the best one to ask.
WEAVER: There a problem with the narcotics count?
Yeah, we're missing ten migs of Valium
If you sign off on it the night nurses can go home.
Yeah, or they could just learn to count.
GALLANT: My onset seizure guy
just went up to medicine, the rack is empty
and I am off the board.
Good. Go home.
So you're saying I can leave early?
No, I'm saying it's slow and you're an intern.
We'll be fine.
Alrighty then.
Get some rest, Mike.
Yup, I hope it stays slow for you.
What have you got?
Gome from the home.
You mean an elderly patient from a nursing home?
Breakfast special.
Staff went to check granny's vitals
first thing, she didn't have any.
( loud music playing )
Hey, sis.
Hey, you want to turn that down?
Valerie, it's 7:00 in the morning.
Mike, you're home early.
PRATT: Hey, baby, you have another razor,
'cause this one's dull.
Hey.
Morning, Mike.
How many times?
What?
How many times has he been over here?
None of your damn business.
It's only my bedroom.
Just a few.
Now I know why you were so interested in my schedule.
Hey, is there any coffee?
No. Yes.
I'm on the clock anyway.
I'll see you later?
Mm-hmm.
Peace, Mike.
What time you got to be at the airport?
My flight leaves at 2:00.
Wake me up at noon.
I thought you were off.
Not until she balances her narc count.
You wanted to see me.
January 18th.
Forget it.
I've already got two attendings
requesting Super Bowl Sunday off.
No, my last day here.
Africa?
I have to admit, I'm surprised you're still going back.
CHUNY: Dr. Weaver, she pulled out
her foley again.
Kovac will be right there.
She's a boarder being managed by cardiology.
Congestive failure and some dementia.
Check her potassium
and hit her again with lasix before she goes up.
So you'll notify administration?
About what?
My resignation.
No. You will.
Put it in writing and leave it on my desk.
I'll bring it to the medical executive committee
in the morning.
For the record, we need you here
as much as they do there.
Dr. Kovac.
You're late.
Power outage at Armitage station.
Valerie again?
I was going to put a Swann-Ganz in my cardiomyopathy guy.
Afterload reduce with enalopril.
How are you doing, Mrs. Webster?
I want to go home.
A mig of bumex and 40 of "K."
I'm on it.
Pressure's borderline, I can't manage him without a Swann.
How you doing?
Just give the ACE inhibitor
and support with dopamine.
I love you.
Thanks.
If I know his wedge pressure,
I can then do what I need to do.
MAN: Dr. Kovac.
My kid finished the chelation therapy today.
They're coming home.
That's good.
You are going to be our only doctor from now on, okay?
Anyway, Swann tells me his output and PVR.
Gracias.
De nada, angelita.
Uh, do walk-rounds with the med students
and I'll talk to about it later, okay?
( sighs )
Patients really respond to him, don't they?
Yeah.
Give the differential diagnosis of peripheral edema.
Cirrhosis.
CHF.
Thrombophlebitis.
Lockhart, you belong to me at 4:00,
you better be sharper than that.
Come on.
What was that all about?
Could this day suck more?
Sign in sheet's over there.
Um...
not a patient.
Hey, Dr. Carter.
Nice to finally put a face to the name.
She with you?
Yeah.
Call me John.
This is Kem.
Hi.
Sam.
Pleasure to meet you.
So this is it.
This is it.
CHUNY: Double MVA two minutes out.
Hey, stranger.
HALEH: How are you?!
Hey, everybody.
Hey, Malik.
Welcome back, Doc.
Good to see you.
I heard you were coming in today.
And who is this lovely lady?
Everybody, this is Kem Likasu.
She's visiting from the Congo.
Wow. Oh. Welcome.
Good to meet you all.
It's nice to meet you.
Kem has an appointment
with Dr. Subramanian upstairs.
Dr. Subramanian from OB?
Pre-natal checkup. Second trimester.
( laughing )
Congratulations.
That's so great.
Hey.
Hey, Pratt, how are you?
Life is good, but I see
it's better for you.
How you doing?
So, are you back on shift, yet?
Yeah, yeah, about five minutes ago.
Can somebody show
Kem upstairs for me?
Okay. This way.
You're coming, right?
Yeah, yeah. Start the paperwork.
I'll be right there.
EMT: Right behind you.
What do you have?
Larry Brodie, 44-year-old restrained passenger.
Single car versus telephone pole.
May have had a syncopal episode.
Bad bruising to the chest and belly
and dropping his pressure.
CARTER: Who's worse off between the two?
Dad by a long shot.
Can I get four units of O neg
and a portable chest and an EKG?
CHUNY: Sure.
Cool.
I'm a second year resident, too.
Barely.
Uh, Pratt, take the driver.
All right, tell me his story.
19-year-old restrained driver.
Said he was trying to wake his old man up when he crashed.
BP 128/74.
Cracked a couple ribs, got six of morphine.
LESTER: What's with the collar?
Custom made by dad.
What for?
Ankylosing spondylitis.
( labored breathing )
CARTER: Equal breath sounds.
Hemocue's only 8.5.
Well, he's profoundly anemic.
He's bleeding somewhere.
Pressure down to 76.
You're back.
( strained ): Where's my son?
Let's, uh, squeeze in both units.
Yeah, a week ago.
I've been holed up at the house.
And not alone, either.
Central line kit and size eight gloves.
Kem, right?
Cordis introducer gives more volume.
Excellent, Morris.
Yeah, she was the one
setting the ARV therapy in Kinshasa.
Where's my son?
He needs help.
Don't worry, Mr. Brodie.
Your son's in good hands.
Is there someone you want us to call?
Your wife?
No. She died.
One percent lido.
Did you ever meet her?
Nope. Must have gotten past me.
Set up for ultrasound.
Oh... What?
It's good to be home.
We need another doc in here.
Here.
Is my dad next door? I can't turn my head.
Yeah, he's hanging in there, okay?
How's he doing?
Probable rib fracture.
The neck film shows big time fusion and a bamboo spine.
That's ankylosing spondylitis.
Unusual to have degenerative bone disease at his age.
Yeah, similar to juvenile arthritis.
Weakens the spine though.
Sucks living life in bubble wrap.
LESTER: Also has a big pulmonary contusion
and a small pneumo on the right.
What's happening?
There's a bruise on your lung,
which is why you're having trouble breathing.
We may need to tube him.
Great, give my dad
another reason to keep me in the house.
No, let's call anesthesia.
They can do an LMA.
Or an awake nasotracheal while he's stable.
Ah, between you wanting to call in the whole team,
and your African buddy wanting to ban all tests,
what the hell am I supposed to do?
Isn't he the attending?
Hey, Taggart, principal of your kid's school
wants you over there lickety-split.
What for?
Don't know. Can't be good.
Hey, you better find another nurse to cover for you.
Okay, let's try nasal bipap.
NEELA: I'll get it.
Thank you.
Where are the bipap masks?
CHUNY: Bottom right drawer.
Grab the EKG.
Pressure's up to 100 systolic.
KOVAC: Neela, read it for me.
I can do that.
Uh, left bundle branch block,
can't see the ST segments.
Probably not an acute MI, but send a troponin.
Can't visualize Morrison's pouch with all this fat and air.
Where does it hurt, Mr. Brodie?
Everywhere.
Okay, stay ahead four units of type specific,
and let's hope his pressure stays up
long enough to get the CT.
He's fragile.
So, is he mad?
NEELA: Who? My dad.
I talked him into
letting me drive today.
Oh, I'm sure he's not mad.
Rales are worse, sats are down to 88.
Might need to think about an airway.
Oh, there's plenty of room to move on bipap.
Why don't you up
his inspiratory pressure to 10?
Dr. Carter, Kem called.
Dr. Subramanian
is seeing her now.
Well, she took her in early.
Go, we're all over this.
Yeah?
Okay, I'm only covering for Sam until Severa gets here.
What?
Kem.
Look.
Normal extremities.
Good fetal movement.
CARTER: Any neural tube defects?
No, looks great.
It's our son.
I couldn't help it, I wanted to know.
He's beautiful, isn't he?
A son?
Well?
Counts the same.
Come on, Abby. That's totally wack.
Don't make me call the union rep.
Okay, I'm going to call Weaver at home,
see if she'll cut us a break.
It's ringing.
Ow.
Hi, Dr. Weaver.
It's Abby.
Yeah, we found the missing Valium.
Yeah, someone actually left it
in their lab coat pocket.
I'll pass that along.
She says whoever did it is an idiot.
I'm out of here.
Make that a double.
KEM: June 2, two days before John's.
MARQUEZ: That's so sweet.
Hi.
Hey.
Hey, how are you?
Good.
I'm Abby.
Kem. Good to meet you.
Welcome.
And welcome back.
How have you been?
Good.
I'm back in med school.
Really?
What's this?
That's ultrasound.
Wow.
Wow. Congratulations.
Thank you.
Must be Kem.
Are you Luka?
Yeah.
Oh.
If it wasn't for you, John and I would never have met.
Yeah.
So, boy or girl?
It's a boy.
Handsome.
Like his daddy.
( chuckles )
Uh, well, I should probably
get back to work.
I'll walk you out.
Sure. Good to meet you both.
Bye. You, too.
( clears throat )
They got together after I left.
You okay?
Yeah.
Okay.
Boy, did he knock her up the minute he got there?
Going home?
No. On-call room.
Same thing.
( yelling )
Got a messy one here.
Let me go!
What happened?
Two stab wounds to the upper left thigh.
Tachy at 120, BP 90 palp.
Lost two liters of blood easy
even with direct pressure.
Back off, man!
Over the femoral artery?
Okay, let's have a look.
Can we fit a BP cuff above it?
Injury's too high.
Undo my belt.
What?
He needs a tourniquet now.
Leave me alone!
Mine's thinner and cheaper.
Leave me alone!
Okay, wrap it as high as you can.
Leave me alone!
( man yelling )
Can't get it tight enough.
Got it!
Okay, let's get him in Trauma One.
Get off me, man!
Where'd you learn that trick?
What, sitting on a patient?
From a Congolese nurse named Mwadi.
You getting down or what?
Get off me, man!
Not until he's restrained or sedated.
Stab wound. Out of the way, please.
You taking Mr. Brodie to CT?
No, Chuni is.
Why, you need help with that one?
Your patient's pressure
is borderline. Take two units
and a med student with you.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Mrs. Webster, this is a busy road.
How do I get out?
By getting treated and released.
Now let's get you back in the bed
before another gurney comes around the corner.
Oh, you're a good boy.
That's what all the ladies say.
30-year-old mom with a history of migraines.
Neuro exam is normal.
No neck stiffness of fever.
Good vitals.
Morris, you all right?
Yeah.
Mrs. Halsey, are you still going to the headache clinic?
No money for a sitter or anything.
I had to bring my kids.
Any chance I can get something to eat?
Sure.
Maybe hamburgers or hot dogs.
For breakfast?
Something hearty, you know?
Like, mashed potatoes, gravy
and giblets.
Sorry.
Think you should be working?
Yeah, maybe, maybe I should call somebody else in.
Sympathy hurl.
Even a sandwich would be okay.
We're not picky.
Mrs. Halsey, when's the last time you had anything to eat?
I know he's not happy, but he can't be an ordinary boy.
Man. Martin's 19.
You need to let the guy live a little.
SHEILA: Does he need oral contrast?
No, just IV.
We'll be right on the other side
of the glass, Mr. Brodie.
All right, fire it up.
His son's the one with all the osteoporosis, right?
Yeah, but it's not like he wants
to play tackle football.
Just wants to get out once in a while.
Make sure you stay still, okay?
( alarms )
Mr. Brodie?
His pressure's down.
We got to pull him from the tube.
No, we have to define his pathology first.
How fast can you do this?
Well, fast, but... Come on.
Wait. What are we doing?
Getting the scan.
You need to wear lead.
He's not wearing lead.
He's only getting one scan.
You think I do this every day?
Here, ladies first.
Leave that alone.
Spike another unit and squeeze it in.
Hurry up.
And page Corday.
They your patients?
Mom was.
Thought her migraines were kicking up.
And then I noticed the hair and nail changes.
The dermatitis and loss of fat from the cheeks.
She and the kids are starving to death.
They can get sicker
if you increase calories too rapidly.
Yeah, I'm admitting to pedes for slow refeeding.
She's beautiful, by the way.
So when are you going back?
Two weeks.
I'm on my way up to Weaver's office
to drop off my resignation letter.
How long are you going to stay this time?
Kem's going to back and see her family
for a couple of weeks
and then come back here and have the baby.
She miss home?
Yeah, we both do.
Hey, give yourself a week of hot showers
and an unlimited glove supply,
you'll miss it less.
Hmm.
Dr. Carter,
Martin's respiratory distress is worse.
I thought anesthesia was coming down
for the intubation.
I paged twice. Apparently, he's at the pain clinic.
What's his pulse ox?
86 and dropping.
How are you doing, Martin?
Not so good.
Okay, let's up his inspiratory pressure to 15.
Give him five of Albuterol. I'll be back
with an anesthesiologist if I have to pull one
out of clinic myself.
Heart rate's down to 58. Come on, man.
You got a kid who needs you.
Push the drugs. Start the scan.
Need to get your hands out of there first.
Atropine's in.
Go.
How long's this going to take?
20 seconds tops.
I thought this was
a third-generation helical scanner.
Another ten seconds.
Pratt, what in God's name
are you doing in there?
Keeping this guy alive
so we can get the CT and show you
where to cut.
SHEILA: Systolic's down to 90. Come on.
We got soup yet or what?
There. Eight centimeter triple "A."
Nicely done, Greg.
He would have bled out
while I focused on the liver and the spleen.
It's all in the wrist.
Is Dr. Carter in here?
My patient's in respiratory failure.
No!
Dr. Carter is not in here.
( alarms ) Sats are 82.
Can't find Dr. Kovac, either.
Martin, stay with us, all right?
What the hell's going on in here?
Progressive hypoxia despite inspiratory pressure support.
Meaning, he's not breathing. Bag him.
Bradying down to 52.
Carter ever call anesthesia?
RASGOTRA: An hour ago.
So much for them coming to the rescue.
Mig of atropine, 20 of etomidate, 120 and sux.
We're supposed to wait?
Lost the pulse.
No, can't wait anymore.
Amp of epi.
What are you doing?
He needs oxygen.
MARQUEZ: Ectopy.
Is the stiffness part of his disease? Pull his arms down.
Let's get them as straight as we can.
Hundred of lido.
I can't visualize squat.
Dr. Pratt, are you sure?
Lido on board.
All right, stop compressions.
Pratt!
I think I got it.
( cracking )
Oh, God.
Hook up the Ambu bag.
Pulse is strong
and regular.
Did he break his neck?
( sighs )
Sats are good-- 98 with five of PEEP.
There's still no motor tone in the legs.
It's probably the, uh, intubation meds.
Sux only paralyzes for ten minutes.
RASGOTRA: Could be a slow metabolizer.
Just broke off a bone bridge, that's all.
No withdrawal to pain.
Even if his neck is broken, doesn't mean he's paralyzed.
Why don't you hang the steroids, and we'll take him
up to MRI?
They'll know for sure.
( sighs )
It's okay, baby.
Mrs. Webster,
you have to get back in bed before you get hurt.
I know you're busy.
Severa,
can we get her some soft restraints
for her protection, please?
Yes, Doctor.
But Mama still loves you.
Hey, you're back.
Not quite.
Go wait in the lounge.
Hi, Chuni.
Hey, Alex.
Mommy dearest, nursing director called,
says you're one emergency break away from probation.
Perfect.
Everything okay with Alex?
Uh-huh.
No school today?
Nope. Excuse me.
Dr. Carter?
Start with 25 of meclizine.
Yeah?
I know we just met,
but I wondered if you could do me a favor.
35-year-old female with AIDS-related lymphoma,
new onset shortness of breath and hypertension.
Her HIV status was diagnosed but untreated.
Hospice care?
Lives alone at home.
How long have you had AIDS, ma'am?
Too long.
KOVAC: One, two, three.
Any advanced directive?
Hypotensive, 78/52.
Hey, what are you doing here?
I guess someone bought into the idea
that Morris was really sick.
100% O2 and mix up dobutamine.
Who's your doctor, Ruthie?
Don't have one.
PRATT: EKG, ABG
and a portable chest.
Sorry about this morning, man.
Yeah, you didn't look too sorry.
Lungs are wet, and there's
a heart systolic murmur.
Could never get an appointment.
Aortic stenosis?
More like mitral regurge.
We need an echo ASAP.
Got it.
How's Val getting to the airport?
Cab.
We're going to take care of you, Ruthie, okay?
TAGGART: I can't believe he sutured himself.
CARTER: Edges are averted.
Nice wound approximation.
Did it hurt much when you did it?
I numbed it with an ice cube.
That's good thinking.
Don't encourage him.
I'm going to put in another stitch
just to be on the safe side.
And I think you'll find that Lidocaine
works much better than ice cubes.
I didn't have any.
Sutures stay in for about seven days,
and then I'm sure Mom can take them out for you.
I can do it.
Uh, I don't think so.
I appreciate your doing this.
No problem.
You ever seen a kid
do something this crazy before?
To be honest?
PRATT: Pressure's up to 100.
Try a nitro spray.
She's a grown woman, Mike.
Yeah, and we work together.
Some respect for that would have been nice.
No acute ST changes.
And some respect for the fact that we're consenting adults
would be nice, too.
Okay, enough.
Take it outside.
Just when it was getting good.
Hey, it's not like I don't want her to date.
Yeah, you just don't want her to date me.
Look, man, this is not personal.
You thinking that I'm not good enough for your sister isn't personal?
Well, I got news for you, Mike-- it's not your call.
I give up.
You barely know her.
Yeah, no thanks to you.
Pratt, MRI called.
They finished with
the neck fracture guy.
Ruthie, it appears as though you have a tumor in your heart.
It's going to require a surgery.
Why?
Because, uh, the tumor
will eventually make it impossible for your heart...
That'll keep me in the hospital what, a month?
Maybe longer.
( laughs weakly )
Now you people want to spend money on me.
Ruthie...
Just save it for the next patient.
Too late for this one.
Okay, how about a little cramping and dizziness
to ease back in?
I thought you weren't on until 4:00.
I'm not, but since I couldn't sleep,
I figured I'd make myself useful.
Hey, uh, do you know much about our insurance policy?
Does it cover, uh...
therapy?
Physical or psychological?
Like couples or, uh, family counseling.
Nothing serious.
I think it's 80%, but there's a max per year.
VALERIE: Excuse me.
Hey.
Can you tell me where I could find...
Hey, Valerie.
What are you doing here?
Looking for you. Yeah, right.
You seen Pratt anywhere around here?
He's upstairs in MRI; you want me to call him down?
I thought your plane left at 2:00.
It does.
What, you come all the way down
to see him before you leave?
It's going to take an hour...
I came to see you, Mike.
I didn't want to leave things this way.
For real?
You're my brother.
That's got to come first.
I'll be more considerate next time, okay?
Yeah.
Need me to get you a cab?
Nah. Got one waiting.
I'll call you when I get in?
Okay.
Don't be so serious all the time.
Have a safe flight.
Cord edema
and contusion at C-5.
That can resolve with decompression.
Not with this degree of hemorrhage.
Kid thought he had it bad before.
Broke it in MVA, right?
Pratt.
Mr. Brodie's in recovery.
I've repaired his abdominal aneurysm,
and he's going to be just fine.
How's his son doing?
You don't want to know.
Actually I do.
His father's asking about him.
Complete cervical cord injury with quadriplegia.
His neck snapped during an intubation.
Performed by whom?
Me.
I'm sorry.
You okay? Yeah.
Hey!
Hey! Taxi!
Hey! Taxi! Hey!
Greg? Unlock the door.
Hi. If I'd known you were coming,
I would've stayed downstairs.
Come on, let me help you out.
You all right?
Yeah, it's just a rough day, that's all.
You know, it's been good with you.
Very good.
Yeah, it has.
( chuckles )
Look, I got four days off next week.
How about I come out to DC,
we hang out, have a good time?
That's sweet.
I'm serious.
I'm sure you are, but...
But what?
( sighs ): Greg, it's been fun--
you know, a total blast,
but...
this has been like being on vacation for me,
you know?
What?
Hmm?
( engine starts )
Bye, baby.
He needed to be reminded.
No chips?
Carrot sticks are better for you.
I got this. Thanks.
Yeah, look, uh, he told me what he did.
Really?
Uh, I just wanted you to know
that I didn't show him how.
I know. I did.
Didn't think he'd ever try it.
I guess that wasn't, uh, such a good idea.
I'm trying to call Sharon,
see if she'll pick you up and baby-sit,
but I haven't heard from her yet.
( sighs ): Okay.
Eat.
She's, like, wigging out over nothing.
Hey, just do as your mother says, okay?
( annoyed scoffing )
Did he seem okay to you?
( chuckles ): Yeah. Why?
Just, it's really hard,
doing it all by yourself, you know?
I, I mean, I try, I really...
Come on, you're doing great.
Sure, that's why everyone says my kid's a freak.
People talk-- so what?
I stuck tweezers into an electrical socket
when I was his age.
I knew better, but I did it anyway.
Then why'd you do it?
Because I was a kid.
Kids do stupid things sometimes.
You think maybe he needs...?
Hey, he'll be fine.
Severa, where's Mrs. Webster?
Who?
Older black woman, wanderer.
She finally go up to Cards?
Had to park her in the hall.
Morgue hasn't come to get her yet.
Didn't think she was your patient.
She wasn't.
( sighing )
Damn.
16-year-old male, multiple GSWs to chest and abdomen.
Talking in the field, but lost his pulse en route.
Is he a gang kid?
Whatever happened to just playing cops and robbers?
Two dead, another one on the way.
CARTER: Open up!
Trauma Two's clear.
Hey, Luka, I got another one coming in behind me.
Gallant, Sheila, Lester, go with Carter.
Neela, stay with me.
Where do I go? They need more hands in Two.
Nine-year-old caught in the crossfire.
Shotgun wound to the left arm.
Pressure's steady at 92/64 after a liter.
Sam, prime the rapid infuser.
What's your name, big guy?
David. Don't be scared, David.
Dr. Kovac is one of the best here.
Martin.
Your dad's going to be okay.
I need to talk to you about your intubation.
There was, uh...
a problem involving your spinal cord...
...and it seems as though you're going to be paralyzed.
Uh...
GALLANT: V-tach!
CARTER: All right, let's shock him once before we cut.
200. This guy's got an entrance wound
for every two years of his life.
Missed one on the right axilla. Charged.
Clear. Clear.
There's no change. All right, give me the ten blade.
Two units of O-neg infusing.
Suction.
Rib-spreader.
Okay.
All right, everybody, watch your feet.
All right, four units of O-neg,
then type-specific.
Abby, you want to come around here and do internal compressions?
The most survivable lesion
is myocardial penetration with tamponade.
Heart's empty.
All right. Satinsky.
You want FFP, too? Mm-hmm.
Why FFP?
'Cause you get a dilutional coagulopathy
after five units.
Aorta is
cross-clamped. Big hole in the left ventricle.
Let's plug it with a foley.
30 cc balloon.
Oh, that'll work?
Paramedics said he had a pulse in the field.
Ah, it's worth a try.
50 mikes
of Fent. He's out.
Vascular stuck in the O.R. with a Fem-pop.
It'll be a while. He doesn't have a while.
The longer we wait, the greater loss of arm function.
Get me a vascular clamp. From where?
Thoracotomy kit.
Neela, I'm rolling back with pressure.
When you see the end of the artery,
press down hard with your finger
right on the pumper.
Have an O silk stitch ready
on a driver. Wound's down
through the biceps. I see humerus.
Can a vascular clamp repair that?
It's our best shot.
If the arm is ischemic too long,
we'll have to amputate.
CARTER: All right, hold compressions.
V-fib. Charge to 30.
Clear. No, you're going to let go of the foley.
No, no, it won't conduct.
Still fib. Shock again?
No. Resume compressions--
hold this-- and give me a ten blade.
The heart won't respond to defibrillation
until you've restored volume until it's full.
So what are you doing now?
Um... it's called a clamshell incision.
He must be bleeding in the right chest.
Six units in so far.
Keep 'em coming.
RASGOTRA: Got it.
Clamp.
Push with the pad and get me
some IV tubing.
I'll tie the proximal end; you do the distal.
Purse-string it with O silk.
Is that going to hold a high-pressure artery?
Just a bridge until Vascular can do a real repair.
And this won't clot off?
By then he'll be in the O.R.
Releasing proximally.
A little oozing.
Nails are pinking up.
RASGOTRA: Palpable radial and ulnar pulse.
Didn't think you could do that.
Fine V-fib.
Been five minutes since the last epi.
Okay, push another amp.
Clear.
Asystole.
Another mig of atropine.
Is the heart filling? Yeah,
after eight units packed cells, two FFP
and ten of platelets.
( sighs )
Pretty big mess.
Can't say we didn't try.
I'll get Housekeeping on it.
I'm glad you went back.
To med school?
Yeah, me, too.
Never should've left.
Well... timing is everything, right?
( chuckles )
What?
Nothing.
What?
You seem happy.
Right back at you.
So we're okay?
We're okay.
Good...'cause Kem and I were going to get some dinner later
and I wanted to know if you wanted to come with us.
Ah...
Well... not that okay.
See you tomorrow.
Yeah.
Ready to go?
Alex.
Mmm...
Come on. It's time to go home.
You know, you can bring your car around.
I'll help you carry him.
He's pretty out of it.
You should've waited in the car.
Come on, I haven't seen snow since I was a kid.
Did you arrange for it?
Yeah. Think it's too much?
I think it's damn cold.
( yelps ) ( laughs )
God, it's a good thing I love you.
You want me to stop?
Not necessarily.
We should get going. SAM: Put him in the back seat.
KOVAC: Yeah.
Night.
Good night.
Thanks.
Anytime.
You off now?
Yup.
You need a lift?
I have something to take care of first.
Okay.
What are you doing?
Need to fix my resignation letter.
So you broke into my office?
The door was open.
I'm changing the date of my last shift.
Let me guess. Sooner?
Actually, later.
You want to be a little more specific?
No.
Not right now, anyway.
Well, let me know when you decide.
See you tomorrow, Kerry.
Stay out of my in-box.
You'll have another?
Bring it on.
You come by to give me some more?
Hey, I'll take one of those.
You got it, man.
To tell you the truth,
I'm really not in the mood.
( sighs ): Yeah, I heard about that neck thing.
That's some hard stuff, man.
Look, we got a big family, okay, lots of boys.
Val's the only girl...
so we all tend to be a bit overprotective.
I ever tell you my mom died when I was 12?
No, you didn't.
Well, that's some hard- ass stuff right there.
You have to get used to being by yourself when that happens.
What about your father?
Truth is, all anybody's got is themselves.
I'm not sure I agree with that.
Look... why don't you just say what you have to say
and leave me at peace, okay?
My sister...
Played me.
She played me.
Well, you can't say I didn't warn you.
Mm... so you were protecting me, huh?
Look, anyway, I'm sorry.
No worries.
Okay, then.
You have a good night.
No, leave it.
I'll drink it.
