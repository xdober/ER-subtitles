Previously on ER:
My parents were in a car accident.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Yeah, it happened in some province north of Suzhou.
Um, I'm pregnant.
( crying )
You did it.
We have a baby.
( no audio )
It's nice to finally meet you, Dr. Corday.
I look forward to working together again, soon.
Excuse me. Can someone get the door, please?
( knocking on door ) Get me the hell out of here.
Nice place.
Yeah, it's okay.
( woman groaning )
( groaning, shivering )
( grunting, panting )
Oh, God...
Nolan.
Nolan, wake up. It's happening.
( grunts )
It's freezing.
You turn the heat down?
Nolan, get up.
Rise and shine. The baby's coming.
We'll drop you at Gram's on the way.
Hello.
Earth to children.
You need to get dressed now.
Clay, come on. Get up, honey.
Clay.
Clay.
Clay. Clay.
Clay.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Shannon? Shannon.
( grunts ): Shannon.
Shannon.
Nolan!
( panting ): Nolan!
Nolan!
( grunts )
Nolan!
Nolan, wake up.
Nolan. Nolan.
Nolan? Nolan!

The alarm didn't go off.
What?
It's time for you to leave.
What time is it?
Time to get your butt out of bed. Hey!
Shh! He might be up.
I don't hear the TV.
That's probably why you should get going.
Could I at least get a shower?
( giggling )
Think I found a roach.
No.
Just an old raisin.
Why are you up?
Why are you?
I'm going to that stupid aquarium thing with Oscar.
( TV playing )
Alex?
When are we going to get satellite?
Um... ( changing channels )
we should probably talk.
They have, like, a thousand channels or something.
( changing channels )
Oh.
( clears throat )
I took out T-bones for dinner.
Okay, I'll bring the ketchup.
Ah, over my dead body.
Oh. What time should I pick you up?
Oh, that's okay. I can take the El.
Come on, baby. It's icy out.
I wouldn't want the little Martin kid getting hurt.
Don't do that.
What?
Make assumptions about last names.
Oh, little Petey then.
Little Jenny?
Until my name changes-- if it ever does--
he or she is a Lewis.
Okay, whatever you say, Mommy.
Don't do that either.
Okay, I've got to go. Bye.
Okay, Bye.
Oh, hey, when are you going to introduce me
to your old man?
He knows about me, right?
Did you tell him about the baby?
Not yet.
Don't you think you ought to...
I gotta go. Bye.
Bye.
( distant sirens wailing )
Hey.
Morning.
Am I late or are you early?
There's no point staying in bed if you can't sleep.
Oh, tell me about it. Chuck snores.
Either I need earplugs or...
Separate bedrooms.
You say that like it's a bad thing.
So, is this going to be a rush or depress the hell out of me?
The latter.
It's multiples, all from the same address.
( woman sobbing )
Vicki Bennett, 38 weeks pregnant,
in active labor and fully dilated.
Why is this happening? ( grunting, sobbing )
I'd say your baby was ready.
Breathe through the contraction.
Let's set up a BOA kit and a fetal monitor.
Okay, so, Mom's in labor.
What's wrong with everyone else?
Unknown.
Rest of the family was found unconscious in their beds.
Was the heat on? It's 10 degrees out.
What's the story?
We have possible CO poisoning.
More family members coming in.
HARMS: Need some help here!
Oh.
How long has he been seizing?
Started as we pulled up.
Altered mental status prior.
No signs of head trauma. Is he on anticonvulsants?
Not according to his wife, and she's the only one talking.
Eight- and ten-year-old are right behind me,
out cold at the scene.
What have we got? Looks like relative hypoxia.
I got this one, you take the kids.
Clay Bennett. Altered but coming around in the rig.
Complains of nausea, vital signs normal.
You feeling sick, dude?
( vomiting )
Right. This one nauseous, too?
Complains of headache, good vitals.
Okay, you take the boy. I'll deal with the girl.
What? Hi. My name's Abby.
We're going to try to make you feel better, okay.
( Vicki screaming ) She's crowning.
Where's my family?
They're being taken care of, Vicki.
Fetal heart rate's 105.
I don't understand what happened.
Oh, we're not sure what happened,
but we need you to stay here a while, okay?
Okay, let's get Mom on 100% O2 by mask.
Labs?
No one would wake up.
Neela, labs. Now.
CBC, type and Rh,
UA and ABG with carboxyhemoglobin level.
When an entire family passes out in winter,
we assume it's carbon monoxide poisoning.
It can happen if your heater doesn't vent properly.
But I didn't pass out.
The fetal hemoglobin has a higher affinity for CO.
( grunts ): What?
In English. Sorry.
Don't apologize. Just explain.
The baby's blood latched on to the carbon monoxide.
That cleared it from your body
and it kept you from getting sick.
Does that... does that mean the baby got it all?
Okay, big push with the next one, Vicki.
Here we go. ( Vicki screams )
Stand by with an umbilical line kit
and a pediatric intubation tray.
Mr. Bennett? Mr. Bennett?
All right, we need to get him
on a non-rebreather and draw an ABG.
Neonatal laryngoscope?
Bottom right.
That's six of Ativan.
Okay, push another two. How's Mom?
Lucky she was pregnant.
Hey, Pratt, Morris needs you in here.
Yeah, well, I'm a little busy here.
Well, let me rephrase that: his patient needs you.
Go ahead. I got this.
I want you to hang Dilantin after eight of lorazepam.
All right, keep Dad's airway secure.
What's the problem?
He won't listen.
I want my mommy.
Yeah, yeah, hold on.
Girl with a headache.
Pulse ox 100% on two liters.
I don't have to draw blood gas, do I?
Yeah, you do. I told you that.
But her sats are normal.
Pulse ox measures oxygen dissolved in the blood,
not bound to hemoglobin.
It's normal in CO poisoning.
I told him that, too.
Damn, who's the resident here?
Ooh.
You okay?
Is my family dying?
It just... it sort of snuck up on us, you know?
I mean, I don't...
I don't think either one of us planned it.
Right?
Right.
It happens.
People date.
You okay back there?
Yeah.
You want to talk about this?
No.
He's gonna start breaking down muscle cells.
Open up the fluids.
Come on, man. Enough is enough. Dilantin's in.
He keeps this up much longer,
we're gonna get irreversible brain damage.
So, what do we do now?
Start a drip and hope it works.
How fast should I run it in?
Wait. Wait. Hold up. Hold up. Hold up.
Mr. Bennett, can you hear me?
Carboxyhemoglobin 35%.
He needs the hyperbaric chamber.
No, only if it's over 40.
Or has significant neurologic impairment.
Yeah, but we don't know that yet.
Just keep him on oxygen. We'll give him 30 minutes.
If he doesn't wake up quick, then we'll talk hyperbarics.
( Vicki screams )
Baby's distress probably induced labor.
It's a good thing, too.
Otherwise they'd all be dead right about now.
Fetal heart rate's down to 80.
Why us? Late decel.
Okay, you really got to push hard with this next one, Vicki.
Here we go.
( Vicki grunting )
Good head of hair.
Get ready with a receiving blanket.
What did we do?
Okay, head's out.
Bulb syringe.
One more push, Vicki.
( grunting )
Okay.
It's a boy.
Clamp.
We're good people. We go to church.
Okay, hang in there, Vicki.
Neela, deliver the placenta.
Me?
Yes, you.
How is he?
CARTER: Having a little trouble breathing.
LEWIS: One for color, one for tone.
Zero for respirations.
Something's wrong.
What's wrong?
Starting compressions.
Uh, his heart's not beating all that well
because it's been deprived of oxygen.
What about the brain?
( sobs ): Oh, God.
LEWIS: I need to intubate.
.3 of epi and draw an ABG.
Let's find out how much carbon monoxide he's taken in.
Bad enough when residents can't get in on time,
but when attendings are late,
it sends a message that time is amorphous.
7:00 a.m. is 7:00 a.m., people.
And the minute Kovac gets here, I want to talk to him.
Yes, ma'am.
Stop surfing the Web on County time.
Oh, Dr. Weaver?
Fair warning: Henry's colicky,
Sandy's pulling a 24, and I haven't had any coffee.
What do you want?
Placenta's out.
LEWIS: Neela, 20 of pit.
VICKI: Why isn't he crying?
He's got a tube in his throat to help give him oxygen.
He's got a good strong pulse, and he's pinking up.
Labs are back. Just try to relax.
And I will find out how your family's doing.
Mom's carbon monoxide's in the safe range.
She's 19%.
LEWIS: How's the little hero?
48. Is that coma range?
He needs hyperbaric therapy. What's going on?
LEWIS: Your son has
a very high level of carbon monoxide
in his body that we need
to clear out very quickly.
Kind of like scuba diving.
One way of doing that is
putting him in a big pressure chamber.
Take him down to a pressure
equivalent to 66 feet of seawater; he'll get three times
as much oxygen. Will he wake up then?
That's our hope. Can I hold him?
Uh, yeah, you can touch him,
but the sooner we start treatment,
the better the result.
Oh.
Oh, he's... he's beautiful.
Yeah, he is. Okay, sorry, Vicki, we got to go.
We're going to do everything we can. Neela?
( crying )
Take this.
( sobbing )
You did a NICU rotation, right?
I need you in the chamber with him.
Oh, wait. You're sending me?
Yeah. A nurse will be with you.
They're waiting for you upstairs.
I thought an attending should be going with me.
No. A dive takes too long.
Well, how long? A couple of hours.
Is that a problem?
Okay.
Here you go.
Take off your gown. Put on these booties, okay?
No lipstick, no makeup,
hair spray, nail polish, perfume.
What? They're all flammable.
Okay, remove any watches, jewelry,
electronic equipment.
Do you have any unfinished root canals,
temporary fillings, caps?
Uh, no. Why?
Okay, trapped air in the tooth socket can expand.
Do you know how to clear your ears?
I don't think I can do this.
All right, just pinch your nostrils,
blow against the closed glottis. Let's go.
No. I can't go in there. What, are you claustrophobic?
Is there time to get a replacement?
What do you think? Come on.
All right, hook him up to the vent.
I'll set the clock.
Patient and attendants set?
Go for it.
You're not going to panic on me, are you?
Initiating pressurization.
( high-pitched motor whirring )
Does this stay this loud?
You get used to it.
( panting )
I'm sorry. Can we stop now?
Ten feet.
Uh, do we have a problem in there?
My ear's bothering me.
Take us up two feet.
Hold your nose, blow to equalize.
( sighs )
I'm sorry. Please, can we stop now?
Resume pressurization.
( panting )
You should really be on the postpartum floor.
Mommy!
It's all right, honey.
Mommy's here now.
Everything's going to be fine.
You're not doing them any favors by not taking care of yourself.
How is he?
He's a little groggy.
You just had a baby.
If I can't be with my baby,
I want to be with them.
Vitals q 30 minutes,
CBC in two hours.
Mom's good and cranky.
How's Dad?
Just woke up.
Neuro exam is nonfocal.
Oriented to person, place and time.
Could still have long-term neuro-psychological deficits.
She know that yet?
Ah, no. She doesn't need to.
The girl's headache subsided.
LEWIS: Yeah, and, uh, how's the boy?
He's hungry, wants a snack,
but he's worried about Mom and Dad.
Yeah, me, too.
Any word on the baby?
In the chamber.
What's his pOH2?
He has a name.
Samuel.
Can you make sure whoever's with him knows that?
Of course.
What's the verdict?
Oh, four hours at 100%,
they should all be clear.
The baby's another story.
Yeah.
So, how are you doing with your pregnancy?
Oh, yeah.
Fine. You know, tired.
A little scared.
About having one?
About what happens after you do.
Every winter, it's the same thing.
Is there any sort of air conditioning?
Temperatures go down,
heaters get turned up,
people asphyxiate.
I mean, why does it have to be so bloody hot in here?
Well, when pressure rises
in a fixed volume,
it's going to get warm.
Ideal gas law.
PV equals NRT. What about it?
Okay.
Time to give the kid an air break.
It prevents oxygen toxicity.
I can hardly breathe.
Well, too much, and he could seize.
How much longer?
Uh, hour, 40.
( rapping on window ): Neela?
Yeah?
His name's Samuel.
Sorry?
The baby. The mom wanted you to know.
How are you doing?
Fine.
Okay, good.
I'll see you in a couple hours.
( panting )
CORDAY: Kerry,
I examined Mrs. Krall, and she won't require surgery.
She passed her kidney stone half an hour ago.
She wants to turn it into a brooch.
I'm sorry. What?
Okay, let me guess.
Henry has colic, and you're barely sleeping.
Yeah. Did Ella have it, too?
Terrible teething.
It's no cakewalk now, though.
Uh, tantrums,
a constant demand for toys, refusing to eat.
I hate to say it, but, uh, in some ways,
it gets harder.
Yeah, must be twice as hard by yourself.
You have any prospects?
Uh...
I met a teacher recently.
He's a nice man.
Nice is good.
Yes, it's nice.
Okay, open up.
All right, there you go.
Oh, with a minute to spare.
That's me,
punctual.
Dad says she has strep.
Later.
It's been going around her school.
Okay, let's see.
Ooh.
101.7.
You have a fever, young lady.
Anything else, stuffy nose?
No, it's just my throat.
Okay, let's have a look.
Oh.
Looks pretty red.
A doctor's going to want to take a culture.
How long's that going to take?
Oh, waiting room's pretty packed.
Six to eight hours.
Look, I just started a new job...
It'll be okay, Daddy.
Why don't you two take a seat,
and we'll call you back as soon as we can?
Okay, thanks.
You think Alex is okay?
Uh, I don't know.
Maybe you should bring him to my place tonight.
We can talk more,
watch something on the big screen.
I'm not sure.
I'll cook.
WOMAN: This where I sign in?
Uh-huh.
Can we talk about this later?
'Cause I need to get back to work.
How can I help you today, ma'am?
WEAVER: Kovac.
Morning, Kerry.
Guess I should be grateful
it's not afternoon.
You're late, which makes me late for a budget meeting.
Look for the deduction in your paycheck.
Could be worse.
She could have an M16 strapped on.
What's this?
Oh, place across the street
does dry ice shipments.
It's a prenatal care package for Kem,
plus some stuff that they, uh, need at the clinic.
Sus-phrine, terbutaline...
Yeah, I hear they're really desperate
for roses in the Congo.
How long has it been?
Since we've seen each other?
34 days.
16 hours,
12 minutes.
But we E-mail each other.
She says she's really starting to show.
All right.
See you later.
Would you hand me a tissue?
He really misses her.
( sirens wailing )
Married 36 years.
He gave my mom flowers every anniversary.
Swore he loved her till the day she died.
That sounds sweet.
'Course he loved his girlfriends, too.
( sirens wailing ) They just had you and your sister?
Yeah. Both raised by crazy people.
Couldn't have turned out more differently.
MAN ( muffled ): Let go of me.
I guess they did the best they could.
Yeah. That's the scary part.
20-something John Doe,
found down behind a building.
Just let go of me, please.
Where is all this blood coming from--
GSW, knife wounds?
None that we found,
but he wouldn't exactly let us check.
Fistfight maybe?
The other guy won. Just let me go, please!
Altered and agitated.
Tachycardic at 128, BP: 160/92.
Got to be on something heavy-duty.
( grunts )
I hate your guts!
66-year-old male,
acute shortness of breath,
febrile, sats 94%.
I'm on my way out. Sorry.
Bed-bound secondary to a pelvic fracture.
Deb?
Hey, Carter.
Hey, how are you? When did you get back?
Last week. I couldn't leave China
until my father was stable enough for transport.
I'm sorry to hear about your mom.
Yeah, she had a fatal PE,
and now my dad's got pneumonia.
Been taking care of him at home.
With nursing care?
No. He doesn't want anyone else
in the house. It's been hard.
Hey, Deb. Deb, how are you?
Hey, Jerry. Hi.
Hey, Dr. C, good to see you.
Hey, Malik. Are you all right?
Yeah.
Hey, Dr. Chen.
Okay.
Sorry. What's the problem again?
My grandson is coughing too much.
I need to see Dr. Weaver.
Uh... she's not in.
My daughter said to have her check him.
Ma'am, he'll be seen by a doctor,
but I can't guarantee you which one.
( speaking Spanish )
Mira,
Sandy and Dr. Weaver--
they live together.
Oh.
It's evil!
You hear me?!
Found a meth pipe.
Want to guess what the tox screen's going to say?
Uh, still do a full workup.
He could just as easily be that way from a head bleed.
It's everywhere.
It's everywhere!
You want hard restraints?
Try Ativan first.
No free fluid.
Morrison's is clear.
No signs of trauma.
Where's the wound? LEWIS: What?
I can't finding anything.
Nothing, not a scratch.
It's demons!
It's demons all around us.
Hematocrit's normal.
So, he's not bleeding
internally or externally.
Let's hope he works at a meat-packing plant.
GALLANT: Hey, Dr. Lewis, you got a minute?
Yeah, uh. You know what?
Call the cops in case he doesn't.
What's up?
Nancy Natarelli, 42,
with nausea, vomiting and fatigue
times two weeks.
She's afebrile, normal vitals,
lungs clear, abdomen soft, uh, no CVA tenderness.
Her meds include kali phos and, uh, arsenicum.
Homeopathic stuff.
Oh, I got five kids at home.
I can't be sick like this.
That's a lot of diapers.
Who are you telling?
Had three of my own already.
These five are theirs.
You're pretty young to be a grandma.
You think it's the side effects from the Saint John's Wort?
It's probably just a stomach virus,
but we'll run some tests to make sure.
So, why are you taking it?
Are you depressed?
Just thought I'd be done raising kids by now.
Okay, we'll be back.
CBC, chem panel, UA?
Could be pyelo.
Uh, yeah, and run a psych history,
and make sure she's not clinically depressed.
All right.
Dad's coming around. Okay.
He's okay.
All right, Vicki, you need to get back to your bed
and put your mask on.
He's talking and everything.
That goes for you, too.
How are you feeling, Mr. Bennett?
Headache.
What happened?
Uh, do you know what today is?
Wednesday?
Vicki said that
the baby saved our lives.
Uh, yeah.
He did.
Is he going to be okay?
( breathing shallowly )
You're not making it go any faster staring at it.
Why do they have to make these chambers so small?
Been in smaller.
Hey, we're over halfway there, okay?
Relax.
Please, don't say that.
You have no idea how hard this is for me.
You want Valium? What?
Calm your nerves.
No, I just...
I need to get out of here. Wait a minute.
He's stable now. He'll be fine. I know, but just...
If I don't get out of here,
I'm going to lose it. Do you understand?
Uh, problems?
I'm stepping into the air lock. Bring me up.
Well, are we okay with this?
Yeah. Get Dr. Olivera to take her place.
( panting )
Yeah, lucky for you, it's easier
going up than going down.
Hurry, please.
Ascending.
( alarm beeping )
Tachycardia, heart rate's 180.
Is the other doctor en route?
Yeah, I paged him.
Breath sounds decreased on the left.
P waves, not SVT.
He's got a pneumothorax.
Uh, 40 feet.
Do you need a surgeon in there?
No, we need to reinflate his lung.
( alarms beeping ) Pulse is weak and thready.
( sighs )
Bring me back down.
Descending.
Open the crash cart and prep the chest.
PVCs. Are you coming back in?
Just until the other doctor arrives.
60 feet.
Ow!
My ear...
It's bleeding.
You perfed your eardrum.
Don't worry. It grows back.
Come on.
We're at depth.
( panting heavily )
( panting loudly )
He's got a subtle right middle lobe infiltrate.
Sure makes me appreciate our healthcare system.
Had to wait a week for a chest film in Suzhou.
Low-grade fever.
It's probably just early pneumonia.
Or pulmonary embolus.
Can he get a VQ scan?
Doesn't need one.
D-dimer's negative.
He's low probability for PE.
Does he, uh, walk at all?
He can, but he won't,
and I can't make him.
Since his surgery, he's been depressed,
a bit demented.
Hmm.
Just stares at the TV.
So, what happened?
They skidded off some back road in the middle of nowhere.
Car flipped.
My mom never regained consciousness.
Jing Mei?
I'll let you two get caught up.
Thank you, John.
What's going on?
Um, I'm having my dad checked for PE.
When did you get back?
Um, last Monday.
You should have called.
How are you, Mr. Chen?
( speaking Mandarin )
( speaking Mandarin )
Ah.
Maybe the ET tube's just down too far.
No, with tracheal shift, it's a tension pneumo.
Give me a 22 gauge.
Are you all right in there?
Alcohol wipe. Are you sure that you're up for this?
Where the hell is Dr. Olivera?
Coming in.
Finally.
There.
How's the heart rate?
( alarms beeping ) Back down to 128.
He needs a chest tube.
You start.
I'll get there as soon as I can.
Five centimeters of water on the thoraseal.
Perfect.
LEWIS: Sleeping like a baby now.
No sense in keeping him in here.
Pupils are four millimeters,
equal and reactive,
and he has beautiful irises.
Can you move this guy to Sutures?
Sure thing.
Yeah, just wait till he comes to,
and realizes we took his crystal meth pipe.
Won't be so cute then.
And Malik, you have a standing order
for five of Haldol.
You got it.
Thanks.
You think he'll be able to tell us
what happened to him?
Doubt he'll remember.
It's sad.
What?
He's somebody's kid.
Morris, I got a call that my son was here?
Yeah, he's in Curtain One.
He's really cute.
Florina?
He just wouldn't stop coughing.
Hi, baby.
Handsome boy, Kerry.
Thanks.
He's eating okay.
But he was very uncomfortable.
I checked his ears.
They are fine, and lungs are clear.
Belly's soft.
It's probably just a cold.
Come here, baby. Come here.
Go with Mama.
Yeah, yeah.
I appreciate you keeping them company.
Right. Uh, nice to meet you.
Pleasure.
He was a very helpful man.
All right, Grandma needs to get you home.
There's too many germs in this place.
Just, uh, keep the humidifier on.
Mm-hmm, okay.
And-and give him some Tylenol if he gets fussy.
But what you really need
is some sleep, sweetie.
Yes.
Will you be home late again tonight?
Probably not.
He yours, Dr. Weaver?
Yup, all 16 pounds of him.
Oh, sweet.
There's my...
There's my guy...
Severa, how much morphine did you give Dolly Zuzich?
12 milligrams.
Hey, you seen that little girl's father?
She's not with them?
No. Came in with her dad.
Hmm.
Christy, where's your dad?
Um, he's coming right back.
When?
After work.
He just leave you here?
I'm okay.
Come on. Let's get you inside.
15 blade, fifth intercostal.
Hate doing procedures on infants.
Getting more tachycardic.
20 seconds.
Kelly. Stay superior to the rib.
What? You'll have to speak up.
Into this pleura.
Keep your pinky in the tract
so you don't lose it.
Inserting tube. Trachea's midline.
I can't thread it in. I can't see.
Wipe my brow. What?
Wipe my brow!
( sighs )
We're equalized.
I'm here.
I'm in.
3-0 silk.
Okay.
Heart rate's down to 110.
( exhales )
Hi, Dad. It's me.
Hey, I put that Foley in Babe Grunhard.
You owe me.
Oh, yeah, could you get 40 of prednisone
to Peenie Sudar in Two?
No, uh, me, Susan. Your daughter?
Uh, what's up?
Well, you know, not much.
I was just calling to check in.
( whispers ): Tell him.
NOLAN: Excuse me, Doctor?
Um, Dad, you know what?
I'm sorry. I have to go. Bye.
You should be in bed.
We want to know about the baby.
I will go check right now.
Here, why don't you come back inside with your family?
Hey, Dr. Lewis? Yes.
Nancy Natarelli's test results.
Oh, young grandma?
Yup. Now I know why
she was more tired than usual.
Positive ICON.
So, you want me to tell her?
Uh, oh... There she is.
That's okay. I'll do it.
Can you do me a favor?
Call the chamber and find out
how that baby's doing, okay?
Okay.
Nancy?
Oh, hi.
Hi.
Is something wrong?
Um, well, that depends.
You're pregnant.
No, I-I can't be.
I-I'm on the pill.
Unfortunately, Saint John's Wort can make oral contraceptives
ineffective.
Oh, my God.
I'm pregnant?
OLBES: Coming through.
Um, yeah.
You know, I'm sorry.
Dr. Gallant can answer
any questions you have.
I'll be right back, okay?
Clara Waskowitz, 50s, multiple stab wounds
to the neck, chest and abdomen.
Don't hurt him. How much blood loss?
Scene was covered in it.
BP's 78 over palp, no sats.
It was the drugs...
Her lung's down. What's open?
This happen on the street?
Nothing. Housekeeping's backed up.
Husband's in the next rig.
Come on. Let's go. But it wasn't his fault...
Multiple stab wounds to the torso.
At least as many as the wife.
Hard to tell who's worse.
Whoever did this must have been really pissed off.
Is it broken?
Yup. That's what happens
when you hit someone with your fist.
( coughs ): Spare some change?
Get a job, dude.
What do you think you're doing?
Oh.
How about you, sweet stuff?
Feed the poor?
Leave her alone,
and get back to your bed, okay?
I'm not talking to you.
I am talking to...
( loud hacking cough )
Get back to your bed. Damn it.
Sweetie.
He spit on me.
You're okay. You're okay, honey.
We'll get you something else to wear, okay?
Let's put her in a gown.
Where are her parents?
Dad left her in Triage, had to go to work.
I brought her back here, thought she'd be safer.
Okay, let's do one better and find her a room.
Good deal.
Hey, uh, I never got an answer.
About?
Well, some pasta, wine, a little X-Box for Alex.
Uh, I don't think tonight'll work.
Tomorrow night then?
Actually, I was thinking
it might be a good time to take a break.
What?
You know, just take it slower.
You know what I'm saying?
Uh, no.
No, I don't.
( sighs )
We're not exclusive, right?
We're just, like, dating or whatever.
No commitments, no strings, no co-parenting, just...
Keep it casual, okay?
Okay.
DUVATA: Sam, Dr. Kovac...
Double trauma. We need more hands.
LEWIS: She's out.
Come on, Clara. Open your eyes.
I can't get the line. I'll do it.
Forget the drugs. Let's tube her.
BP's dropping.
54 systolic.
Suction on high.
Need another set of hands for this neck bleeder.
Bradying down. 53.
Three through the wall wounds to the right side alone.
Gee, haven't seen this much blood since this morning.
More cricoid.
You think the speed freak had something to do with it?
Who knows? 30-French and curved kelly.
Can you see the cords?
Throat was slashed, but it didn't touch the trachea.
I'm in.
Me, too. Mig of atropine.
TAGGART: Left lung is up.
He was pretty bloody.
LEWIS: Who?
Meth pipe boy, and he was hallucinating.
LEWIS: Laceration to the left axilla.
( alarm beeping ) V-fib.
Paddles.
Charge to 200.
Stabbing victim, right?
She a surgical candidate?
Uh, not a very good one.
Clear.
Still V-fib.
The husband's next door. Try him.
Charge to 300.
Clear.
Ten stab wounds, mainly abdominal.
Still hypotensive. 64/48.
Hang another two on the rapid infuser.
Home invasion, robbery gone bad?
Gotta be more personal than that.
CORDAY: Where are you?
He's got free fluid in the belly with hypotension.
Urine dips negative for heme.
Cops said their house was broken into.
Doesn't mean they don't know who did it.
Good breath sounds.
Red line for a open laparotomy.
Hang two grams of cefotetan.
How come there are only men in here?
Ectopy.
Probably ischemia from the hypotension.
Let's do a subclavian.
And keep the blood pouring in.
LEWIS: Clear.
Asystole.
It's been 40 minutes.
And eight units of O neg.
I guess that's it, Clara.
Time of death: 10:54.
Hope this wasn't evidence.
( man shouting )
Look. I guess it was related.
MAN: I didn't do anything!
( panting ): No. Let me go!
Let go!
Look, I didn't do anything.
I didn't know them!
Hey, so, what's the story?
Kid went nuts, stabbed his parents.
Killed one of 'em, right?
Starting to ascend.
Thank God.
You did great.
More like Samuel survived despite me.
No, seriously, you did great.
You okay?
Feeling a little funny.
Are you having chest pain?
A bit.
Abort ascent.
NEELA: What? No.
There's crepitance and subq emphysema.
Probably blew out a few air sacs on the way up. Oh, no.
Look, if we ascend too rapidly,
we could collapse a lung.
So we'd better do an hourlong decompression.
Another hour?
How long will he be under?
At least four hours. Maybe more if we get into the chest.
Make the next two units type specific.
Excuse me, but we need to get his statement as soon as possible.
The man's been stabbed 11 times.
Let him survive surgery first.
Hello.
Hello.
So, what brings you to the ER?
Transcatheter embolization
of pulmonary arteriovenous malformation.
That's quite a mouthful.
And you?
Uh, stabbing victim.
Lacerated liver and spleen,
open laparotomy, thoracoscopy and probable pericardiectomy.
Push the Medical Executive Session until next week,
and tell Anspaugh to contact me
before scheduling meetings
I'm expected to attend.
You think you'd like to go out sometime?
Sure.
Good.
I'll call.
Yeah, you do that.
I thought you were dating a teacher.
I am.
No, prostate cancer with back pain and leg weakness
cannot wait a day for an MRI.
Sign here and here.
Yeah, well, you know what? We're short-staffed, too.
Dr. Lewis?
You got Chuck on line one.
You know what, tell him I'll call him back.
Okay, you know what, you have five minutes
to hire someone because I'm sending this guy up.
Rough day?
Just typical.
Mom's staring at the clock.
You were supposed to find out about the baby?
Oh, crap.
How long ago was it?
Two hours.
Oh, you know what, just tell them I'm pregnant.
Maybe they'll cut me some slack,
and I'll have someone bring Mom down to the chamber.
Yeah, I'll get a wheelchair and take her myself.
You almost done?
Need to check labs.
Uh, can you, actually, use one of the other terminal?
What are you doing over here anyway?
None of your beeswax.
Dawnie Dinovo's asking for a new albuterol prescription.
Labs are back on our orphan.
Positive for strep.
We can't treat her without parental consent.
What's wrong?
I'm okay.
Well, you seem kind of...
Don't read into things.
Excuse me?
Hey, Mr. Grover, you're back.
Where's my daughter?
Isn't it your job to know?
Sorry?
Dr. Kovac examined Christy.
She has strep throat.
But worse than that,
she's been traumatized by being left alone here.
What happened?
Is she okay? She's fine.
No, she's not.
There are drunks here.
Junkies, psych patients.
Yeah, and doctors and security guards and nurses.
She's ten.
She could have wandered away, been abducted, assaulted.
Luka. What?
He abandoned her.
I'm a single dad, okay?
I gotta feed my kid, so I gotta go to work.
What am I supposed to do when it takes six hours
to get her seen by a doctor?
CHRISTY: Daddy?
Honey, are you okay?
Did anybody bother you?
Give her 250 of Pen VK.
He responded well to the therapy.
Oh, my God.
It's okay. It looks worse than it is.
Are they ready yet?
Yeah, they just came out.
Hey. Is this Mom?
Yeah, can she see him?
Yeah. He can see her.
He opened his eyes a few minutes ago.
Hi, Samuel.
It's Mommy.
Spontaneous movement.
He'll need another round of treatment tomorrow,
but he looks good.
When can he go home?
Probably in three days.
He'll need to be in the NICU overnight for observation,
and you'll be in OB.
( laughs )
We didn't plan on having a third.
But thank God he came along.
Neela!
What are you still doing in there?
Possible pneumomediastinum, among other things.
You should've had someone replace you.
Thanks, Sharon.
Hey. Hey.
Bye.
How was the aquarium?
See any sharks?
Yup.
Listen, I was thinking
maybe you and me could do something by ourselves tonight.
I mean, we haven't really had the chance
to talk about things.
Like you and Luka having sex?
Well, that wasn't how I was going to put it,
but yeah, that.
What's there to talk about?
I don't know, how you feel.
Whether or not it hurts your feelings
or pisses you off or whatever.
I'm fine.
Hey, how's the baby?
Oh, great.
How's the rest of the family?
Just finishing disp orders on Dad
and the other kids now.
Oh, man.
What a hell of a day.
It's not even lunch yet.
Only got half a shift to go.
Since when did you become so optimistic? Recently.
Dr. Carter, come have a look.
( woman coughs on computer )
Kem?
John, is that you?
Oh, my...! Yeah.
Oh, my God. How did you do this?
I found out the consulate had a webcam.
Oh, you look great. How are you?
She can hear me? Yeah.
See for yourself.
( Carter laughs )
What do you think?
How come some women have little volleyball tummies
when they're pregnant...
Wow.
...and others don't?
I felt a kick yesterday.
Really?
High-speed MVA with multiple fractures.
Oh, I got it.
What do you think?
I think you're both beautiful.
You get the VQ results?
Normal, negative Dopplers on the legs.
So, no PE.
That's good.
Well, he still needs to be admitted for pneumonia.
Get him on IV antibiotics.
Yeah, but you knew that was gonna happen.
It's common at his age.
Least you're amongst friends here.
So, how long you going to do this?
Take care of him 24/7?
Because, you know, there are assisted living situations.
My father's going to get better.
Jing-Mei.
I was at the hotel, asleep, when my mother died.
She was all alone.
Breathe.
Your breath sounds are equal.
( panting ): I told you I'm fine.
I'm sure you are, but once we're out,
you'll need a chest x-ray.
How much longer?
Three feet and rising.
Come on. Come on.
If it is pneumomediastinum, it'll resolve on its own.
Excuse me.
NURSE: Wait, wait!
Wait!
( panting )
Out of the way, please!
Excuse me.
( Malik yells ) Watch yourself.
What the hell?
( panting )
( hockey game plays on TV )
Regular here?
Uh, yeah, every Tuesday with his buddies.
Black Hawks fan?
Maple Leafs. Don't ask.
Hi, Dad.
I thought you said 6:00.
Ordered you a beer.
Um, there's someone I'd like you to meet.
Oh, he's nuts.
That was not a cross check.
What?
Chuck Martin.
Pleased to meet you, sir.
Boyfriend?
Yeah.
You two had dinner yet?
I'm gonna have a baby, and Chuck's the father.
You're gonna be a grandpa.
They couldn't score a goal to save their lives.
You marrying her?
If she'll have me.
About damn time.
