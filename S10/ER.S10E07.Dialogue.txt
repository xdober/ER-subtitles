Previously on ER:
Morris... you bailing?
Let him walk.
How do you put it on?
Donning and doffing are much more complex tasks.
I want my damn arm, all right?!
I've waited long enough!
Stay away from my patients.
From now on I'll present to another attending.
He's diabetic.
I didn't know he had diabetes.
He's a kid. You're an adult.
You're supposed to be a doctor.
That patient brought you flowers?
And a book. He's a real Civil War buff.
I've been reading it to him.
He's losing his eyesight.
What? You're going to his house?
He has no one.
He's going blind.
No one should end up like that.
CHUCK: You're out of milk.
( sighs )
What day is it?
26th.
What do you want, front page or sports?
Do you ever realize that a month's gone by
without your noticing?
Fed's raised rates again.
And it wasn't bad, but...
it wasn't great either?
Half a point. You know, I should've bought.
( phone rings )
( sighs )
Yes, hello?
This is she.
Oh, yeah. Okay.
Yeah. See you there.
Okay, thanks. Bye.
Work?
No, my accountant reminding me
of our appointment with the IRS today.
I'm getting audited, which blows,
considering I file 1040EZ.
You don't do long form?
Well, I'm single, I don't own anything,
I don't have any dependents.
You want some?
What?
Kids-- instant tax writeoff.
Yeah, but...
Come on, baby, let's do it! Huh?
We like each other, right?
The sex is pretty good.
What are the odds we're gonna find someone better, huh?
Whose stupid idea was this?!
Weaver says it's space efficient.
Yeah, takes a bucket of acetone to erase.
Need a hand with that?
You trying to be funny?
Nope, just trying to be helpful.
You know what? Don't bother, Boy Scout.
I just finished your eval.
You may want to practice these words: Paper or plastic?
Oh, and speaking of negative evaluations, sign this.
What's this? It's a documentation of your chronic tardiness,
your failure to attend required conferences...
I'm pulling six shifts a week, how am I supposed to...
...and yelling at an X-ray tech.
He gave me a lateral C-spine without T-1.
The repeat took over three hours.
That's totally unacceptable and beside the point.
Sign it. So what, this goes up to Human Resources now?
Nope. Stays with me, until I have
a fat enough file to pull the trigger.
Oh, now you gonna fire me now?
Keep giving me ammo!
Oh, hey!
Uh, electrical malfunction.
Only on women? It happens.
I'm telling you, it's not chicken pox.
Hey!
Teen mom-- news flash-- this is not day care, okay?
Eighty-six the love child and stop tying up the phone lines.
Yeah, um, listen, I'm a nurse, and I'm telling...
Fine. Whatever.
The next time you decide to put a marker on your face,
can you do it before school so I can get a sitter?
That means I can stay here?
Only until I can find one.
Now go to the lounge and do something normal, like homework.
Hey.
Hey.
Don't even.
What's that about?
Overprotective mother.
You still on surgical rotation?
No. I start my ER rotation today.
Welcome home.
PICKMAN: Got the whole family here!
Low speed MVA, rear-ended, no PSI.
Superficial facial lac on Mom, sore wrist on the girl
and Dad's only complaint is about his car.
Six grand in body work, easy.
What about the baby?
Found on the floor, alert, with no apparent injuries.
No car seat?
Cries whenever he's in it, so Katie here goes and unhooks him.
Hey, look, we're all okay here.
Is this all totally necessary?
The shock of the accident can often mask injuries.
What are the most important factors when
triaging children involved in an MVA?
Proper restraint use. Glasgow coma scale.
Evaluate consciousness and spontaneous
movement; in this case, the baby's a 15.
KOVAC: Good, Neela. What?
You know this stuff.
ROMANO: Hey, Abby, guy over here needs a foley.
Oh, wait, I'm sorry, you're playing doctor today?
Okay, never mind. I'll find a nurse
who's not kidding herself. Here's one now.
Mom, right? Uh, there's good news and bad news.
The bad news is, my enlarged prostate guy
needs a tube shoved up his urethra.
The good news is, he gets to have you in his pants.
Excuse me? I absolutely, positively
have to take my lunch hour today. I'm being audited.
Didn't know we paid you enough to get audited. You don't.
My meeting's at noon, downtown, so I'll prob...
Great, that is great!
What the hell do you think you're doing?!
LEWIS: What are you doing?!
Cut the hell out!
What are you doing? He just grabbed my ass.
Here, take this to church and have it exorcised.
That's right, you keep walking, right up to the
Nursing Director's office, 'cause by the time
you get there, there'll be a pink slip waiting for you.
Good! Give me plenty of time
to file my sexual harassment lawsuit.
Do you mind?
( sighs )
Yes, I do.
You can have it back at the end of the day
if you learn to behave!
Give me my damn hand back!
Uh, Dove?
Hmm?
That... Is that the soap you use?
Oh, yeah.
It works, works, works for you.
( chuckling )
You know, they-they say that,
uh, smell is a more powerful than-than sight...
has a... has a stronger impact on... on-on memory.
It's true.
Oh.
Gi-Given the choice, I'd...
I'd choose sight.
Could-could do without smelling... dog poop again.
Or-or stepping in it.
Can I get a vacutainer with a red top?
Housebreaking not going so well?
I can do that for you if you want. No, I got it.
Now, it's, it's fine.
Um... oh, and-and, uh, thanks.
For what?
Th-The dog.
Oh.
He laughs at all my jokes and licks my feet.
I think I'm in love.
( both chuckle )
You know, if your didge levels are in the therapeutic range,
you can stop dragging yourself down here.
Oh.
Great.
Yeah, just see your primary physician every three months.
Okay, and we are... done.
Oh. Listen, I, uh, I make a mean tri-tip.
Seriously, I'm... I'm quite-quite the chef.
Really?
Yeah. Would...
Would, you know, would you like to have dinner tonight?
I-I-I'll throw in a good bottle of wine
if it... if it would close the deal.
Uh... sure.
What time?
8:00.
All right, I'll see you then.
A doctor who does her own blood draws, huh?
Only on friends.
Listen, sorry about earlier,
but I got a rule against ass-grabbing.
It's a good rule.
What'd you do with it anyway?
I put it where it ought to be-- under lock and key.
Here. I don't need the receipt.
Oh, no, I do-- I'm going long form next year.
Hey! What the hell are you doing here?
Working.
I thought you quit.
Oh, my dad wouldn't let me.
Said he'd pull the money plug
if I didn't see this thing through.
This "thing" meaning a career in medicine?
Yeah. You want some?
It's 10:00 in the morning, man.
( sniffing ): Hey, you been smoking weed?
You know, my roommate tokes.
Can't help it if the smell sticks.
Mmm!
( sighs )
Katie, knock it off!
ERIC: Sorry about the mess, Doc.
We're med students actually, and it's fine, really.
( baby fussing ) Shh...
He likes you.
Colin usually cries with strangers.
ERIC: When's he not cry?
Seems like a happy enough guy to me.
MED STUDENT: Head sheet, ibuprofen and Dad's good to go.
Oh, he's not either of their fathers.
He's my boyfriend.
KOVAC: Who's next?
Seven-year-old, no medical history,
ecchymosis of left hand.
Full range of motion,
neurovascularly intact.
X rays are clear.
Um, NSAIDS for pain, R.I.C.E. and home.
( baby crying ) KOVAC: Good. Neela?
21 year old female, one centimeter forehead lac,
cleared the neck clinically, remainder of exam normal.
Irrigated the wound, approximated edges with dermabond.
Excellent. Abby?
Full term ten-month-old male, alert and interactive.
He doesn't seem to be on any...
Start with the... the vitals.
Afebrile, pulse 118, resps 24.
No hematoma or step off.
Lungs are clear, abdomen soft,
moves all extremities, but since he wasn't restrained,
I'm thinking baby gram and head CT.
NEELA: A full body X ray?
He might need a screening film
since he can't tell us if anything hurts.
He'd tell us with irritability and guarding.
Trust your exam, Abby.
No unnecessary X rays, no CT.
Um, he already got a portable.
Um... finish the discharge paperwork and send him home.
Dr. Kovac, I have a UTI in Two.
Maybe you're like me-- better with babies than with school.
Got into a fight, got stuck with a shank made out of a fork.
Jimmy, I need to see your eyes.
NEELA: Can I help?
Stab wound above the scapula.
Tell me what you do.
ABC's IV, O-2 monitor and pulse ox.
Mm, that and introduce yourself.
Hi. I'm Neela Rasgotra.
I'm going to listen to your lungs now.
Okay, head's atraumatic, TM's fine.
They handcuff in juvenile hall?
He's 18, in with the big boys at Joliet
for aggravated assault and B&E.
Five to ten, but probably get a few more now.
Clear and equal, no increased work of breathing.
Which means the knife wound hasn't affected your lungs.
Okay, portable chest with a lateral neck
and a set of hematocrits.
Dr. Chen, there's a call from China
holding on line one for you.
Huh, wonder what time it's over there.
Do me a favor: Can you tell my parents, the cat's fine,
and I'll call them later at the hotel?
It's not your folks, it's the embassy.
Um, get him set up for suturing.
"B&E," that's "breaking and entering," right?
What did you break into?
My stepfather's house.
He locked me out.
You still here?
Who's, uh... who's, who's asking?
I'm a nurse. I saw you earlier.
Oh, I wish... wish I could say the same.
Have you seen a cabbie anywhere around here?
I called for one about an hour ago.
No. I can call another one for you.
You okay?
Me? Oh, yeah, yeah.
Blind and getting blinder every day.
Life is good.
FRANK: Sam.
I'll call you another cab, okay?
Got your backup baby-sitter on line one.
She says she's glad you called, she's got pinkeye,
wonders: Can you get her antibiotics?
Great. 50 pounds of pressure
in addition to being waterproof.
Which makes it perfect for shucking clams.
What happened to your other gizmo?
It's being punished for being naughty.
Enough fun and games. Where is it?
You got a stay of execution.
Your audit's been pushed an hour.
Nothing like postponing the inevitable.
ROMANO: Hey, my hand! cough it up.
At the end of the day, provided
you don't try anything with that one.
Hey! Do I need to remind you that I'm in charge here?
You'd have to convince me first.
Hey, Alex.
What's a prolapsed rectum?
Shouldn't you be reading
like Harry Potter or something?
You menstruating?
Hey, look a popped-out eyeball!
( Chen speaking Mandarin )
( speaking Mandarin )
Something wrong?
My parents were in a car accident.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Happened in some province north of Suzhou,
I'm not exactly sure where.
Hey, can you get somebody to cover for me?
Yeah, of course. Are you okay?
Not really.
I have to pack
and get my emergency visa.
I don't even know if my passport's still good.
Do you know any details?
Only that there are no trauma centers in China.
Something happen?
Yeah, her parents
got hurt in China. MVA.
Hey, Jing-Mei!
What's going on? Your folks okay?
I won't know until I get there.
Is there anything I can do?
No, I don't think so.
Come here.
Don't worry, it's gonna be okay.
I got to go.
Jensen's at a conference, Stewart's on nights
Chen's on emergency leave,
that officially leaves us short one attending.
Ankle sprain, med refill, kid with cough.
I'll pick up her slack.
She also had a dislocated shoulder.
And I'll give any reductions to residents like you
with two paws and half a brain.
Elbow contusion,
fight-bite lac. Beat it.
What pleasure could you possibly get
out of humiliating people?
Fun. You ought to try it sometime.
All right, so what'd I miss?
Your calling as a hoodlum.
Here, prison stabbing,
ought to be right up your alley.
If it's any consolation, we all suffer at his hand.
What do you got?
Franny Meyers, 34 years old, brought in by paramedics
with chest pain and palpitations for an hour.
No cardiac history, no risk factors.
Hi, Franny, I'm Dr. Lewis.
Can you tell me what happened?
Nothing, I felt a little dizzy at work
and somebody called 911.
I'm fine now.
Orthostatics were good, and I got an EKG
which was also normal.
Any medications? Nope.
Are you having trouble sleeping?
No.
Do you drink soda, coffee?
Never.
Really? That's amazing.
I skipped breakfast, that's all.
Listen, I have got to go
pick up my little girl from pre-school.
No, you're not going anywhere soon.
When someone comes in with chest pain
and heart palpitations,
we usually keep them overnight for observation.
No, my husband can't do everything, he works, too.
Find her a bed on telemetry and send out for troponins? Yeah.
And have Cards can do a stress test while she's up here.
I have three kids and work a full time job--
every day is a stress test. This is nothing.
Really. Probably, you're right, but we need to follow
your labs and monitor your heart, okay?
Yeah.
You seem to be doing well.
One on one; I'm not so hot in a group.
You know, it gets better. It always does.
You want to get something to eat tonight?
Oh, I have a date sort of.
Chuck?
No. We're at that point where we should be
spending either all our time together or none at all,
and I'm kind of leaning towards none at all.
So, it's a date with someone new?
Someone old actually.
Did that guy's head get cracked by a bat or something?
Sledge hammer.
Really?
No, he slipped in the shower, bumped his head.
He's gonna fine.
Aren't you supposed to be in the lounge?
Yeah, but mostly away from you.
I don't know what my mom's problem is.
I've been in DKA, like, a thousand times this year.
Wasn't your fault.
I better take you back.
Belly pain prior to vomiting and diarrhea,
no fever, no history of stones,
urine dip negative.
Might be the seafood lo mein.
I'm thinking appy.
CBC results?
I didn't order a CBC.
Uh, Dr. Kovac? You didn't think checking the white cell count
on a possible appendicitis
would be a good idea?
I told him not to bother.
No guarding, no rebound, no fever.
CBC is the standard test used in the diagnosis...
For almost everything, but it's useless
for anything else except leukemia, which he doesn't have.
It's also a primary indication of infection
and I have absolutely no intention
of proceeding without it.
Fine, then it was 16,000.
You just told me you didn't order the test.
I forgot to put the results on chart.
I still think it's an unconvincing case for appy.
Exactly my point.
Order a CT with triple contrast to be certain.
Yes, ma'am.
And if you're on a mission to subvert protocol,
perhaps you should clear it through administration first.
How on earth do you stand it down here?
Everybody's so much more agreeable in Surgery.
Gee, why do you suppose that is?
Okay, here's a time-waster.
Transport from Geldin--
stable 12-year-old heme-onker with fever.
The community hospital on the East side?
Otherwise known as a glorified doc-in-the-box.
Who's expendable? You are.
But since you're neither fish nor fowl,
you're useless even on a mindless transport.
Robert... Dr. Corday,
you forgot to sign for the factor eight.
Ah, eureka...
our Affirmative Action hero
and our sultry hand thief.
Go with God, but more importantly, just go.
My kid's here and I don't have a sitter.
That's my problem, how?
The nurses can take care of him in the lounge
until you get back, right, Chuny?
Sure, no problem. Fine, that's settled.
Ebony and ivory can go off into the sunset
and maybe the rest of us
can get a little work done around here
without being stared at.
Come on, honey.
I don't think his mom loved him very much.
Are you on hold? Yeah, why?
Mrs. Meyers wants to leave AMA.
Yes, yes, I have an appointment for today
that I'd like to reschedule.
Mrs. Meyers,
you need to see a doctor before you go.
I can't find my shoes. Someone stole my shoes.
Nobody stole your shoes. They're right there.
I don't know what I was thinking.
Who's going to make dinner?
Who's going to feed the dogs? Slow down.
Who's going to wash the clothes? Slow down.
All right, oh...
She barely has a pulse.
Someone grab a crash cart!
No, I'm okay.
I'm okay.
Have you been in prison long?
Few months.
Busted me right after my girlfriend got me this.
( groans )
Her name's Lila.
She's pretty, too.
Stitches can come out in ten days.
How's he doing?
Still has some bony tenderness,
just on his way to radiology now.
Otherwise, completely intact.
Come on, lay down. Need to make a switch.
Hang on, let me uncuff him.
Let's go.
Ow, easy, man.
Dr. Pratt?
Get her out of here!
Jimmy, it's all right.
Just get her out! Okay. Go.
Go. Guys give me a couple of minutes, all right?
Please.
Want to tell me what happened?
I'm not a fag, all right?
Okay. But you're bleeding pretty bad.
Did they rape you?
Don't come close, okay? I'm cool.
This is serious.
I said just leave me alone.
Okay, so you're refusing treatment.
Just know that you're AMA
and going back to the big house in about an hour.
Now, you let me do the exam,
you buy yourself at least a day here.
One more time, hard as you can.
Anybody seen Sam's weird little kid?
I can't find him anywhere.
Nope. ( groans in Spanish )
Still SVT.
Am I having a heart attack?
I don't think so,
but your heart is beating faster than normal.
No P-waves, narrow QRS.
Has anything like this ever happen before?
No, I don't think so.
EKG tech's on his way.
Supraventricular tachycardia?
Yup, and vagal maneuvers didn't work.
Adenosine?
Six milligrams.
Mrs. Meyers, we're going to give you medicine
to try and convert your heart back to a normal rhythm.
When we do, we'll be better able to find out
why this is happening.
All right, I'll be back to administer it.
Nice assessment. Thanks.
You never compliment me like that.
Like what?
"Nice assessment."
I do. No, you don't.
I don't? No.
I give you my time,
which is the highest form
of a compliment.
( whirring )
Out of the way. Out of the way. Shoo.
What's the weirdest thing
you've ever taken out of somebody's body?
Prednisone for five days
and benadryl for itching, okay, Mr. McPhee?
Like a real long tapeworm?
Worse.
Can you get a knee immobilizer for the LOL in Three?
Yes, Doctor.
A gerbil?
Look, Alex, I really need to work now.
Go back to the lounge, okay?
Chuny, the rule-out appy guy's eating?
Mr. Persky? He's on his second tray.
Okay, Mr. Persky, time to go home.
Let me just sign these discharge papers...
What about the CT Corday wanted?
He's past the common age for appy,
he's not getting any sicker and he's got an appetite.
I thought you said it was appendicitis.
Not if you can stomach that much hospital food.
Yeah, but there was progression of pain, there was tenderness.
Could be an unusual presentation.
Sure, once in a million cases.
Kovac, Radiology wants you upstairs.
Your tibia fracture lady
is agitated.
Mr. Persky, if you experience any vomiting,
fever or worsening belly pain, come back.
Otherwise, have a nice day.
Where are you going now?
X-ray. Can I come?
No. The lounge, go.
Hey, Chuny, need you to get me an attending for a rape exam.
We use the same kit on men that we do for women, right?
I can do it when I get back from radiology.
No, thanks.
A guy can get raped?
( sighs )
Dr. Romano, you got a minute?
I've got ten patients of my own
and six med students I'm avoiding like the plague,
does it look like I have a minute?
I need you to do a rape kit.
Didn't see anything on the board.
Came in with a knife wound, he didn't tell us at first. He?
The prisoner you gave me earlier.
He has some rectal bleeding.
Oh. Well, uh...
You go ahead, I'll sign off on it.
No, per legal, an attending's
supposed to do all the rape exams.
It'll be our little secret.
Hey, wait a minute. Wait a minute.
You're always all over me
for this, that and the other protocol,
and now you want me to do a procedure...
All of a sudden you're Mr. By The Book?
This is not a stretch for you, Pratt.
Just do it, break the rules. You're good at it.
A coffee break, imagine that.
You guys from County?
Yes, sir.
12-year-old with acute myeloid leukemia,
spiked a fever to 102.
It's probably just a cold,
but since she's neutropenic,
she needs admission somewhere till her culture's negative.
You don't have a pedes floor? Mm-mm. Budget cuts.
Chest X-ray's clear,
UA's negative, got two grams of ceftaz.
Her parents here?
Yup, brought her over from Ann Arbor
for a concert,
celebrate her successful bone marrow transplant.
Girl started feeling sick so they drove her
to the nearest hospital, which was us.
Thought you said she just had a cold.
I'm Dr. Gallant from County.
She didn't look like this earlier.
Michelle, can you hear me?
Last vitals were two hours ago.
They said she was just sleeping.
Give me an oxygen mask.
She was fine, she was satting at 100%.
Can't get a good pulse ox through this much nail polish.
No, a pedes mask!
We don't have them.
She should've been on a monitor.
Mix some ox and gent, and hang another liter. She was stable.
Yeah, well, now she's septic. We need volume.
Here, catch.
Will someone please tell us
what the hell is going on?
She might have a blood infection
and her chemo weakened her ability to fight it.
Sat's only 81.
Okay, help me get her onto the gurney.
Gallant...
I need to explain the risks of transport.
Gallant, I need to talk to you.
There's a chance of mechanical problems in the ambulance
or worsening of her condition.
Now, Doctor. I need to speak with you.
She's not stable.
You need to stay here or tube her before we go.
She has a strong pulse, we have her on O2.
I say we scoop and run.
She only has about 20 minutes before she stops breathing.
County is 15 tops.
Look, if I can't get her tubed, there's no backup here, none.
Okay, let's go.
We're going code three.
What does that mean?
That means your daughter's very sick,
we need to get her to a trauma center as soon as we can.
Can we ride with her? No, not enough room.
We're headed to County.
Gallant, consent.
Sign here.
ABBY: Well, your heart rate's back to normal,
which means the adenosine worked.
Did you get in touch with your husband?
Yeah. He's picking up the kids.
Well, that's one less thing for you to do, right?
( sighing ): Yeah.
You should try to get some rest.
I can't.
Uh... I lied.
I... I don't sleep much at all.
Really?
Do you think that's weird?
I don't even know anymore.
I think...
( chair rolling )
I think, with three kids it's pretty hard to do...
without some help.
Do you have any help?
A nanny?
Uh... ( laughs ) no.
No, I mean... for energy.
Are you taking anything or drinking anything
to... give you a little lift?
Because, Franny, if you are taking something,
it could be doing serious damage to your heart.
Another mom I know gives it to me.
It's the only way that we can get things done.
Uh...
please...
don't tell my husband.
Okay.
I'll be right back.
LEWIS: Ah... an hour and counting.
Do you think the IRS flagged me because I worked in two states?
Soccer mom uses crystal meth.
What?
You heard me.
Did she just tell you out of the blue?
No, I asked.
Somebody help us! We were just here.
What happened?
He fell asleep on the way home and now he won't wake up.
They came in with an MVA this morning.
They were cleared and discharged.
Any vomiting?
No, no, but he's- he's-he's not right.
You must've missed something.
Okay, come on.
( utensils clattering )
LOCKHART: Pupils are equal and sluggish.
RASGOTRA: He's hypertensive, 110 over 82.
Miller two and a 4-0 ET tube.
What's going on?
Sir, we're trying to find out.
Let's get a gram of mannitol when we're in.
Did he get a CT?
No.
Crichoid...
Heart rate's 69.
Tube.
No CT after an MVA?
He just flew out of the car seat.
LEWIS: Okay.
I... I'm in.
Did you check for a cranial hematoma?
For a step off?
Yes! I checked for all of that. He was fine.
Mannitol's running.
What's wrong?
Um, he might have...
had some head trauma in the accident.
It can cause bleeding in the brain.
I'm sorry it wasn't caught earlier.
Okay, let's get him up to CT.
Unrestrained and no CT-- are you kidding, Abby?
Hey.
What'd the CT show?
Parietal skull fracture with a subdural hematoma.
Neurosurg has got him up in the OR now.
How could I miss a intracranial bleed?
It happens.
He seemed like a perfectly healthy baby to me.
And you had an Attending.
No, if I can't trust my clinical skills,
I might as well go home
because the book stuff is not going that great either.
Look, when I get back,
we'll pull the charts and the film,
and we'll just go over it step-by-step
and see what went wrong.
It's how you learn.
Need some help in here!
What, did they just forget to tell you she was septic?
Claimed they didn't know.
Dropped her pressure and went apneic in the rig.
Lost the pulse right when we pulled up.
She's in PEA. Milligram of epi
and stand by with atropine. What about your audit?
TAGGART: Third atropine's in.
LEWIS: Weak femoral with compressions.
The trip over did not help.
She wasn't coding. She had a good pulse.
Dopa's up to 20; still don't have a pressure.
I mean, they had no pedes RTs, no equipment.
Figured it was more dangerous to leave her
than to bring her back.
Well, they're a bunch of idiots.
So why didn't you tube her?
Stop compressions.
LOCKHART: Still PEA.
Because she was breathing on her own.
Dr. Lewis, I've got your geriatric boyfriend on the phone.
He says it's important.
I'm going to have
to call him back. Resume compressions.
Come on, Michelle, come on.
Another round of epi. Where are the parents?
TAGGART: En route from Geldin.
Do they know how to get here?
I think they're from Michigan.
She's fixed and dilated.
They better figure it out fast.
Dr. Morris, your pancreatitis is a case of menstrual cramps.
Oh.
Uh, so, perhaps in the future, before you call surgery
you could read chapter one of Harrison's.
Right.
Can you make sure Amanda Knight gets 600 of ibuprofen?
Yes, Doctor. I consulted on that man earlier.
Why isn't he in a bed?
He just signed in.
Mr. Persky's back?
Well, who let him go in the first place?
Doctor Kovac discharged him. Without the CT I ordered?
Mr. Persky, what happened?
He's febrile.
( groaning )
Oh, God.
( groaning )
It hurt for awhile there,
but... it's much better now.
Think he perfed?
Yes. Mr. Persky, when the appendix bursts
it releases pressure, which abates the pain.
Unfortunately, it also releases fecal matter into the belly,
requiring us to operate on you.
Like under anesthesia?
Yes.
Uh-uh. My mother died that way.
No anesthesia.
During your surgery?
Yes. Going under's what killed her.
CORDAY: Right.
Okay, well, let's take Mr. Persky upstairs
and prep him for surgery.
I'll be right there.
COOP: Where are you going?
Oh, I'm going to find Dr. Kovac.
LEWIS: Stop compressions.
LOCKHART: Asystole.
Resuming compressions.
Should we try transcutaneous pacing?
How long has she been down?
42 minutes.
Okay, Gallant.
Gallant?
Time of death-- 15:37.
LEWIS: There's only so much responsibility you can take
for what happened.
You didn't give her cancer.
So how come that doesn't make me feel any better?
LOCKHART: Those the parents?
Yeah.
Gallant?
I'll tell them.
( knocking at door )
Is it all right if I come in?
Sorry it's taking so long.
Dr. Pratt's been tied up.
But then I suppose you don't mind the delay.
Will you report what happened?
I never said anything did.
Because maybe you could be transferred to another facility,
someplace safer for you.
There's no shame in this.
No one's going to think less of you for it,
not me, not your girlfriend.
I don't have one anymore.
I'm the girl now.
Jimmy...
Can you leave me alone?!
ELOISE: No! It's going to hurt my baby!
Eloise, you have a broken leg. You need to settle down. No! No!
Give me five of haldol.
No! It's going to hurt my baby!
Please! No! No! No!
( sobbing hysterically )
I don't... I don't want my baby...
I don't want my baby... to do...
( calming ): to do...
drugs.
Did you kill her?
No.
Send her up to Ortho
and make sure they cast her before she wakes up.
( sighs )
Sorry you had to see that.
Did you get scared?
You kidding? It was cool.
( chuckles )
So what does this thing do,
make you glow in the dark?
Yeah, only after 1,000 x-rays.
Want one?
Can I have one of my head?
Is it okay?
Long as your department gets charged for it.
( chuckling )
Okay. Lay still, hold your breath.
I understand you overrode my order
for an abdominal CT on the possible appy patient.
Yes.
Well, he's since managed to perforate his appendix
and is upstairs waiting for surgery.
So, instead of a quick laproscopic procedure,
I'll be performing an open laparotomy
with antiseptic wash-out.
That's too bad.
( sighing ): Your actions have made his life and mine much harder.
You know he wants epidural anesthesia?
What do you want me to say?
Neither a CBC or a CT would have been definitive.
Sometimes the best test is time.
You're serious.
He was given discharge instructions
and came back as directed.
The system worked.
Oh, for you, maybe,
but he'll be subjected to a riskier surgery
and I'll miss dinner with my daughter.
Score one for your bloody mission.
MARQUEZ: Can you see Morris's crouper
so we can discharge her?
Yeah, in a minute.
And I need a consent
for conscious sedation for Carolyn Kinaire.
Okay, hang on.
Dr. Lewis. You know, you have to present to Kovac or Romano.
I have to call the IRS and beg not to be imprisoned.
Kovac is not here
and Romano's the reason why I need this favor.
Great, what'd he do now?
I got a male rape victim who needs an exam
and Napoleon's not too comfortable with the prospect.
Homophobe. Fine, I'll do it.
You're the best.
Ready to go over this?
Uh, yeah, I've denied my bladder this long...
Ah, the Helen Keller of County.
I hear you missed a skull fracture today.
Keep it up, you'll be back to code browns in no time.
Hang on a second.
Hey. You.
What is it, Dr. Lewis? I'm a busy man.
Well, now you're one less patient busy.
I'm taking the rape case.
Excuse me?
I don't know if it's a gay thing,
or if you're afraid of two-handed procedures...
What are you talking about?
Pratt feels that...
Pratt is a rabid dog who needs
to be taken outside and shot
before he infects the rest of the staff.
As for my abilities are concerned, I finish what I start, okay?
Okay.
Bang.
TAGGART: Hey, Frank...
Back from your little joyride?
You seen my kid around?
Yeah, I saw him stalking Kovac earlier.
Did the IRS call?
Yes, they said something about penalties, back taxes,
you owing them for their lost time,
and that Hollander guy called again.
Did he leave a number?
Nope, just canceled dinner.
I spoke with Mrs. Meyers.
Who?
Meth mom.
She's agreed to seek counseling,
and social services will follow up.
They don't want to see her?
I told them she's obviously devoted to her family,
takes good care of them.
Be harder to do when she dies of a drug-induced heart attack.
Well, I'm sure this scared her,
enough to get the message, I'd think.
Okay, go with your gut.
Are you sure?
Because it's a bit of a weakness on my part,
not reading people well.
Never occurred to me
that a working wife and mother would be a meth user.
People are capable of anything
when put under the right stressors.
( gunshot )
Need help visualizing the fissure.
Okay.
You want to swab for sperm, too?
No, we have enough.
Help me take this off.
The bleeding's stopped.
The tear will heal on its own.
So is he good to go?
Yeah, right back to the daddy tank
as soon as his discharge papers are signed.
Excuse me, Dr. Romano,
may I speak with you privately?
You're already my favorite. You want people to talk?
His lab work-up.
Why you showing it to me?
Dr. Pratt's on his way into Trauma.
Some test results have come back.
You're HIV-positive
with a CD4 count of less than 200.
That means you have AIDS.
Did you hear what I just said?
Yeah, thanks.
At least now I know it's not going to be forever.
That the guy who got punked out?
Shut up.
He's had a bad day.
Okay, this all looks well documented, anyway.
Gee, thanks.
Baby had a normal exam
and the mechanism was borderline.
I would've scanned the head, but Kovac could argue not to.
It's a judgment call.
Which is why I ordered a babygram.
When you're reading an X ray,
are you using the ABCD mnemonic?
Airway, Bones, Cardiac, Diaphragm.
Wait,
this is the wrong film.
No, it's Colin Tranh, and I still don't see it.
Is it more superior?
Do you have the head CT?
Yeah.
Okay, um, here's the fracture.
And I still don't see it.
It's not there.
Get a social worker and find the boyfriend now.
Right.
Dr. Lewis, GSW to the head!
WOMAN: Went into V-fib two minutes out.
Robbery, homicide, both?
Self-inflicted. No time to transfer.
Charge to 200.
Why isn't he intubated?
Because he's a DNR.
That's what I told him.
But suicide is against the law.
He could've flinched and only injured his frontal cortex.
Okay, let's do this. 8-0 tube.
Come on, give me those.
TAGGART: Dr. Lewis?
LEWIS: Stand by with epi.
PRATT: Still V-fib, 300. Clear!
Amp of epi.
He used a gun.
PRATT: Charge to 360.
Stop it.
Clear. I said stop it!
What? I'm trying to save this guy.
A hundred of lidocaine.
She knows him.
Just leave him.
It's what he wanted.
Is the baby out of surgery?
Yeah. I spoke to the doctor.
It went well. Where's his mother?
She's at work. I called her.
So he's going to be okay, right?
Yes, he will.
This is Mr. Sung. He's a social worker.
How you doing?
Fine.
What's this all about?
Well, you mentioned earlier
that Colin cries a lot.
Yeah. So?
Was he crying when you got home today?
Why? It appears his skull was fractured
after he left the hospital.
What?
He didn't have a fracture
when he was here earlier.
So what are you saying-- I hit him?
I don't know what you did.
Did you slam his head against the wall?
Or the floor?
Abby... The crib railing?
I don't have to listen to this crap!
I'll take it from here. This is ridiculous.
Why don't you come with me?
She's nuts! I didn't hit that kid!
I didn't do anything.
Excuse me. You're nuts!
Lady, you don't know what you're talking about!
I didn't hit that stupid kid!
Hey!
Alex, this room's for families
who need privacy.
Come on.
Super power punch.
Quit knocking me off.
Plus it's time to go.
But I'm winning.
Alex, it's late and I'm tired.
Fine.
See ya.
See ya.
Did you make a new friend today?
Guess so. Cool.
Hey, would it be okay if we invite him over
for Thanksgiving dinner?
He doesn't really have any family.
Sure. Okay.
Oh, wait, I forgot something.
You finish your homework?
Yeah, but look.
It's my head.
Dr. Kovac did it for me.
He X-rayed your skull?
Night. Yeah.
Hi.
You going home then?
Yeah, my family's here to pick me up.
Listen, I just want to thank you for everything, okay?
Hey! Do you guys want me
to make spaghetti tonight for dinner?
Uh, Neela,
labs are back on my lupus patient.
How do you calculate creatine clearance?
Weight in kilos times 140,
minus age, divided by 72, times creatine.
Thanks.
Have a good night.
Abby, would you be interested
in studying together some time?
Sorry?
I'm good at the academic stuff, you know?
But you're good with everything else.
Maybe we could help each other.
Okay.
Hey, Dr. Lewis. What is it?
The LOL in two is complaining of nausea.
All right, give her ten of compazine
and make sure she gets a dinner tray.
Pretty rough day, today, huh?
Yeah.
Did you hear from Jing-Mei?
She got on a plane.
Did you send in a blood draw this morning,
check a didge level?
Yeah.
The tube you sent was hemolyzed.
They need another draw.
What do you want me to tell them?
Tell 'em he left AMA.
Time's up. Where's my hand?
It's in the women's bathroom in the tampon machine.
Get it yourself.
