Previously on ER:
We belong together,
Sam, Alex and I.
And Sam knows that.
MAN: You get two
weekends a month...
That's not enough.
...at the discretion of the Lopezes.
I get to see my son at their discretion?
Does that make any sense to you?
Worst thing you could do
is violate the judge's order as we're about to go
into a custody hearing.
Remember that kid
with high blood pressure?
Call him, tell him to get his butt
to the clinic sometime before he's 30.
17-year-old with pulmonary edema.
Elgin?
There's no heartbeat.
Not genetic.
It was just bad luck.
( sobbing )
WOMAN: Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
I haven't started yet.
Okay, little pinch.
Ow! Ow! Ow...!
Hey, you put your schedule request yet?
Yeah, why?
Because Alex this teacher/parent thing next Monday,
and I'm on all week.
I can swap Friday.
Find another nurse.
Can't have one of our interns
changing bedpans during their residency.
Yeah, I'm, uh...
I'm still waiting for my board results.
Well, call the USMLE.
It's multiple choice, for God's sake.
It's not rocket science.
Okay. Ow! Ow!
All done. All done.
( panting )
You are God's gift to nursing,
you know that?
So, Monday for Friday?
Yeah, but I thought you were starting.
Yeah, well, not till I pass my boards.
I can't quit my day job.
Morning.
Hey, I thought you had left already.
Orientation doesn't start till this afternoon.
Figured I'd take care of a few loose ends.
Return my microscope to the histology lab,
hand over supply room keys,
and sell my textbooks.
You know, this is your last day of freedom.
Why don't you, uh, read the paper,
go to the movies, sleep in?
Right, do as I say, not as I do.
You find a place yet?
I'll have a look while I'm there today.
Um, are you a doctor?
No, but...
Yes, actually, she's just not on duty right now.
Uh, I got my hand slammed in a car door.
I'm supposed to get another dose of morphine.
Yeah, if you just wait over there,
I'll take care of that for you in a minute.
Okay.
You need to start referring to yourself properly.
You'll never gain the confidence
of your patients otherwise.
Doesn't feel quite earned yet.
Fake it till it does.
Where did you match?
University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.
Well, we'll miss you, but I hear it's quite nice.
Yeah, AKA-- rich and easy.
Unlike my friend Abby, who's decided to, uh,
stay at County and do God's work.
Just like the rest of us suckers.
Hey, check this out.
( chuckles )
The doctor is in.
Five-speed automatic,
340-horsepower, 5.7-liter Hemi,
V-8 with MDS and ESP.
I'm assuming those are good things.
Man, this is tight. What'd you drive before?
Nothin'. I finally got the prize.
So, you won this in a contest then?
What? No.
Paying for it out of my own pocket.
Not everybody gets money from Mom and Pop.
Really. Really.
Hey, Jing-Mei, take a look.
I'm sorry. I'm late.
So, are you leasing this or did you buy it?
What do you think? I'm still a resident, remember?
Hey, get that beast out of here. This is a hospital, man.
Yeah, which is convenient for you,
'cause if you ding this baby, you die.
Hey, is this the intractable vomiting?
75, endstage colon cancer,
liver mets, fever, and abdominal pain.
I'd better go.
There's a patient I want to check on before I leave.
Okay, give me a call. Let me know how it goes.
Hold it. Hold it. BP's 92/64.
Looks pretty jaundiced.
Who's your oncologist, sir? Don't have one.
Says that chemo wasn't working,
so he signed himself out a few weeks ago.
What about your primary care doctor?
Fired him. I told him I wanted to die at home.
Called 911 anyway.
Guess he changed his mind.
Need any help? Yeah, I do. Thanks.
Hey.
( sighs )
Thanks.
Now, you stay in your seat, honey.
Stay in your seat, sweetie.
I-I-I need you to sit down in your seat, okay?
But, Mommy, I have to go.
I know, honey. Just hold on.
Okay? I think my battery's dead.
( honking )
Come on, lady. Move it!
I think I have cables in here somewhere.
It's okay. I got it.
( whimpering )
( screaming )
Dr. Carter, I was sorry to hear...
Thanks.
Wife says to let us know
if you need her to bring dinner over.
We will. Okay, we've got eye pain.
We've got swollen ankle,
excessive coughing, headache,
gout... You all right?
Headache. Yeah. How is Henry?
Haven't seen him all week.
We're in court today.
Helps to keep busy.
Yeah.
Okay, Chuny, fluroscein, saline bullets
and a wood's lamp all in Exam Four.
You got it.
KOVAC: We need paramedics.
There's a woman wedged
between two cars.
She's awake and alert!
Yeah, State and 14th.
Can you feel me touching your legs?
WOMAN: No. No.
Where's Michael?
Are you having any trouble breathing?
Get me out!
How's the boy? I-I don't know!
The door's jammed. I'll be right there.
Michael!
Okay, help is coming.
Just hang in there, okay?
That guy came barreling through the cones.
It's crazy. There's a first aid kit in my trunk.
Hurry. I'll get it.
Help me get it open. Come on.
( grunting )
WOMAN: Michael!
Hey, hey, where you think you're going?!
Somebody stop him. Damn it!
( gagging )
Temp's up. 102.8.
No septic workup, though, right?
I don't need a workup. I need ampicillin.
Well, we can't give you anything until the doctor examines you.
Now, is there anyone you'd like us to call?
No.
Hi, Richard. I'm Dr. Chen.
It's Mr. Gould.
Doesn't anybody teach manners anymore?
Looks like you're
a little jaundiced, Mr. Gould.
Any advance directives?
Yeah, DNR, but he wants antibiotics.
Sir...
it's entirely possible
these symptoms are due to your colon cancer,
and antibiotics will do nothing to help that.
I'm not ready.
Well, we can try and figure out why you have a fever
or we can just treat you for your pain.
I said I'm not ready!
Okay.
CBC, lytes, liver panel, blood cultures times two
Zosyn 3.75 piggyback?
Thought you were a nurse today.
Abby's a nurse every day.
That's why she's going to kick ass as a doc.
How'd you score on the boards? I never heard.
Me, either.
Ah. Pretty close to the wire, isn't it?
Yeah. Listen, Dr. Chen, is everything okay?
Um, give Mr. Gould two liters of saline wide open,
ten of Reglan and four of morphine once the pressure's up.
Hey. Hey.
Where you been? Pardon me.
Um, I took a few days off.
My dad had ten different doctor appointments.
Nice car, by the way. Wait a minute.
What happened there?
Nothing, really.
It doesn't look like nothing.
My-my dad's not sleeping well, so I'm not sleeping well,
and I forgot to turn on a light and ran into a door.
Excuse me.
Dr. Pratt.
Damn, how many times I gotta say good-bye to you?
I wanted to say bye to Elgin.
He's going home today. Were you planning on it?
Planning on what?
Seeing him.
Yeah, sure. Because he asked.
I get the impression he looks up to you.
Figured he was smarter than that.
I'd imagine he could use
a positive male figure
in his life right about now.
Yeah, well... I'm nobody's role model.
WOMAN: Is he all right?
Don't worry. They are taking good care of him.
Sir, you need to clear the area.
I'm a doctor. If this blade breaks, you're going to catch metal.
Oh, please... Get your ass out of there!
Okay! Just hang on.
Okay, put direct pressure on anything that bleeds.
Another four of morphine and one more liter of saline.
Get me the biggest BP cuff you've got.
How are you doing, Linda?
Need to call my husband.
We will, but we need to get you to a hospital first.
... of saline on the pressure bags.
What's her BP?
108/70. Look, doc, we have protocols to follow,
and you've already broken most of 'em.
Pent her up to ten liters of O2. Let's go!
Sorry, it's just us on the rig.
Oh, please, don't leave me.
You can follow us in your car if you want.
I'm going with her.
Excuse me. Looking for a kid named Elgin.
Down at the end on the left.
Thanks.
Hey, what's up, man?
What's up, Doc?
How you doing?
Good. Just waiting on my mother to come get me.
My cousin's driving.
So, what have we learned from all this?
Five a day, exercise some and find myself a job
at a vegetable stand or something, I guess.
Good man.
Well, all right, then. Take care of yourself.
Yo, Doc, you got an office
somewhere?
Me?
We don't really have a doctor,
so I was thinking maybe we could come see you.
Yeah, look... I just work in the ER.
People come in, I see 'em once, twice tops.
That's it, you know?
Well, maybe we could hook up something then.
The family clinic can help you with whatever you need.
Just give 'em a call.
Tell 'em I sent you.
Stay on your meds.
Guess he just got spooked.
Midshaft clavicular fracture.
That's a dangerous sport.
He's usually steady...
except for that time he refused a jump.
Well, there's minimal tenting.
You're very lucky. This is not going to need surgery.
Broke my leg in two places.
Immobilization, Motrin for pain?
Yep. Month in a sling.
Well, the good news is that's going to heal on its own.
But I'll miss the Lamplight Classic.
Get her a follow-up with Ortho in two to four weeks.
Be right back.
Wish I was that fearless when I was 15.
Is that fearless or is that reckless?
She is fearless. I was reckless.
Hey, look, um, I didn't want to bug you earlier,
because I'm sure you've probably heard it from everybody else, but...
Hey, Taggart, that juvenile delinquent of yours is MIA.
What?
School called. He's a no-show.
Probably just out lighting fires and torturing small animals.
Alex playing hooky? More like his dad is.
Hey, it's me. Pick up.
Come on. Anybody home?
She's got it, uh, pretty rough with him, doesn't she?
Which one, the kid or the ex?
Both.
How are you and Kem doing?
You'll get through this.
Hey, Peaches and Herb,
multiple MVAs one minute out,
including the woman nearly cut in half.
Got control of the major bleeders, but she's tachy.
We need Trauma, Ortho and Vascular down here now!
Thought you were working nights. I am.
Give her another five of morphine
and as much O-neg as you can get.
CARTER: What have you got?
Seven-year-old male, unrestrained, tachy at 138.
BP: 102/56, multiple lacs to scalp and face.
It hurts.
Oh, yeah. I'm Dr. Carter.
We're going to take very good care of you, okay?
Who are you?
My name's Abby. What's your name?
Antwan Coles, 20-year-old driver
of Vehicle Number Three.
Airbag deployed.
Vitals are good, but he's definitely altered.
Think I smell a little ETOH.
How you doing, Antwan?
Need to get me out. No sign of head trauma.
Pinpoint pupils, shallow resps, bradycardia.
Push two of Narcan.
Right here? Yeah, right now,
unless you need some practice intubating.
You been shooting up, sniffin'?
No, nothin' like that. MARQUEZ: Pulse ox down to 82.
PRATT: Just give it a second.
( groans ) PRATT: Come on. Let's go.
You got to back me up, brother.
I'm Dr. Pratt. You're under suspicion of DUI,
and you sure as hell ain't my brother.
( alarms beeping )
( soft whimpering )
I can't feel my legs.
Got a flash.
Am I paralyzed?
You received a lot of pain meds,
and you're in shock.
It's affecting your sensation. I'm in.
Guidewire's ready.
How's she doing?
Pelvic fracture by exam, small fluid in Morrison's.
And hypotension.
AP chest and pelvis are on the way.
Uh, ma'am, I'm Dr. Corday.
I'm a trauma surgeon.
You're bleeding internally,
so we'll have to take you to the OR.
What about my son?
Uh, I'm sorry.
I don't know.
Michael's in good hands, Linda.
CORDAY: Were there distal pulses
before the cuffs were placed?
Ask Kovac. He examined her in the field.
I couldn't tell.
Take down the cuffs, and she bottoms out.
Better wait till you're in the OR.
Gram of Ancef, 200 of gent and DT, if you haven't already.
Why were you in the field?
Good Samaritan.
MALIK Systolic's 74, pulse: 130.
CHEN: Hang another unit of O neg
and get the rapid infuser. You got it.
CORDAY: Page Ortho down here 911.
Shallow resps, good femoral pulses.
You still need the infuser?
No. It's all yours.
Tachy at 165, sats are only 84.
Mommy!
She's right next door, honey.
Mommy!
Okay, I can't get the labs.
He's thrashing around too much.
Belly's soft. Let's give him two more of morphine.
Hey, Michael, we're going to try and make you feel better,
but you got to settle down, okay?
Daddy, Daddy!
Daddy!
He's on his way.
Let's run in a liter of warm saline.
Let's get this mask back on you, buddy.
Michael? ( alarm beeping )
BP's 74/37. He's bottoming out.
Michael! All right, we need to intubate.
4.5 uncuffed, two mac blade.
Come on! What are we waiting for? Let's go!
( Antwan yelling )
Five-centimeter lac over the deltoid.
Must've hit the doorframe
when he was trying to leave the scene.
You don't know that.
You don't know nothing about me, bitch.
Hey, watch your language.
No attendings in here?
Got their hands full.
Urine tested positive for opiates.
Woke up cold with Narcan.
My guess, heroin by nose.
Get a CT, check for bleeding or fractures.
Can I go after that?
Dawg, you caused an accident.
No, an accident is
when bad things happen for no reason.
You were high and ran into people.
Sew him up.
Let the cops sort this out.
( alarms beeping ) Decreased on the left.
This one of the MVC patients?
Yeah. Mom's next door.
Blunt chest trauma, hypotensive, and hypoxic
secondary to a tension pneumo.
How old?
Seven. Let's get an 18-gauge angiocath
and a chest tube tray.
Pulse is 78. He's bradying down.
That's just gonna keep getting worse
till we get this compressed air off his chest.
C-spine, chest, ab and pelvis?
No, he's not stable yet.
Pulse ox, 84.
Okay, I'll assist Dr. Carter.
Ten blade to me. I've got it.
Dr. Weaver?
Ten blade.
You'll be late for court.
I don't need any help with a chest tube.
( alarms beeping ) KOVAC: Good breath sounds.
CHEN: Systolic's drifting down. Another liter of NS.
We need more O neg. Is my husband here?
Not yet. Dr. Chen, can you assist Dr. Carter
with a pedes case? Hey, Ortho's here.
We're gonna need bleachers pretty soon.
And get X ray back to check line placement.
Why? Is he in trouble? No, it's just...
I hope this is more interesting
than the Achilles repair we just did.
Bilateral open femurs, and open book pelvic fracture.
I'm afraid he's too emotionally vulnerable.
Not to mention hypotension,
decreased sensorium and blood in the pericolic gutters.
What, are you saying that he can't...? Do it.
Wow, pretty ugly stuff.
She can hear you. She is conscious.
Diastolic's dropping.
What happened to Dr. Chen's face?
If we move now, we might be able to salvage with a BKA.
Which will be a non-issue
when she bleeds out
from a massive hepatic lac.
Let's tube her, get her to the OR for an ex lap.
No. I want to wait for my husband.
A laparotomy and a BKA.
We're double-teaming.
What's BKA?
What are they saying?
You need surgery.
Oh.
( panting )
( radio plays classical, country, talk, commercial )
WOMAN: ...And receive placement assistance anywhere in the USA.
Don't wait any longer to enter the exciting world of...
( alarms beeping ) Lost the pulse.
Let's PEA. Epi, 3cc's.
Starting compressions.
Lung's down again.
CHEN: Abby, check the thoraseal.
CARTER: That's not it. Maybe the tube's kinked.
Or in a false tract.
No, it's not it.
18-gauge angiocath and another chest tube tray.
That mediastinum's not widened. There's no crepitus.
Holding compressions.
V tach.
CHEN: Charging to 40.
CARTER: Normal heart, no chronic
lung disease. It doesn't make any sense.
Clear.
Still V tach.
Okay, come on. Needle. Let's go!
( air hissing )
Sinus at 58.
Too slow. Another round of epi.
Abby, that Gould guy's asking for you.
Who?
Endstage cancer with the antibiotics.
Well, did you tell him I'm busy?
No, I told him I wasn't going
to deal with his cranky ass.
Come on. Who's in and who's out? You in?
I'm in. I'm in. I'm in.
Come on. .6 of atropine.
You called?
When am I getting my own room?
It's noisy in here. It stinks.
You'll get your own room
when one becomes available.
Don't patronize me. I'm not.
Fever's down.
What do you need?
I dealt with a million smartalecks just like you.
You think you know everything, but you know crap.
Okay. Well, then,
I'll be back to check on you later.
I was a teacher. Junior high. 37 years.
I bet you were the kids' favorite.
Weaver's on Line One.
Yeah. Can you take a message?
She's in her car.
Hi, Dr. Weaver.
Have you called the USMLE for your board results yet?
No, I haven't had a chance yet.
Well, are you going to?
Yeah. Fine.
Fine.
Okay.
I'll be back.
Whatever.
Frank, you have the number for USMLE around anywhere?
Do I look like 411?
Here.
Let your fingers do the walking.
Excuse me, nurse.
Uh, my family was in an accident.
Sinus.
Weak carotid.
It's better than nothing.
500 of NS, another hemocue
and let's get some warm blankets.
( alarms beeping )
Heart rate's dropping. 48. Damn it!
Starting compressions.
All right, epi, come on. Let's go. Mark time.
Michael?
This the father? Yeah.
What happened?
Holding compressions.
He, uh, suffered severe trauma
to his chest in the accident.
His lung's collapsed, and it's compromising his heart.
( alarms beeping ) We lost the pulse.
Oh, my God.
Okay, let's let the doctors work.
Oh, you have to do something.
All right, pericardiocentesis needle.
He's not in tamponade.
I know.
Hey!
( knocking ): Open up.
You're home early.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
We're watching TV. Why?
Because Alex is supposed to be in school; that's why.
Dad said it was okay.
Well, it's not exactly his call, is it?
I'm out of here. Later.
I'll speak to you soon.
Can I speak with you a minute?
You cannot keep doing this, Steve.
You can't just pull him out of school
whenever you feel like it.
Look, I just wanted to take the kid and with me...
You're high.
W-What?
You smoked dope in front of him?
No, I went outside.
I took a few rips when he was watching TV.
And it's no big deal, okay?
Maybe not to you, but to me it is.
Listen, the only reason why I kept him out of school
was because I wanted to take him somewhere.
Where? To an arcade or a movie?
Or your dealer's house?
To my interview, okay? Interview.
All right? What?
He got, like, the coolest job ever.
He's gonna manage this apartment building,
and they're gonna give him a place to stay.
Yeah, it's on Upper Dearborn. It's two-bedroom,
two-bath, fully remodeled.
So now I can live with Dad, too.
BROOKS: The judge will ask questions
about how you plan on caring for him
while you're at work.
WEAVER: Meaning I'm somehow less of a parent
if I have to hire a nanny.
The Lopezes are retired. They're elderly.
They may not be alive long enough
for Henry to get to high school.
And can offer a larger support system.
So now I'm being penalized for not having a big family?
This is a conservative judge.
Her idea of what represents the best interests of the family
is pretty basic: two parents-- a man and a woman.
Unless she's planning to take away the children
of every other single parent in Chicago
and place them with a heterosexual couple,
she's a damn hypocrite.
I don't disagree.
It's a myth, you know.
This idea that there's some perfect setting
that everyone gets raised in.
You need to outline how you're going to provide a stable
consistent lifestyle.
They brought him.
Sit back down.
If you interact, it could get volatile,
and that's not going to help you in court.
He's grown.
( knocking )
You okay in here?
Who was that guy?
He's just some guy who had a business proposition for me.
Look, Sam, just so you know,
I wasn't planning on staying, okay.
It just all kinda fell into my lap,
which makes me think it was supposed to happen.
You know, this manager job is no great shakes,
but, you know, it'll keep here and, I don't know,
maybe I can go to night school or something.
You know what Alex said to me the other day?
What?
He said, "I love you, Dad."
Anyways, um...
I've got a whole bunch of furniture
with a buddy down in Dallas and I figure I leave today,
and come back maybe this weekend.
Hey, maybe when I get back,
you and Alex can help me paint.
Sam.
Okay.
I'll see you soon.
Hey, buddy.
Hey.
I'm gonna take off.
You, uh, you want to walk me to my car?
Why can't I just go to Dallas with you?
Because you got school, that's why.
( groaning )
( sighing )
LOCKHART: Mr. Gould, you have to stay in bed.
Need to use the restroom.
All right, but you're dehydrated,
and your blood pressure is low.
Let me get you a bedpan.
Can't a person die with dignity around here?!
I want a toilet!
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
You have to let me help you.
( groaning )
Hold on.
So, what have I got, a week?
Three days, huh?
( sighs )
Never mind. Doesn't matter.
What subject?
( panting )
Algebra.
37 years.
Taught over 4,000 13-year-olds.
What the hell for?
Well, I'm sure you had an impact.
Oh, right.
And at the end, you're alone, and you got cancer.
I'm here.
Yeah, only because you're paid to be.
CORDAY: More laps and suction.
JACY: BP's down to 78/40.
Ligate the femoral proximal to the popliteal artery.
I can't control the damn SMA bleeder.
Okay, periosteum's shredded up
to the midshaft, and the perforating arteries are gone.
Oh, Dr. Kovac, you came after all.
How is she?
On a scale of one to ten, probably a four.
Repaired the spleen, still oozing from the liver.
( alarm beeping ) Maxed out on dopa and levo.
Make that a three.
Anything I can do?
There's barely anything I can do.
Perry, start neo at 100 mikes per minute.
That'll totally screw up her distal perfusion.
Yes, well, the brain and heart
outrank the extremities, don't they?
( drill buzzes )
CHEN: This is crazy.
MARQUEZ: Atropine's in.
He's got two chest tubes. Hold compressions.
Still pulseless. There's a huge air leak.
He's got another pneumo.
That's his third.
Resume compressions.
He's been coding off and on 40 minutes now.
Betadine and a ten blade. Still PEA.
Another chest tube is not going to fix it.
His injuries are too severe.
Carter, somebody needs to talk to his dad.
Well, come on then, think! I don't know!
Another epi? No.
No.
MARQUEZ: Pulseless.
I'm calling it.
Wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait, okay.
We're pumping air into the pleural space
faster than the chest tube can suck it out.
What are you doing?
I'm going to bypass the left,
and gonna put it all down into the right lung.
He's lacerated
BOTH: ...his left mainstem bronchus.
Resume compressions. Even if he did,
he's been deprived of oxygen too long.
Just give it ten seconds.
Okay, hold compressions.
MARQUEZ: Got a pulse back, 82.
Sats coming up. Okay, call CT surg,
redline him upstairs.
We saved him.
Mr. Pryor?
We think your son has a tear in his airway,
and he's going to need surgery.
But he's going to be okay?
The injury's very serious,
but we hope to be able to fix it.
Do you know anything about my wife?
Just that she's in the OR.
I can have someone take you
to the waiting room, if you'd like.
Can I be with her?
Um, well, she is being operated on.
Oh, she'd want me there.
Dr. Carter, got a minute?
Uh, no, not really.
It's about Jing-Mei.
Can you give me a second?
Can you just have a seat right there?
Yeah, did she seem okay to you?
No, neither one of us are having the best day, okay. Why?
Yeah, well, there's this bruise on her face.
Yeah, I saw it... She says it was an accident, but I don't know.
She seeing somebody? I don't think so.
She's pretty focused on her dad these days.
Think it was him? Maybe. Probably.
Look, I'd get into it myself,
but things are complicated between us.
I don't think that she'll listen to me....
Hey, Pratt, your DUI homeboy's back from CT.
I'll talk to her.
Thanks.
So, looks like in addition to being high on "H"
you were also legally drunk, too.
How you think your boy out there
is going to feel about that?
You know what he says to me? What?
He said 'cause it's my third strike
I gonna have to do 25 to life.
I'm 20 years old, Doc.
You hit a woman and a kid.
Yeah, but life?
What, you think that's right?
I think it's the law.
Hey.
Lido and a 4-0 vicryl.
I ain't got nothi'' nowhere anyway.
I mean, what the hell am I supposed to do?
I don't know, go to school, get a job maybe.
Yeah, right, man.
Who the hell's gonna hire me?
What, you grow up in Winnetka or somethin'?
Cabrini-Green, so I don't want to hear any excuses.
Oh, okay, I guess that makes you one lucky son of a bitch.
Hey. It ain't about luck.
You know what?
You right. It ain't about luck.
I guess it's about not looking back once you're gone.
Doc.
ALEX: Mom?
When are you making dinner?
Mom?
I'll deal with the clothes.
You put all the stuff that you want to keep in these.
What?
We're moving. No!
Come on. Hurry up.
I don't want to go.
You don't exactly have a choice.
I'm not going!
Yes, you are.
I like it here.
Yeah, so did I.
You're just being a bitch.
What did you call me?
I'm sick of moving just because you're screwed up.
You know what I'm sick of, Alex?
I'm sick of pretending that your dad is a good guy.
I'm sick of keeping my mouth shut
about all the crap that he's done
and all the things that he hasn't.
And I'm sick of him tracking us down
every time he loses a job, so he can come here
and buy you enough presents to make you think
he's actually a father because he's not.
He's a user and a loser, and I am not gonna let him
turn you into one, too.
Now get your ass in that room and start packing!
Last one.
Cover with ABD pads.
I'll write post-op notes.
So you saw the whole thing happen?
Yeah, her car broke down.
I stopped to help.
She's lucky.
Most people would've kept on driving.
We've got an audience.
Must be the husband.
I'll go talk to him.
How soon before she wakes up?
That's hard to say.
Mr. Pryor? Yes.
I'm Dr. Kovac.
I was with your wife at the scene of the accident
and during her surgery.
I'm going to check back in with you later.
Is she going to be all right?
She suffered massive internal injuries,
and she lost a lot of blood.
Oh, God.
But, uh, we were able to stop the bleeding,
and we're confident that she's going to pull through.
But, uh, her legs were severely injured,
and orthopedic surgeons were not able to salvage them.
What?
We had to amputate.
Wh...? Both legs?
I'm sorry.
LOCKHART: Yeah, I took it a couple weeks ago.
Lockhart, Abigail.
I mean, I should've gotten them by now, right?
Aren't you supposed to send them to my home address?
You're kidding.
Yeah, I will.
Hey, Frank.
If I received a letter here, would you tell me?
Hell, no.
If a letter came, it would be filed alphabetically
in the mail drawer with everyone else's crap.
As if I didn't have enough to do.
Excuse me.
I'm looking for a patient, last name "Gould."
Let's see if he's awake.
Mr. Gould?
Who the hell is that?
It's a former student.
Hey, Mr. Gould.
Ed Minyard?
I had you for algebra.
In both '73 and '74.
Flunked you because you didn't follow directions
on your final.
Yeah, that'd be me.
What are you doing here?
I teach at Larchmont now.
Math, which is kinda karmic.
Someone called the school, told us about your situation.
I've reviewed all the written testimony,
and I have a few follow-up questions.
Mr. and Mrs. Lopez,
I understand you're both retired.
Yes, Your Honor. Yes, Your Honor.
Can you describe
your physical condition currently?
My wife and I are both in good health, Your Honor.
And a statement from your physician would verify this?
Yes.
Dr. Weaver, just to clarify.
Both your parents are deceased and you have no siblings?
That's correct, Your Honor.
I'll take this under submission,
and both parties will be notified of my decision when...
Your Honor?
I love my son.
Mr. Brooks,
does your client wish to address the court?
No, Your Honor, she...
And I loved Sandy very much.
Kerry, please.
Together, we decided to have a baby,
we chose a sperm donor, got pregnant,
had a miscarriage,
and together, we tried it again.
And that time,
thank God, we succeeded, and we had Henry.
I was there when he was born.
I cut his cord.
We made our way through every cold, every rash,
every colicky night.
We fed our son and changed him and bathed him.
We were a family, whether any city,
or state or country gives us that recognition.
And we still are.
You'll be notified of my decision.
Is that it?
Yeah.
All right, I'll be right back.
FRANK: ER.
Yeah, can I speak to Dr. Kovac?
Yeah, just a minute.
For you.
Hi, this is Dr. Kovac.
Hey, it's Alex.
Could you come over?
My mom's freaking out. What are you doing?
Alex?
Hello?
The surgery said that the lung repair went very well.
He has my ears.
I was hoping he'd get my eyes.
Everything else was Linda.
That's probably a good thing.
You have kids?
No.
Honey?
I'm here, baby.
So is Michael.
He's right next to you.
What happened?
They had to take your legs, honey.
But you're going to be okay.
You're going to be good.
( stifled sob )
LOCKHART: "J, K..."
It's empty.
Look under "N."
For Lockhart?
For "Nurses."
HAMMOND: Doctors' Lounge is on the third floor,
where I'm sure you'll be spending little or no time
if you know what's good for you.
My office is on the second floor,
where hopefully you'll spend even less time.
And in keeping with orientation tradition,
some of our departing third-year residents
will escort you to a local eatery,
where you will eat, drink, and pride yourselves
on having matched at one of the finest hospitals in the country.
So, I'll see you all tomorrow morning
bright and early.
All right, who likes Mexican?
Make sure Dr. Goodman sees me before he leaves.
We need the PPD results from his file.
Excuse me.
Dr. Rasgotra.
Would it be possible to speak with you privately?
Transitional internship
leading to Dermatology, right?
Right this way.
Ha!
( laughing )
Good news? Yeah!
I passed my boards.
Really? Yeah.
Congratulations.
Thank you.
( laughing )
Oh, God.
Sorry, I'm just...
You going home?
Yeah.
Give Kem my best.
I will.
Hey, Abby.
I never had a doubt in my mind.
DR. HAMMOND: So, what can I do for you?
I, uh, I don't know how to go about this, but, um...
I never actually made this choice for myself.
I mean, I told my parents in third grade
that I wanted to be a doctor,
and ever since then, it's been assumed.
Suppose it's a good thing
I never said I wanted to join the circus.
I don't think I can do it.
I've been thinking about it the whole way here,
and for the last year, actually, and...
Are you withdrawing
from this residency program?
I'm sorry.
You're really leaving us in quite a lurch.
What are you going to do, then?
I'm not sure.
You understand you can't get licensed
without an internship.
I know.
So, you got into MIT after all.
What did you always used to say?
"Math is the true universal language..."
"...and love is for suckers."
Mr. Gould, this is Dorrie.
She's going to be taking care of you tonight.
Hi, there.
He's waiting on a bed in Medicine.
You might want to give them another call.
GOULD: Young lady?
Me?
Will you be my nurse again tomorrow?
No, I won't.
Uh, but I will
be here.
Just ask for Dr. Lockhart.
Alex, come on. Get in the car, please.
Alex, please.
I'll get you something to eat on the way.
KOVAC: Sam!
Luka!
What happened?
What's going on?
What are you doing?
Alex and I have to leave.
What?
It's complicated.
I don't understand.
No one does.
I can't let it happen.
I can't let him get to my kid.
I'm sorry.
I don't want to go!
Wait. Why are you doing this?
Sam, talk to me! Hey!
Sam!
Hi.
Hi. We're running low on ibuprofen.
Is that right?
I know it's none of my business...
You know, I was just trying to give him a bath.
Was it an accident?
He doesn't know what he's doing anymore.
Well, did you talk to anybody about it?
'Cause I think you should.
I'll be okay.
Wait. Hold up. Hold up.
Jing-Mei, look, call his nurse.
Ask her to stay an extra couple of hours
so I can take you to dinner and we can talk.
Jing-Mei,
I'm still your friend,
whether you want to believe that or not.
Pratt, cops need you to sign off
on your DUI ghetto kid.
He's medically clear, right?
Sutured and good to go.
ELGIN: She should have been here by now, man.
What time is it?
Just about 5:00.
What's up, Doc?
He get all his discharge instructions?
Four hours ago.
Can't get in touch with my mom.
Phone ain't working or something.
So, you need a ride?
I got the Chrysler outside.
For real? Zero to 60
in 5.6 seconds.
Let's go.
( car stereo playing loudly ) Yo, this is one nice ride, man.
This is the best I've been in.
Hey, is your safety belt fastened?
Like this song right here?
Want to turn this up, bro?
Hands don't even have to leave the wheel.
Oh, how many speakers you got?
Eight with a sub-woofer
and 380-watt digital amp.
Yeah, and you're going to blow them all out,
not to mention our high-frequency hearing.
ELGIN: What'd she say?
The lady wants it down a notch.
Is that better?
( car honking behind ) Thank you.
All right, all right, keep your shirt on.
Hey, jackoff.
Try to pay attention to the road!
Hey, what's your problem, man?
Why don't you get out of here?
ELGIN: Pay attention to this.
Oh, nice.
All right, we're out of here.
ELGIN: See you, suckers!
( chuckling )
Feel that Hemi power, baby.
It's a beautiful thing.
( laughing and whooping )
Do you want to slow down now?
Whoo!
Pratt, slow down.
PRATT: There, everybody happy now?
Okay, good.
Greg.
( screaming ) Son of a bitch!
He's shooting at us! Get down!
PRATT: Come on. Hold on.
We got to get out of here!
Hold on!
Where is he?
We got to get away from him!
( Jing-Mei screaming )
