Previously on ER:
I need a mat. Well, get used to it.
You'll be sliding the hall in socks in no time.
How long are you going to stay?
Kem's going to go back
and see her family for a couple weeks, and then...
come back here and have the baby.
I don't want you to get the wrong idea about Luka.
He's a good guy.
I'm not looking for anything right now.
Okay. I just thought you should know.
Thank you, but independence works pretty good for me...
although I wouldn't mind some regular sex.
They always pray before they start eating.
You have to bow your head and stuff. It's weird.
Just be respectful.
Think about something else.
Like what?
I don't know, baseball, dinosaurs...
cannibalism.
Isn't his mom going to set something on fire tonight?
Bananas.
That doesn't happen every day.
Well, Austin's mom can cook pretty much anything.
See? You're going to have a great time.
Sorry, late start. Hi, Austin.
I couldn't get Max going either.
I'm never going to make yoga now.
Okay.
It's one for my pager, two for the hospital, okay?
What're you going to do tonight?
I don't know. Remember to check your sugar before bed.
You going to see Luka?
Uh, I don't know.
I guess. Bye.
Enjoy your night of freedom.
Thanks, I will.
Man, your sister's hot.
14-year-old female, ankle inversion
stepping off a curb, I'm dying!
probable second degree sprain. I'm dying right now,
every second, dying! Every day,
I'm closer to death!
( all talking )
73-year-old male. Hold on. Past medical history?
On the 14-year-old? Unremarkable.
Was she drunk or high? Does the story match the injury?
Is she sexually active?
When was her last menstrual period?
She came in for a sprained ankle.
Abby, monoarticular joint pain
in a young woman could be the result
of gonococcal arthritis, staph,
or a systemic polyarticular disease.
Or she fell off a curb.
You're a med student.
I don't want to hear "history unremarkable."
This ER visit may be the only time
a 14-year-old sees a doctor. Dr. Weaver?
Get a sexual history. Do some STD counseling.
Dr. Weaver, Arnie Nadler, Human Resources.
Oh, right. Hi. Arnie Nadler. Nice to meet you.
Mr. Nadler is visiting us for a couple of weeks,
advising us on how to have a happy and cooperative workplace.
Ah. Shorter hours, higher pay.
Pardon? Just a suggestion.
I'm very open to suggestions.
I'll be interviewing the entire staff
before issuing my recommendations,
and I would love to pursue this conversation with you
when you have a free minute. Great.
An HR consultant?
Risk management sent him.
He's a mandated part of the Romano lawsuit. Arnie Nadler. Hi.
Which one? Hengstet.
Who? Nurse with the weird little dog and that hat.
Oh, sexual harassment?
Hostile work environment.
We identify and assess high-risk employee behaviors
and implement unique early-intervention strategies
before they escalate into psychological abuse or violence.
Have you ever been in an ER before?
You know, Dr. Romano's gone,
and we all get along great.
In my experience,
all work environments could use a little help,
especially when navigating the twin dangers
of anger and conflict.
Morris. Morris, I'm going to kill you.
I'm sorry.
Here, have one.
Don't put those there.
( grunts )
Thank you.
Idiot.
John?
What are you doing?
I was going to make you breakfast in bed.
Did you lock Emily in the guest house?
No, I gave her the day off.
She's convinced that we're going to burn the house down.
Oh, let's, and then we can run off to the jungle
and live off sticks and berries.
Is my cooking that bad?
Ow!
Oh, let me do it.
Did they give you a hard time about going in to work today?
No. I think Luka's forced everybody
to lower their expectations.
If we show up without resigning,
Weaver thinks it's a good day.
We've got a whole day alone together.
What are we going to we do?
I have a list.
This is everything that I wanted to show you in Chicago
that we haven't done yet.
Oh...
( paper crunches )
Ice skating in Grant Park.
Yeah, that's one.
And the Art Institute?
Yeah, that-that, among others.
So, where should we start?
I have an idea.
Would you get a sexual history
on a 14-year-old with a twisted ankle?
Uh, depends on the girl. Why?
Weaver. I'm used to the squawk,
but she was totally condescending.
Morris, belly pain in Three's been waiting on you
for over an hour. Okay. Hey!
You're getting big. Do you mind?
Uh, yeah.
Do you want to try a dislocated shoulder?
Yeah. Can I do the Hennepin maneuver?
Are you getting married,
or is that kid going to grow up a bastard?
Shut up, Frank.
So, what is going on with you and Chuck?
He's pushing to get married,
buy a minivan, fire up the backyard barbecue.
I don't know. Oh, Dr. Lewis.
How often do you find yourself the subject of unwanted
physical contact at work?
LEWIS: What? Hey, Abby,
can you do a fly-by on a swollen knee?
This guy's demanding pain meds,
wants to see a doctor right away. Sure.
But is tactile contact between employees
something that is encouraged or frowned upon?
How many blonde bimbos you got in this hospital?
Just the right number.
Miguel, this is Dr. Lockhart.
Student doctor, actually.
What's that mean?
It means she's studying all the latest medicine.
That looks painful. How'd you do it?
Fell off a ladder.
Look, I got to get back to work.
What kind of work do you do?
Hang drywall. It'll go away, all right?
You just give me some Vicodin,
and I can get off your plate.
We're going to take good care of your knee
and get you home as fast as we can.
Now, when did you fall? All right, what do you have?
I'm not ready to present.
Knee effusion from a fall?
Drain it, pain meds, and send him on his way.
That's what I said. I haven't finished doing a history.
Abby, we got 30 on the board and 50 still waiting.
We're backed up 18 hours, and this is an easy case.
Come on. Next patient. Let's go.
I'll get a setup for you.
Med students always want to spend an hour
with each patient. It wasn't an hour,
and she was doing a great job.
Dr. Pratt, if you have a minute... Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'd like to talk to you later about that incident with Dr. Morris.
That wasn't an incident; it was a French fry.
How's that feel? Is that too tight?
No, it's perfect.
Oh, I love it...
seeing your whole face.
Are you colder now?
Yeah.
Well, that is what scarves are for.
That and kissing.
This is where you used to skate
when you were a kid?
Uh, no. There used to be another one
on the other side of Grant Park.
My grandfather used to rent it out for us.
All right. Ready?
I don't know.
Whoa, ho, ho, ho!
Yeah?
So, who's us?
My brother and I. Oh.
Your grandfather would rent you the entire rink
just for the two of you?
Yeah, and our friends.
A lot of friends, I hope.
Usually. You know, I wasn't quite as pampered
as I make it sound.
No, of course not.
Whoo!
( laughs )
I still don't see anything.
Once you have the blades fully in,
pull pressure straight down,
and the cervix should come into view.
Can you set up for cultures?
Sure.
So, when did the bleeding start?
Uh, last night.
It's weird 'cause I'm usually pretty regular.
Sorry. Dr. Kovac.
Mm? Vulvar hematoma,
multiple bruises and vaginal tears--
one at least three centimeters.
It'll need suturing.
Lido and 3-0 vicryl.
Layla, uh... there's some vaginal trauma.
Uh, is that from... too much sex?
Could be from the kind of sex.
Has, um... anyone forced themselves on you?
What?
Did anyone touch you in a way that, uh, hurt you,
or that you didn't give permission for?
No.
Do you have a boyfriend?
A... fianc√©.
Dean.
He's in college.
Do you and Dean, um...?
Does it ever get rough?
Well, we get a little carried away sometimes.
How old is that girl?
16. What are you doing tonight?
What? A patient invited me to his restaurant,
and I thought we could go.
Does Alex like Korean food?
Oh, Alex has a sleepover.
Nine victims total-- we're getting three more after they're cut out.
Gus Loomer, 50s, altered LOC.
He's wearing a heart monitor.
Pulse irregular, but in the mid-90s.
How did it happen? He plowed his Hummer into two oncoming cars.
One, two...
What do you want, Gallant? Full trauma panel,
lateral c-spine, chest, pelvis and a 12-lead EKG.
Okay. Add a set of troponins and talk to the patient.
Mr. Loomer, you're at County Hospital.
You were in a car accident. I was driving.
I must have blacked out.
Have you been having heart palpitations?
Uh, I had a heart attack two years ago.
Call Cards to interrogate the monitor
and go see if they need any help with the other traumas.
Okay.
How bad is it?
We're still assessing your injuries, sir.
No, no, no, not-not me... my Hummer.
It's brand-new.
Okay, C-spine is clear.
Can you find out about my car?
Not right now, sir.
We've got three more victims from the MVA,
two of them critical.
Is he stable enough to be moved?
Yes.
What's MVA?
Motor vehicle accident.
Oh. Going to be a lot of crashes today.
It's icy out there.
SAM: He's hypoxic. He could be retaining.
KOVAC: Hang a gram of ancef and update his tetanus.
SAM: You sending him to CT?
KOVAC: No. Belly's benign.
We'll follow his serial crits.
Good day to be driving a Hummer.
NEELA: Sam, we need you to get
the pede's airway box.
There was a kid involved? Mom and dad, too.
Oh... damned shame.
He doesn't know? No, he was unconscious at the scene.
GALLANT: This is the dad.
Lungs down, hypoxic and altered.
We need the room.
Can you move him out?
WOMAN: Oh, my God...
What've we got?
Kathy Shepard. A&O times four.
Breath sounds clear, good radial pulses.
Please, is my family okay?
We're working on your husband and your son.
Any loss of consciousness? No.
But what about my daughter? What daughter?
Morris... But they never brought in a girl.
Oh, my God, is she dead?!
Is she dead and you're not telling me?!
Distal perfusion sucks. I can't get a line.
Draw up etomidate.
What's his weight?
Uh, about 25 kilos, same as Alex.
Oh... God, he's been scalped.
WEAVER: Exposed skull and galea
with a big hematoma.
Neck's broken, C-5 and 6.
WEAVER: We'll need Gardener- Wells tongs
to stabilize the neck.
Page neurosurg.
( whispering ): Where's my mommy?
It's all right, sweetie.
Mark the placement point for the tongs.
They're all beautiful.
Most of these are over a hundred years ago.
These were all built for the doctors and lawyers
and managers who'd moved west with the railroads.
It's my favorite street in Chicago.
What do you think of this one?
It's lovely.
Yeah. You like it?
Yeah.
What?
Mm, I was thinking maybe we could buy it.
Really?
Actually, I may have already bought it.
I had to put a deposit down.
There were four other interested buyers.
We need to have someplace to stay when we're here.
What about your grandmother's castle?
We could sell it.
What will your father say?
Uh... he might get a little upset, but...
Gamma left the house to me.
I don't want to live there.
Are you sure?
It is a little bit more space than we need.
Mm-hmm.
We can get our deposit back... if you don't like it.
I love it.
Yeah?
Yeah.
They sent two people to Mercy and two to Northwestern.
Why would they split us up?
In a big multi-victim accident,
one hospital can't take care of everyone.
There were ten victims total.
We could only handle four. Yes, I'm still holding.
No, that's eight. What happened to the other two?
Uh, there were two fatalities at the scene.
What?! Kathy...
Oh, my... Kathy...
Kathy, we don't know anything yet.
Paul? Mrs. Shepard.
What was the last hemocue? 10.2.
He has to get into the OR.
He's losing blood somewhere.
Ethan. Where's Ethan?
Ethan. RASGOTRA: How far?
What are you doing to him?
Until it's anchored in the skull.
No!
WEAVER: Dr. Kovac. Reverse Trendelenburg.
Stop it!
Stop it...
( screaming and sobbing ): Get off me!
Oh, God... Your husband has suffered
massive injuries to his chest.
Both lungs are collapsed, and he's bleeding internally.
What about Ethan?
What about you?
You-you were in there with him.
Tell me!
Uh, Dr. Weaver will talk to you.
Please, please, what was that thing
they were screwing into his head?
Ethan has a broken neck.
The tongs help prevent paralysis.
Paralysis?
There's been, uh, severe injury to Ethan's spine,
and his lungs,
and probably his brain.
They're dying, aren't they?
We don't know yet.
Where should I go now?
I'm sorry?
Who's going to die first?
I've had this ice cream cone
for nearly two hours,
and it hasn't even melted yet.
That's just one of the many,
many wonderful things about winters in Chicago.
My grandparents got married here.
And my parents.
Is that a proposal?
You want it to be?
( laughs )
No. I thought because breakfast in bed didn't quite work out,
we'd try for lunch.
Are we going to check in?
We already have.
Beth Shepard.
No, Kathy Shepard's here at County.
I'm looking for her daughter, Beth.
I should get a smaller set of sandbags.
Stabilize the tongs
while I add five pounds of traction.
Can you at least tell me
what hospital she was sent to?
Abby, I need you to hold the counterweight.
Layla's been waiting three hours
for a repeat crit.
Go on. He's stable.
I'll take three of your patients
if you take over for me in there.
No, thanks.
How you doing?
Fine.
Uh, when can I go?
As soon as we get these results in.
Nurse, can I have some orange juice?
And when he said that,
did you feel threatened or just uncomfortable?
I mean, would you categorize his comments as hostile
or merely insensitive?
Can I still have sex?
Not for a couple weeks.
What?
Just tell your boyfriend...
Fianc√©.
Just tell him that he needs to settle down.
If he really loves you, he'll understand.
Dean loves me.
We're getting married.
You know, sometimes you can love someone
and not realize that they're hurting you.
He doesn't mean to hurt me.
But does he?
Hurt you sometimes?
Did he hurt you last night?
I don't know.
What do you mean?
We went on a drive last night
with two of his friends.
We went to this park near his house.
He tells me I'm sexy all the time.
He just likes to show me off.
Well, show you off how?
Uh, sometimes he likes to let them watch.
Do they ever...
do more than watch?
Layla?
Yeah.
Sam, we need you to set up another IMED.
Get Duvata.
She's busy.
We're going to figure this out, okay?
Sam, now.
TAGGART: I'll be right back.
Dispatch RDC can't tell me where Kathy's daughter went,
or even if she's still alive.
The father's maxed out on three pressors,
he arrested twice, and I don't know
how long he's going to last long.
( alarms beeping ) WEAVER: Decreased on the right.
( knocking )
Pratt wanted that guy discharged.
You know, I'm busy.
Betadine. Let's do this again.
Doesn't look good.
Needle decompression and chest tube.
Where are my pain pills?
You can't be in here.
You're going to have to wait.
No! I got to see you now.
Abby, get him out of here.
Tachy at 124.
We're still waiting on some tests.
I don't need any tests!
Abby.
BP's dropping again.
This is stupid.
We're just torturing him.
LOCKHART: Let's go. ( Miguel coughing )
Hi.
Mm. Hi.
Was this on your list?
Several times.
I hope he has your nose.
You have a lovely nose.
What do you want him to be when he grows up?
I don't care.
As long as he's healthy and happy.
( laughs )
Okay, I'm deciding between Cy Young award-winner
and the guy who cures cancer.
I think he'll be astoundingly cute.
Well, nature likes genetic diversity.
We should make him marry an Asian
or Hispanic girl.
Mm.
You know what frightens me most?
Hmm?
That I could get used to all of this.
Well, I'm not going
to be renting out any ice rinks for him.
No?
Uh-uh.
That's what I ran away from.
Good femoral pulse.
All that epi kicked his BP up.
Sam.
Layla's pregnant?
I can't get his sats above 80.
Did you call social work?
Yeah, but they're slow as hell.
Subq air in the neck.
Let me tell her.
Okay.
Haleh, I'll be right back, okay?
TAGGART: We do a pregnancy test
on all female patients of childbearing age.
Yours came back positive.
I'm pregnant?
Yes.
Do you use birth control?
I was on the pill for a while, but it made me fat.
Oh, my God.
This is incredible.
Layla, do your parents...?
I've got to call Dean.
He's going to go through the roof!
You can't use that in here.
Listen, you need to seriously consider
whether or not you want to keep this pregnancy.
Oh, Dean loves kids.
What you think you want now may not be
what you're going to want in five years.
Or next year.
Or even in six months.
We need a SonoSite in here.
I'll be back.
MIGUEL: You running some kind of scam?
'Cause I been here nine hours waiting on some stupid tests.
Hey, man, I hear you.
Sam, how come Mr. Rivas hasn't been discharged yet?
Abby's still waiting on some labs.
Mr. Loomer?
Hey, can you take this to Trauma One?
Sure.
Ms. Taggart, I would love the opportunity
to sit down with you
and discuss appropriate workplace conduct
when you have a moment.
I don't, okay? Maybe later.
I won't then, either.
Mr. Loomer, you got to get back to bed.
What's-What's happening in there?
Come on.
You have a heart condition.
Is-Is he dead?
Yeah.
Damn shame.
Come on. You got to get back to bed.
I bought that car on a whim.
You have a heart condition.
Cost me half my retirement savings.
You shouldn't be wandering around the hall,
and you should really leave these people alone.
Mid-life crisis thing, but hell,
it probably saved my life.
I-I could've ended up like...
like that poor schmuck in there.
You drove your car into that family.
You were unconscious on the scene.
Your Hummer slammed into their car
and went right over it.
Ooh.
I-I...
I don't... I don't remember.
Is that Mr. Loomer?
( panting ) Oh, God.
I need some help here!
Shirt.
What happened?
Syncope.
Get a quick look.
V tach.
Okay, charge to 200.
Clear.
( zapping )
Sinus.
Got a pulse.
Okay, can you at least tell me how serious the...?
She's alive.
Okay. When can I call back to...?
Okay.
Fine. Thank you.
She's at Mercy Hospital.
The doctors are working on her right now.
What's wrong with her? I'm sorry, I couldn't
get more specifics, but I'm pushing
for a transfer here as soon as possible.
I just want to know if she's okay.
Do you want to be with your son, Kathy?
Will you go with me?
Sure.
Labs back on your knee effusion, Miguel Rivas.
AFB's positive.
Okay, um, I'm sorry.
Can you take Mrs. Shepard in?
Of course.
I'll be back in a minute.
Pratt. What?
Miguel's knee effusion is from TB.
What?!
I looked at his old charts.
He had multi-drug-resistant TB
15 months ago; he stopped showing up
to observed therapy.
But there was no fever, no coughing.
Because of the history, I did AFB stain,
which is positive, and he's coughing,
so he's probably infectious.
Where is he? I just discharged him.
Well, we have to find him
before he starts coughing up TB all over the El.
I gave him a prescription.
Call the pharmacy. I'll see if he's still there.
Miguel!
Move this damn thing.
Watch it. Watch it.
Hey, hold the elevator. Hey!
Damn it.
Damn it.
Hey.
Miguel, hey!
Hey, wait for the next one.
Come on, man.
( coughing ) Sorry.
All right.
TAGGART: Hey, Alex.
I just wanted to let you know that if you don't want to go
to that sleepover tonight, you don't have to.
We could do something fun together.
But if you still want to go, then that's fine, too.
And I just realized that I'm the only one
who's ever going to get this message
'cause I never showed you how to use the voice mail.
Damn it.
I'm sorry, okay?
How could you do this to me? Dean...
You're getting rid of it.
But it's our baby.
You need to leave. How do I even
know it's mine? I love you.
Get out! You need to leave right now.
What's going on? Oh, who's this?
One of your buddies from the gang bang squad?
She knows? Get out of here, both of you.
I told you she'd talk.
Hey, I don't know what she told you,
but we didn't make her do anything
she didn't want to do.
Oh, yeah? Well, why don't you
tell that to the cops.
She lies, okay? You heard her.
If it was true, why would she still
be saying she loves me? Hold on.
Let go of me.
Look,
she's just a stupid little slut.
( grunts )
( sighs )
( sighs )
Hey, how long is it going to take in here?
I've been here 12 hours, going on 13 now.
Keep your mask on. Yo, nurse!
I'm talking to you!
( sneezing )
Hey, Frank? Hmm?
Has my kid called? No.
He was supposed to call a half hour ago.
Maybe he's busy.
Can you hold for a tap in Three?
Weaver said you're not supposed to see any more patients
till you talk to her.
You're supposed to wait here for her.
I got it.
Don't hit me; I'm just the messenger.
I don't trust him. He didn't understand.
He stopped taking the pills when he stopped feeling sick.
I want Miguel in isolation,
and if he can't take his meds on his own,
I want him handcuffed and force-fed.
Oh, he just started coughing.
You're really going to call the police?
The guy's a ticking time bomb.
Are we throwing all our TB patients in jail?
'Cause it's not sustainable.
If this is how we treat people with TB,
they are going to stop coming to this hospital.
Abby, it's not like they all go clubbing together.
No, but they hang out at the TB clinic.
Miguel needs six months of therapy.
And you think you can do that?
I want to try to make him cooperate
with the health care system.
Hey...
FRANK: You're supposed to stay put.
If you still want to talk...
Maybe later.
You waiting for Weaver? Yeah.
Don't hit her. She's crippled.
( chuckling )
Never stops being funny, does it?
Sam.
How's Ethan?
Pressure's holding.
Last gas looks better.
Mr. Nadler is recommending your immediate dismissal.
What?
He called for references
at three other hospitals you've worked for.
You've had prior incidents.
I never got fired from any of those jobs.
Yeah, because you left before they could.
Look, I'm a good nurse.
If you want me here, fine.
If not, I'll find another job just as good somewhere else.
Something tells me you've used that speech before.
It's clear to everyone
that you have an impulse
control problem.
The guy helped his friends gang-rape his girlfriend.
We'll probably get sued.
The kid's in PEA.
All right.
The Director of Nursing
will talk to you tomorrow at 8:00.
For what it's worth, I wish I'd hit him harder.
You know, it's a lot warmer here in the summertime.
I like Chicago.
In the summertime, the lake is full of sailboats.
I can't live here, John.
My work-- it's... important.
I know.
What terminal?
United, Terminal 1.
We could just disappear, and no one would ever know.
Yeah, I'd like that.
Me, too.
The pills made me sick.
If you stop taking the pills before you're supposed to,
you're only going to kill some of the TB,
and the bacteria that's left
is going to get stronger and multiply,
and then none of the medicine is going to work.
Abby?
Did you call the cops yet?
No, not yet.
You're wasting your time with this guy.
Call the cops.
Hey, what are you doing?
I'm getting the hell out of here.
Well, it's not that simple.
You can't just leave.
I'll take the damn pills, okay?
You need to go to the TB clinic every day
for observed therapy.
I don't need that.
Oh, Abby,
Mercy for you on line one.
Okay. Miguel, stop.
It's about that woman's daughter, Beth Shepard?
Don't be an idiot.
Okay, Security, stop this guy.
Hold it!
Come here, please.
Hey, come on.
Come on. Take it easy.
Come on!
( grunting )
Don't hurt him.
I don't want you to leave.
I don't want to leave.
Well, then stay.
I can't.
It'll be all right.
( no audio )
Your halter monitor records every heartbeat
and stores it for 24 hours.
Thanks.
It appears you had a run of V-tach at 8:20 A.M.
8:20? Is that about when I crashed?
Your arrhythmia caused you to black out.
But upon impact, it seems you reverted to sinus
almost instantly.
You mean the car crash saved my life?
Yeah.
How long?
41 minutes.
Hold compressions.
Pace at 80.
No capture.
Another atropine and resume CPR.
PEA.
Mrs. Shepard, your son has no pulse.
His brain has been deprived of oxygen for almost an hour.
I think we should stop.
But it's still beeping.
It can take some time
for the electrical activity in the heart to stop.
( sniffling )
What about my daughter?
I'll find out.
I thought my life
was over after my... my first heart attack.
I couldn't work.
I couldn't walk upstairs and...
I couldn't have sex.
I felt like I was dead.
I never thought I'd get married,
have two kids.
Wasn't the type.
I always thought that stuff would mean life was over.
But then...
I got pregnant.
Paul was so excited.
He was always more excited about everything.
GUS: I thought my wife was going to leave me.
You know, I mean, I thought she should.
But she didn't. She...
She made me get out of bed in the morning.
I'll take any seat. I just need to get to the gate.
Sorry, Amsterdam's completely sold out.
Another flight. Anything.
I have a first class to Tokyo.
It's $9,000.
GUS: The car cost $110,000.
But she didn't care.
She said, "Gus, you spoil yourself.
You deserve it."
So... that's what I did.
I went out and bought myself my dream car...
and took it for a drive.
KATHY: I'd been having these dreams.
Fantasies.
Stretching out alone at night.
You know, reading a book.
Now I can.
Did I make this happen?
Why, why should I be the lucky one?
Why should I be spared?
No one knows why these things happen.
You have to believe
there's a reason you're still here.
KATHY: Late start this morning.
Ethan wanted ice cream.
He always wants these crazy things,
today I said okay.
Can you imagine ice cream in winter?
ABBY: She's in here.
Oh...!
Oh...!
KEM: John?
Hi.
Can I get four coffees, three chili dogs,
and in a separate bag, please,
two plain burgers and three plain yogurts?
SAM: Hamburgers and yogurt?
Susan can only eat two things without throwing up.
Oh, being pregnant sucks.
You want to sit?
Sure.
How are you handling nursing and student shifts?
Do you ever get any sleep?
Um, not that much, no.
( chuckles )
That's what you get for switching careers.
Well, medical school was a plan for a while, actually.
I just sort of got sidetracked.
Last thing I remember wanting to be
was an international spy.
I was 15.
Then I got pregnant.
15? Wow.
Oh, I was like one of those girls
who gives birth at her prom-- total denial.
By the time I figured out where the clinic was,
I... didn't have the money.
Alex's dad never kicked in his half,
and I couldn't get a waitressing job 'cause I was too young.
So I took double shifts at Baskin-Robbins
to save up the dough.
Did he go with you?
He was at a gig.
Right.
First time I went, I sat in the waiting room.
They called my name. Never got up.
Second time, I was too late.
Now I look at Alex, and I...
The place I went to had this calendar
on the wall with a picture of, um...
...Strawberry Shortcake.
I just stared at it the whole time.
You have a nursing shift?
Yeah. You're finished, right? Yeah.
Oh, here. Thank you.
See you tomorrow. See you tomorrow.
KOVAC: Hey.
Hey.
How's your arm?
Oh, it's okay.
Is Alex having fun on his sleepover?
Yeah, too much fun
to come to the phone when I called.
Yeah, sleepovers are tough.
I mean, on parents, not kids.
I had a boy and a girl in Croatia.
Uh, Miss Taggart?
Do you have a minute?
Uh...
Talk to you tomorrow.
LOCKHART: This is a document, drawn up by our legal department,
that says you agree to be admitted
for two weeks for treatment,
and after that, visit the TB clinic
every morning for six months.
I'm not signing anything.
I notice you don't have a Social Security number.
Hey, I been living and working in this country for ten years.
Good, so you know if you get arrested for a felony,
la migra's gonna kick your ass out of the country.
WEAVER: Oh, where's Dr. Carter?
Sandy's gonna kill me.
Dr. Weaver, we need you to sign off on a TB admission.
TB on a knee effusion?
See, that's what I mean by doing a thorough exam.
Good catch, Pratt. NADLER: Dr. Weaver.
It was Abby's catch.
Doesn't matter.
Dr. Weaver.
What do you want?
Well, a month alone in Door County
with my cats and my French horn,
but I'd settle for five minutes of your undivided attention.
This place is a disaster.
I've never seen anything like it.
I've witnessed your workers engaging in bullying, hostility,
violence, inappropriate touching...
Oh, come on.
We have a good staff.
They do their best.
You have a bunch of walking lunatics on your hands.
Doctors yelling, nurses beating up patients.
You need to start firing people immediately.
Fine. You're fired.
What? Don't come back tomorrow.
You won't be meeting the terms of the legal settlement.
So sue me... again.
What else is new?
You're late.
Night shift started 20 minutes ago.
Yeah, I'm sorry.
Where were you?
At the airport, dropping off Kem.
Oh, yeah?
Where'd she go?
Kisangani.
She have to get back to her program?
Mm-hmm.
She has 200 HIV patients' lives to save.
Good for her. ( pager beeping )
Oh, it's Sandy.
She can't believe I left her alone
with a screaming baby for 12 hours.
How long will she be gone?
I hope just a couple weeks.
Hey.
Did I show you the new pictures?
No.
( chuckles )
He's pointing his finger, huh?
Yeah.
I mean, he does that all the time.
He came out of the womb doing that.
It's like, "I've got a point to make."
Oh, he's got his own personality already.
Yeah, they all do.
You'll see.
( sighs ) ( keys clatter )
( sighs )
MAN ( on TV ): Now, we're in the 30s in Chesterton, Indiana.
( changing channels )
WOMAN: Tools that are stylish, affordable, and...
( turns off TV )
( chuckles softly )
( knocking )
( knocking continues )
Hi.
Hey.
I was going to see if you'd had dinner yet.
I thought maybe we could get something.
Come on in.
Let me get my coat.
Wow. Nice place.
Yeah, it's okay.
So... where do you want to go?
I don't know.
