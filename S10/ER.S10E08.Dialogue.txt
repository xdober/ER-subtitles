Previously on ER:
What are you doing?! Cut the hell out!
What are you doing? He just grabbed my ass.
What are the odds we're going to find someone better?
We're at that point where we should be spending
either all our time together
or none at all,
and I'm kind of leaning towards none at all.
Sign it. So, what, this goes up to Human Resources now?
It stays with me until I have a fat enough file
to pull the trigger. Bang.
Sinus tach, 130.
BP's up. 220/140.
Come on. He's going to blow an O-ring.
Let's try Nipride.
Oh, what? How did the paramedics miss this?
Cocaine?
Could be. Okay, hold the Nipride.
He needs a beta-blocker.
Five of metoprolol, IV push.
Heart rate's up to 140.
Metoprolol's in.
He's seizing.
Okay, two of Ativan.
ROMANO: Hey, Abby, what are
the physiological effects of cocaine?
It's a sympathetic stimulant.
Alpha or beta?
NEELA: Both.
SAM: V-tach.
Starting compressions.
Uh, charge to 200.
Check for pulse with compressions.
Clear.
V-fib.
Charge to 300.
Amp of epi.
The beta-blocker made him worse.
Clear.
No change.
360. Maybe he's allergic.
I doubt it.
By blocking beta, you've left alpha unopposed.
His BP's going through the roof
and he's bleeding in his brain.
Clear!
Asystole.
Amp of atropine.
Okay, what should she give?
Phentolamine and esmolol.
Gold dot for your forehead.
I've seen beta-blockers
work before. Oh, I'm sorry.
I forgot you have nursing experience, which means
that you can handle 90% of patients. Unfortunately,
it also means you might kill
the other ten percent. He's not dead yet.
Another amp of epi. Forget it. That's it.
Stop compressions.
Just another dead junkie.
Congratulations, Abby.
You managed to kill the practice dummy.
Okay, reset for the next student.
Shame we have to work the holiday.
You got family in town?
No.
Your overdose was much harder
than my dialysis patient with hyperkalemia.
I need a room to hold an ICU admit.
CHUNY: Sorry, bad MVA coming in.
So where do I put him?
Anywhere, as long as it's in the hallway.
Come on.
Can't you just get me some pills?
That wouldn't be safe.
Mr. Garland has pneumonia with hypoxia.
You need IV antibiotics.
I need to be with my family for Thanksgiving.
They can come and visit you here.
How was the mock code?
Fine.
So Romano humiliated you?
I looked like an idiot.
He does that to everyone.
Or maybe I just don't get it.
You'll catch on.
It just takes a little time.
Stay up there, turkey. Come on.
Son of a bitch.
Better call the coroner on that one.
The damn night shift was supposed
to take care of all of this.
I'm just in charge of the potluck.
Well, my yams are in the lounge.
How many admits are we holding?
You don't want to know.
No, there's a sandwich in the fridge.
And don't answer the door until I get home.
All right. See you soon.
Everything okay?
Yeah, I had to leave Alex at home for the day.
Oh, he'll be all right.
It's just until 3:00.
I'm finally going to get to make my kid
a real Thanksgiving dinner.
Most years I've had to work.
That's Lily's.
I thought it was for the potluck.
There's a coffee club.
Yeah, you have to pay every month.
Sorry. How much?
It's a nurse's coffee club.
Okay, time to stamp out disease.
Hand lac for Coop.
Hit me again.
Oh, one per customer.
Asthma for Neela.
Vag bleeding for Abby.
Lovely.
And "bugs are crawling under my skin" for Lester.
Cool.
Hey, Pratt, will you take the incoming trauma?
Yeah. Hey, Frank.
What's up with the stupid parade, man?
Put the game on.
Hey, kickoff isn't till 12:30. My brother-in-law is marching
with the Brundy County Sheriff's Posse.
Oh, yeah, what's that? Some sort of clan?
Hey, Morris.
What do you think you're doing?
Picking up a patient.
You just skipped over "bloody diarrhea"
for... "eye pain."
FRANK: Smile! Frank?
Sorry, I didn't think this old thing would still work.
1t was in last year's box.
Couple of shots left.
What do you figure is on there?
Might be Romano and Weaver in a compromising position.
I'll get double prints then, just in case.
ABBY: October 14.
Six weeks and three days.
So I'm still pregnant?
We'll check an ultrasound.
How heavy is the spotting?
Uh... couple of pads so far.
Are you taking any medications?
Prenatal vitamins, AZT,
3TC, and indinavir.
You're HIV-positive?
Yeah, for ten years.
Never shared a needle, no blood transfusions.
Just a loser boyfriend
with too many chicks on the side.
Anyone here with you today?
Yeah, My fianc√©.
He's driving up from Iowa City.
This guy's the real deal. ( knocking )
Abby?
Excuse me.
Three sick calls for night shift.
( chuckles ): Right, sick.
On Thanksgiving.
Call the registry.
We really need someone who knows the floor.
No.
No way.
I'm on all day as a med student.
I only work nursing shifts on weekends.
I can let you off your rotation
at 5:00 so you can take a nap.
Can you take one for the team?
No.
Okay, fine. Only if you can't find anybody else.
Thanks. Okay.
MORRIS: So you're not using the eyedrops?
My nephew gave me an herbal medicine.
What, some sort of homeopathic crap?
Morris, come on, man. Trauma's here.
I think it's called Kona Gold.
Morris, grab some four-by-fours.
Uh, yeah.
Okay, this is pretty deep.
I wanted to use the carving knife.
She made me use the other thing.
( knife buzzing )
It's from Germany.
PRATT: Morris!
Morgan Westbrook, traffic collision with intrusion.
BP: 80 palp
with obvious pelvic fracture.
O2 SATs: 98. No significant head trauma.
Didn't get altered until he dropped his pressure.
On the phone to his doctor when we pulled up.
Drives a Bentley. Oh, nice.
Okay, prime the rapid infuser.
Come on. Let's go.
Here we go. On my count.
Uno, dos, tres.
( grunting )
How do we tell pelvic bleeding
from intra-abdominal? MORRIS: CT scan.
What if the patient's unstable?
Uh, ultrasound?
No, suprapubic mini-lap and DPL.
Which you can assist on.
Pupils equal and reactive.
Looks like we got some sewing for you, too.
Can you two handle this?
Oh, I should hope so.
Good. I need to get back to my glaucoma patient.
Morris, this is a primo teaching case.
I'm worried about angle closure.
No hemotympanum.
I need to check eye pressures.
( sighs )
Equal breath sounds.
Is he squeamish?
No, just stupid.
Frank, where are the nurses?
With patients.
I need a chaperone.
Sam, can you help me with a pelvic?
After I hang blood in trauma.
Can we bring a few patients back?
Eventually.
I've done solo pelvics.
I could help, if you'd like.
That's okay. Thanks.
No, no, we are boarding five ICU players
and it's total gridlock.
I'll give you an hour.
Mr. Garland, looks like you might be with us for a while.
Not a problem.
What's that?
"Turducken."
What?
It's chicken stuffed in a duck, stuffed in turkey.
You want a taste?
Maybe later.
( moans )
Sorry.
( sighs )
No, no, it wasn't you.
Just a cramp.
There's a little bit more bleeding than I expected.
And the cervix is open.
Meaning?
With the cervix open, you can't maintain a pregnancy.
I'm sorry.
I had a feeling.
( groggily ): I woke up and something...
something was strange.
We've been trying to get preg... pregnant...
For how long?
Loren?
Loren?
Damn it.
( beeping )
FRANK ( on speaker ): Can I help you?
This is Abby. Who's at Admit?
Just me and the food.
Well, my patient's bleeding out.
I'll see who I can rustle up.
Could use a little help here!
Systolic's 110 after two units.
Spontaneous eye movements.
( man groaning )
Mr. Westbrook?
Where am I?
You're at County General.
You got clipped by a tow truck.
( groans ) Try not to move your leg.
What do you think you're doing?
I'm calling my lawyer.
I'd rather not be treated here.
You may have internal bleeding.
I'll take my chances.
Your cell phone interferes with our equipment.
Hello.
It's Morgan Westbrook...
Hey, I said no cell phones!
Hello, Mr. Westbrook.
I'm Robert Romano,
Chief of Emergency Services.
I just got off the phone with our CEO, Peter Fenwick.
Oh, Peter was in my class at Wharton.
Yeah, so I heard.
I think your employees
need a lesson in customer service.
This one stole my phone.
Well, he's not long for this hospital.
We're taking him up to CT.
Great. After a few tests, we'll work on a transfer.
Thank you.
You're welcome. And don't worry.
You are in excellent hands with Dr. Corday.
Believe me, I envy you.
Hey.
Come here.
That guy is the biggest real estate developer in Chicago.
Yeah, more like the biggest prick.
Now, when you get a VIP patient, sometimes...
You treat them the same as everybody else.
He's not stable.
Well, if he has no solid organ injuries, I say he is stable.
Well, then you're making a big mistake.
He could have ongoing hemorrhage.
My only mistake was continuing to allow you
to practice medicine, Pratt. Wait a minute.
You're willing to compromise patient care
just so you can suck up to some rich guy?
No, we will determine objectively
if he's able to be transferred...
I'm not signing any transfer papers.
Well, you don't have to
because you're no longer on the case.
Well, great. Then my name won't be mentioned in your malpractice suit
when he bleeds to death.
Yeah, and as far as I'm concerned,
you no longer work here.
Right.
No, I'm serious, Pratt.
You just pissed me off for the last time.
Second liter's in. Pressure's 100/60.
LOREN: Whoa.
Hey, Loren.
Gave us a little scare.
You passed out from blood loss.
That doesn't sound good.
Well, there can be retained tissue that keeps bleeding.
Hemoglobin's 9.4.
Okay, type and cross for two.
How do you stop that?
With a D and C.
We clean things out, and then you're back to normal.
Abby...
Let's get you a fresh gown.
I'll be right back.
There is no retained tissue.
She has multiple uterine fibroids.
It's not going to be as simple as a D and C.
You should be careful what you say.
Most of the time, it's retained...
Not in her case.
Transfuse two units and call GYN.
We have to get this bleeding to stop.
Next time, wear oven mitts before you take out the turkey, okay?
Oh, there.
Hey, Frank, what's the score?
First quarter, zero-zero.
Oh, you're back from the scan?
Bilateral pubic rami fractures and a shattered acetabulum.
Ouch. And we've got Todd Corbett on stand-by
at the Mayo Clinic.
Hey, you think I'll be able to run
the Marathon next October?
I'd say there's a good chance.
That guy could put Humpty Dumpty back together again.
I'll be right there.
All right, what part of "You're off the case" do you not understand?
I'm just looking out for the best interests of the patient.
Did you send off another CBC?
Keep it up, Pratt.
What, another letter in my file?
No, you and I are meeting with Weaver and Anspaugh
at the end of your shift. On Thanksgiving?
That's right.
Well, I guess it saves you from spending it alone.
Did you call Psych about your bug guy?
No, he really has scabies.
My asthma girl's worse.
Call RT for heliox.
Lewis, get coverage for Pratt's shifts starting tomorrow.
Complex laceration?
I repaired the extensor tendon with a figure of eight.
Looks nice.
Yes... very tidy.
Abby, where's the abductor pollicis brevis insert?
You know its innervation?
Smile!
My patient needs blood.
Okay, just put your dirty clothes in the hamper.
Did you check your sugar at noon?
Timoptic, one drop two times a day.
What about the other stuff?
You don't need it. It's illegal...
Just say "no."
Just say no to what?
Altar boys.
Look at this rack.
Do I have to?
We need to treat patients in Triage again.
Meet 'em and street 'em.
Whoa, not so fast, Luka.
Couple of problems in the hall.
Jeffries spiked to 104.
Tylenol, blood cultures and a gram of Cefotetan.
When can he go up?
Fifth in line for med-surg...
Mrs. Paulson's now altered.
Two tele admits in front of her.
How are you doing, ma'am?
30cc's of lactulose, and, uh, draw
an ammonia level. And Mr. Garland's BP is down to 90 systolic.
Start Dopamine at five mikes...
Sorry for the delay, sir.
That's okay. I like to people-watch.
Can you help us at Triage?
No. Why not?
'Cause you just gave me about an hour's worth of orders.
This is ridiculous.
We have no beds, no staff,
and we're doing the work of the entire hospital.
Yep, welcome to my world.
I need hard restraints for Mr. Garland.
Garland? He's a pussycat.
The kind that lock.
Have you ever had any problems with general anesthesia?
Hepatitis?
No, they check my liver enzymes on the triple cocktail.
I need you to sign a consent form
for exploratory surgery and a possible hysterectomy.
Hysterectomy?
Only as a last resort.
Nobody said anything about a hysterectomy.
Well, it may be our only option
if we can't control the bleeding.
No. I want to have kids.
I appreciate that.
Dr. Coburn, do you have a minute?
Hang two more units
and check another hemoglobin.
Um... why do a hysterectomy for fibroids?
Because it might save her life.
Well, there are other options.
I usually don't justify my operative approach to a nurse.
I'm a fourth-year med student.
Well, we consent for all contingencies.
Are you even going to attempt embolization?
That would take hours.
Okay, I'm not sure I'm getting your point.
She's bleeding out.
She's on her fourth unit, and she's not stable
for embolization. Uh-huh, and maybe she would be
if she wasn't HIV-positive?
What are you accusing me of?
Ladies, please,
let me settle this catfight.
Abby, you're wrong.
We were discussing uterus-sparing procedures.
On an HIV-positive woman? Why?
Yeah, thank you, Robert. I can handle this.
She wants to have a baby.
Well, maybe this is God's way of saying, "Bad idea."
With a low viral load, transmission rate is less than three percent.
Uh-huh, and the kid'll be motherless by age ten.
I'll attempt a myomectomy,
but I can't make any promises.
Probable rotator cuff tear.
I thought it was a game of touch football.
My sister-in-law doesn't like to lose.
Happy Thanksgiving, Dr. Lewis.
Excuse me.
Uh, thank you.
Don't thank me. Thank some dead guy from Mercy.
Very romantic.
So, you in the mood for some late-night pumpkin pie?
Um... you know what? I'm beat.
I'll bring the whipped cream.
Maybe another time. You okay?
Yeah, I'm just tired.
Of me?
FRANK: GSW to the face
en route.
Morris, you're with me.
Talk to you later.
Two liters NC, TKO the saline.
Five-minute ETA on the private chopper.
I'm Chuck. I'm Dr. Hewitt from Northwestern.
I'll be flying with you.
Hands inside the car, man.
I appreciate everything you've done, Dr. Romano.
My pleasure.
Are you coming up to the copter with us?
Oh, well, I'd like to, but, as you can see,
we are completely swamped, so, uh...
I don't know how you do it, Robert.
Aw, I guess it's just my calling.
Thanks a lot. Take care. Have a good flight.
WESTBROOK: Thank you.
Hold that elevator.
So you still think there's still a chance?
Yeah, I do. A good one.
Abby, Mrs. Marshall is praying
to the porcelain God again.
Uh, okay.
Reglan and Tagamet.
My fiancee's coming to the ER.
Okay, um, I'll bring him up,
and I'm going to scrub in, make sure you're okay.
This is for painkillers.
Keep them. After ten years of marriage, I'm immune to pain.
Helium gets deeper into the lungs.
I won't float away, will I?
No, but you may talk funny.
Frank, Pedes ICU have a bed yet?
In your dreams.
Hey, chow-line's open.
Yeah, I think you forgot something.
What? Emesis basins.
Shouldn't you be on the roof? No.
Mr. Moneybags left his Rolex in the Trauma Room.
So have one of the nurses take it up.
They're busy.
Hey, Indira,
take that up to the helipad.
How do I get there?
Look, I don't blame you for being scared.
Last thing you need is to lose another limb up there.
Come on. I'll take you up.
Someone stole my medicine.
Talk to the hand.
What kind of medicine?
For my glaucoma.
Who was your doctor?
Young guy, red hair, and goatee.
GSW to the mid-face. Where the hell is Morris?
( horn honks, siren blares )
KOVAC: So, uh, about tonight--
It's okay that I'm coming for dinner? What?
Alex invited me.
What is this?
Septic pneumonia patient.
We don't have any beds. Neither do we.
You said they accepted him.
You can't just come up here without calling report.
Here is your report.
72-year-old pneumonia patient
on Cefotaxime, five mikes
of dopamine, and six
liters of O2. He might leave AMA.
What are you doing?
Take it easy.
He's a troublemaker.
This is really stupid.
You have more nurses.
We can't take extra patients.
Why not? We do it all the time.
Now you can't
send him back.
Are you coming?
Dr. Romano?
Are you coming?
Here, take it.
Patient forgot
his watch. Thank you.
Keep your head down.
I know the drill.
This isn't your flight.
FRAN: Dispatch sent me.
There's only room for two attendants.
Right, me and the doc.
No, I have to go. Insurance requirement. She's off the flight.
Hey!
What the hell do you think you're doing?
Uh, nothing.
Give me that.
Uh, it's not what you think.
Yeah. Get your ass back inside,
sit down at Admit,
and do not move until I come get you.
( grunts )
The strap
is caught.
Fine. Just call the nursing supervisor.
You're not helping
to solve the problem.
( screams )
( screams ): No!
( grunting )
Open up four ORs and get every surgeon down here.
Done.
COOP: Three criticals out here.
Yeah, copy that. Mike? Yo.
O2 and IVs outside. Let's go.
Lester, we need backboards, man.
( knocking on glass ) Dr. Pratt?
From the roof. ( sighs )
Morris, get busy.
I can't.
NEELA: Decreased breath sounds.
Weak carotid pulse. What's open?
Trauma Two. Chest tube.
ET and two large-bore IVs.
Send X-ray
down here for a portable.
Should I set up a thoraseal? No, no. I need you to triage.
Go. We got this. Go!
Neela, grab a box.
What is it?
Mass-casualty bins and lots of morphine.
How much longer?
Soon as I get this crike. What happened?
Helicopter crash.
Up on the roof? In the bay.
Any survivors?
I don't know.
Find out! Go!
FRANK: I closed us to internal disaster.
NEELA: What should I be doing?
Grab this gurney.
Okay. Put one of these on every patient.
Fill in vitals,
injury, and tear off the triage category.
Morris!
Romano told me to wait here.
Green for minor, yellow, delayed,
red, immediate, black, dead.
Green and yellow stay in Chairs.
Bring back red right away.
What about black?
Cover them with a sheet.
Where should I start?
Anywhere.
We need two more gurneys.
How bad is it?
( sirens wailing )
You okay?
Just a little dizzy.
Backboard!
( man coughing )
( woman groaning )
Did they pull anyone out?
Not yet. Meet Reina Flores.
Came in for heart failure,
and now she needs ortho.
It hurts quite a bit.
( people groaning )
LEWIS: Abby, morphine.
All right. What about him?
I'm fine. Take care of her.
Chest pains, broken ribs.
COOP: Abdominal pain
and weak pulse.
Abby, I need four of morphine.
Susan, you should go inside.
We got this covered.
Oh, her lungs are wet.
She needs a nitro spray,
40 of Lasix, and dopamine to keep her systolic above 90.
Are you all right, dear?
Yeah, it's just the smoke.
( fire alarm blaring )
Hey, get me out of here!
Get me out of this!
You're okay, Mr. Garland.
We have to move patients to the ER.
No, they'll be swamped.
We can treat them here.
I'll call down for help.
No. The phones are dead.
Get him to the other side.
I can't find the key.
You're going to be okay, ma'am.
Not if I don't make it to my granddaughter's wedding.
When's that?
Two weeks.
Hypotensive with a rigid belly.
Call Corday.
Blunt chest, good vitals.
Okay. How is my wife?
Who's in charge?
Uh, Dr. Lewis.
Right here.
Fire's just about out.
I got nothing for you.
But I got four for the coroner.
You know, Luka's on.
I can get him to cover for you.
No.
Abby, respiratory arrest in Curtain One.
( woman whimpering )
Hey, nurse, I'm chained to the wall here.
SAM: Double up the patients,
two per slot.
Sam, I need some help over here.
Get an E cylinder for every vent
before you move them.
The fire melted her ET tube.
I have to reintubate.
Burned her central line, too.
Oh, Doc, get me loose.
Get me loose.
Here you go, 8-0.
I'm not ready for the tube yet.
You said you wanted to intubate.
I think she aspirated the short end into her lungs.
I need something to fish it out.
You want a MacGill?
Keep pressure on the subclavian. I'll see
what I can find.
Help! Somebody, help!
Ready with a backboard and splint.
How are you doing, Reina?
Better than the poor souls in that helicopter.
PICKMAN: Pulse ox down to 88.
LEWIS: Put her up to ten liters.
Susan?
Kerry.
Susan, are you okay?
Were you hurt?
No, no. I'm fine.
Okay, who are the other attendings?
Um, uh...
Luka and Romano. I don't know where they are.
You shouldn't get tied up with one patient
when you're the incident commander.
You've got to keep your eye on the big picture.
Chuck's on the chopper.
Oh, God. I'm so sorry.
She's more hypoxic.
How's your breathing, Reina?
We're having
212 wedding guests.
Can you imagine? Oh.
LEWIS: She's altered. She needs an airway.
WEAVER: Curtain Two.
COOP: Both traumas are going up to the OR.
Stay with Dr. Lewis. This one has a flail chest.
Okay, Trauma Two with me. Got it.
Abby, you and Pratt take the yellows to Exam Three.
Pulse ox dropped to 88 on five liters.
Is there blood in the belly?
That's my wife.
We're taking her up to the OR for an ex-lap.
Berta.
WEAVER: She's in good hands.
Oh, Happy Thanksgiving, Dr. Weaver.
Yeah, you, too. Didn't get past the relish tray.
This was a tough one.
Had to tube this lady on her side.
LOCKHART: Hey, Pratt, you're with us.
Do you know how to debride?
I've done it once.
All right, let's go.
Hey, what happened, man?
I don't know. Bad concussion.
Neuro check's, 215.
I fell to my hand.
You lifted patients like that? Yes, doctor.
Damn, you are one tough muchaca. Yes, doctor.
CHUCK: I need a doctor here. All right.
Through-and-through penetrating neck.
I tubed him for an expanding hematoma.
On the roof?
Weren't you the flight nurse?
Supposed to be.
Lily, Trauma One.
500cc's in.
Mm-hmm. You started a line?
Yeah, 14-gauge in case he needed blood.
Is that Mel?
Yeah, trauma panel, type and cross
for six, lateral c-spine and let's get surgery down here.
Nice and easy.
CO2 detector is yellow.
We need to tube you, too?
I thought he was dead.
How long until we check
an ABG?
Baby, I had to tube this guy, and there was no suction...
Whoa, whoa, hey.
It's not that big a deal.
I thought you were on the chopper. Oh, God, no.
They brought their own flight nurse,
and the bitch wouldn't let me fly.
Oh, that bitch saved your life.
Dr. Lewis, multifocal PVCs.
I know, I know.
Oh, I thought you were dead.
Hey, hey.
I scraped my back a little, see?
( laughs )
Okay.
The MacGill won't fit through.
It's all we have.
I need something thinner. Like what?
Anything.
Dr. Kovac, I need you over here.
Where are your doctors?
Coming from home. It's Thanksgiving.
Damn, I am so late.
I've got to call a neighbor.
Can we focus on this?
Curved vascular clamp.
Get ready with the ET tube.
Tube her fast. Sats are dropping.
Bag her.
This guy needs the OR.
If we still have one.
Keep pressure on the liver.
Where are you going?
To the OR. We need Vicryl mesh.
Okay, and bring a surgeon.
A little cold on your chest.
Hard-hard to breathe.
Because you collapsed a lung.
How is Berta?
She's in the OR. We'll get an update.
You have a cordis introducer?
What's going on, Pratt?
Penetrating neck developed a dense right-sided paralysis.
Vascular needs to repair his carotid.
No, that won't work.
Ten blade. Call surgery.
The injury is too high. Yeah? Let them decide that.
32 French.
Get me a c-arm and a radiologist.
No, your patient needs to go to the OR.
He'll be dead by then.
( alarms blaring ) V-tach.
Charge to 200.
Don't do it, Pratt. Clear.
( zap )
( coughing )
Run of six.
That's another 50 of lidocaine.
She's about to arrest. Where's the heliox?
Mix up the procainamide.
You think it's rhabdo?
Yeah, the crushed muscle cells are getting
into her central circulation.
She needs an amputation.
( high voice ): An operation would kill her. Her heart's too weak.
I don't know about that wedding.
I need ice, lots of it.
LESTER: Subtract seven from 100.
Uh, 93.
Seven from 93.
What are you doing? Mental status exam.
Serial sevens.
Neuro checks are pupils,
orientation, and grip strength.
That's it. You've got ten
other patients who need you.
Excuse me. 86.
That's good enough for now.
We've got a foot lac to suture
before it's six hours old, and we have to...
Chuck? What is it?
Chuck?
Move the arm guy into a chair.
Neela, go get a doctor
and a SonoSite.
Lester, help me lift him.
One, two... Wait.
Hold it. Hold it. Hold it.
Okay, roll him.
( alarms blaring )
Suction.
Open the internal paddles.
We need a doctor in Exam Three.
Try next door. Start internal compressions.
PRATT: The guy is stroking out.
I'd start with an angiogram.
The injury is at the base of the skull.
The surgeons can't get distal control.
Dr. Pratt, can you come to Exam Three?
Does it look like it?
If you don't put a stent in this guy, he's going to die.
I'm taking the SonoSite.
Clear.
Fine. Then let's just sit around until he's dead.
Got ultrasound, but no one's available.
Hard to bag. Try a jaw thrust.
He stopped breathing? Yeah.
He needs intubation.
Prep an 8-0 ET tube.
Abby?
I think the damn cords are too anterior.
You want me to try? ( gurgling )
Oh. Roll him.
Roll him. Roll him.
Yankauer.
His sats are dropping.
Why isn't this...? Can you turn it on?
Turn on the wall suction. Thank you.
Heart rate's down to 40.
Okay, stand by with atropine.
Maybe you need a straight blade.
Give me your hand.
I'll open the crash cart.
Backwards
and to the right.
Right...
there.
Hold it right there.
Got it.
Bag him. Neela, tape.
He's got a laceration on his back.
It could be an entrance wound.
Sats are coming up.
It looks like he has
a metal fragment in his spleen.
Lester, get me the rapid infuser
and two units of O-neg.
What are you doing?
He needs a central line.
Shouldn't an attending be here?
Yup. You see anyone around?
The liver is wrapped, still bleeding.
Purse string it with 2-0.
How do you know this?
I used to be a surgical tech.
Oh, my, what have we here?
Liver lac.
Hemostasis with Vicryl mesh.
Excellent. Well, I've got an open OR.
Let's get him upstairs.
Looks like I'm eating cold turkey tonight.
What time is it?
Almost 5:00.
Oh, man.
Hey, you got a bolt cutter?
Not up here, but I'll get you one.
Oh.
You're lucky, Mr. Garland.
Your burns are only minor.
I liked it better downstairs.
Only had pneumonia downstairs.
Charged to 30 and clear.
Asystole.
Resuming compressions.
How long's it been?
35 minutes.
Okay, that's it.
Time of death: 17:09.
Close the thoracotomy and find the family.
His wife's in surgery.
Hey, what did Vascular say?
They never came down.
There you go. Leave three centimeters
to cover the defect,
one intracranial.
Stent is in place.
What did I tell you?
To do the right thing.
No. I want a surgery...
Hey, look at this.
Motor function in the upper extremity.
Blood flow is restored to the brain.
Everything's good, Mel.
Where's Dr. Lewis?
Clear.
( zap )
( beeps )
Sinus tach. Got a pulse.
Try for a pressure.
Reina? Open your eyes, Reina.
You think she'll wake up?
I hope so.
We still need an attending.
Which patient?
The flight nurse guy. Chuck?
What?
Abby?
Occult splenic injury.
He had a slow leak, took him about an hour
to drop his pressure. He's intubated
with a central line.
Who did this?
If you sign here, we can say you did.
It was either that or let him die.
This the spleen for the OR?
Yup. It's Chuck.
What, your ex-husband?
Yeah.
Do you want to observe?
Um, I-I can't, but I can bring him up.
LOCKHART: Last crit was 26.
He's type and crossed
for another four.
BP's 110/70
after two units. Abby, thank you.
Is it over?
Did he drop his pressure again?
Any additional transfusions?
Okay, good. Thanks. Chuck?
Yeah, he's doing well. They're closing.
And we're opening to Trauma. What?
Sent nine to the OR, five to telemetry,
four to med-surg, and I've monitored beds.
Too bad it takes a disaster
to whip this place into shape.
Ruptured globe's going up to surgery,
and the supracondylar girl can follow.
Okay, good.
Abby.
The fibroids involved the uterine artery.
I attempted a myomectomy, but there was no way.
You did a hysterectomy?
Yeah.
She's stable now.
Heard you had your hands full
down here.
Good night.
Hey, can I sign out?
What?!
You're a night shift nurse.
Not until 7:00.
Well, it's a quarter till.
I don't believe this.
I wrote these orders six hours ago.
Mom. Hey, Mom.
Where's Helene?
She couldn't pull in.
Are those body bags out there?
Did you see the crash?
Well, it looks like
home cooking's out of the question.
You want to go to Ike's?
Ike's?
It's across the street.
We're going out to dinner.
You're still coming, right?
I don't think so.
Why not?
Alex, we're fine on our own.
Mom, you said I could bring a friend.
Besides, it's boring if it's just us.
You're welcome to join us.
No, I-I don't have to.
No. Come on.
Are you ready?
Yeah, last stitch.
Where is Romano?
I haven't seen him,
but I need to get this guy up to CT.
Let the nurses handle it. Come on.
Why in God's name would he insist on meeting tonight?
I really couldn't say.
Time for our little sit-down, Kerry.
I'm a little tied up in here.
Where is Robert?
I thought he was up in the OR with you.
Well, I thought he was down here with you.
Just fill me in later.
Ah, come along, Dr. Pratt.
Best if we deal with this right now.
Romano sent me a file of your disciplinary letters.
Yeah. Sometimes we don't see eye-to-eye on things.
Well, there's enough documentation here
to merit a suspension,
I guarantee you that.
Offending patients, contradicting consultants,
refusing to comply with attending's treatment plan.
Do you care to respond?
Look, I may have been out of line, maybe...
Oh, baloney.
Excuse me?
I don't give any credence to these allegations.
If any of this were true,
I would get complaints from other attendings,
and obviously, Robert doesn't care enough
about this to even show up.
I saw you in action today.
You're an excellent physician.
Thank you.
Give this to Romano when you see him.
Can I have French toast?
No.
Why not? It says all-day breakfast.
Because it's Thanksgiving.
You're having turkey.
Would you rather have French toast or turkey?
Um, I-I don't like French toast.
Why not? You like pancakes.
Yeah.
So... so does my mom.
You guys
can have pancakes; I'll have French toast,
and then we can share some turkey sausage.
Alex.
Why would you do that?
Payback.
I'm sorry I didn't get home in time
to cook you Thanksgiving dinner.
Excuse me. I'll, uh, wash up.
Why did you invite him?
Because he's my friend.
Well, you shouldn't have friends who are over 30.
Why not? Because you're a kid.
So? I like him. He's cool.
I know what you're trying to do.
I'm not.
And...
I'd rather not be going out with someone right now, okay?
You're probably not his type.
Besides, he's my friend, not yours.
Hello, Mrs. Marshall. I'm back.
The nurse came with my medicine.
That's okay. I'm your nurse now.
I thought you were my doctor.
That was this morning.
Now, I'm your nurse.
This is a very strange hospital.
Tell me about it.
Abby, I'm about to suture an arm lac.
5-0 nylon.
I thought so.
Abby, how much angulation is acceptable
on a fifth metacarpal fracture?
More than 60 degrees needs reduction.
Hey, do you know who gets the Blue Beacon admissions?
Sessa, beeper number
2956.
Never received?
No way. I brought that down myself!
Look, I said I looked in the Records room,
and it's not there.
Yeah, well, Happy Thanksgiving to you, too, jagoff.
Hey, did Detroit win?
I have no freakin' idea.
Well, what about Dallas?
Don't make me come over there and smack you.
One for Dr. Pratt.
( women chuckling )
Hey, Morris.
What have you been doing all day?
Romano told me to wait here.
So you just sat on your ass
through a mass casualty?
Yeah.
Your shift's over, man. Go home.
I can't!
Are those from Christmas?
Uh, last year?
The year before. Dr. Greene.
Mmm. Which one's Dr. Greene?
I'm going to need a massive amount
of caffeine if I'm going to make it to sunrise.
Here you go, Abby.
Ew.
( all chuckling )
Shred it.
Ooh, look at this one.
That's definitely 2001. The Secret Santa party.
Anybody hear from Carter?
He sent us a postcard about a month ago.
You should put that up in the lounge.
How's he doing?
( file slaps table )
I don't know.
What are you thinking about?
Mm... nothing.
Come back to bed.
( singing softly )
Hey.
Hey.
I should fake my death more often.
I knew it.
What?
That we'd end up together tonight.
( chuckles )
This your idea of a hot date?
Yeah, yeah.
It's dark. The nurses are busy...
You just had your spleen removed.
Yeah... you know what they say--
when you lose an organ, the other ones get stronger.
( chuckles )
Hey. What are you still doing here?
Waiting on a few labs.
I hate to pass on patients when it's busy.
Ah, that will change.
Today was pretty amazing.
I've never seen anything like it.
I didn't think we could handle it, but we did.
We did really well. We saved lives.
It was like a roller-coaster.
I've always hated roller-coasters, but...
I sort of can't wait for the next ride.
Just as long as it's not in the next 12 hours.
You want a coffee?
I'm not in the club.
I got an extra.
Thanks.
