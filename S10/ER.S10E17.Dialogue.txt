Previously on E.R.
If it's a choice between something serious
or nothing,
maybe serious is the way to go.
You still on for dinner tonight?
Looks like you're dating a teacher.
I am.
You take care, big man.
Please don't go.
I'm going to have a baby, and Chuck's the father.
You're going to be a grandpa.
You're marrying her?
If she'll have me.
That's it.
Hey, what is that?
Little bit of Sikh rap.
Wait a minute. He's stable now.
He'll be fine. I know, but just...
If I don't get out of here,
I'm going to lose it. Do you understand?
Kertzenstein, Lester.
Lester.
Lester, Lester, Lester...
Very polite.
Hmm. He should try pathology.
Yeah. That way, his patients will be dead
before he gets to them.
I heard he wants radiology anyway.
Second tier. Lockhart, Abby.
Very strong clinical skills.
Efficient when she needs to be.
Knows where to spend her time.
The only person who's not sure
about Abby is Abby.
Does she want Emergency Medicine?
As much as she wants anything.
WEAVER: All right.
Rank to match.
Rasgotra, Neela.
Intelligent, very sweet.
Studious.
Studious?
She's the smartest one on the floor.
Come on.
She could be more assertive.
CHEN: She has a tendency to hang back,
avoid getting into traumas.
She's cautious. That's good.
LEWIS: She's not ER.
She'll be
a star in internal medicine, or research--
something using your intellect--
but she's not an ER doc.
Uh, since when did intellect become a liability
to working in the ER?
WEAVER: There was a memo
while you were in Africa.
I think she's excellent.
She basically saved Frank's life.
She's thoughtful, yeah, but she's deliberate.
Is that code for passive and slow?
She's a student.
She's going to get faster.
LEWIS: Yeah, and in four months,
she'll be a doctor.
I say rank to match.
That's not the consensus.
Consensus is wrong.
WEAVER: Okay.
The NRMP list doesn't have to go out right away.
Carter, change our minds.
Well, at least you have some time
for your reclamation project.
Not really. I'm on a plane to Africa tonight.
For how long?
About a week or so.
How's Kem doing?
She's pregnant.
She asked me to fill a suitcase with Ho-Hos.
Yeah. Save some for me.
I need you to sign off on these dispos?
My shift's over.
14 hours isn't enough?
Dr. Carter, 27-year-old healthy male,
knee versus circular saw.
Chuck said he'd be waiting for you outside.
Chivalry-- time of death, 8:07.
How long has he been here?
Sat in triage for seven hours,
and back in a room for the last two.
Good luck, Carter.
Um, you irrigated, yeah?
I was concerned
that the lac might extend to the joint.
For nine hours?
Well, I thought I should wait on you.
You think Ike's serving burgers this early?
I really need a burger.
What is up with you?
I think we've got a case
of, uh, sympathetic pregnancy going on here.
Excuse me?
I have all the symptoms-- nausea, gas,
increased salivation, cravings.
I got to pee all the time.
You had all that before I got pregnant.
You know what? I have to sit down.
Just get me whatever you're getting, okay?
All right. See?
We're together in this.
( sighs ): Oh.
Morning.
Morning.
When are you due?
Oh, another month or so.
I love kids.
When my wife was pregnant with ours,
it was... it was the best thing ever.
Yeah, it's pretty great.
Yeah. We're divorced now.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Women are never more beautiful than when they're pregnant.
( laughs ): Ooh.
I wish it felt that way.
Hey...
don't let anyone ever tell you you're not sexy.
Because you are sexy.
Thank you.
Any real man
knows that there's nothing better
than making love to a round, smooth,
nurturing, mother-to-be.
I-I hope you don't take that the wrong way.
There's a right way to take that?
I didn't mean to offend you.
You know what? It's okay.
Can I touch it?
Excuse me?
Your belly-- can I touch it?
CHUCK: Whoa, hey, what's going on?
You know what? We need to go.
What are you doing?
I was just talking to the lady.
He wanted to touch my belly. Was he hitting on you?
Ease up, pal. I don't see a ring on her finger.
Oh.
( grunts )
Whoa.
Oh, God, my lip.
Must be the hormones.
It was flagrant assault.
I already called the cops.
My lawyer's on the way. You molested me first.
I asked you an innocent question.
It was not innocent.
That caveman decked me for exercising
my freedom of speech.
Sit still. As long as I'm stitching your lip,
you have no freedom of speech.
He was defending me.
You didn't need
defending.
I was just being friendly.
KOVAC: Order a nasal series
and let me know when his X rays are back.
Aah! What a creep.
Chuck could have punched him in his teeth.
That way, they can't talk.
Did he apologize?
No, but he called the cops.
To what, to turn himself in?
No. Come on, we have to have a little chat.
TAGGART: Oh, no, I understand.
Yeah, have a great time.
Yeah, next weekend.
Good morning.
Hey there.
What's wrong?
Oh, it's Alex's birthday tomorrow.
Yeah, I heard.
Well, I wanted to throw him a party or something,
but Austin's his only friend,
and his folks are taking him skiing
for the weekend.
Get him a clown. Yeah, good idea.
What's wrong with a clown?
Kids love clowns.
CARTER: Okay, next time, just inject 5cc's
of sterile fluroscein
and observe under a woods lamp.
I wasn't sure about the fluroscein.
Well, then come find me. Don't just wait, okay?
I didn't want to interrupt the meeting.
Neela, we were ranking
fourth year med students in there,
and everybody agreed that you're really bright,
and we really like working with you.
Someone spoke poorly of me?
Well, nobody in particular.
Was it Dr. Chen?
Because she's had it in for me...
Neela, you have to be more decisive.
Okay, you have to be more
proactive.
They feel I'm too passive?
Tell you want--
for the next four hours, you are a doctor.
I want you to carry a minimum of three patients at all times.
LOCKHART: Rescue 37, county base, go ahead.
Start their workups, order the labs and meds,
and present back to me only after
you've put your own diagnostic plan into action.
Today, you're a shark.
Shark?
Keep swimming,
or you die.
Car versus nursing home medi-van.
We're getting the driver and at least two passengers.
Anybody unstable?
Good vitals on all of them, ETA nine minutes.
I've got the first. Okay.
Okay, so work up these three.
In fact, just work up these two. That's enough.
And then go help Gallant.
PRATT: Hey, Mike...
( sighs )
...I'm leaving that stripper in curtain four
with the broken toe just for you. Try not to TUBE her.
What? What are you talking about?
Totally Unnecessary Breast Exam.
I think you're projecting.
Oh, Michael, hi.
New onset seizure needs to go to medicine,
post-op appy with fever needs a belly CT.
Call me if there's a problem.
Got you.
You feel like buying me some breakfast?
Maybe another time.
Deb, there's a lady waiting for you in Triage.
Gallant can take her. Uh, it's not a patient.
She's a nurse. She says she works for you.
Have a good shift, Neela.
Lucia?
I'm sorry to bother you at work.
Did something happen with my dad?
No, the night nurse agreed to stay late.
I'm not coming back.
Your father won't wear the diaper,
he throws food at me.
When I try to help dress him,
he yells very bad words.
I-I appreciate your patience.
( sighs )
You know, this isn't really him.
I know he's a very good man, Dr. Chen, but,
I can't do it anymore.
Look, if you could just give me a few days
until I can get a replacement?
Here is my address.
You can send my last check there.
And give him this for me.
Lucia...
I pray for him.
I don't like working on old people.
Or children. Or drunks.
And what's with all the sick people?
They make it such a drag, huh?
Listen, he's just motivating you.
For the match rankings.
You know, maybe they're right.
Maybe this job's just too...
fast for me, too unpredictable.
It's a big hospital.
If the ER's not a good fit...
Then what?
The NICU made me want to jump off the roof.
Pedes is filled with screaming brats
and anxious parents.
And OB/GYN's a lifetime of overnights
and malpractice suits.
I could go into research or teaching,
but is that really why I became a doctor?
I'm sorry. Were you talking to me?
( laughs )
This-This place is so up-and-down.
I mean, you learn to ride through the rough days.
I did.
You were probably good from the start.
Are you kidding me?
I came in young, dumb and scared.
At least you-- you're good with the books.
You really like it here?
I wouldn't stay if I didn't.
MAN: Luis Sanchez, MVA passenger.
Deformed upper right leg, probable femur fracture.
Oh, ouches. Don't!
You give anything for pain?
Pressure's too low-- 90/70.
He's from a nursing home?
Make it stop. It hurts. Is this a change in mental status?
I don't think it's from the crash.
Nursing home said he fell off a roof in December.
Can you call my wife? I have a wife.
I think he's got
some kind of traumatic brain injury.
Lower extremity fracture with borderline pressure.
Need to rule out an intra-abdominal bleed. Trauma one.
Two more MVA's rolling in behind.
( pained wailing ) Okay, on my way.
Can we medicate him?
Once his pressure's up.
LOCKHART: Here's the SonoSite.
Two liters of saline wide open.
Maybe we can draw up analgesics?
Luis, do you have any allergies?
I don't know, I don't know.
Are you taking any medications?
Mary gives me my pills.
What kind of pills?
A blue, a green, and three white.
Okay, Morrison's looks good.
No blood in the belly.
Pressure's up to 100. Can we push morphine?
We need a med list and allergy history first.
Call the home. Make it stop! It hurts!
Pocket Doppler and Surgilube for the pedal pulses.
I don't like.
Cole's potassium is 3.2.
40 of K-Dur p.o.
Suze, I'm not going to do it.
Then he's going to press charges.
I have a couple of other things.
Hey, we're the ones who should be pressing charges.
Yes, this is Neela Rasgotra from County.
For what? Having a uniquely disturbing pick-up line?
I need to speak to a nurse taking care of a Luis Sanchez.
I believe the name's Mary? Just say you're sorry.
They're done patching up your freak.
Give a half bolus, seven per kilo IV.
When will the nurse be available?
Can you read me the list from the chart then?
Why not? Can Mrs. Herrero eat?
Two gram sodium diet, 1800 calorie ADA.
I'm sorry you've had a bad morning, sir,
but Luis Sanchez has had an even worse one,
so could you please fax us the med list
as soon as possible?
( screams )
How about a magician?
Magicians are cool.
Last year he wanted a pig embryo to dissect.
You really think a magician's gonna do it?
Lucy Kilmer, another van passenger from the nursing home.
History of laryngeal cancer, complains of low back pain.
Where was she sitting?
Middle row, belted.
Vitals good, resps 12.
Any belly pain, ma'am?
No. I'm okay.
Carter needs some help with the van driver.
I have just the thing for him-- paint ball.
Good idea, put a gun in his hand.
50 more of fent is in.
Flail segment on the left with hemo pneumo.
Betadine and size eight sterile gloves.
What do you need?
Tachy at 126. The guy next door needs meds
but we have no drug records or reliable medical history.
Call the nursing home. I did.
They're going to get back, but I doubt it will be very quickly.
You tell them it was urgent?
They seemed very disorganized. I'll need
a second thoraseal on the other side.
Mr. Joss, do you keep paperwork on the patients you drive?
He's not breathing.
Give me some in-line traction and let's get ready to bag him.
Need a doctor in here.
The lady's having trouble with her trake.
Ten blade, and a 32 French.
Neela, go with Sam.
BP holding at 106 systolic, sats still 91.
Okay, bag him up.
Her trake is out.
She must have just pulled it.
She needs a new one.
Number four shiley, uncuffed.
Okay, I'll call a doctor.
No, no, I can do it.
You need some Surgilube.
Right.
Okay, ma'am, extend your neck
and look up at the ceiling.
On your third breath. Ready?
In, out.
In, out.
Big breath in...
( inhales deeply )
( coughing )
Pulse ox is coming up.
Let's tie it in.
Got it.
Thank you.
Doctors?
We don't need no stinking doctors.
Neela!
She could use some ice chips.
Sats are coming up.
Transport information on the passengers.
Found it in his jacket. Go. Go!
Into the pleural space, chest tube's in.
Systolic's up to 120 after two liters.
I've got the discharge summary from the last hospital visit.
Okay, when was it? Three weeks ago.
Good. Good enough.
Dr. Gallant, Mr. Anderson is vomiting blood in CT.
Okay, titrate morphine to pain, start with four milligrams.
Hemocue's 15, I don't think he has any internal bleeding.
Stop. Not the morphine.
Violent nausea and vomiting with morphine
during his last hospitalization.
What do you want to do?
I'll be right back.
LEWIS: Jerry, tell him.
It is not unmanly to apologize.
Come on, just do it and let's get out of here.
I'm exhausted.
Okay, okay, I'm going in.
Did Dr. Gallant go to CT yet?
Yeah, he's already down there.
Has there been a fax for me?
Were you waiting on a price list
from Crazy Joe's Party Supply?
Yeah, who knew piñatas were so pricey?
Damn it.
Is everything okay, Neela?
I've got it taken care of.
Neela, Mr. Lavecchia's
urine is four plus for blood.
Uh, kidney stone. Push 30 of Toradol.
I pulled Demerol.
No, give the Toradol 15 minutes to work before we try narcotics.
All right, I'll put it away.
No, I'll take it.
( groaning )
Pain scale eight out of ten.
We need to give him something.
The discharge summary says
he got post-op Demerol in the hospital.
Good. How much?
Abby, triple lumen CVP kit?
Go ahead. I'll take care of it.
Oh, please...
Please stop hurting...
Please.
All right, Luis, this is going to make you feel much better.
( crying )
It's so sweet to see them growing.
Babies?
Men.
Dr. Lewis, Mr. Hemorrhoid in Three is asking for you.
Oh, no, I'm not here. I left an hour ago.
( loud crash ) Crazy bastard!
Get off me! Pull his hair!
Ow!
Chuck, stop!
Kick him!
Oh, my God!
( laughing )
Stop it, Chuck.
Get your hands off me.
Come on, come on, guys.
Come on, Chuck.
Okay. All right, all right.
It don't hurt no more.
You made it go away.
Isolated femur fracture awaiting ortho.
No evidence of occult blood loss,
vitals stable, medicated for pain.
Good. Wheezing in two, sudden onset visual loss
in the eye room. Which one should I take?
Both.
Keep it up.
I never touched the guy.
He says you handled him in an aggressive manner.
She handled him? In his dreams.
There are a number of potential lawsuits here.
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.
In addition to the hospital and the Emergency Department,
he's threatened to sue the city, the county and the Fire Department.
I'm not even on duty.
I need this to go away.
So either I get the lawyers down here or...
No, fine, I will talk to him.
What? No. No.
He's weird, not nuts.
I will talk some sense into him.
The hernia's trapped outside the abdominal wall.
Is that bad? You ready to round?
Deep breath, Bobby.
( inhales deeply )
Better? Yeah, thanks.
A surgeon will come see you.
It's a straightforward procedure,
nothing to worry about.
Cool. Inguinal hernia?
Incarcerated.
Reduced without sedation-- the kid's tough.
20-year-old asthmatic, came in with a sat of 89.
On his third albuterol with atrovent, received 60 of pred.
Aeration's improved but still 92 on room air.
Did you call medicine?
They're on their way.
Can I get some more water?
Tigerlilly Lee, 24, complaining of cotton mouth.
I'm like parched all the time.
History of polydipsia led me to check her blood sugar-- 642.
New onset diabetes, not DKA'ing yet.
You should give ten...
Ten units of regular insulin,
two liters of saline and I consulted endocrine.
Back to bed.
Hey!
( quietly ): Very good.
She's looking much better.
Yeah, back to her usual self.
Viral gastroenteritis.
I consulted Kovac, as you were too busy.
Thanks for your help, doctor.
Mr. Silvio, four ounces every hour,
and don't let her chug 'cause she'll just throw it back up.
Oral rehydration, avoided an IV, in and out in an hour.
The girl is on fire. Yeah, you told us so.
I told you so.
Told you what?
Nothing. Attending gossip.
Hey, did you check out the van driver?
Uh, yes. He needs an exploratory laparotomy.
We're moving him up.
So?
His lungs re-expanded, 350cc's out the left tube...
No, no, no, no. Not that.
Last night, the surgeon.
Oh. Uh, it was... splendid.
Is that British for "sweaty and hot"?
I don't kiss and tell.
Abby, radiology's bouncing back your patient.
Temp's up and he's unresponsive.
I'm gonna need some dirt later.
Our gift shop sucks.
You couldn't find anything?
The best I could do is a novelized version of the Matrix Reloaded.
I had them fax over a menu so you could see.
"Mr. Hyde's Tavern."
It's a haunted mansion restaurant.
Strawberry bloodshake? Tarantula fries?
That's cool, right?
I want it to be something he'll remember, something special.
What, a bloodshake's not special?
This is Frederika Torrez.
Hurt her ankle during tennis team practice.
Who put this on?
Sister Margaret. Um, she's my coach.
Did she come with you?
Yeah, she's out in the waiting room with the other girls.
Did you roll it inside or out?
Uh... I can't really remember.
SAM: The toenail's bruised.
Did you do anything else besides twisting it?
I don't think so.
Are you sure you didn't jam your toe, or kick something?
Okay, there's this really creepy guy
who keeps on flashing us during practice
from outside the fence.
You know, opening his coat
and he's naked underneath.
I mean totally. It's really gross.
Yeah, I bet. Sister Margaret called the cops
last time, but he got away before they showed up.
Uh-huh...
So today we just got sick of it,
and we all ran out after him. Got some pretty good whacks in before he got away.
You beat this man up?
Sister Margaret also teaches us self-defense.
She's cool.
How bad did you hurt him?
I'm pretty sure we kicked his ass.
Need a little help here.
He's unresponsive, temp's 105.8.
He didn't have a fever before. Luis? Luis.
He needs a septic workup.
CBC, blood cultures times two, cathed UA, and do a spinal tap?
Yeah, rule encephalitis and meningitis.
Oh, no.
All right, roll him.
You want Ativan? Four migs.
Come on, push it. Is he on aphenothiazine?
What does the medical record say?
I'll see if it came in.
You didn't get it yet?
Doctor, the headache's worse.
I'll have the nurse give you another shot.
Did you look at my X-rays yet?
Soon, Mrs. Jenkins. Hey, slow down, girl,
you're showing us all up.
Luis Sanchez is seizing. Who?
Brain injury guy from the nursing home.
I thought he was stable. Not anymore.
Six of ativan on board.
And load a gram of dilantin.
I've got the med list.
Why didn't you have it before?
The fax wasn't in. The driver's transfer record was only three weeks old.
All right, read it to me.
Baclofen, Omeprazole, Keflex, Tolterodine.
The only thing new is they switched his antidepressant
two weeks ago-- Phenelzine?
It's a monoamine oxidase inhibitor.
What'd you give him?
Morphine. All right, we need to start
thinking about an airway. No, Demerol.
You gave him Demerol?
He had nausea with morphine, so...
Oh, God, it's serotonin syndrome.
What?
You never give Demerol with an MAO inhibitor.
It can be fatal.
Let's get him on O2 at 15 liters.
Spinal tap, come on.
Prep and drape!
WEAVER: Your better half got that idiot
to drop the whole thing.
She did?
What do we have to do?
You don't have to do anything.
Do you mind if I lift your shirt up a little bit?
Don't push your luck, creep.
( mouthing words )
Don't worry. I'll get Chuni to put battery acid in his IV.
Hey, Jerry, will you check on my X-rays?
What's up with you?
I defended Susan from some freak.
And ended up getting her molested.
I can't watch this anymore.
George Deakins, mugged under the Michigan Avenue bridge.
Lovely spring day.
You'd think you could take a walk by the river.
Okay, Mr. Deakins, could you remove your coat, please?
I'd rather not.
In order to examine you, I need to listen to your chest.
It's all right, George.
Whoa, they steal your clothes?
Uh, yeah.
Okay, get him a drape.
Cocktail napkin ought to do it.
So, they scratched you up pretty good.
How many guys were there?
Must have been
like four or five.
With long nails... and a tennis racket.
So, George...
You a sports fan?
Fluid looks clear. B.P.'s sky high,
220/140. Start an esmolol drip.
Hypertension part of the syndrome?
Who pushed the Demerol for you?
They should've verified. Nobody. I did.
There was no nurse?
I was called out of the room.
It's not Abby's fault.
I'm more than capable of pushing pain meds.
Shouldn't push anything without medical history.
Didn't want to wait for the nursing home-- he's in pain.
Who did you speak to, by the way?
The receptionist.
Oh, so you didn't actually talk to a doctor or a nurse.
Dr. Carter... I couldn't. They were busy.
No. What you can't do is take no for an answer
when you have an unstable patient with an unknown history.
I gave her the order.
I thought you said morphine.
Neela saw it was contra-indicated,
so I changed it to Demerol.
Then what, you forgot?
I was a bit preoccupied.
Had someone crashing in C.T. Dr. Gallant...
Myoclonus and hyper-reflexia.
Isn't there a serotonin antagonist
we can give him? No. We just have to wait.
For what?
To see if he lives.
DEAKINS: When can I go?
You have to talk to the police first.
The police?
About my mugging?
Yeah.
Still haven't left?
I don't want to talk about it.
I'm going to kill you.
Baby, please, I am sorry.
Listen, please...
How does a guy like that get to be such a freak?
Born with a Y chromosome?
Oh, so all men are twisted?
LEWIS: You said it. You hate men.
If it wasn't for sperm and heavy lifting, you'd all be useless.
You know, I can't wait to pop this baby out so men'll quit
looking at me either like I'm Mother Teresa or the cover of Maxim.
It's not just men-- come on, the world's full of degenerates.
Yeah, and the sad part is they always get away with it.
( screaming )
Temp's still up, 104.
Another 200 of I.V. dantrolene.
How come there's no written order on this chart?
We were busy-- I called it out on the run.
Demerol, 50-milligram I.V. push,
verbal order, 10:23.
Dr. Gallant, can I speak with you for a moment?
Sorry, you're right. It's more like 10:45.
Pulse ox down to 82.
He's not moving any air.
Too much ativan?
Maybe, or neurologic damage from the hyperthermia.
Okay, let's open an intubation tray.
Bag him on 100 percent, andetomidate and sux.
His wife and daughter are here.
LOCKHART: Suction's ready.
CARTER: Call Respiratory for a vent.
LOCKHART: Sats are up to 89 with bagging.
Take 'em to the family room.
Neela, come on, come on, you're doing the tube, let's go.
TAGGART: Welcome to the perv ward, Mr. Deakins.
You put me in a special room?
Don't worry, they're all special.
Uh, pervert's a relative term, honey.
Call me honey again, I'll come over there
and give you the longest catheter in the world.
KOVAC: Neosporin to the lac,
B.I.D.
So, I've got our problem solved.
Alex's birthday party.
Aw, thanks for the help, Luka, but I think it's my problem.
You see, that's your first mistake.
Anyway, a plan is in motion, arrangements are being made,
and everything is under control.
Keegan's C.B.C. isn't back yet, and I need a head C.T. on Hong.
Do me a favor, would you: call United and check on my departure time?
What, are you flying through Paris? Amsterdam.
Hello?
Frank.
Hey, Frank. What's up? How are you?
Just thought I'd stop by on my way out from rehab.
How's that going? How do you think?
They split my chest open like a baked Montana trout.
You don't just bounce back, you know.
Want to see my scar? No, but there's a guy in two who might want to touch it.
You look good. You do.
I can do two miles on the treadmill.
I haven't been able to do that since... well, ever.
Where the hell are my last two paychecks?
Ah, I've been holding them for you.
Where, in your wallet?
When are you coming back?
I don't know, you know?
Rehab's like a spa vacation.
My old police benefits are a charm.
I don't really miss this sideshow.
Is Dr. Pratt around?
He's off today.
Tell him I owe him a beer.
Sure thing.
Look...
my doctor's not ready for me to come back to work yet.
It's going to be awhile, but... I do miss everybody.
Just wanted to say that.
Four-year-old with left upper quadrant pain.
Found by father with shortness of breath and confusion.
He kept asking for me even though I was... I was standing right there.
It was like he couldn't see.
Tachy at 144, resps 42.
B.P. 86/55. Hey, big guy,
when did your tummy start hurting? No, Mommy, no.
She's on her way, buddy. He's not making any sense.
Any medical problems?
No, he's always been healthy.
77 systolic.
How are you doing, Tevin?
I don't like horses.
He's altered. Have a pedes intubation tray ready
and squeeze in those fluids.
Hey, do you know what this is?
Your son's spleen
is enlarged-- it may be acting like a sponge,
soaking up his blood so it can't circulate.
So, what can you do to stop it?
Hopefully, transfusions
will keep him stable until we know what's causing it.
First liter in, pulse in the 70s.
Okay, keep the N.S. coming.
Femoral line kit. I'm with him every day.
I-I-I-I take care of him.
Nothing like this has ever happened.
Does your son have a history of Thallassemia or sickle cell disease?
My wife has the trait, but I tested negative.
I want to go on the ferris wheel.
Okay, as soon as you're better, buddy.
I-I-I don't know what that other thing is.
Thallassemia? It's a hereditary anemia.
Here you go. Huh?
Keep talking to him-- it's the best thing
you can do right now.
Blood's here. Femoral line's in.
Run them on the infuser.
You think it's occult trauma?
Should we call in Social Work?
I don't know. It could be malignancy, emoglobinopathies...
That's some differential.
Yeah. Add a sickle screen and HIV to the labs.
We didn't realize Luis was recently put on phenelzine.
There's an interaction between the drugs
that creates a condition known as serotonin syndrome.
You get very sick.
Like when they gave him the morphine that time?
Uh, worse. You get high fever,
high blood pressure, rapid heart rate,
muscle spasms.
How long does that last?
A few days at least.
But it's very serious.
Up to 30 percent of people with serotonin syndrome die from it.
So 70 percent survive?
Yes, ma'am.
They didn't think he'd ever wake up after the fall, but he did.
Good. Good. That means he's a fighter.
He's really smart, you know?
I mean, he was going to go back to school before the accident.
Then I got pregnant again.
My dad hired him on at his roofing business.
They don't usually work when it's icy,
but there was a job
that he wanted to finish before Christmas.
Why are you saying you did this?
It doesn't change anything, and I'm partially to blame.
And that makes it okay to lie?
Neela, do you want to match, or don't you?
Only if I deserve to.
You do, so let this be my fault.
Hey, patellar dislocation in curtain four needs a reduction.
How's Luis?
He's, um... he's stable.
It's looking pretty good.
Is there something that I should know about?
No.
All right, well, you did what you were told.
Gallant's a supervising resident.
He should've known better than to order up a drug
without verifying a current medical history.
He didn't. I did.
You ordered the Demerol?
I assessed it. I ordered it. I pushed it.
And you didn't run it by an attending or a resident?
No.
And you did it because I asked you
to be more autonomous?
We found an Arabic interpreter
for your belly pain lady.
Thank you. All right,
we need to talk about this-- the three of us.
Everything okay?
Fantastic.
Oh, Lavecchia's results.
Kidney stone from this morning?
No hydro, pain free with Toradol and ready to go home.
Just like you said. Didn't need the Demerol after all.
You still have the vial? Put it back in drug lock-up.
I used it for another patient.
KOVAC: Sam, did you get labs back on Tevin?
How's Tevin doing?
He's doing much better, thanks.
I want to go home.
Mr. Walker...
Hey, you want to pick out a sticker?
Tevin tested positive for, uh, sickle cell anemia.
That's impossible-- I told you, I don't carry the gene.
Maybe there was a mistake with your test.
Maybe there was a mistake with your test.
What your son has-- splenic sequestration--
is consistent with sickle cell, and I think he has a form
that's very... You're not listening.
I told you, I went to a genetic counselor.
He said I'm not a carrier, that our son could not get
the disease unless both parents are.
That's true.
So, what, you're saying I'm not his father?
What I'd like to do is send his blood
for a more advanced test... just to be sure.
Send my blood, too.
Test me again.
Neela... Carter wants to talk to me after my shift.
I told him what happened. You what?
I didn't think it was right for us to lie about it,
so I thought it'd be better to get it out now.
Nobody needed to know, Neela-- that was kind of the point.
Please, someone! Please help! Something's wrong!
He went into v-tach,
unsuccessful cardioversion at 200.
Get him off the vent and bag him.
Please, he can't be dying.
Charged to 300. Clear.
No change. Try 360.
Need any help?
Amp of epi after the next one.
MARQUEZ: Charged. Clear.
V fib, 100 of lidocaine.
This is not supposed to happen.
Go find Dr. Carter now.
Let's go, 360 again.
Clear.
Come on, hit him again. 360.
MARQUEZ: Clear.
GALLANT: Still in fib.
CARTER: All right, 360 again. Clear.
Asystole.
How long has it been?
Should we try the high dose epi?
42 minutes.
Run the dopamine wide open.
We still have time.
Or we can pace him.
Neela...
Let's try pacing him.
WEAVER: Tie off the lines,
leave the E.T. for the coroner.
Carter, go inform the family and then meet us in the suture room.
Are his tests back?
They, uh, confirmed my diagnosis...
but the good thing is most kids do very well
with folate and prophylactic antibiotics.
Good. That's good.
I, uh, also ran your blood through.
The tests indicate that...
Is there anything affecting my health
that I need to know about?
Not really, no.
So all that piece of paper is going to tell me
is whether or not he's got my genes.
Either way, he's still my son.
I'm his father.
From a medical standpoint, it's a bit more complicated...
Liza... my wife and I--
we, um... we went through a rough patch
about five years ago.
We broke up for a few weeks.
She got pregnant right after we got back together.
We've been happy ever since.
She's going to want to know about Tevin's condition.
Mm.
I'll tell her that I'm a carrier.
He got it from both of us...
and he's going to be okay.
He's in here, Mrs. Walker.
Honey, is he all right? He's fine, he's fine.
Did you get his labs back?
( sighs )
Is he the father?
Yeah.
Hey, uh, I didn't mean to keep ragging
on your suggestions before.
Maybe Mr. Jekyll's isn't such a bad idea.
Mr. Hyde's.
Look, I... I know I'm not exactly Carol Brady,
so I just really wanted it to be something special.
It will be.
Just be ready to go in half an hour.
I have to pick something up, okay?
Was the med list current?
Kerry, I think we should stick to protocol.
As the Attending, I'd like to have a chance
to review the case with my staff before we do this.
Was the med list current or not?
It was recent.
It wasn't completely up to date.
And no one checked with the nursing home?
I tried.
You tried?
Abby, why didn't you push the meds?
I was called out of the room,
but the result wouldn't have been any different.
As the nurse, it's your responsibility
to double-check
allergies and interactions.
I thought that had been done,
to the best of anybody's ability.
This is a case of trying to manage a patient's pan
with incomplete information.
I suspect a jury isn't going to see it that way.
Who made the decision?
I did.
You did?
So now we let medical students push pain meds
without any supervision?
No, that's not what happened.
CARTER: I was with a critical care patient.
Neela did exactly what I told her to.
Actually, that's not... She's just trying to protect me.
Do you all need a few minutes to get your stories straight?
What does it say on the chart?
Exactly what I've been saying.
I ordered up the drug and Neela pushed it.
And is that accurate?
Like I said, I wasn't in the room.
Simple question-- Is it accurate?
As far as I know, yes.
A young man comes in here
and dies of a lethal drug reaction
that could have been prevented
with one phone call.
Next time, why don't we just send a blank check
to the family's attorney?
SAM: Mom.
Mom.
Son of Sam is back.
What are you doing here?
Luka picked me up. It's amazing.
We gotta go, though. We gotta go.
Hold on. MARQUEZ: I'll take those, Sam.
Come on. If we hurry now, we can get there by 11:00.
What are you talking about? Let's go, let's go.
And what are you wearing?
Luka said I have to wear a life vest
if I want to get on the boat.
SAM: Boat?
Isn't it awesome?
It's, like, bigger than our whole apartment.
Wow, you really went a whole other direction.
A weekend in the great outdoors,
fishing, camping, burning s'mores.
S'mores?
Do you even know what that is?
Yeah, that white thing on a stick.
Come on, you got to see inside.
Wait, where are we going?
I rented a spot at Lake Geneva.
Bottom of the ninth, two outs, nobody on
and here comes Kovac with the clutch homer.
Is that baseball?
Mm-hmm.
( horn honking )
How are you going to back this thing out?
Mr. Joss' triple-A repair went well.
He's stable in the ICU,
and Dr. Edson's finishing up
on the perirectal abscess right now.
Uh, and do you know a cheap red wine
that goes with spicy food?
I have a date.
Two nights in a row?
It's with the teacher tonight.
Okay.
Zinfandel.
I'm not completely comfortable with waking up with one man
and going out with another the next night.
Well, if we were guys,
we'd be talking about carburetors right now.
So, you don't think it's... slutty?
No.
I just won't sleep with him.
That sounds like a good plan.
Good-night. Good-night.
Women plan, God laughs.
Hey, when did I become the guru of sluttiness?
Did you start the banana bag on Vern? Three times.
He keeps going off to the bathroom and coming back drunk.
I think I should delete emergency medicine
from my match list.
It was one mistake, and I pushed you too hard.
No. What they said about me
in your meeting was all true.
Look, you're a talented doctor,
and you did a lot of good things on the shift today.
Nothing I did on this shift can convince me,
or anyone else, that I belong here.
Well, yesterday, you were a little too cautious.
Today, you were a little too reckless.
Somewhere in the middle
is the way to practice emergency medicine.
I just want you to know
I shouldn't have left you alone with the patient
until he was stable.
It's my fault.
What you did was the sweetest, dumbest thing
anyone has ever done for me.
Well, something like this
could've derailed your career.
The worst that'll happen to me is...
discipline, counseling.
I'll be all right.
You don't look all right.
Seems kind of silly now,
but out in the bay this morning, I was, uh...
...was thinking about asking you out.
I was thinking of saying yes.
Neela, I have the cefoxitin for Mr. Martin.
I just need the extension tubing.
( sniffles )
Are you okay?
I'm fine. I'll take care of it.
Let me help you find it.
I said I can do it!
Bottom drawer.
( crying )
Well, uh... ( clears throat )
I suppose it's time to call it a night.
You're welcome to stay a little while.
No, no, no.
I really should get going.
I'll get my coat.
I'll help you find it.
It was such a lovely evening, and, uh,
I'm so glad that the girls like each other.
Ella's a great kid.
Oh, and it was really good of you
to pick her up from school.
Thank you so much.
Uh, you want me to carry her to the car for you?
No, no. No, I'm fine.
I can manage.
So...
good night.
CARTER: You should've come and talked to me.
You know why I backed you up in there?
'Cause if Weaver knew the truth...
you'd be done.
( clears throat )
I know you went out on a limb for me, but...
I could just say I got confused.
Yeah, you could've...
until you falsified the chart.
But...
That's a felony.
Okay... ( clears throat )
Well, then I got to go tear it up.
It's too late. Why? Why? Why?
It's just... it's just one entry
on an otherwise blank order sheet.
Okay, nobody's going to even know it's missing.
We can go talk to Weaver again.
It's too late!
It's already up in Legal.
You know, you guys... you guys sit up there
and you decide who's going to go and who's going to stay.
I mean, why did you have to push her?
Hmm? Why'd you have to push her?
The only reason she screwed up
is because you scared her into thinking
she wasn't good enough!
She wasn't cutting it!
( quietly ): We're talking about you now, Michael.
I wasn't thinking...
I'm sorry.
Yeah.
Me, too.
