Previously on ER:
Welcome back.
How have you been?
Good.
I'm back in med school.
Really?
I know I'm supposed to feel
like I want to carry a baby, but I don't.
Once that baby's inside of you, it's, I mean, it's incredible.
Kerry, I don't want it.
Abby, would you be interested
in studying together sometime?
Sorry?
I'm good at the academic stuff, you know?
But you're good with everything else.
Maybe we could help each other.
Okay.
TAGGART: Four-day-old full-term male.
Mottled, lethargic, retractions.
Has NICU been called?
They're on the way.
Pratt's intubating.
Suction. Tube's too big.
Give me the 3-0. I'm Doctor Carter.
What's his name. Jacob.
It won't advance.
Sat's are good, try again.
Anatomy's distorted. Here, go for it.
Just brought him home.
He started gasping
and sweating while I was feeding him.
Mm-hmm.
Okay, Pratt, bag him.
Equal breath sounds.
200 of cefotax for presumed sepsis.
Where the hell is NICU?
Is he going to be okay?
Yeah, we're taking care of him.
Systolic ejection murmur, weak femoral pulses,
and distress while feeding.
What's your diagnosis, Pratt? Ductal dependent
cardiac lesion.
Matt Gillespie,
R3, pediatrics.
Sam, P.G.E. infusion
at point oh-five mikes, quickly.
Oh, doing your NICU rotation, huh?
Just when I was getting used to my double life in the ER.
Wait, wh-wh-wh-what's happening? Please.
PRATT: We think Jacob might have a heart problem.
Wait, you think?
ABG's back,
metabolic acidosis, minus 18.
Wh-Wh-What does that mean?
It means that his body's not getting enough oxygen,
but the breathing tube and fluid should help with that.
Sam, ten of bicarb,
50 of saline. I only have two hands,
and he only has one line.
Abby, bag him.
Neela, tell cards to meet us in the NICU.
Sam can start the prostins on the way.
We'll take it from here. I'll help you up.
We don't need any help. No. If he starts crashing,
you're going to need an extra set of hands.
SAM: Here, push this.
It can be very difficult to diagnose congenital heart disease.
Well, his doctor saw him yesterday. She missed this?
Well, there may have been nothing to miss.
Sometimes, the symptoms don't present right away.
Well, how serious is this? We don't know yet.
Cards will meet us with the echo and a Rashkind, just in case.
In case of what? Uh, cardiology will talk to you.
I just want to talk to someone
who knows what the hell is going on.
Listen, he may need a septostomy. What? A what?
All right, everybody off the elevator. Out! Why don't we take the next one?
That way, I can explain everything to you.
SAM: Mean's down to 34.
He needs pressors.
Aeration's good, sat's are 93.
He's in
very good hands.
Back off the FIO2.
We don't want to flood the lungs.
He'll be okay once he's got the prostins on board.
When'd you two start your rotation?
About five minutes ago.
Well, the NICU's great: intubations, chest tubes,
umbilical lines-- you'll get to do all sorts
of teeny, tiny, kick-ass procedures.
KATE: Cards is waiting
and Raab is pissed.
You trying to give him a pneumo?
Good luck, you two. Yeah, you're going to love it.
Let's get out of here. I hate the NICU.
Those guys are screwed.
Humphrey Fowler, Ex 33 weeker, day of life 58.
Status post RDS, on vanco for MRSA,
day 19 of 21.
Who names their kid Humphrey?
Please, Abby, it's the last one.
Post-op day 46 for C-CAM repair.
C-CAM? Congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation.
Was on the oscillator, weaning the map and amp.
Born with only one lung, but other than that,
he's doing great, okay? Okay.
You didn't keep flow sheets, index cards?
It's all up in here.
Please tell me you're joking.
( singing ) You don't need any paperwork for this kid.
Bad hypoxic encephalopathy.
His brain's mush...
but, um, his vitals are good.
He can go on like this indefinitely.
Family won't withdraw support?
Two months and about $2 million later,
Mom's still holding out for a miracle.
They're here every day.
He's a paperweight.
There's nothing to do.
Come on, they're waiting for us.
Thank you so much for joining us.
I'm Doctor Raab, director of Neonatology.
We round twice a day, 7:00 and 4:00.
You will come ready to present overnight data
and exams on your patients.
Everyone scrubs for a full three minutes
before you enter the NICU.
No jewelry on the hands-- spreads bacteria.
Not even my wedding band? No, and cut your fingernails.
In 1993, two children
were abducted from this unit.
That explains the little LoJacks around their little ankles.
You will be issued a code for this door.
Do not give your code to anyone.
I tattooed mine on my scrotum.
Believe me, no one'll ever see it there.
Dr. Gillespie, back already?
Another month in the box.
Your stand-up routine might go over on other rotations,
but the NICU is a tough room.
Who do we have here?
Lloyd Roberts, ex 38 weeker
admitted for TTN. and detox.
What's TTN? Transient Tachypnia of the Newborn,
resulting from delayed clearance of the fetal lung fluid.
Good.
Continue, Kate.
Born to 23-year-old G4P4 mom
who used methamphetamine and heroin during pregnancy.
Don't we need to be keeping our voices down?
Confidentiality doesn't exist here.
The quieter we talk,
the harder they listen.
Kate, your plan?
DC the O2, continue amp and gent,
advance the feeds,
morphine taper.
Did you name him yet?
Everyone, meet Virgie.
20-years-plus as a NICU nurse.
Her mission: to protect the babies
from the likes of you.
Haven't had a Thor in a while.
We have a tradition
of giving the babies tough-guy nicknames.
Hard to fight
with a name like Lloyd.
Latest gas on Jacob Kolber.
Acidosis is worse.
What was the final read on the echo?
Come on, people, who picked him up?
Lockhart, he's yours. Go.
Examine your patient.
Cardiology confirmed a critical coarct.
Which is...? Narrowing of the aorta,
usually near the ductus arteriosus.
And why do we care?
Because blood can't get to the lower half of the body.
Why is that bad?
His legs need blood?
If you don't know, don't guess.
Decreased perfusion means acidosis,
shock and heart failure.
His means have been drifting down.
LOCKHART: Lungs are wet.
I can barely palpate the femorals.
Ten of bicarb,
start dopa at 12, crank up the prostins to point one.
He needs the O.R.
But the cardiologist said you'd try medicine first.
The medicine isn't working.
CT surg is backed up, said they'd
get to him in the next 48 hours.
This boy is not waiting 48 hours.
If they can't take him to the O.R., they can take him
to the cath lab for dilation and stenting.
Stenting?
Another way to open a blockage.
It's blocked? You said it was just too narrow.
So narrow, the blood isn't getting through.
Tom, uh, send off LFTs and creatinine,
check for end-organ damage.
TOM: You got it.
KYLE: I-I-I want to talk to that cardiologist again,
all right?
Mr. and Mrs. Kolber,
Jacob is very sick,
but all this is really just a plumbing problem.
Nothing that a CT surgeon can't fix.
Surgery will cure him?
It should, yes.
Dr. Lockhart, he needs
a nickname.
How about Jake?
Sounds tough to me.
Jacob to Jake-- very creative.
Thin mec, delivery room three.
What are you waiting for? Go!
50 cc saline bolus, push it, Tom.
Dr. Lockhart, what are you waiting for?
Go-- you could learn something.
Yeah, I'd like to stay here, if that's okay.
Covering deliveries is part of your job-- go.
Tom, we need another I-STAT to see where we are.
Dr. Raab...
And he needs a foley and another PIV.
I can do that.
He's my patient.
Get CT Surg on the phone and tell them your patient
needs the O.R. right now.
Not in 48 hours, not sometime today, right now.
I'll be right back.
NEELA: So when the DL phone rings
we drop everything and run?
Yup, 24/7.
It means some potentially sick-assed baby's being born.
Kid ends up being fine but you never know.
Can I do the intubation?
If it's indicated, I mean.
Oh, you like this stuff.
The technology's fascinating...
What's wrong with us?
We should be in the easy,
lucrative specialties: Derm... radiology...
Okay, little gunner,
welcome to your very first delivery.
Hey, Matt, just in time.
Six weeks early, no prenatal care.
You have a boy.
First thing, get rid of the gunk
and dry him like crazy.
Warms the baby and reminds him to breathe.
( speaking Chinese )
Good pulse but the cry's weak.
With neonates, it's all about ventilation.
Get them to breathe well and the rest will follow.
Decel down to the 20s..
You got it-- one more big push.
Hand me the bag.
Come on, you can do better than that.
Wake up! Matt!
Head's out, here we go.
We were visiting my cousin.
Baby come too soon.
Don't worry, Dad.
Just needs a little help getting started here.
32-weekers usually do just fine. Matt!
Cord clamps.
Dude, thanks for the heads up.
We would have brought down a second team.
Neela, second set-up.
The ABCs... you know what to do.
Okay, buddy, you just bought yourself a tube.
Call the NICU for back up.
It's a girl.
This baby's not breathing.
RAAB: A NICU admission
is like running a marathon without training for it.
It's an endurance test for patients,
for families and for you.
Eat when you can, sleep when you can,
and when it's time to go home,
get the hell out of here.
Let's round.
Jiang Han's up to 1830 grams.
Room air, q3 feeds.
GROUP: * Blessed be the tie that binds... *
RAAB: Feeder and grower.
Behaving himself nicely.
VIRGIE: Inga's ABG.
Sister's a mess.
( singing continues ) Inga?
Inga?
You had a week to come up with nicknames,
and you failed to.
Dirk and Inga.
I was going to call her Surinder.
It's Punjabi for "warrior."
You're thinking too much.
Inga doesn't sound tough.
Neela, present your patient.
Her pneumonia is worse.
RAAB: Acidotic.
Ventilation's crap.
VIRGIE: Pa02 in the 40s all day.
I think we should consider ECMO.
Cardiopulmonary bypass?
Isn't that incredibly dangerous
on a two-kilo kid?
We need to do something
before the prolonged hypoxia
causes brain damage.
Who can tell me the risk of ECMO?
Overwhelming infection.
Could happen anyway, ECMO or not.
Head bleed.
Parents could end up with a little potato.
We'll get daily head ultrasounds.
That won't prevent a bleed,
just detect it after the fact.
She was doing well until she became bacteremic.
I know it's risky,
but ECMO could get her through this.
She's not getting enough oxygen.
If we do nothing, she'll die.
Are you sure?
How can anyone be sure
about something like that?
Neela, call the profusion team to start ECMO.
Rounds are over.
Thanks.
She already thinks I'm an idiot,
so there's really nothing to lose.
I have your sign-out.
You should get out of here.
I need to talk to Inga's parents about ECMO.
I'm going to be here all night anyway.
Go. I'll talk to them.
No. I'll do it.
Did you change Rocky's diaper?
Yeah.
Why did you do that?
'Cause it was dirty.
My ins and outs are all off now.
All right. I'm sorry.
Not good enough; go find it.
It's in the trash. Find it, weigh it,
and I just might let you get some sleep tonight.
Mr. and Mrs. Tseng...
Sorry. Do you have the results back
on the cardiac cath?
I'm sure Cards will come talk to you
as soon as they have an official report.
I've been waiting for hours.
I'll take an unofficial report.
I'll ask Abby if she's heard.
I need to talk to you.
Waiting's driving me crazy.
The waiting is hard.
Do you know how long it takes to recover
from something like this?
Just, you know, rough estimate?
It's too soon to say.
Would you two come with me?
How long you been here?
Eight days.
We were visiting from Suzhou, China,
when the babies came.
Are they doing okay?
Our son is very strong.
Mr. Tseng?
ECMO stands for Extra Corporal Membrane Oxygenation.
Ready for circuit.
The machine puts oxygen in the blood
and sends it back to Inga's body.
It does the work of her heart and lungs.
Let's go. I'm clamped on high.
I know it looks scary,
but it's her best chance.
Chance of what?
A good outcome.
She'll be healthy?
I hope so.
TOM: Chow time for Dirk.
One of you want to feed him?
I'll go.
JANE: I've got control down low.
Releasing arterial.
Releasing venous.
Clamping bridge.
ECMO on, 2025.
It'll be while before we know how she's going to respond.
I'll let you know.
MEI FAN: If she was born in China,
she'd already be dead.
You don't know that.
My husband and I are lucky.
We went to school, we have jobs as teachers.
But it's not like here.
We wanted our daughter to be born in America,
so she'd have more options.
And she already does.
We don't have hospitals like this.
It wasn't an accident, then. You meant to deliver here.
We sold everything to come stay with my aunt,
have the babies in Chicago.
You're just going to start over, with nothing?
Her life will be better.
Isn't that why your parents sent you to this country, too?
Tom, can you help me out?
Not now. Gotta hang vanco.
( sighing ): Transducers, art lines, no butterflies.
They're in the cabinet by the sinks
on the left.
Been here for nine weeks.
Thanks.
Hi. Hi.
Just came to check on Jacob.
He looks great.
Mm-hmm. His suck is still weak,
but Abby tells me to keep trying.
He'll get there.
You keep trying.
It says here that he may need surgery
again in a few years-- is that true?
That sounds like a question for cardiology.
Occasionally the area
where the aorta was repaired
gets blocked from scarring,
but usually they can take care of it in the cath lab
and avoid another surgery.
That's good to know. Thanks, Abby.
I better get back to work.
But I'll be by later.
It was nice to see you, Mrs. Kolber.
Looks like you're doing well here.
Right.
Abby, take a look at the CO2.
Uh, back off on the rate and check it again in an hour.
You got it.
The parents love you.
Nurses wouldn't give you the time of day
unless they thought you knew what you were doing.
Yeah.
Tell that to my attending.
You should see me on rounds.
( chuckles )
So Kem and I had our
first official tour of the labor and delivery suites today.
How can you call one room a suite?
That counting the bathroom?
Ah.
You're gonna be a dad.
Yeah.
How's it feel?
Scary.
Especially in this room.
I start thinking about all the things that can go wrong,
all the mistakes you can make.
You're going to be a great father.
VIRGIE: Full term forceps in two!
That's my cue.
Hey, Abby...
...you're going to be a great doctor.
Okay... Let's go. Baby time.
Can't-- Got a finger in this kid's pleural cavity. You go.
Alone?
Is that even legal?
I'm right behind you.
Get set up, I'll meet you there.
I'll go with you.
Are you kidding? You have to go home.
You can't go to a delivery on your own.
I dream about blood sugars,
TPN orders, gent doses, boxed kidneys.
Better get used to it if you're going into neonatology.
I haven't slept well for days.
You know, all this whining about how tired you are,
but you never leave.
I hate to break it to you, Neela,
but we will make it through this night without you.
Just trying to help.
( woman groans and pants )
( woman screaming )
ALYSHA: NICU's here.
35 weeker, maternal diabetes, failure to progress.
I thought this was just a forceps delivery.
That, too.
Here comes a contraction, Sarah.
( screaming )
That's it, baby. Big push! We're almost there!
What do you mean "we"?
Hi, I'm Abby from the NICU team.
Is there something wrong?
We're called in for all forcep deliveries.
It's standard procedure.
Baby's heart rate's dropping.
( screaming )
REITMAN: Come on, let's go!
The baby's getting tired!
SARAH: Oh, she's not the only one.
ALYSHA: Nuchal cord.
Bad decel, 54.
REITMAN: Okay, Sarah, one more.
( screaming ) That's it.
Here she comes.
Okay, Sarah, one more.
( screaming )
That's it.
Here she comes.
( screaming ): A girl?!
It's a girl?
It's a girl!
It's a girl!
Good work, baby.
( laughing ) Good work.
Poor tone. Check the heart rate.
I can't feel it.
Well, listen, then. Shallow resps.
FATHER: How is she? How's my girl?
Come on, baby... wake up.
Wake up.
Hold on, I'm gonna get a picture...
Neela, what's the pulse? I'm counting.
It's not that hard. Tap it out.
Where the hell is Matt?
Wow, look at all that hair.
I'm sorry, I'm going to need some room, okay?
Okay.
( baby crying loudly )
She's okay.
You hear that, baby?
She got some lungs.
ALYSHA: Everything cool?
Yeah.
She's gonna have to come upstairs to monitor her sugars,
but, yeah, she looks good.
Congratulations.
Thank you. Thank you.
Ooh, girl, you look just like your daddy.
Except you're three shades lighter.
Babies are supposed to be light when they're born-- I told you.
Don't listen to your daddy, Daphne.
You're perfect.
( pager beeping )
It's Matt.
He's a little late.
It's Inga.
What happened?
Hypertensive. Crit bottomed out.
Ultrasound shows huge brain bleed.
Are you sure?!
Yeah, like we said,
it's always a risk with ECMO.
She's got to come off.
But she'll die.
Well, we can't leave her on, the bleed will get worse.
Hey, Matt, they need you in L&D.
Ah, there's a C-section. I gotta go.
Um, order 20 per kilo of packed cells.
I'll be back soon.
Surgery's on their way to decannulate.
I talked everyone into this.
Nobody, not even you, could talk Raab into ECMO
if she didn't think it was the right thing.
NEELA: She's seizing. Point five of ativan.
I can't take a verbal for a benzo from a med student.
Raab's gone and Matt's in a delivery.
Give her the ativan.
I could lose my job. She's seizing.
That's the least of our worries.
Let's just wait
to see what Matt says when he comes back.
Versed will do the same thing.
You can't give that without a co-signed order.
Watch me.
I'm telling Dr. Raab.
You do that.
She'll kick you guys off the rotation.
She can kick me off. Neela has nothing to do with it.
What am I going to tell her parents?
Versed's in.
You should go home.
Mr. and Mrs. Tseng, I'm sorry.
I screwed up. Inga's brain is toast.
Stop it. You didn't do this.
I've got to call them.
Just go. Raab'll do it.
They should hear it from me.
You know, you're a med student.
I think the attending can handle it.
Just go.
Good night, Neela.
( gasping )
Excuse me, can someone get the door, please?
Hello? Anyone?
Get me the hell out of here!
Oxygen is perfect
the whole time.
When can we take Dirk home?
As soon as Dr. Raab writes her note.
Thank you, Neela.
Inga's not breathing over her ventilator at all.
That's not a good sign, is it?
It will take time before we know
how much neurological function she'll get back,
but her lungs are much better.
She's a strong girl. Yes, she is.
I'm still waiting for you
to fill out Dirk's discharge summary.
I'll get on that.
Cher's a lovely name, it's just, uh,
h-how you've spelled it.
I just wanted it to be different.
Okay.
As long as you're aware.
Poor Chair-- she's doomed.
Unless she meets a nice ottoman some day.
Heard any funny dead baby stories lately?
Here's a good one:
Inga's hydrocephalus is worsening.
EEG shows continued seizure activity.
She's not dead, but she might never wake up.
It's a real laugh.
Bad day, Neela?
Millions of dollars keeping these babies alive.
Half of them die anyway.
Why bother?
Time for rounds.
40 years ago,
Inga was considered a micro-preemie,
borderline viable.
In many parts of the world, that's still the case.
And we saved her
so she can endure a lifetime of seizures,
chronic lung disease, cerebral palsy.
It's a real advance.
We gave Inga a chance.
Her brother's going home today, a normal kid.
But Inga's here now,
gorked out in a level three nursery.
Look, we do our best.
Some kids will end up
hospitalized
for life, and some will go to the prom.
Neela,
there are no guarantees in this work.
If you can't
live with that, I'd suggest
you become a bank teller.
( pager beeping )
We'll pick up again when I get back.
Don't listen to her.
My cousin's a bank teller.
Got held up at gun point last year.
Still here?
I discharged Daphne an hour ago.
Yeah, we're just waiting
for the nurse to take out that IV.
LOCKHART: I can to it.
You're letting a med student touch your IV?
That's brave.
She's territorial.
They teach that in nursing school.
TOM: Abby,
we need you over here.
Just keep some pressure there.
Okay.
Come on, come on.
She's going to miss you guys.
RASGOTRA: No, she won't.
She'll be home.
TOM: He's been tachypnic
all morning, sat's dropping.
He's tiring out.
You put him back on oh-two?
He's going to need more than that.
( alarms )
Diastolic is in the teens.
Widening pulse pressure. He's septic.
Okay, 50cc's of saline,
cultures, start him on amp and cefotax.
What's happening, Abby? ( alarm )
TOM: He's apneic.
Pulse down to 105.
Bag him.
TOM: Five As and Bs in the last hour.
Did anybody page Raab?
911. Okay, Mrs. Kolber... Kyle?
Jacob's blood pressure has dropped.
He's having trouble breathing,
most likely due to a blood infection.
From what? We're sending out cultures.
We won't know for a few days.
He was okay this morning.
Sepsis can come on quickly like this.
We're starting antibiotics to fight the infection,
but we're going to have to put the breathing tube back in.
We were talking about going home.
He's a tough guy.
He'll get through this.
Get together.
Photo for the wall.
Smile.
Fentanyl's in.
Go ahead, Abby.
One more with Dr. Neela.
Oh, it's okay.
SHUANG: We insist.
Neela?
Suction.
Take your time.
Heart rate's good.
Smile.
I see the cords. Tube.
Good-bye, Jiang Han.
Ready to see the outside world?
We're going to keep calling him Dirk
since the name has bring him luck.
Thank you, Dr. Neela.
Mei Fan,
( speaking Chinese )
( sighs )
Mei Fan?
( baby crying )
I want you to have this.
Thanks.
It's strange to be going.
Lots of parents are nervous
when their babies are discharged.
It'll be great.
You'll love having him home.
I know you're right.
Bye, Neela.
See you tomorrow.
TOM: What are my vent settings?
RAAB: 24 over eight. We'll adjust from there.
Order a versed drip and a chest film.
You want to call the tech?
RAAB: Okay, nothing to do now but wait
for the antibiotics to kick in.
I don't know if I can take another round of this.
( softly crying )
Here. Sit.
One of those better be for me.
I just needed to get outside for a minute.
The NICU's so confining, claustrophobic.
There's a reason why Matt calls it the "the box".
Raab's right, you know.
Did you eat anything?
I like science, complete answers,
a plan for everything.
I can't deal with uncertainty.
It gets easier.
I'd sort of planned neonatology since I started medical school.
I'm supposed to be loving this.
Well... the whole purpose of rotation
is to try on different specialties.
I mean, it's okay if you don't...
I had a baby brother.
He died when he was six days old.
I was only three.
Oh.
I remember sitting in my mom's hospital room eating ice cream.
But I don't actually remember him.
The NICU's just so sad all the time.
How can you stand it?
I don't know.
When I was an OB nurse the preemies freaked me out,
thought they looked like frogs.
I was pretty sure I was going to hate the NICU.
But you don't.
No, I don't.
It's not just about the babies.
You know, so much of it is about taking care of the parents.
And it turns out... ( pager beeping )
tragic family dynamics are my specialty.
It's Matt. There's a delivery.
MATT: Full term,
mom's febrile, P-PROM, suspected chorio.
REITMAN: Good work, Sandy.
Oh, my God.
We're almost there. Honey, we're almost there.
LOPEZ: The little boy is officially here.
( joyful crying )
You did it.
We have a baby.
MARINA: Amniotic fluid's cloudy,
kid's had late variables.
Abby?
Wait, you're bagging him?
Sorry, you need to wait over there.
No, that's my son. I'm a doctor.
It's okay, Matt. It's okay.
Honey, what's wrong?
It's just a little blow-by. Let them work.
What's wrong?
He's too quiet.
Give him a minute.
Good chest excursion.
( baby crying )
Thank you very much. That's what we like to hear.
Congratulations, Mom.
And Mom.
He's beautiful.
Is he really all right?
He'll have to go upstairs for antibiotics
because of the chorio.
But right now, he looks great.
I love you.
Hello, little baby.
I had no idea.
Nobody did.
Would you like to cut the cord, Dr. Weaver?
( sniffles )
( baby crying )
( mouths ): Hello, Henry.
Hey.
Your usual.
Thank you.
Bad night?
Jake is maxed out on dopa and epi,
third-spacing like mad.
In the last two hours
his belly blew up in front of our eyes.
I think it's NEC.
Surgery's on their way.
God. His parents here?
No, they're on their way.
I finally convinced them to go home and get some rest,
and then I had to call them back an hour later.
Any word from Inga's parents?
No.
Three days and not a single phone call.
KUB on Jake Kolber.
Free air under the diaphragm and pneumatosis.
Oh, damn it. He's perfed.
Pedes surgery's going to meet us in the O.R.
Come on. Let's go.
Can we wait for his parents?
They should see him before he goes up.
His bowel's dying-- there isn't time.
We need to save the viable tissue
before there's nothing left to save.
He's thrombocytopenic.
Platelets and FFP are onboard in the O.R.
Abby, wh-where are you going?
To surgery.
His intestines were injured as a result of the infection,
and they need to cut out the injured part.
I'm Dr. Corday.
The injury has compromised your son's already tenuous condition.
The sooner we get him to the O.R., the better.
Okay.
Hey. Would you like
to see your little brother up close?
Abby.
Kids aren't allowed in NICU.
Just five seconds.
There he is.
Can he hear me?
Yes, he can.
It's okay. You won't hurt him.
I'm Miranda, your big sister.
Come on, honey.
Thank you, Abby.
Thank you.
Good morning.
Morning.
Where is everyone?
I told them not to come.
I think he's getting a diaper rash.
I'll order some nystatin.
He's three months old today.
You should go home.
I thought that... if I prayed hard enough...
if I showed God how much I believed.
You must be exhausted.
I don't want him to suffer anymore.
My patient has been bumped three times
for so-called emergencies.
Been waiting over 24 hours for ORIF, happened again.
Came up here to see what's so damn important.
Jake Kolber.
It's the congenital heart disease baby
you guys admitted to us a few weeks ago.
Do you remember?
No.
SURGEON: Circumferential necrosis to the jejunum.
There's really nothing viable here.
Damn.
Abby?
The bowel's completely infarcted.
I'm sorry.
We're closing.
So that's it.
Can't live without a gut.
I'm sorry.
( groans )
Where you going?
I'm going to go tell the family.
Just give yourself a minute, okay?
They don't need to hear this immediately.
What am I supposed to do, go out and get a latte
while they stand out there wondering what's going on?
All right, listen.
Maybe you want to wait for the attending to tell them.
Is that what you would do?
Kyle.
( crying )
( crying ): Oh, God.
Is this the Chinese interpreter?
Excuse me.
No, I don't understand what you're saying.
I've already called them.
I was connected to you.
Please don't put me on hold again.
Hello?
Yes, I'm still here.
I'm not sure if I need Mandarin or Cantonese.
How long will it take?
An hour, maybe longer.
( sighs )
You helped this family, Abby.
They will remember you for the rest of their lives.
Yeah.
I'm hoping you'll give
neonatology serious consideration.
Are you mocking me?
Cause it's really, really not a good time.
No.
You're one of the best students I've ever had.
Thank you.
Bye.
What?
The Tsengs have gone back to China with Dirk.
What?
That was Mrs. Tseng's cousin.
They went back yesterday.
She doesn't know how to reach them.
Come on. We've got work to do.
Tell me this is our last day.
Good morning. How's Henry today?
He's great.
He's raring to get out of here.
All the cultures came back negative,
but we still need to treat for another seven days.
Unless you two allow us to do the LP.
I do taps on babies all day in the E.R.,
and never think twice about it.
Honey, shh. Just do the spinal tap.
We want to take our baby home.
Okay. Abby, you're on.
Okay.
Uh, Dr. Raab,
I would be much more comfortable
if you did the procedure, if you don't mind.
No problem.
I'll be back after rounds.
Okay, thanks.
Let Abby do it.
Kerry...
It's okay, Sandy.
Dr. Raab, what's going to happen to Inga?
If she survives, she'll either be adopted
or put in a long-term care facility.
Should I call social work?
Go ahead, but nobody's going to China to look for them.
This doesn't make sense.
Her mother wouldn't just leave her here.
They're young. They're scared.
Maybe they think Inga would be better off this way.
In a hospital, alone?
If you were in a foreign country, with no money,
no job, and no place to live, who knows?
You might do the same thing.
No, I wouldn't and neither would you.
You can't begin to know what you would do
in the same situation,
and you don't know the first thing about me.
People are complicated.
That's not an excuse for abandoning a baby.
Neela, if you stay that judgmental,
you're going to hate this job.
( fussing softly )
( sighs )
CSF on the first attempt
with Dr. Mom breathing down your neck.
I'm impressed.
You should see how good I am when I'm not post-call.
Wait a minute. Wait, wait.
You stuck a needle in my kid's back
and you've been working for 36 hours?
Actually, it's only been 31 hours.
Tube four, crystal clear.
( cries )
Owen Miller. Bad hypoxic brain injury at birth.
Mom's your real patient.
She's inching towards letting go, needs a lot of help.
Mrs. Miller,
this is David.
Hi. I'm your new medical student.
Ex 34 weeker with mec asp and pneumomediastinum.
Got him off high frequency last night.
That's a big step.
"Mec asp"?
Meconium aspiration.
It's like a foreign language,
but you'll pick it up fast.
Zero red blood cells.
Champagne tap.
Hey, before we go, do you mind taking a picture?
Thank you.
( contended sigh )
Thanks.
Get your butt back down
to the E.R. where you belong.
Bye. Bye.
Congratulations.
Thanks. Thanks.
( snap )
You all signed out?
Yeah.
Ever been to the Sky Bar?
( coughing )
This is disgusting.
I told you.
Why are cigars associated with babies?
This stinky thing really has no place in a nursery.
It's Freudian.
Something about men wanting to have sex with their mothers.
Thank you.
( chuckles )
You know what else I don't get?
Why we're drinking cider instead of champagne.
You're supposed to get champagne for a champagne tap.
Is Weaver that cheap?
Weaver knows I don't drink champagne.
So, you still thinking about neonatology?
Not in a million years.
I hope you didn't let Raab discourage you.
It's more than that.
She thinks you should go into NICU, you know.
Yeah.
You should.
No, thanks.
I bet every attending tries to recruit you.
( chuckles ): Oh, please.
Look who's talking.
Your mind is a sponge.
Maybe, but... you've got that thing.
I don't know what it is, but it's much harder to learn.
I think all that cider's going to your head.
