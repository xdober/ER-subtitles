Previously on ER:
Got a medical transport plane in Kinshasa
waiting to take you back.
( kiss smacking )
( groaning )
( shouting )
Shoot!
( sighs )
( vomiting )
( groaning )
Getting bad out there?
Yes.
Merry Christmas Eve, huh?
If you say so.
WEAVER: You're late.
Yeah, I had to walk from LaSalle.
My bus crashed into a UPS truck.
Whoa.
Weak and dizzy in Six,
LOL with bloody stool in Two
and there's a kid who swallowed
a Christmas tree ornament in Five.
Work them up and send them to Dr. Kovac.
My shoes are soaking wet.
Happy holidays, everybody.
Where's she going?
Home to wait for the Ghost
of Christmas Past to show up.
NEELA: Thanks, Michael.
I was afraid you'd already have it.
No, it's great.
A kid swallowed an ornament?
Yeah, Mom's worried about the wire hanging hook thing.
Take a couple of minutes.
The old lady with the bloody stool
can wait for you to change your shoes.
Thanks. Hey, Abby,
did you get your trinket from Carter?
What?
His Third World care package.
Gone-native junk for everybody.
Look, Kovac's got, eh, some kind of voodoo mask.
I think it's Bangala.
Yeah, they use it to slaughter farm animals
in some kind of satanic ritual.
Oh, here.
Go ahead, it won't bite.
You ever send that box of stuff to Africa, Frank?
Toys For Third World Tots?
Went out last week.
What'd you get?
A box.
A tribal shaman's box.
Medicine men use it to store their potions.
Oh, Lord.
Merry Christmas everybody.
Welcome to Calcutta.
Yeah, come on, come on, that's it.
Hey, what is that?
It's a little bit of Sikh rap.
Sikh rap?
Hey, you ready to go?
No, keep dancing.
She's good.
Okay, I'll be back for the H&Ps.
This one?
WOMAN: Yeah.
( rattling )
Don't you shake it.
( chuckles )
Oh, God, are you a paper saver?
( chuckles )
No.
Mebendazole, how romantic.
Open it.
You like it?
That is beautiful.
Mm... it was my father's.
I want you to have it.
Go on, try it on.
Wow.
It suits you.
Thank you.
So, what'd you get me?
It'd better be good.
( chuckling )
I hope you won't be disappointed.
Come on.
It's, um, kind of sentimental.
Mm-hmm.
( metallic clinking )
Oh...
They were mine when I was little.
( kisses ) Thank you.
There's more.
I want you come back to the States with me.
I want our baby to be born in America.

Well, back to work.
You really don't like the Dixie Chicks?
Everybody likes the Dixie Chicks.
Everybody?
Everybody with any taste.
( Carter speaking French )
He's weak on the right.
Toxoplasmosis.
We got a CT?
No, so treat with Sulfadiazine,
Pyrimethamine, Folonic acid.
Spinal tap?
No, we have to save the taps
for the patients who really need them.
And he doesn't?
If he doesn't improve in a week,
we'll tap him then.
Hi, you looking for me?
How's our Belgian dermatologist?
Oh, suffering from first day shock.
He'll be all right.
So, are you coming tonight?
Yeah. 9:00?
Coming alone?
No.
What?
I think it's great.
( chuckling ): It's nothing serious.
9:00 then.
( engine rumbling )
( indistinct chattering )
Bonjour! Ca vas.
( talking at once )
WOMAN: Oh, come on, it is not that simple.
Imperialism is imperialism,
no matter whether the conqueror claims
that the conquered will be better off.
Again? Mm.
The conqueror brings with him
the seeds of his own destruction.
Heiner Muller.
Very good.
Muller.
Right.
Americans are like sheep.
I don't understand
why they aren't rioting in the streets
of Palm Springs or Atlana.
CARTER: Atlanta. Ta.
Two T's. And Palm Springs?
Nobody riots in Palm Springs,
they're too busy playing golf.
You can't argue democracy hasn't been a positive force
for change throughout the world in the last...
Hiroshima, Chile, Vietnam...
Uh...
Hungary,
Poland, Romania...
Coca-Cola, Marlboro,
McDonald's...
Oh, mon dieu, what I would give
for a Quarter Pounder avec cheese right now.
That's exactly what I'm talking about.
American commercialism is ruining music, film,
indigenous culture around the world.
CARTER: Listen, from what I've heard
of, uh, French rock and roll,
you were well on your way
to ruining French music all on your own.
I thought this was supposed
to be a celebration?
I don't so much mind
American intervention in Iraq.
The Baathists were rapists and mass murderers.
Hear, hear.
But I do mind America callously dismissing
legitimate international concerns.
Just trampling 50 years of carefully crafted diplomacy
in pursuit of it's own
political and economic interests.
Makemba Likasu, Dr. John Carter.
Kem works with the Ministry of Health.
And her friend, Peter.
I have no idea what Peter does?
What do you do, Peter?
Ministry of Finance.
Kem's setting up an ARV demonstration project
for AIDS patients.
Oh, that's great.
Has everybody already ordered already?
MANY: Oui.
Oh, wait, I love this song.
Come on, Walter. Let's dance.
Come on, Walter.
CARTER: Be very, very, careful.
( laughing )
So, what project are you working on?
I'm starting a small HIV/AIDS program
with money from the Global Fund.
Antiretroviral therapy.
Really?
Mm-hmm.
Triple cocktail, here?
Skepticism is well-founded.
We have our doubters.
Well, can you afford to treat millions of patients, right?
I mean, meds cost $15,000 a year per person
and we can't even get IV antibiotics here.
My point exactly.
We're not using American drugs.
Another perfect example
of American commercial self-interest.
I mean, blocking the use
of generics.
After the WTO ruled that poor countries
could ignore drug patents, India developed a generic.
It only costs $200 a year per patient.
Money we also don't have.
What is your alternative, Peter?
Just to watch 30 million Africans die
in the next ten years?
If we can demonstrate
that these programs work,
then we can appeal to the UN, to rich countries,
to our own governments.
I think I just heard someone playing our song.
Imperialist Yankee dollars ride to the rescue again.
It's nice to know we're still needed
for something around here, isn't it?
( chuckling )
Oh, Peter, stop pouting.
Let's dance.
It's Bastille Day, you know?
Vive la revolution!
I won't be forced to say nice things
about the French all day now, will I?
He's not improving.
When did we start him on sulfadiazine?
Ten days ago.
Now do we do a spinal tap?
Yeah.
Is this his wife?
Yes.
Tell her that we need to do
some additional tests.
( speaking French )
I speak English.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Your husband is not getting any better on the medicine,
so we need to do some additional tests.
He's very sick?
Yes.
He will die soon?
Not immediately.
But yes.
How pregnant are you?
Six months.
Do you know why your husband is dying?
AIDS.
And have you been tested?
No.
Your children?
Hmm-mm.
It only takes a few minutes.
Why?
Is there anything you can do
to help us if we are sick?
If you are HIV positive, we can give you medicine
to try and keep you from passing it
along to your baby when the baby is born.
Yes?
Yes.
Dad's dying. End stage.
He's probably got a couple of weeks.
Mom's pregnant, she's got two kids.
One's 18 months, the other's five.
All the tests came back positive.
You got a CD4 count?
She's stage three.
They've been living in the refugee camp.
She had to flee the fighting
in Bukavu last March.
Has she been to a VCT center?
VCT?
Counseling. Community support.
She doesn't need counseling,
she needs antiretroviral drugs.
You want to get her into my pilot program?
She's a teacher,
when her husband dies, she'll be the sole support for her family.
I would think that would make her
the perfect candidate.
I can only enroll ten patients a month.
We're only funded for 200 participants.
Total?
Uh-huh.
How long is your waiting list?
The selection committee is very particular
about who gets in.
How long?
We can only take patients with TLCs under 1200.
They have to live close to the clinic,
they have to agree to participate
for a minimum of five years
and shown consistency
in taking previous drug regimens.
If they fulfill all these criteria,
they're included in the list of candidates
that I present to the committee monthly.
They then select ten to get the ARV drugs.
We have six fully occupied AIDS wards
in this hospital, Dr. Carter.
Every patient in every ward wants to be in my program.
Who would you like me to exclude
so I can take your mother from Bukavu?
( coughing )
Your AIDS drug finally came.
Pharmacy needs you to sign your credit card slip.
Great, thanks.
1,200 bucks.
Yep, Carter's paying me back.
Carter needs antiretrovirals?
What, did he get a stick or something?
No. Patient.
Well, say hello to him for me, will you?
Why don't you write a note?
I'll stick it in.
Leave a little for somebody else?
You're Kovac right?
Med student needs you down the hall.
Call a pick-up for me, will you, Frank?
You get used to the heat.
It's the food-- that's another matter.
Mm. Can't be any hotter
than it was last year in the Sudan.
Thank you, Charles.
So, you've, uh, you've volunteered before?
Yeah, every year for the last eight.
What is that?
Lasagna.
Made with potatoes?
( chuckles )
Excellent.
Halloween candy?
Ooh, anything chocolate?
Hmm.
Who's Elizabeth?
She is a friend from work.
Friend?
She blonde?
She's a redhead, actually.
So, are you in private practice back in the States?
Yeah, I spent
15 years at Women and Children's, O.B. ward.
Oh, yeah? Uh-huh.
I have a patient eight months pregnant, HIV-positive.
Husband's end stage. She's got a couple of kids who are HIV-positive, too.
I'd love it if you'd take a look.
Sure, anytime. How 'bout now?
GINNY: How's her CD4 count?
CARTER: 175, but that should come up with the ARVs.
Ah, good heartbeat, Mommy. Strong.
And the ARVs cut the transmission rate
down to three or four percent,
so, if she uses formula,
that cuts it down to one percent.
Uh-huh. Are you living in the refugee camp?
Yes. And are you still breastfeeding?
Yes.
Celine, you can't breastfeed the new baby.
Uh, you could pass the virus along in your milk,
so we'll get you formula, which is great stuff,
and that will help keep your baby strong.
My milk can make my baby sick?
Absolutely.
Uh, Doctor, can I speak with you a moment?
You're doing great, Mommy.
Listen, she's going to have to breast feed.
No, we get the, uh, formula in the UNICEF packs.
No, it's powdered. You have to mix it with water.
Mm-hmm. She's living in a camp.
She's going to have to get that water from a lake or a river,
and there's a 50% chance that her baby's going to die
from dysentery or cholera.
The three percent chance of contracting HIV
from breast milk-- it's a bargain.
CARTER: I'll get her bottled water.
Eight times a day for six months, a year, two years?
It's possible.
Maybe, but it's not practical.
What do you expect?
Of course they're going to start blowing things up.
MICHELLE: Nationalism, tribalism...
You didn't figure it out with Vietnam?
CARTER: No, we're slow learners.
DAVID: Now you come
begging Europe for help...
Soldiers, money, but not as partners.
No, you just want us to legitimize your misadventures.
What can I say?
I voted for the other guy.
Is it always like this?
The conversation is turning into something of a perennial.
If America is going to insist on bombing
half of the world into some... David, enough.
Really, if they're going to keep... Forget it!
We all get it.
Come on,
let's dance.
Come on.
Dance. Sure.
Okay.
Where's your friend?
From the Red Cross?
ICRC food convoy to Goma.
And yours?
Peter?
He's at conference in Nairobi.
Something about currency fluctuations
in the capital market.
How's your AIDS study coming?
Fully enrolled. All 200.
Really, great.
What about your adherence rate?
100 percent.
Wow.
We have this combination pill,
so patients only have to take two a day.
Really? Mm-hmm.
In America, the patients have to take seven.
Where are you from?
I've been trying to place your accent.
My father was Congolese.
My mother's French.
They met when he was in school in Paris.
Where were you raised?
London mostly,
but my mother remarried.
Moba in the summers with my dad.
What about you?
I was born and raised in Chicago, Illinois,
the Windy City.
Have you ever been to America?
No... but I've seen it in the movies.
You want to dance?
I am terrible.
Good.
So am I.
All right, what's your...
No, no, ...most embarrassing...
oh, no, no, no, not a chance.
Come on, I just told you mine.
That wasn't embarrassing so much as stupid.
Come on, give it up.
Uh... it involved a lack of clothing.
Oh, thank God.
Merci infiniment. Looks like we closed the place.
Bonsoir.
Bonsoir? When are you going to tell me
how you got naked?
( laughs )
What happened, uh... what happened to your patient:
the mother, HIV, and the kids?
Celine? Oh, she's doing great.
You got her to a VCT center?
No, I got her on ARVs.
Antiretroviral drugs?
Yeah. CD4's over 400.
Where'd you get the drugs?
I had a, uh, friend of mine
write a prescription back home and ship 'em over.
You smuggled them in?
No, no, I used FedEx.
What?
What, she's doing great.
Drugs entering the country
have to be registered and approved
by the Ministry of Health.
Well, you didn't have the resources
to include her in your study, so...
AZT, 3TC? Yeah, and Nelfinavir.
And that cost you... thousand dollars a month?
Twelve hundred.
Where'd you get the money?
Um... I paid for it.
Yourself?
( scoffs )
I could treat four patients for a year
with what you're spending on your patient every month.
It took me two years
to get all the approvals necessary
to import the drugs,
arrange the funding and staff, and you're
jeopardizing it
Whoa... by pulling out your checkbook
and sending them in by post.
How am I jeopardizing your work?
It's not sustainable.
What happens to that poor woman when you leave?
What, you're going to keep shipping her thousands of dollars
worth of drugs for the rest of her life?
Uh...
Yeah, I was planning on it, yeah.
And who's going to monitor her progress,
make sure she remains compliant?
You know, what if one of her kids get sick...
Well, that's... ...and she decides
to split her meds with the child?
It happens! Yeah.
Or if she moves back to Kivo?
Is your Mr. FedEx going to chase all over the Eastern Congo
tracking down your one patient?
What is going to happen to your patients when your funding ends?
You cannot start a patient on drugs without guaranteeing
you can maintain a supply.
What, and you can guarantee a supply?
Yes. I'm trying to show my government
and the international community that ARV therapy works here,
and when they see our success, they'll realize
we can save millions of lives.
I'm just trying to save one.
One's not enough!
You want me to walk you home?
Oh, it's just mild jaundice.
Three Fansidar tablets, and tell her
if she's not feeling better in a couple days,
just come back. Okay. C'est le paludisme.
Si ça ne va pas mieux dans quelques jours, revenez.
Bonjour. Comment vous sentez-vous aujourd'hui?
Dr. John.
Ms. Likasu is here from the Ministry of Health.
She was looking for your HIV patient.
Celine?
She was quite insistent.
Did you tell her where she was?
She went to Angelique.
They're already on the ward.
( speaking in French )
What's going on?
You shipped in drugs.
Merci, Celine.
Je la prends pour l'étude.
Il faudriat qu'elle vienne á l'hôpital Mardi,
dans la journée.
Okay, sure.
Okay, what, what?
I'm enrolling Celine in my pilot program.
I thought you were full.
Yeah, I was.
Thanks, Angelique. Au revoir.
So, what happened?
I met this rich American
who can afford to commit $15,000 a year
to my study for the next five years.
You can afford that, can't you?
Yeah, sure.
So that means I have funding
for 40 additional participants,
and your patient seemed like the perfect place to start.
What about her two kids?
Don't push your luck, Doctor.
Thank you.
Look, I said I looked in the records room,
and it's not there.
Yeah, well Happy Thanksgiving
to you, too, jagoff.
Hey, did Detroit win? I have no freaking idea.
Well, what about Dallas?
Don't make me come over there and smack you.
Are those from Christmas?
Uh, last year?
The year before. Dr. Greene.
Mm. Which one's Dr. Greene?
I'm going to need a massive amount of caffeine
if I'm going to make it to sunrise.
Here you go, Abby.
Ugh!
( laughter )
Shred it.
Oh, look at this one.
That's definitely 2001.
The Secret Santa party.
Anybody hear from Carter?
He sent us a postcard about a month ago.
You should put that up in the lounge.
How's he doing?
I don't know.
Why did you come back?
Hmm?
Well, you were raised in Paris and London.
After you got your degree,
why didn't you come back to the Congo?
My father was killed,
so I came back to settle his affairs.
How was he killed?
He was on his way from...
Manono to Kabineta,
and his car was ambushed
by rebels and CLF soldiers.
I'm so sorry.
He was an engineer.
He worked 30 years
trying to upgrade the water supply
in Kivo and Katanga.
But he was a Banyamulenge driving in a Mai Mai area,
so they pulled him from his car and shot him in the head.
He believed in the goodness of people.
I came back for him.
( applause and cheering )
Prets? Et partez!
Go, go, go, go!
Vite, vite, vite, vite!
Vite, vite, vite, vite!
You are the winner!
J'ai gagné!
( applause and cheering )
J'ai gagné!
Oui, tu as gagné!
( laughs )
Whoa.
( laughing )
Here he is.
Hey.
You need a helmet?
( laughs )
Oh, probably.
What's the matter?
Celine didn't show up at the clinic
this morning for her testing.
( groans )
( sighs )
CARTER: So, when was the last time she came in?
KEM: Two weeks ago, just after her husband died.
And her lymphocyte count was still good?
Yup, it was excellent.
Something must have happened.
She knows she's supposed
to be monitored.
So, how are we going to find her?
She'll be with people from her village.
How are we going to find them?
We ask.
When did you first notice he was sick?
A week ago.
Has he been coughing?
Yes, but nothing is coming out.
Shortness of breath?
( breathes quick, rapid breaths )
He cannot run.
He gets very tired.
I know I was supposed to come to the clinic yesterday,
but I wanted to wait till he was feeling much better.
I have been taking my medicine
every day.
He...
( weakly ): He...
He...
He...
I would start him on high dose trimethoprim-sulfa.
20 milligrams per kilo per day
divided q six hours.
Prednisone ten milligrams twice a day.
How are we set for oxygen?
Not good. All right, hold off on the O2 for now.
Is it the AIDS?
He has Pneumocystis pneumonia.
It's an infection that can take hold
if the immune system is weakened.
Will he get better?
I hope so.
We're going to give him medicine and see how he does.
He looks so small...
and sick.
I only slept with my husband.
No one else, ever.
( rain pouring down )
How bad?
Well,
if he gets through the pneumonia,
he's going to need ARVs.
Do you have the pediatric suspensions?
No.
We can grind up the adult tablets.
I can figure out the dosage for a five-year-old.
No.
That little boy's going to die.
Yeah.
And you can just stand there, not doing anything?
You can just let that happen? I don't...
What?
I am doing something.
I'm proving drug therapy works
so we can save 1,000 little boys,
50,000.
Then help me save this one.
Don't you yell at me.
You go home, you yell at your president.
You yell at your government.
You tell them that we need real money.
Not just these empty promises.
You tell them, 6,000 people are dying out here.
Damn it! Damn it!
Every day, and they have
to do something about it.
( yelling )
Hey.
How are you?
Great.
You still mad?
I wasn't mad.
Well, Charles tells me
that you're going to take a C-140 flight
into Kinshasa to get a couple more tons of rice.
No. It's MONUC's plane.
I'm just along for the ride.
Well, it occurred to me that I might be able
to talk you into picking up a few things
for me in the capital?
Like what?
Oh, Christmas decorations.
You know, tree, lights, ornaments, tinsel.
Tinsel?
Santa suit, snow globes, that sort of thing.
Oh, and a couple of cylinders of oxygen.
Oxygen.
Yeah, you know, if you could find any.
I made a list.
Hey.
Hey.
What are you doing?
Oh, just wrapping a few Christmas presents
for some friends back home.
Bangala.
Mm.
Hope you didn't pay too much for it.
No, it was cheap.
50 bucks.
What?
Just kidding.
It was three.
Oh.
( laughs )
How was your day?
Oh, endless.
Who's Abby?
She's a, you know, friend.
Really?
I hope she still is.
Why, are you jealous?
A bit.
( chuckles )
I think I might be pregnant.
What?
( laughs )
How?
Uh... when did, uh, uh...?
Oh, yeah.
Mm-hmm.
Hmm.
Are you angry?
No.
You're upset?
No.
You?
I... I thought I would be, but it's strange.
I think I might be happy.
Do you want to have a baby?
I don't know. Do you?
You first.
Uh, I've got my program...
and we barely know each other.
It's been what, six hours?
Six weeks.
Oh, God, I'm really in trouble.
( laughs )
( loud retching )
Getting bad out there?
Yes.
Merry Christmas Eve, huh?
If you say so.
VALERIE: Hey, Greg.
Hey, Valerie, how you doing?
Good. Just ready for the holidays.
Yeah, me, too.
Except I've got to work.
Too bad.
You waiting for Mike?
Yeah, he's supposed to be off
in a couple of minutes.
All right then, Merry Christmas.
Yeah.
FRANK: Merry Christmas, everybody!
Hey, what the hell is that? Welcome to Calcutta!
Come on, that's it.
Hey, what is that?
A little bit of Sikh rap.
Sikh rap?
Are you ready to go?
No, keep dancing.
She's good.
I found six tanks, but the pilot
couldn't handle the extra weight.
He only let me bring on these three.
Bilateral interstitial infiltrates
and a high LDH.
Yeah. We've got him on IV Bactrim and steroids.
Pulse ox on O2 is only 78.
Is he not getting any better?
He should, uh, be resting more comfortably now
with the oxygen.
How about the other stuff?
I found a couple of things.
Dumped them in the hallway.
Yeah? Decorations, ornaments, that kind of thing?
Someone offered to sell me a fruitcake.
You like fruitcake?
That's it-- you didn't get any, like, decorations
or tinsel or a garland?
I did the best I could do.
Whoa!
( laughing ): All right!
Oh, it's fantastic.
Where did you get all this stuff?
American Embassy.
They had a bunch of their old junk in the basement.
Oh, my... oh!
( laughing )
Friends back home sent all this?
Yeah, the ER staff where I worked.
I asked everybody to get one gift--
nothing over $20.
Looks like everybody chipped in.
How did they know what to give who?
They were supposed to...
Here, they wrote on the back, see?
Appropriate age-- boy, girl.
Should be a few in here for the adults, too.
Package in here for you, John.
Wow, this one's heavy.
Looks like some kind of doll.
What'd you get?
It is a card from work that everybody signed.
What's Martin, Hall and Jacobs?
Uh, that is a, uh, a law firm back home.
It's marked "urgent."
Oh, my God.
What?
Dr. Romano died.
Was he a friend?
Um... no.
No, not really.
It's beautiful, isn't it?
Yeah. It really is.
Ho-ho-ho! Merry Christmas!
Merry Christmas.
Oh, oh, careful.
Got it?
Merry Christmas.
Read the labels.
Okay, three-year-old boy.
Three-year...
You want another one?
You know what?
Keep going.
I'll be right back.
Joyeux Noel, Celine.
Joyeux Noel.
He hasn't woken up this morning.
His oxygen level is too low.
Will he ever wake up?
No. I don't think so.
I brought some presents for your kids from the party.
This is for your little girl.
And this is for the baby.
And this is for Lamia.
Shall I open it for him?
I think it's a truck.
Thank you.
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.
Oh...
They were mine when I was little.
Thank you.
There's more.
I want you to come back to the States with me.
I want our baby to be born in America.
Oh...
I have to go back.
That, um... package, the envelope from the law firm
that you were asking me about.
I used to get them every few months,
then it was every few weeks, now it's every few days.
It's just something that I have to take care of.
Are you in some kind of trouble?
( chuckling )
No.
No, it's nothing like that. Um...
My grandmother died nine months ago,
and I have to settle her estate.
Just some financial things that I have to deal with.
I kind of ran away after she died.
You ran away from what?
Myself.
( chuckling )
Responsibility. Um...
It's hard to explain.
I wasn't happy.
Something was missing in my life.
I can't leave.
My work is here,
and it's my life, you know?
I know.
I don't expect you to leave forever.
Come for a couple weeks, a month, two.
Meet my friends.
See my life there.
