Previously on E.R.
You did it.
We have a baby.
Will you be home late... again tonight?
RASGOTRA: I've got the med list.
CARTER: Why didn't you have it before?
Phenelzine?
She'll be a star in Internal
Medicine or research.
You have to be more decisive.
Should we try the high-dose epi?
I assessed it, I ordered it,
I pushed it.
I gave her the order.
You falsified the chart.
CARTER: That's a felony.
Nothing I did on this shift
can convince me or anyone else
that I belong here.
She's not ER doc.
We need more wipes.
Where's your mom?
She's late.
Hey, nine ounces.
Nice.
( laughs )
Can't say I don't produce.
( laughter )
( doorbell rings )
Better put on your shirt.
She already thinks we're pervs.
( laughs ) Come on, baby.
You gonna be good for your Grandma?
Yeah, you're always a good boy, aren't you?
That's my baby.
That's my baby.
I'm sorry.
My battery was dead.
I had to get a jump. That's all right.
Hi, baby...
Hands. Wait. Hands, hands.
( muttering )
Hi, Ma.
Hi. Carlos is going to buy me a new battery.
Hmm. Really? Mm-hmm.
What you need is a new car, Ma.
Yeah? Preferably with some air bags.
Yes, well, you going to buy it for me?
Oh, yeah, right.
My brother's a saint,
'cause he's getting her a new battery,
but I got to pick up the tab for a whole new car?
Uh-huh.
All right. He didn't sleep very well last night, so
Oh. you might want to put him down early
for his morning nap.
Ay, que lindo.
Just like your mother, only don't be so stubborn, okay?
You ready to go, babe?
Yeah.
Say good-bye to Mama.
Good-bye, boo.
And Mommy, too.
Say good-bye.
( sighs )
Bye, baby. Bye-bye.
Come on, sweetie. Okay.
( baby crying )
It's all right, papa. Don't worry.
We'll be back.
Boy, your son's got a set
of pipes on him, huh?
Yeah? He gets that from your side of the family.
Oh, yeah?
What are you trying to say, hmm?
( laughs )
I got a big mouth? ( laughter )
You want, uh, turkey or peanut butter sandwich?
Both.
You want a turkey with peanut butter sandwich?
You used to make it for me, remember?
No, I didn't.
Well, somebody did.
Hey, what are sodomy laws?
( knock at door )
I'll get it.
What are you doing here?
Just got off work.
Thought I'd stop by, say hello.
Hey.
Guess he misses us or something.
I have to be at work in, like, 40 minutes,
and he has to be at school, like, now.
ALEX: You know, if he wants, I could stay home.
TAGGART: Yeah, nice try.
Come on. Gina got a ticket
for double parking last time. Go.
Hey, when are you going to stop working night shifts?
Soon.
And-And what are sodomy laws?
Out.
You know,
I have a couple of minutes before I have to leave.
Really?
Uh-huh.
A lot can happen in a few minutes.
I'm sorry...
It doesn't have to be anything fancy.
I'm really tired.
How tired?
Not that tired.
LOCKHART: How did you score?
Hmm?
On your boards.
Don't know.
I can't bring myself to look.
With any luck, I failed.
Well, that's a positive attitude.
I'm serious. Part of me is afraid
I'll actually be given a license
to practice medicine one day.
Isn't that kind of the point?
When I was good at it, yeah.
Between annoying attendings,
butting heads with the nurses, and of course,
being responsible for the death of a patient because I try
to be aggressive...
Oh. The writing's on the wall for me, wouldn't you say?
Well, you're not a good doctor
until you've killed someone.
Spoken like someone who hasn't.
So, how are you doing?
Fine.
Then I don't have much of a poker face, do I?
Abby, pilonidal cyst in Four, Gallant shingles in Two,
Neela vaginal bleeding in One.
Get to work.
Sorry I'm late, Deb.
I had to meet with risk management.
Oh my God. Are you okay?
Uh, well, my feet are swollen, my back is killing me,
and apparently, my waddle's too slow
for some people.
We got a long day ahead of us.
The sooner we start, the better.
All right, we're doing interviews
on the phenelzine death.
So, I'll need some time off the floor.
Are we being sued?
MAN: Not yet. Just need
to clarify the hospital's defense.
All right, Gallant, you're up last at 11:30.
Actually, the attending's up last since he's the one
who'll be named in the suit.
God knows Carter's got assets.
That why he leave the country?
All right, we'll start at the bottom
and work our way up.
Neela, that's you. What? The guy's
medical records fell through the cracks.
It's not like
anyone did anything wrong.
What's the matter with you, man?
I'm telling you, this chick is hot.
A little overweight, but in a good way.
Look, I'm not interested, man.
Mike, she's your type. I'm busy.
You got Lieutenant James on line one.
Tell him I'll call back.
Busy doing what, playing soldier?
Man, you need to get a life.
Dr. Gallant, did you treat
the immersion burn in Exam Four?
Yeah. There a problem? Did I tell you she's a college grad?
No. Not at all. I thought
you did an excellent job with the debridement.
Magna cum laude. Ever consider switching to surgery?
It's never too late, you know.
I think I'm pretty well committed.
Oh, well, if you change your mind.
The chick has legs up to here.
Dr. Pratt. You're playing games.
Susan's with risk management so you'll need to present to me.
Yeah, okay. You all right? Yeah. Why?
Well, how's your dad doing?
Oh, he's much better, thanks.
Okay.
We have a, uh,
homeless John Doe, approximately 70 years old,
found in a makeshift tent in Lincoln Park,
cold and altered.
His, uh, sugar's at 435,
so I gave him eight units of insulin subq.
Yeah. How long has he been outside?
Rectal temp's 92.3.
Overnight?
( grunts )
Diabetic ulcerations on the feet.
PRATT: He also has high blood pressure-- 180/95
and evidence of a prior MI on the EKG.
Pretty bad cataracts, too.
Sure he's homeless?
Well, it fits the bill, right?
Nails are groomed.
Check missing persons.
Maybe he's a wanderer.
Sir. Sir...
Oh.
Great.
( laughs )
Here.
Seems like he's incontinent, too.
CORDAY: Kerry,
my department's in utter chaos.
Since Robert, there's been no leadership,
scheduling's a bloody nightmare
and there's nobody representing us
at the bargaining table.
Our salaries have been cut back.
I know.
Well, what are you going to do about it?
Have the new Surgery Department head
assess the situation and get back to me about it.
You selected a chairman?
Dr. Weaver, Sandy on line two.
Chairwoman. Can you find out if it's urgent?
Unless you prefer to be gender-nonspecific
and simply referred to as Chair.
It's only about dinner.
You can call her back.
Good. I'm late for a medical
executive committee meeting.
I don't understand.
When was this decided?
Two months ago, something like that.
Still need final approval,
but that shouldn't be an issue.
Uh, well, that's fine,
but it would've been nice to have been asked.
Three months maybe? I-I don't know.
Something like that. You don't want it?
Maybe. I don't know.
Still, it-it would have been nice
to be given a choice in the matter.
How long has your back been hurting, Mr. Halpern?
Uh, couple of days now.
Did you fall or strain yourself?
I slipped on the stairs about a week ago.
Might have triggered something.
I... I had a slipped disk a few years back.
Did you have surgery for it?
No, no.
I couldn't afford it.
It-It just flares up once in awhile.
I usually just take Vicodin.
Let me guess.
You're allergic to Tylenol and ibuprofen,
and Vicodin is the only thing that works.
Yeah. I don't really like the stuff, but
you know, what am I going to do, you know?
Abby?
T and L spine and get some urine?
Yup. We'll be right back.
Then run a tox screen, check his records,
make sure he's not drug-seeking.
You read my mind.
So, you think you'll match at County?
( laughs )
I don't know.
So, you basically let a desk clerk get in the way
of your getting a medical history.
I suppose I did.
And did you inform Dr. Gallant
that you didn't have Mr. Sanchez's current med list?
Yes.
And yet he gave the order for Demerol?
Yes.
Do you have anything else?
No, I'm good.
LEWIS: Okay. Thanks, Neela.
Oh, by the way, I have a friend
who's doing a study
on neuroprotective agents in stroke.
And they're looking for students
to work part-time in the lab.
Research?
Just check it out.
CHEN: This is crazy.
If Susan knew she was going
to be in some inquisition all day,
she should have scheduled another attending.
Abby, chest pain, scalp lac, itchy groin rash.
I've already got eight on the board.
And I've got twelve. What's your point?
Dr. Chen, old frozen guy's waking up.
He asked for some water.
Oh, hey, uh, Kovac called.
He said next time he's going to have a triple latte first.
Does that make sense?
Yeah.
Aren't you two living together now?
No.
Well, for what's it's worth,
I think Luka's a good guy.
Uh, wait, you didn't... Sleep with him? Nah.
I went in a completely different direction.
Hi, I'm Dr. Chen.
Can you tell me your name, sir?
Jones.
First name is Bob.
Is there any family we can contact, Bob?
No. No.
I'm homeless.
Mr. Jones, your hemoglobin A1C suggests
that your diabetes was under control until recently.
What happened?
No missing persons report that fits.
( sighs )
Well, we'll just have to call social services,
get him placed somewhere.
Yes.
I need somewhere to live.
All right, recheck d-stick and urine ketone...
You know what? Why am I doing this?
He's Pratt's patient.
So, the clonopin's working?
Okay, no. That's good.
Just, uh, give me a call if he gets agitated again.
All right.
What are you doing?
I was talking to your father's nurse.
She tried to call, but you were busy.
Seems like he tried to fry a steak
while she was stripping his bed.
What?
Yeah. He set off all the smoke alarms,
scared himself up pretty good, but he's okay now.
Oh, my God.
I gave her verbal orders for P.R.N. clonopin.
It has a long half-life.
But you might want
to consider restraints, though.
Dr. Chen, Rescue 3-8 has, uh, two critical
and six serious from a structure fire collapse.
Okay, give it to me. I'll call resp,
make sure they have a couple of vents ready.
Page trauma and burn fellows,
set up the rapid infusers
and get Lewis out of that damn meeting.
She discovered that he once had a bad reaction to morphine,
and sought out an alternative.
It was smart on her part.
But she didn't tell you what that alternative was?
No. Not specifically.
Did you hear Dr. Gallant give the order
to push Demerol?
No,
but to be fair, I had stepped out of the room briefly.
What are you guys
looking for exactly?
The truth.
Meaning you think there's some sort of cover-up?
( knock at door )
Excuse me, Dr. Lewis.
F.D.'s rolling up with criticals.
What have we got?
Tommy Mason, 33, full thickness burns
to the face, neck and chest.
Unconscious at the scene.
BP's 90 palp, tubed for agonal resps.
Residential fire?
Abandoned warehouse. Should've let it burn.
Nobody inside to save.
Sam, Gallant, you take
the next one, Pratt, you come with me.
What happened?
Industrial fire.
17 got hit pretty bad.
How'd your meeting go? Fine.
Ah, watch it!
Andy Fash, 22, smoke inhalation.
Passed out and took a fall.
Dislocated knee.
BP's 132/80.
Complains of belly pain.
Good pulse on the foot. Pelvis is stable.
It's okay, I'm cool. How's Mason?
We don't know yet. I'll get the next one.
This the second critical?
Next rig.
It took awhile to fish her out.
Abby, you take this one.
By myself?
Yeah. Chen and Pratt in the next door.
Gallant, Neela, you're with me.
OLBES: 29-year-old female, chest and pelvis crush.
Injury on scene with prolonged extrication.
Hi, I'm Dr. Lewis.
RASGOTRA: Oh my God.
It's Sandy.
Hey, Doc.
Got a flash. Wire.
Sandy, you need to stay still, okay.
BP's 80 palp.
Tell Gemmill to stop trying to get a look at my boobs.
Chest is up. Multiple rib fractures.
Pneumothorax. She needs a chest tube.
I was about to say that.
( alarm beeping ) Pulse ox is down to 78.
How about one of you doing it, instead of talking about it?
Ten blade.
Tegaderm for the line.
Sandy, how are you doing?
I've been better.
I remember you.
How's the baby?
You have carbonaceous material in both nares.
We need to think about securing your airway.
You wanna shut me up by sticking a tube down my throat, huh?
We want to help you breathe better.
I want to... I want to talk to Kerry first.
You cut in the fifth intercostal space, mid-axillary line.
Yeah, I'm aware of that.
Free fluid in both pericolic gutters.
Sandy, you need the OR.
We're going to have to intubate.
( gasping ): What's taking her so long?
I paged her.
Okay, I'm in.
Please...
Okay, okay.
Put her on 100% non rebreather,
but the minute she gets down here, I'm going to intubate you.
We need another doc in here. Go, Gallant.
I have to sew in the chest tube.
No, they don't want a student, they want a doc.
Neela, have you ever done a horizontal mattress?
Yes.
Dazzle me.
What do you need?
CHEN: Glove up-- 60% surface area burns with hypoxia.
Guy needs an escharotomy.
Wide prep. 10 blades for the both of us.
We'll open a square over the entire chest down to the subq.
BP's down to 70 palp.
Gallant, check the ET for a leak, may have to reintubate.
Yes, ma'am. Ready?
Every time.
Anterior axillary line,
all the way down to the tenth rib.
Join the top and bottom
transversely. All right, Mike,
you should be able to bag him now.
Nope. Sats are dropping.
Hold up, 18 angiocath.
What?
Tracheal shift.
Found a puncture wound,
tension pneumo on the left.
Gotta needle him.
Hemostat and four-oh vicryl.
Pulse is stronger, sats coming up.
Nice catch, Gallant.
Hey, Abby needs some help in here with a knee reduction.
Pratt.
I'm in the middle of tying off a bleeder.
Gallant can take over.
GALLANT: Sterile gloves.
What's up?
Lateral dislocation with equivocal pedal pulses.
Mild wheezing. Maybe has some smoke inhalation.
Is he hanging in there?
His chest was burned so bad he couldn't breathe.
He's intubated and doing a little bit better.
MALIK: Systolic's 120 with 50 on board.
What about Lopez?
We don't know yet.
He's had 250 mikes of Fentanyl.
I told the old-timers I'd race 'em to the top.
All right, man, this is gonna hurt.
We have to pull on your lower leg
and move it back up onto the knee.
17 years on the job between 'em.
I got eight months...
Come on, stabilize the distal femur.
Let's get ready to pull.
Tommy got up there first, then Sandy...
You got enough countertraction?
I remember thinking the old guy won...
Yeah. You ready?
Then I saw 'em both drop...
One, two, three...
( Fesh screaming )
Where's Sandy?
Trauma One.
How bad is it?
She's conscious.
WEAVER: Excuse me. Excuse me.
Crit's 24 after two units.
Sandy?
Oh, God.
Hey, baby...
What'd you go and do?
Roof collapsed.
Bilateral rib fractures, pneumothorax,
intra-abdominal bleed, pubic rami fractures.
We need to get her to the OR.
It's a good thing I pumped, huh?
Chest tube output's slowing down.
Pulse ox 87...
She's on a hundred percent?
Yeah. Why isn't she intubated?
She refused it till you got here.
I only wanted to say hey.
Type specific's here.
It's gonna be okay.
Sandy... ( alarm beeping )
( snapping fingers ) Sandy.
Sandy, you need to stay awake, sweetie.
You need to stay awake, Sandy!
20 of etomidate and 120 of sux.
Pressure's drifting down.
Sandy, you need to stay awake. 8-oh tube?
And a number two mac.
Sandy... Sandy! I need to do this.
Sats in the 70s-- we should be bagging.
Uh, Kerry.
Push the drugs.
I need an end-tidal CO2 detector.
Etomidate first?
Kerry, you need to let us do this.
No. Please... she's my wife.
How long am I going to be in this?
When you dislocate, you tear up a bunch of knee ligaments.
Those heal, right?
Even with surgery, still could be some instability.
I've wanted to do this since I was a kid, you know?
There are some new artificial ligaments,
but if it's really bad, you may need knee replacement.
Mason says it's a calling.
So what happens when you can't answer it?
Good pulses, he's stable.
Keep an eye on his airway.
I'll see if they need me next door.
What happened?
Must be a cardiac injury.
I lost the pulse.
Start compressions.
Thoracotomy tray to Dr. Gallant.
You're serious?
Why not?
He's earned it.
10 blade then Mayo scissors.
Put up a screen. They don't need to see this.
Okay, rib spreader.
Open the pericardium with the metz.
Stay anterior or you'll cut the phrenic nerve.
You do remember the anatomy of the phrenic nerve?
Edema and secretions...
Tube's not advancing.
You asked for an eight-oh.
BP 108 over 68.
Come on, come on, honey.
Switch to a seven and a half?
Come on, you can do this.
Sats 83, 82...
I'm switching to fiberoptic scope.
Suction and crichoid.
81, 80...
Kerry?
I see cords.
Get her a tube.
79, 78...
I'm in.
Bag her.
Good yellow on the CO2 monitor.
Pressure's 120 palp.
Another four of Ativan and six of Pavulon.
You okay, Dr. Weaver?
Portable vent?
Just keep bagging her.
Okay, Mr. Fesh, we're going to move you to...
( gasping ) You all right?
I can't breathe.
I think I hear stridor.
Okay. Try continuous albuterol at 20 per hour. Pratt?
Pratt, I need you in here.
I think this in here needs me a little bit more.
I'll start an atrial line.
He needs four units now.
Okay, we can try a foley.
He's diaphoretic.
This guy's in respiratory distress.
He must have an upper airway burn.
Crank up the O2.
Ventricle's starting to fill.
Come on, crank it up.
Abby, does he need intubation?
PRATT: Just bag him, I'll be there in a few minutes.
All right, ambu mask at 100%.
What's happening?
Okay, you need to try to relax, all right?
Just relax.
No reading on the pulse ox.
He's out.
All right, try a jaw thrust.
There's no chest excursion.
I can't bag him.
20cc's for the balloon.
Extend his neck.
We did.
Good hemostasis with the foley.
Another two units and we just might save this guy.
Okay, fine-- etomidate and sux.
You got it.
Push the drugs, Abby. One of us
will be right there.
Run of six.
Heart's still empty.
Where's he losing it?
Abby, try a six-oh. Take a look.
Okay, sponge stick and more suction.
Clamp the hilar vessels. Abby, what do you see?
Nothing!
( quietly ): Larynx is swollen shut.
Sats are down to 72.
This is ridiculous.
I can't ventilate him.
Just keep bagging.
I'll be right there in a second.
All right, 11 blade and a five shiley.
What? You heard me.
All right.
Okay, hilum's clamped.
So's the aorta.
V-tach.
Internal paddles. Charge to 30.
Clear.
Abby, how you doing in there? You okay?
Yup.
Tube and curved kelly.
Ectopy on the monitor.
You do this before?
Nope.
Charged.
Clear.
No change.
Amp of epi.
Sixty.
Charged. Never mind.
What? Clear.
I criked him.
By yourself?
Sats are up, he's fine.
Now, that's a med student.
Going again. 100 of lidocaine.
Charged.
Clear.
Still V-fib.
Asystole.
Okay, come on, five of epi.
High dose could get us a shockable rhythm.
Stop compressions.
Don't bother, man.
12:27.
Should we let those guys in?
After we close the chest.
Oh silk on a needle driver.
BP's only 82 over 60. You want more blood?
Another two units and squeeze in the FFP.
Fractured liver, pelvis, ribs, humerus...
God, what's not broken?
Kerry, do you have the C-spine film?
It's Sandy. What?
Oh, God.
Who's operating?
Anspaugh hopefully, and Dean.
Ignacio's anesthesia, Shirley's circulating.
Good, that's good.
Platelets are here.
Do you want to stay with her?
What?
Would you like to observe?
Yes. Yes, I would
Right. Um...
Chest tube on water seal.
You got it.
Really cool of you, by the way.
The O.R.'s ready.
All right, let's go then.
I'll say a prayer for you, Dr. Weaver.
Kerry, she'll pull through. She's a fighter.
I'm right here, Sandy. I'm not going anywhere.
Have the blood bank send four units upstairs.
SAM: They're already ahead six.
HUTCH: How is she?
Her lung collapsed. We were able to reinflate it.
She's lacerated her liver, which we need to repair right away.
Mija... oh, my God...
What happened? Where are you taking her?
Try not to be scared. She needs an operation.
Sandy.
Mija...
¿me puedes oir?
Mija?
She's not conscious, ma'am.
Where's Henry?
With my wife.
Is Sandy going to be all right?
Yes. Uh, I will be with her in the O.R.,
but there's a waiting room upstairs...
and I'll call you the minute that she gets out of surgery.
Take care of her.
We will.
I'll take 'em up.
WOMAN: No...
No... no...
( sobbing ): No!
I can tell you exactly what happened.
We-we had a very recent discharge summary
documenting an adverse reaction to morphine.
The patient was in pain.
I gave the order to administer Demerol.
I shouldn't have. End of story.
Not exactly.
LEVINE: Luis Sanchez's chart is incomplete.
No attending note. Any idea why that is?
Well, maybe Dr. Carter didn't have a chance to do it
before it was sequestered by legal.
He was leaving for Africa that night, so...
So he was a little distracted is what you're saying.
No, I'm not saying that at all.
Do you think he needed time to get his facts straight?
What? No. It w... it was a busy night.
We had a lot of patients.
Is Dr. Carter typically available to you?
Of course he is.
What are you doing? I thought you were supposed to help us here.
I am... by preparing you for the difficult questioning
you may face in a deposition.
Do you feel supported by Dr. Carter as an attending?
( sighs ): Yes. He's a great teacher.
He's one of the finest physicians I've worked with,
and I respect his opinion tremendously.
So why didn't you present to him?
LEWIS: It just doesn't make sense,
because he was probably 30 feet away the whole time.
Was Dr. Carter informed of the decisions
you were making in your treatment plan?
No.
I wanted to handle it myself.
I thought I was better at this job than I guess I am.
I'm completely responsible.
Nobody else is.
Will you state if deposed?
Yes.
When is that supposed to take place?
A deposition? We're not sure.
We haven't heard from the family yet.
I might not be able to do it for awhile.
Why is that?
The Army called me up.
I'm going to be deployed to Iraq.
Excuse me.
Whatever, you know? I got Chris Halpern's medical records.
Even just a half an hour-- be nice to see you.
That's all I was thinking. Gallant?
Oh, uh, Halpern, right.
Refresh my memory. Call me back.
Desperately seeking Vicodin. Love you.
Yeah... Hey, did you hear anything
about Sandy Lopez?
No. You?
Puts it in perspective, huh?
So, Mr. Halpern managed to hit up
every local hospital for Vicodin this year.
You want to know what his tox screen showed?
What, narcotics and benzos?
Nope. Nothing. He's clean.
Aspirin and caffeine.
Uh, excuse me.
I'm wondering if you could find out about my sister.
The guys told me she was in surgery and you might know.
You're Sandy's brother.
I'm one of 'em. She okay?
Uh, let me make a call. Thanks.
Falciform ligament clamped.
DEAN: Systolic's in the 90's.
SHIRLEY: Two more units going in.
How long have you two been together?
Ready the cell saver.
Three years.
One of which included a pregnancy.
That gets you bonus time in the equation.
Okay, there's lots of blood. Suction.
Uh, looks venous.
SHIRLEY: Hemocue's 8.3.
We met here.
At the hospital?
That's the last place I expected to find anyone.
Right, uh, the spleen
looks good... but...
there's a grade four hepatic lac.
Bovie.
I miss Mark, too.
Let's pack off the liver.
Shirley, Shirley, can you wipe my brow?
Lap pads.
I need lots of them.
Neela, what's the therapeutic range of procainamide?
Four to ten mikes per mil, but you also have to measure its active metabolite.
Procain plus NAPA should be under 40.
Did you open that envelope yet?
Yes. And let me guess: you passed.
Yes.
And you're not in the least bit excited about that?
I'm a little excited about it, I suppose.
Don't have to tell my parents I flunked the boards.
I don't know.
I'm not sure it means anything...
but I suppose we should at least go celebrate passing tonight.
Well, I'm not much in the mood myself.
Yeah.
Susan... what are you doing?
Please let these be Braxton-Hicks.
( beeping ) What's wrong?
You need to isolate the segmental veins.
Trying...
Kerry.
How is she doing?
SHIRLEY: Systolic's down to 78. She must have
a retrohepatic caval injury.
Oh, God...
Okay, clamp the suprarenal I.V.C.
ANSPAUGH: All right, I'll take over.
Large angled Satinsky.
Come on, baby... please don't scare me like this.
I.V.C. clamped. Mark time.
( alarm ringing ) C.V.P. dropped to zero.
Uh, start an epi infusion. Keep her temp up.
All right, suprahepatic cava clamped.
You sure you should be in here?
She's fine.
SHIRLEY: Bradycardia.
Oh... she's lost her filling pressure.
Can you unclamp?
If we do, she'll bleed out. And if we don't,
her heart stays empty and she arrests.
Oh, God.
Systolic's only 60.
Mig of atropine. Let's prep the chest for a Schrock.
Ten blade.
Heart rate's down to 58.
Sternal saw.
Kerry, we have to put in an atrio-caval shunt
In order to do that, we have to open up the chest.
It'll improve her preload and get blood back to the heart.
Kerry.
Do it.
( sternal saw buzzing )
Nicotine, coffee and aspirin.
Setting yourself up for an ulcer.
I don't drink coffee.
Okay, soda then.
Lot of caffeine in your system.
Over-the-counter migraine tablets.
They don't do squat, though.
Nothing works but Imitrex.
That's a pretty expensive medication...
especially for someone who doesn't work much,
not insured anywhere.
Yeah, well, thanks a lot, Uncle Sam.
How long have you had the headaches?
Ever since I pulled sand duty in the Gulf.
What branch?
Army.
Yeah, me, too.
Don't count on the benefits.
I spend a year in the desert, came home with migraines.
The V.A. says it's not service-related.
Won't give me a dime.
That why you sell the Vicodin?
Pay for the Imitrex?
What unit?
43rd Battalion, Medical Corp.
You going to turn me in?
No.
But I'm not going to give you the Vicodin, either.
That's fair enough.
You stay low... watch your back.
You didn't say how your meeting went.
( sighs ): It's going to be fine.
Look, I'm... sorry
I've been... I don't know...
bitchy about this whole thing.
It's just not comfortable for me...
lying and having someone else cover my mistakes,
and... it just sort of keeps on compounding,
one on top of the other.
( sighs )
I'm being deployed to Iraq.
I'm heading for Texas tomorrow morning.
You haven't finished your residency.
Yeah, I know.
I'm going to finish up the last few electives down there.
They called you up, just like that?
Yeah.
You're a coward.
What? What?
A coward and a liar.
I never asked you to do this for me, but you did,
and now you're leaving, and I'm supposed to live
with the fact that I killed a man
and that you helped to lie for me to cover it up?
Listen, Neela... Go, Michael.
Go to bloody Iraq...
and tell yourself you've done something noble.
I had to protect you and Dr. Carter.
No... you didn't.
Well, at least the contractions stopped.
So the subq terb worked?
Uh, she's still one centimeter dilated and 50 percent effaced.
You can sit up now.
So, I should just, uh... take it easy,
cut back on a few shifts?
You were having regular contractions.
Your cervix has softened, shortened and dilated.
Bed rest, huh, plain and simple.
For how long?
35-weekers do well, full terms do better.
Mm-hmm.
No way. I can't stay in bed for five weeks.
You can and you will.
Schedule an appointment for an N.S.T.
with my office in a week.
( sighs ): This blows.
The whole day blows.
Yeah...
What else happened?
Nothing.
Oh, I failed my boards.
What?
Need a 182 to pass, I got a 167.
Oh, Abby.
Oh... I'm sorry.
It's okay.
Well, how were you supposed to study?
You were pulling double shifts.
It's fine.
It's not like a burning building
collapsed on me or anything.
I'll just take them again.
ANSPAUGH: Ah, atrium's oozing.
Another 2-O, I can oversew the purse-string.
V-fib.
ANSPAUGH: Charge to 30.
I love you so much.
Come on.
Clear.
Clear.
No change.
CORDAY: Okay, teflon pledgets.
ANSPAUGH: Oh, God.
There's blood pouring out of her ET tube.
D.I.C.
CORDAY: More platelets and FFP.
Clear.
Asystole.
Resume cardiac massage.
ANSPAUGH: Elizabeth...
CORDAY: Mig of atropine.
You can stop.
She's gone.
Kerry...
Can you take it out?
By law, we're not supposed to...
Please.
Of course.
I'm so sorry.
We wanted more.
I had to twist her arm to have a baby, but...
once Henry was here, she said, "I can do this.
Eight more and we got a team."
Sandy had a big family.
I only had her.
And Henry.
What am I supposed to do now?
Would you like me to talk to the family?
No...
No, I'll go do it.
Hey, you hiding out or taking inventory?
Oh, just looking for Reglan.
You leaving?
I've been ordered
to sit on my sofa for five weeks.
Sounds good to me.
Yeah, I bet.
Do people know?
No, not really.
You prefer it that way?
You know...
Look, what you did was stupid,
but there were a lot of circumstances
that conspired to kill Luis Sanchez.
The nursing home should've put a medic alert bracelet
on him but they didn't.
You should've gotten a full med list,
but you didn't.
If it goes to court,
the Army'll send me back to testify.
Nah, I doubt it'll happen.
The bottom line is,
people don't sue doctors they like,
and for whatever reason, Mrs. Sanchez liked you.
Take care of yourself over there, okay?
Yeah.
You have a healthy, happy baby, Dr. Lewis.
KOVAC: Hey.
You get called in early?
No, my shift doesn't start for an hour.
I wanted to see you.
Maybe we can get a coffee or something.
Sandy Lopez died today.
Who?
Weaver's Sandy.
GALLANT: Take care, of yourself, Dr. Kovac. Sam.
So how long have you got?
Here?
About an hour.
On your tour of duty.
Year at least.
Maybe longer.
So you were just going to sneak out
under cover of darkness?
No hi, bye, kiss my ass, nothing?
You know, I'm not much for send-offs.
I don't care what you call it.
There's a war going on.
Going to miss having you around, man.
Yeah, right.
No, I'm serious.
You're an honorable guy.
I'm not sure I've ever met one.
Don't go getting yourself killed.
( loud music plays )
Alex? Alex?
( sighs )
Alex, get out here.
Mom, guess what?
Alex, turn it down, okay?
I had a crappy day and I got a major headache.
You look good, though.
Dad's here.
Is there anything I can do?
You need me to watch Henry,
or do you need a ride home?
He's with Sandy's family.
Dr. Weaver...
It's okay.
( sobbing )
Dr. Weaver, it's okay.
It's okay.
( sobbing continues )
Shh, it's okay.
Got anything else?
No, that's about it.
NEELA: You'll need this.
Rabbit's foot.
It's American for good luck, isn't it?
Thanks.
You're welcome.
You'd better come back,
you know that, don't you?
Yeah, I will.
You just better be a damn good doctor
when I do.
You ready?
Bye, Michael.
( doorbell chimes )
Hi, Eduardo.
I'm here to get Henry. Is he awake?
Listen, he's not here.
I think he's with my aunt or something.
No, no, you...
You told me that Theresa...
Look, it's nothing personal, okay?
I mean, I always really liked you.
Wait a minute.
You said that Theresa was taking care of him.
We're his blood relatives.
What are you talking about?
What's... going on here?
Where's Henry?
I don't know.
Where is my son?
Sandy's son.
I don't understand what you're talking about.
What... I don't understand what you're talking about.
Where is he?
I hear him. Let me in.
No, no, that's mine.
( talking at once )
No, Kerry, he's not here.
I know my own son's voice!
Let me inside.
I'm really sorry.
Please! Please!
No.
Why are you doing this?
Give me my boy.
Why are you doing this? Let me in.
Damn it, let me in!
Give me my son.
Give me back my son.
