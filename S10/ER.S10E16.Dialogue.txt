Previously on E.R.--
I'm Gillian.
I was working with Luka and John in the Congo.
We really haven't had a chance
to talk about things.
Like you and Luka having sex?
We're not exclusive, right?
No commitments, no co-parenting.
Keep it casual,
okay?
My dad's got pneumonia.
Been taking care of him at home.
I met a teacher recently.
He's a nice man.
Do you think you'd like to go out sometime? Sure.
CARTER: Hey, Abby,
you're going to be a great doctor.
Thank you.
It's, uh, dum ke pasadey.
One of my students' parents gave me the recipe.
So...
( clears throat )
Where were you born?
Tell me about your parents,
your first kiss.
( laughs )
Uh...
( clears throat )
You're terrible at small talk.
Well, they're quiet.
We have to take advantage of every minute.
( sighs )
All right. Uh,
Sussex.
Father's a surgeon,
Mother's a university professor in mathematics.
Impossible.
First real kiss.
Neal Mitchell.
Seventh grade.
Your husband-- it was cancer,
wasn't it?
So, you're divorced?
Uh, that's the story on the school parking lot.
But we were never actually married.
Oh.
She left when Syd was three weeks old.
And Melissa was only 20.
She was scared.
Is it too spicy?
But you-you like Indian food, don't you?
Yes.
( laughs )
I'm sorry.
You know, I-I thought because you were English.
I thought all Brits, like...
Here, let me fix you something else.
No, no, it's lovely.
Daddy, we're tired of drawing.
Um, well, then,
how about a movie?
( knock at door, French pop music plays )
I'm here.
Hi.
Hi.
Uh,
I should have called.
Alex went to the movies with Austin,
and-and I hadn't seen you in a couple days.
Yeah, I've been working nights.
Yeah. I'm on days.
I thought you might want to get some dinner or something.
I can't.
Yeah, I guess...
( laughs )
Yeah, I should have called first.
No big deal. I will, uh...
I'll see you at work.
Yeah. Sorry. No.
No. Please.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Yeah, see you.
Is the food here?
Uh, no.
Oh, too bad.
I'm starving.
( quiet laugh )
Ooh.
Mr. Welling, you need to calm down,
and then I can help you.
I told you, the VA burned all my files.
Now, my back is killing me.
I can barely walk!
Whoa, you're standing.
Look, it's a miracle.
Morris,
the guy needs psych.
They've seen him five times
in the last three months.
He's not getting admitted.
Are you having any, uh, suicidal thoughts?
Hell, no. I'm not going to kill myself.
I'm going to kill him.
His B.P.'s elevated.
We could call medicine, see if they have a bed.
Just let him go. Why do you care?
I'm going to frag his redheaded ass.
Then I'm gonna piss
all over his useless corpse.
Mr. Welling.
Hey, Mr. Welling, wait!
Hello.
I'm going to make you cry.
LOCKHART: Hi.
I love the smell
of crazy in the morning.
Back on days?
Yeah, till 6:00.
You?
7:00.
Olecranon bursitis can go home after Ancef,
and bleeding esophageal varices
is on hold for the GI lab.
Can I at least take off my coat first?
Altered LOL is getting sedated and scanned.
She needs a Foley and an NG.
Thanks.
See ya.
PRATT: Dr. Kovac, I need you
to eyeball a perilunate dislocation.
What's this?
I don't know.
Weaver's office decided it was time
to box up all the residency applications
for the past ten years.
I called to have them picked up.
Frank.
And it would be my privilege to call again.
If you check his neuro-circ, I can get him blocked.
Uh, what is with all these boxes, Frank?
That's where I keep my list
of idiotic questions.
RASGOTRA: Dr. Chen, this is Eliza.
Two centimeter laceration
extending through the vermilion border.
I just split my lip is all.
I promised we could see her quickly?
Oh. Hi, Eliza. Let me see.
Ooh, looks like something got you pretty good.
She wasn't aiming at me.
Who? As far as I can tell,
she had an altercation with her girlfriend.
Ooh, lesbian cat fight.
Somebody grab a video camera.
Chuny, can you please put Eliza in curtain one
and draw up 10cc's of one percent with epi?
Sure. Come on.
Going to get her settled,
and I'll talk you through a three-layer closure.
Hey, do you want me to call social work,
see if we can get her in one of those BBL support groups?
Big black lesbian.
( chortles )
You know what?
You're a horrible man.
Do you think it's pleasant
being greeted every day with a fusillade of homophobic,
xenophobic ranting from a bigot?
From now on, I expect nothing from you
except silence.
Blissful silence.
Wow!
Must be somebody's time of the month.
So, Gillian left me a message.
I didn't know she was in town.
She wants us all to get together and have dinner.
I need two-doctor consent
for an unaccompanied 13-year-old.
Uh-huh. Sure.
So, we can talk later
about the, uh... Yeah, right.
( whistles )
Dr. Carter, do you think you have a second
to take a look at him?
Um.... Dr. Carter, they're a minute out.
Sorry, EMS is bringing in a probable septic patient.
Uh, he came in on a bus all alone.
He's kind of freaked out. Mm.
Woke up with right-sided testicular pain.
The school nurse sent him in.
No nausea, no dysuria,
no trauma, not on any meds.
Any nausea?
No. I said that.
Hey, Brian.
This is Dr. Kovac.
He's going to check you out.
Hi, Dr. Kovac.
Nice to meet you.
So, you're having some pain, huh?
It hurts a lot.
TAGGART: Did the school nurse call your parents?
No. I live with my dad.
He had a meeting this morning in Detroit.
He's probably still on the plane.
Uh, was there anyone else I can call?
An older brother or sister,
neighbor?
No, ma'am, thank you.
KOVAC: Okay, Brian,
I have to take a look.
Sam,
uh, can you get
a container for the UA?
Sure.
Don't worry, Brian.
Dr. Kovac is the best.
She's really hot.
Charlie Taslitz, 42, fever and hypotension.
Baseline brain injury, but he's taken nosedive.
Tried four sticks, but I couldn't start a line.
Where's all the blood from?
He pulled out his PICC line.
You're his nurse? Daughter.
I take care of him.
All right, nice and easy, one, two,
three. Good.
All right, he's burning up.
Sepsis on top of the blood loss.
Rectal Tylenol?
Yeah, and CBC, lytes.
Type and cross for four cultures times two.
( man groaning )
And hang Zosyn and Vank.
How are you doing, Mr. Taslitz?
He can't talk anymore.
He can't walk or move or anything.
Did he have a stroke?
No. He crashed his forklift at work two years ago.
A bunch of steel crushed him.
He got brain damage.
Uh, Dr. Chen?
Hmm? Ooh, John.
Do you clean his G-tube site?
Twice a day.
He used to be at an extended care facility,
but I wanted him home with me.
They showed me how to do everything.
Grab a fresh tube.
( alarm ) TAGGART: B.P.'s 82/58.
CARTER: Tank two liters of saline.
( groans ) TAGGART: I don't have a line.
Are you hurting him?
CARTER: Try the, uh, antecubital.
I did. It's completely sclerosed.
CHEN: Okay, we're going to have to go central. Grab a kit.
Um, Dahlia,
your father has very low blood pressure
and a serious infection.
I know. That's why I called 911.
We need to give him fluids and antibiotics.
But even if we do,
there's a chance that his heart could stop beating.
Has he discussed his wishes with you?
I told you, he doesn't talk.
Temp's 103.4. CARTER: Does he have a DNR?
A do not resuscitate order?
No, no, no, he doesn't have anything like that.
You have to help him.
Okay.
CHEN: Page Corday.
Could you see through someone's clothes with this?
Nope, doesn't work.
Already tried.
How you doing, Brian?
Much better, thank you.
Morphine's kicking in.
I'll go check on your urinalysis, okay?
I'll page urology.
No.
The ultrasound is normal.
It's not surgical.
Doppler's not 100% sensitive,
especially with all that edema.
He's got a positive Prehn's sign,
a normal cremasteric reflex and a low-grade temperature.
It's probably epididymitis.
He's a kid with possible torsion.
He only has a six-hour window.
He could lose his testicle.
We wait for his urine to comeback, okay?
Are you mad at me?
He's got a good blood flow.
No, not for that.
For coming over last night.
No. It was fine.
Because what I said before-- I didn't mean
that we shouldn't see each other at all.
I didn't mean to hurt your feelings.
You want things to be casual.
Right, but...
if it's a choice between something serious
or nothing,
maybe serious is the way to go.
PRATT: Hey, Sam?
Yeah. I got it.
Sam, uh, maybe you should page urology?
You think?
Yeah. Better to be safe.
Adam Grant,
61-year-old slip and fall with no LOC.
B.P. 136/72, pulse 106.
Mucho ETOH on board.
Wow, nice breath.
Tequila. Breakfast of champions.
Sam, start an IV, hang a banana bag and call CT.
You guys hear on the news?
Some guy robbed the National Guard armory.
Stole a frigging tank.
I mean, it's all over the news.
A tank tank?
Yeah, George Patton,
big turret, armor, treads.
The whole deal.
Come on, big guy.
You got this?
Yup.
You have beautiful skin.
Leave me alone, Morris.
That thing's gigantic.
60 tons of American firepower.
Don't hit the newsstand.
FRANK: Anybody need any kindling?
LOCKHART: Excuse me?
MORRIS: What, what?
Look.
Oh, crap.
FRANK: Hope he doesn't have any ammo.
DUVATA: The guys from the National Guard say he doesn't.
FRANK: We're going to believe them?
They're the ones that let him steal
the damn thing in the first place.
Where's he headed, do you think?
Here.
What?
He-He's headed here.
Tell 'em.
He said he was going to get a tank
and blow my ass up.
( sighs )
Kelly.
Tank's moving pretty fast.
It has a top speed of 35 miles per hour
on the open road.
That's what they said on CNN.
I had an '88 Civic that couldn't do 35.
He's tachy, 130.
Are you hurting him?
We numbed the skin.
Cordis introducer.
His pressure's down to 74 systolic.
Uh, why don't you wait outside?
We'll come find you
the second we're done.
No, I want to stay.
Excuse me.
He going to be okay now?
We can give him medicine and fluids,
but he's still very sick.
He's strong, you don't know.
Four-oh vicryl and a needle driver.
Oh, what a mess.
You doing hernia repairs
in the ER now?
No. Mister Taslitz needed access for blood and pressors.
I'm here to replace his PICC line.
I put it in three months ago.
Well, thanks for stopping by,
but he has a lovely femoral cutdown, instead.
Dress the wound and repeat the crit.
I, uh, I don't appreciate you poaching my cases.
And when your cutdown gets infected, call me.
I can assure you I washed my hands.
We still on for dinner tonight?
You find a sitter?
Yes.
Great, I'll call you about 7:00.
He's doing better.
His pressure's up to 88 over 57.
How do they do that?
Who?
Men. They argue with you one minute
and chat about dinner the next.
You're asking the wrong girl.
Mister Taslitz' tachycardia's resolving
and he's starting to perfuse.
Thanks.
Transfuse to a crit above 30, then titrate the dopamine.
Okay, but, uh...
he better start making urine soon
or he's going to need dialysis.
Yeah.
Doctor Chen, I don't think the daughter really understands
how serious her dad's condition is.
He's responding to treatment.
He's got a good chance.
A good chance at what?
Being in a vegetative state for the rest of his life?
Look, he didn't sign an advanced directive.
His daughter's responsible for his medical decisions.
She's 19.
And she knows her dad better than we do.
Okay. So if he arrests, do we shock him?
Yeah, if that's what she wants.
He's turning right on Wells again.
He keeps going in circles.
Guy's probably just out having fun.
Doesn't he have a map in there?
GPS or something?
He's got GPS, night vision, laser targeting.
And this one uses those uranium-tipped shells, too.
He starts shooting, you grab your gonads.
RollingDeath.com.
All right, back to work, people.
It's not the moon landing.
Where is this lunatic?
He's crossing Monroe.
Six miles, as the crow flies.
WEAVER: How long till he gets here?
DEMETRAS: He won't.
We got roadblocks on Adams and Jackson.
If he's coming here, we'll feed him onto the Eisenhower,
force him to run out of gas.
That's your plan?
Let him run out of gas?
They're also getting a helicopter
with a gigantic magnet.
Really?
Doctor Lockhart,
you treated this guy. What was his story?
There was no physical explanation for his pain.
He was just angry because we couldn't help him.
There was nothing wrong with him.
You keep telling me to dispo patients faster.
Nobody said you did anything wrong.
PRATT: Hey, hey, check it out.
He's about to hit the roadblock at Adams.
BOTH: Damn.
You got a plan B, Detective?
Oh, my God. He's coming for us.
Not us, pal, you.
BOY: Built models of Shermans
and Tigers, but never an M-60.
Hmm. My son's almost your age.
He makes models.
He likes to blow them up with firecrackers.
Did you figure out what's wrong with me yet?
Your urine test came back.
It's positive for chlamydia.
What's that?
It's a sexually transmitted infection.
You're having sex, Brian?
I hook up sometimes.
With who?
Girls in my class, like after school.
Girls? Like more than one?
You're 13.
How do I get rid of it?
Uh...
You don't have to cut anything, do you?
One dose of antibiotics, and you'll be cured.
Cool.
Cool?
You have to tell these girls to get treated, okay?
Chlamydia can be very serious.
We'll get you some STD handouts to give to them.
Okay.
A 13-year-old kid with chlamydia.
Consent him for an HIV test and give him some condoms.
Is that what I have to look forward to?
Doctor Kovac?
TAGGART: See you later.
19-year-old female with buttock pain
after ice skating pileup.
Minimally displaced coccyx fracture.
Give her some naprosyn and a donut cushion.
What's this, duplicate film?
No, twins. Blonde twins.
They never came for the boxes?
I'm filing them under "D" for Dumpster.
Just put them in the storage room, okay?
Ca va?
Hey.
I had to drop off my carte jaune at the consulate
and the traffic's awful, so...
Yeah, someone stole a tank.
I know, I heard.
Americans and their big cars.
Um, do you have time for coffee?
Double MVA rolling up.
Sorry. We're kind of swamped.
Okay, later then. Around 6:00?
Okay.
And I want to do something fun, like dancing.
Okay.
Bye.
BP 102 over 78 after two liters, tachy at 112.
Easy, Mister Rojas. He's right behind us.
( speaking Spanish )
You need me?
I got this. Help Pratt.
Who was that?
Uh, she's Gillian.
Oscar Rojas, seven years old.
Pinned behind the passenger seat.
GCS 15, in respiratory distress.
( Oscar screaming in Spanish )
One, two, three.
( Rojas screaming in Spanish )
CARTER: Easy, Mister Rojas.
( tries to speak Spanish )
Tell him we're taking care of his son.
( speaks Spanish )
Bilateral femur fractures.
Probably the pelvis, too.
He screamed when we put him on the board.
( screaming )
CARTER: Okay, okay, calm down.
Head-on collision?
Nope. Ford truck versus M-60 tank.
Your boyfriend better learn to drive.
ROJAS: Oscar!
Calmase, Senor Rojas.
Equal and reactive. Good breath sounds.
Okay, Neela, what do we do?
Full trauma panel...
LOCKHART: C-spine, chest and AP pelvis, and a foley.
Chuny, grab a central line and set up...
Easy. I think we should be okay with two large...
He's running people over out there.
( Rojas screaming Spanish )
He wants you to find his wife, Maria.
Let's see if we can find his wife,
and then see if Luka needs a hand.
( screaming in Spanish )
Frank, can you locate a Maria Rojas?
You got the area code for Guadalajara?
Just find this man's wife, please.
( Rojas screaming and gasping )
Hold on a minute.
I'm calling from...
( gasps )
( groans )
PRATT: I'm going to need you to take
some deep breaths, Oscar.
I knew her before in Africa.
She's just visiting.
You want blood?
Yeah, two bags of O-neg.
( screaming in Spanish )
ROJAS: Oscar!
I need a suture kit.
OSCAR: Papi!
Looks like multiple rib
fractures with flail segments on the right.
Hey, what the hell was that?
I need a suture kit.
Please. I'd like it on the Mayo stand with 3-0 vicryl.
You two need me to call Dr. Phil?
Sats are falling, 88 percent.
All right, let's prep for a chest tube.
Breath sounds are down on the right.
Oscar, I'm going
to put some cold stuff on you, okay? Frio.
ROJAS: Oscar!
Papi!
( gasping )
Oscar, this is going to pinch a little, okay?
Hey, you have to stay still, okay?
No, no, no, you have to stay still, okay?
( gasping )
Chest tube prep.
Push that lido.
He keeps moving.
I'm not cutting this kid open
without numbing him up first.
His BP's falling fast. Sam, get Chuny
to get some help here.
She's busy. Grab the portable oxygen.
He's on the wall line.
PRATT: Come on, do something.
Oscar!
( Rojas speaking Spanish )
OSCAR: Papi!
Oscar, there's your papi.
Papi?
See him? See him?
( speaking Spanish )
PRATT: All right, 10 blade.
ROJAS: Oscar.
TAGGART: Shh, he's right there.
( Oscar sobs quietly )
Okay, get plastics to check this facial lac.
I'll call.
Oh, my God.
Frank? Wake up.
Come on, Frank.
Breathe!
I need some help in here!
What happened now?
What'd he do, choke on a doughnut? Oh, man.
Draw troponin, lytes, CPK, coags,
type and cross for four.
What happened?
He's having a huge anterior MI.
You, grab a gurney.
Spontaneous resps on ten liter non-rebreather.
Last BP 102 over 60.
He needs metroprolol.
As soon as the bradycardia resolves.
Push 5000 of heparin.
Done.
Oh, no. MI?
How'd you guess? Come on, up.
I gave him 325 of aspirin. He's on oh-two. What else?
Duvata, call cards, tell them we've got one for the cath lab.
All right, everybody grab hold. Ready?
( all groan )
He sucks down fried chicken for 30 years, now we gotta pay.
All right, slide him up.
Pratt, you go with him.
I have patients.
I'll cover. Stay with him.
I want somebody there when he wakes up.
Is there anyone we should call? Does he have a family?
Only thing I know about his miserable life
is that you just saved it.
( sighs )
An hour ago, you told me not worry.
And now you want me to evacuate
because you can't stop one wacko?
Just consider it as a precaution.
I got snipers up on the roof,
snowplows blocking my ambulance bay...
Doctor Weaver, if I'm endangering any lives,
I'm willing to leave.
Good, why don't you go stand in the middle of Lakeshore Drive
and play Tiananmen Square?
She has a boyfriend.
That's nice.
You said you didn't want to be exclusive.
I said it four days ago.
I forgot she was coming.
You know what? I don't care.
It's fine, Luka. It's fine.
You think I really care how many little French girls you're screwing?
You already nailed every nurse in the E.R.
Dr. Kovac, sir?
Uh, I called on my cell.
They took the bus over.
You said they needed to get treated.
Hi, I'm, um, Dr. Kovac.
It's very important for all of you
to get checked today.
Because Brian gave us chlamydia, right?
Listen, I-I know you're all experimenting,
but having sex at your age,
and with people you don't have any feelings for...
Y-You... you may regret it later.
Hey, look who's awake.
I'll call your daughter for you, all right?
Whoa. You need that line for your medication.
( whimpers )
Do you want to be treated, Mr. Taslitz?
If your heart stops...
or you stop breathing,
do you want us to use heroic measures to keep you alive?
Or should we stop?
Blink twice if you think we should stop.
KAYSON: There's the occlusion...
right there. FRANK: Connie?
PRATT: Hey, what's up, Frank?
You're in the cath lab.
What are you doing to me?
You had a heart attack.
If we can open up the blockage in your artery,
it'll save you from bypass surgery.
KAYSON: Whoa, L.A.D.'s down to nothing.
Blood cells are marching through single file.
Timi zero to one flow.
FRANK: What's that mean?
You are going to give a 2-B-3-A inhibitor? You just watch
the pretty pictures and leave the medicine to me.
( alarm sounds ) P.V.C.'s.
KAYSON: Another 50 of lido.
What's happening? Pratt, you are disturbing
my patient, and you're bugging the hell out of me.
Why don't you wait outside?
Fine with me. Take care, big man.
Please... don't go.
Please stay.
Think I'll stay a few more minutes
if you don't mind, Dr. Kayson.
I do mind.
Tough.
Wow. Yeah, wow.
( sighs ): Well, at least the E.R.'s slow.
Mm. Closed to trauma, closed to transfers,
closed to ambulances.
Thank you, Dr. Morris.
Hey, I.R. called about, uh, Mr. Rojas,
the driver that he hit.
They, uh, embolized a small retroperitoneal bleeder.
He's going to be fine. What about his son?
Still in surgery.
I pulled his old charts.
The tank guy.
Back strain, broken finger, nosebleed,
five psych consults but no admissions,
distant history of cocaine and amphetamine abuse.
Probably nothing that would've convinced
a psych resident to give him a bed.
He had pressured speech, paranoia, delusions of grandeur.
Abby...
I missed a drug-induced psychosis.
Psych saw him five times.
He never met admission criteria.
Don't beat yourself up over this.
I'm not beating myself up.
The guy came here looking for help, and I let him go.
That's just what happened.
Dr. Carter.
Dr. Carter.
Sam is looking for you,
and Mrs. Delyanov has tight wheezing and her urticaria is back.
She's on alb... Excuse me, excuse me.
Do either of you work in the emergency department?
Yeah. I'm trying to find my husband.
Uh, what's his name?
Francis Martin. He works here.
My daddy answers the phones. He's in charge.
Frank?
Yes, Frank Martin.
Someone just called and said he was sick.
Um... I'm very sorry.
He had a heart attack.
( gasps ): Oh, my God.
He's up in the cath lab now.
Oh, my God.
What are they doing to him?
Um, angioplasty. It's a procedure
where they take a balloon
and unblock a blocked artery in the heart.
Uh, the cardiologist can explain all this to you.
Neela, will you take them upstairs?
Please, I'll show you where to wait.
Mr. Taslitz, can you hear me? He blinks all the time.
It doesn't mean anything.
His systolic's only 62; his pO2's even less.
He was satting well before-- he was alert.
Mr. Taslitz, I want you to blink twice
if you can hear me.
He's not following any commands.
I had a connection.
He wants his suffering to end.
CARTER: What's up? You guys need me?
No. I asked him to come.
He's my patient, Sam.
I just wanted someone more objective.
( alarm sounds ) SAM: Pressure's bottoming out.
Down to 40. I'm not getting a pulse.
It's P.A. What are we doing?
Starting compressions. Amp of epi.
This isn't what he wants.
Epi, Sam.
KAYSON: Guideline's through the occlusion.
Wonder what's for dinner.
You hungry? That's a good sign.
They used to fly us in a hot meal
every time we were in a firefight.
He's looped on the versed.
Let's hear some vitals.
A.C.T's 220. Pulse 87, resps 24.
Tay Nihn Province, second in the 22nd, mechanized infantry.
I'd hear those first enemy rounds: pop, pop, pop.
So you know how to use a bazooka?
They could use you outside right now.
It's funny... we were... that close to dying...
and I'd be thinking... 'I wonder if it's beef stew tonight.'
You're not dying, Frank.
BLAKE: Vessel's pretty angulated. Want a shorter stent?
KAYSON: No, it has to cover the lesion if we're going to prevent
acute re-occlusion.
I can wiggle it in there.
Half of my unit was black.
They were all cocky S.O.B.'s, just like you.
Some of your best friends, huh?
Yeah. Shanks...
He was shot right through the left eye... February 12, 1967.
Davis...
Bauer... Woodward...
None of 'em made it.
None of 'em.
KAYSON: All right, that looks good.
Inflate to 15 atmospheres.
You know what you are, buddy?
You were what those boys could've been.
( alarm sounds )
Frank?
Frank? He's out.
Inject contrast.
Pulse is up to 125. Pressure's dropping, sats 85.
He's perfed. He's bleeding into his pericardium.
KAYSON: Give me a covered stent, now.
Pressure's 65/0.
He's maxed out on dopamine and levophed.
Still no pulse. How much longer are we going, Deb?
Okay. Holding compressions.
No! SAM: V-tach.
Charge to 200.
Do it. Shock him.
CHEN: Clear.
No change. You're torturing the guy.
Keep going, please.
Charge to 300.
CARTER: Last time. Clear.
( alarm silences )
Sinus tach.
Got your father's heart beating in a normal rhythm
again, but he's going to have to have medicine
to keep him from having another arrhythmia.
Don't stop. Don't stop.
His heart is beating.
KAYSON: Run a liter of saline wide open.
Oh, Lord, another one-- can't you people stay
down in the E.R.? His family's here. What happened?
The artery is so calcified, the stent cracked it.
Muffled heart sounds.
Tamponade.
PRATT: Heart's surrounded by pressurized blood.
It needs to be drained.
All right, run dobutamine at 10 mikes
Prep for pericardiocentesis.
I'll get it.
PRATT: Needle to me.
You, stop.
This is not the E.R.
We do things a little more controlled
up here. Let me help.
( alarm sounds ) Pressure's dropping, 80/45.
We have to up his cardiac output.
I'll have the stent in in 90 seconds.
He doesn't have 90 seconds.
Systolic's down to 71. I can draw off 50cc's.
That'll buy us some time.
Dr. Kayson?
Just don't lacerate another coronary.
( alarm sounds ) All right. Okay.
Ah, yeah.
P.V.C.'s.
Now you're putting him into v-tach.
Okay, once you get ectopy on the monitor,
you just... pull back a little, uh...
like magic.
BLAKE: BP's coming up, 98/60.
Almost 30cc's of blood out.
BLAKE: O.R. Four is ready.
All right, let's roll.
One lucky needle doesn't make you
a cardiologist, Pratt.
Where is he?
On Ashland.
It's the only way he can come-- the roads are all blocked.
They'll stop him. They will.
He can't go past the snowplows.
Now they can throw his ass in jail.
What he needs is an eval and a psych admission.
What kind of eval does he need?
"Have you ever stalled a tank?"
Oh, God.
41-year-old male, three GSWs.
Where was he hit?
Chest, neck, shoulder. BP 108/72, tachy at 112.
Arterial bleeder. I need more gauze.
Deep breaths, Mr. Welling.
I said I was coming back.
Can't get a radial pulse.
You know, he's not going anywhere.
Cuffs stay put.
Mr. Welling?
He needs intubation, a chest tube, and 0-neg.
Morris, get your ass over here!
BP 78/56.
Hang two units on the rapid infuser.
He's hard to bag.
I can't get a good seal
with all this blood. I need suction.
All right, two more breaths,
then he gets tubed.
Sats are falling, down to 86.
Let me tube him.
I've got this. Come on, everybody,
let's push some SUCCS, huh?
Crichoid pressure?
Yep. Easy, Morris.
He has a GSW to the neck.
BP's falling down with his sats.
Oh, there's a lot of blood in there.
Okay, Yankauer.
Got it.
Okay, I am in. Bag him up.
Good breath sounds
on the right. Sats are only 68.
They're not coming up.
He might have a pneumo on the left.
Prep for a chest tube.
I'll do the chest tube.
No. Carter,
he's not doing it.
He was my patient!
Yeah, he was, and look what happened.
Morris is up.
Okay, Chuny, set him up with betadine.
Betadine, and a ten blade, please.
Heart rate's only 48.
All right, Morris, fifth intercostal space.
In the mid-axillary line, I know.
That's right.
Blunt dissection, stay superior to the rib.
I've got it.
32 French on a curved vascular next.
Run of six.
( grunts )
I can't get it in.
I'm losing the pulse.
Carter?
He's got it.
Keep your finger in the tract. Chuny, open
the crash cart.
Stand by to start compressions.
No. I'm in.
Hook up the thoraseal.
Right.
Sats are coming up.
That's nice work, Morris.
Okay, hang two more units,
let's get him to the OR.
Strong carotid, good breath sounds.
BP's up to 60 systolic.
Kick the brake. Are we clear?
Can I scrub in? Nope.
He's going to be okay.
We saved him.
Luka?
Joanne's admitting one of Brian's friends.
PID?
Upper-tract chlamydia with a huge tubo-ovarian abscess.
They'll try antibiotics.
I hope she doesn't need surgery.
She could lose a tube.
Fun.
Going home?
Another hour.
Do you want to get some coffee?
I'll wait.
No, thanks.
Hi.
Hey.
Are you ready?
Yeah.
Okay. Let's go.
Oh. Thank you.
It's very kind of you to sit with us.
You know, it was always my worst nightmare
when Frank was on the police force...
that I'd get some call from the hospital.
You can't ever stop worrying, can you?
Dr. Pratt will find us when he has any news.
You know, Frank took this job because he wanted
to put more money away for Janie.
That's all he ever thinks about is his Janie.
I'm sure he talks about her all the time.
Yes.
But he loves it here, comes home with stories all the time.
He always makes the work day very interesting.
You're Neela Rasgotra, right?
Mm-hmm.
Frank always says how bright you are...
and how well you're doing.
( crying )
That's very kind.
Yeah.
Frank's always been a people person.
They should be taking him up to the ICU in about an hour.
He won't open his eyes anymore.
Uh... he might have suffered more brain damage
when he wasn't getting oxygen.
After he gets out of the hospital,
it's gonna be hard to take care of him at home.
We can help you find a good long- term facility.
Dahlia...
Do you think people get what they deserve?
No, not really.
I was 17 when he got hurt.
Tim Landau called from the floor of the shop.
I thought it was Dad calling
to see if I was home from school.
He called every day since the fifth grade.
He wanted me to be there when he got home...
because my stepmom would still be at the restaurant.
So we'd be alone.
You and your dad?
I'd take a shower, and wait in my room.
He liked it when I left my hair wet.
We can go to Beat Kitchen or Liquid.
I heard it's very hip.
Dancing?
You want to just go home?
We can dance there.
You don't want to dance.
Gillian...
Are you in love with her?
The nurse?
You know, I'm jealous.
I don't have any right to be, but...
yeah.
A bientot.
Je t'embrasse.
PRATT: You're okay.
We had to open up your chest to bypass the blockage.
So, no more nachos, no more perogies.
Remember, today is the first day of the rest of your life, Frank.
I'm in hell, right?
You killed me.
You and your...
faithful Indian companion.
Daddy?
Daddy...
( groans )
I wasn't scared, I wasn't.
That's my good girl.
( groans )
You're my...
my brave girl.
Hard to believe he was an officer.
And a husband and a dad.
And a bigot.
That, too.
Bypass went well?
Yeah, less than 30 minutes of pump time.
Kayson says you're banned from the cath lab.
Nice work, you two.
Dr. Corday, they need you in OR 1.
I'm already late for dinner.
They said it was 911.
ALEX: So the guy's head comes off
and then these spider legs grow out.
It's really cool.
You should probably close your eyes.
Luka!
KOVAC: Hey.
We rented The Thing and Evil Dead II.
Have you seen them?
Nope.
Well, Mom got me McDonald's,
but you could probably order a pizza.
Alex, why don't you head upstairs?
Isn't Luka coming up?
Put the popcorn on--
two and a half minutes on high, okay?
It's cold.
They said it was going to snow.
Luka, I'm tired.
Gillian went to a hotel.
She was at your apartment last night, wasn't she?
When I came by.
Yeah.
You talked to me and closed the door,
and, like, five minutes later...
I was probably still on the stairs.
I'm sorry.
God, I am so stupid.
I really...
Whatever.
You came here to say something, so say it.
It's freezing outside.
I screwed up.
I just wanted to apologize.
Okay.
Sam...
Just tell Alex I said...
Just tell him I'm sorry I couldn't stay.
Sure.
Hey!
These movies scare the crap out of me.
