CORDAY: Oh, look, here they are.
Fantastic.
Hey.
Hi. Good morning, Ella.
Hi.
Happy birthday, Sydney.
Are you ready for your party?
She's been ready for a month.
We're going to aquarium,
and then we're having a puppy party.
It seemed like a good idea
at the time.
I put her present and a card
in Ella's backpack. Thanks.
I'm must say, you're awfully brave
taking this on alone.
Hey, you're welcome to come with us.
Yeah, Mommy.
Come with us, please!
Oh, Ella, I have to work in the hospital.
I'd come if I could, but I have to do
a pancreaticojejunostomy at 9:00.
No problem.
I'll come another time, I promise.
You have fun at the party.
Okay. Thanks, Dave.
I'll pick her up around 6:00? They should be well
into their sugar rush by then.
Marvelous.
All right, girls.
Love you. Bye. GIRLS: Bye.
KEM: Do you think I could talk
to someone in the infectious disease department?
It would be great to compare adherence statistics
for HIV patients in Chicago.
Yeah, I can probably arrange that.
And it would be really helpful
if I could spend some time in your clinical lab.
'Cause even though the chances
of us getting one are remote,
I would love to take look
at the current generation flow cytometer.
Uh-huh, uh-huh.
And counting lymphocytes under a microscope
is the best I can do for now.
Yeah, I just got to check all this with Dr. Weaver.
Frank, have you seen Dr. Weaver? Try the lounge.
I'll be right back.
Breakfast pierogie?
His dedication to the staff
and patients will be hard to replicate.
Kerry? To duplicate.
Ooh, sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt.
You didn't. Have you seen Dr. Lewis?
No. I just got on.
Hey, would you mind
if Kem observed in the hospital today?
Yeah.
Um, she has her master's degree in public health.
That's no reason to punish her.
Give the poor woman a credit card, Carter,
and let her have some fun.
I tried that.
She, uh, would like to speak to the public health nurses
and see how we track communicable diseases.
Sure, fine. Maybe she can motivate some
of the slackers around here.
Frank, where's Lewis? Got me.
Okay, I want everybody in the lobby at 9:00
for the dedication.
Huh.
What dedication?
Well, they're renaming the hospital Romano Memorial.
( chuckles ) I'm not kidding.
Where is Kem?
There.
Ah.
Do all the patients
with sexually transmitted infections
get routine HIV testing?
Sometimes.
It depends on the doctor.
Do you refer them to your STI clinic?
I don't think we have one.
Hi.
Did you talk to Dr. Weaver?
Yeah. She said everything's fine.
Kem's going to be hanging out in the hospital today.
Why?
Morning, folks.
Ride-along?
Yup.
Interns have to do, uh,
paramedic ride-alongs twice a year.
Lets them see what real medicine's all about.
Oh, yeah, right.
You might want to pop a couple steroids
before we try lifting this one, Doc.
31-year-old male, fell down a flight of stairs.
Complains of back and diffuse abdominal pain.
Frank, did any labs come back on the Gorham kid?
Frank, you all right?
I think I'm having a heart attack.
Are you kidding?
Do I look like I'm kidding?
Okay, here, here. Sit down. Sit down.
I need some nitro over here!
( belches )
( sighs )
Oh.
That feels a lot better.
You know, I bet it was just those breakfast pierogies.
Thanks.
Hey, check you out, Mr. GQ.
What, do you have a deportation hearing?
Have another pierogie, Frank.
CARTER: Hey, Luka, could use another set
of hands over here.
I'm not on. It's just for the transfer.
Where's Dr. Lewis?
Uh, did you check the on-call room?
I think she's sleeping.
Are you kidding me?
She wasn't feeling well.
Do you need something?
Yeah, I need someone to run this damn department.
Can't help you there.
Hey, uh, Susan,
the Medical Executive Committee has authorized
a nationwide search to look
for Romano's replacement.
Until we can find a suitable candidate,
we'd like you to step in.
Oh, Kerry, thank you for the vote of confidence,
but, um, I, uh, I... I'll pass.
I'm going home.
Wait. It's-it's an extra three grand a month.
Do med students qualify?
I'm sorry. I'm just not interested.
Why not?
Um, I'm pregnant.
( vomiting )
Cleanup on aisle five.
I'll phone upstairs as soon as I'm done down here.
Please let me sit up.
I can't catch my breath.
That's 'cause you've got too much weight on your chest.
We need to get an X ray of your neck first.
No, you don't.
Uh, yeah, we can use the nexus criteria.
If he's alert and sober
without any focal neuro deficits,
distracting injury, or neck pain,
then he's low risk for C-spine fracture.
Any pain in here, sir?
No.
What are you doing here today if you're not working?
I'm giving a lecture to the med students
on clinical decision-making without the use
of ancillary tests.
Look towards me.
Now look at Dr. Kovac.
Any pain there?
No.
That's very cool.
Our health care system requires us to diagnose
and treat with a minimum of tests and equipment.
Hey, maybe Kem could sit in on your lecture?
She's doing a little recon in the hospital today.
I-I never taught in the classroom before.
Oh, you're a natural. Okay, his neck's clear.
Let's get him off the board
and sit him up.
Ready? One, two, three, go.
Hemocue is 12.8.
Trauma labs drawn.
This is exactly what I'm talking about.
All he needs is a CBC and UA.
Diffuse abdominal pain--
he meets trauma guidelines.
I'm sending a trauma panel.
There's no rebound or guarding.
He doesn't need LFTs; he doesn't need amylase;
and he doesn't need to be typed and crossed.
Nurses have to follow protocols.
They're unnecessary.
You know what?
Why don't you save the lectures
for your med students
'cause the nurses don't want to hear it.
Weaver says to get your butts in the lobby pronto.
WEAVER: Dr. Robert Romano
was a fixture in this hospital for years.
His dedication to the staff
and patients will be hard to forget.
And his generosity continues even now.
Hey, how you doing?
Very good, thank you.
A significant portion of Dr. Romano's estate was left
to this hospital to further our service
of this community.
And to that end, I am pleased to announce
the creation of...
the Robert Romano Center
for Gay, Lesbian,
Bisexual and Transgendered Health Care.
This new facility will provide the latest
in health services to those patients
and their families.
She didn't.
Oh, yes, she did.
All right, that's it. Back to work.
Pratt, you missed your appointment with Bob Harris
from Risk Management.
Yeah, I know. I've been a little busy.
Yeah. I got you another appointment in 30 minutes.
Don't be late.
Is it just me, or do the eyes seem to follow you?
Was Romano's prosthetic arm destroyed in the accident?
Why?
Because if it wasn't,
it's going to hunt Dr. Weaver down and strangle her.
He wasn't a big supporter of gay rights?
Uh, no, not really.
That's too creepy.
Did I miss the dedication?
More like postmortem payback.
Oh, my God.
All right, looks clear to me.
What do you think?
I think we should discuss it over dinner.
Really?
You like Moroccan?
I'll eat just about anything.
Okay.
TAGGART: Pratt!
Approximately 20-year-old male,
feet versus tree at 30 miles per hour.
Was he thrown from a car? This thing is frozen.
Yeah, his buddies wrapped him up and tied him to a toboggan
and sent him down a hill like some sort of body luge.
Witnesses say he bounced off the tree
and wound up in a creek.
I can palpate a decent carotid,
but we can't get his arm out for a BP.
We got his boots off.
It looks like bilateral foot fracture.
He may have a spinal injury.
Maybe we should get Carter on this.
What's wrong with you?
Hey, come find me later.
All right, let's get
ten liters of warm irrigation solution
so we can thaw out this damn blanket,
and let's cut off this tape
so we can do a proper assessment.
I hate this time of year.
We must get 30 slip-and-fall calls a week,
right, Bardelli?
At least.
Here's an idea-- if it's icy
and you're old, don't go outside.
Save yourself a broken hip.
( yelling and thumping )
MAN: Go away.
You called 911 for paramedics?
MAN: Shut up, bitch.
WOMAN: I'm not gonna shut up.
You shut up.
Hello? Is someone hurt in there?
WOMAN: Leave me alone.
Great. I'll call the police.
Hold on. What are we doing?
We need to get in there.
Not till the police get here.
Are you kidding me?
What if he's hurting her?
We wait for the cops.
EMT got shot last year
going in without backup.
Open the door.
You have to enter two pages of demographics
for every patient that walks through the door?
Yes.
So, what do you do with all the information?
That's really up to the public health geeks.
Do you ever use it to try and track down
patients who leave without being seen?
You have to ask one of the docs.
So, how many people leave without seeing a doctor?
Look, lady, I just work here.
What kind of training do you need for this job?
Dr. Weaver?
Hmm?
Do you know how many patients leave
without getting medical attention?
How about calling off this grand inquisition?
Somewhere around five percent.
Some of us are trying to work here.
Hi. Uh, I just got off the phone with Dr. Farina,
and someone's going to phone me back
about letting you take a tour of the lab.
That's great.
So, do you want to try and catch Luka's lecture,
and I'll just have you paged when I hear something?
Luka didn't seem too keen on the idea.
Oh, he's just shy.
I think he'll appreciate your interest.
Kerry, are we truly to believe
that Robert left a substantial donation
to establish a gay and lesbian center?
Gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgendered--
whatever the hell that means.
The actual designation was left
to the discretion of the board.
This is the one area
where we felt that County was truly lacking.
Revenge is a dish best served cold.
( sirens blaring )
Yo, Morales, the police are here, man.
Come on. This is crazy.
Just relax, man.
Right here.
GALLANT: Listen, there's a woman inside.
It sounds like she's being killed.
( yelling and thumping inside )
This is the police department.
Open the door.
Back up.
Back up, back up.
Sit down, sir. Sit down.
She tripped.
Ma'am, are you okay?
He pushed me.
She's drunk. She tripped.
Sit down now, sir.
You're the drunk.
You liar.
I think you better take a look at her.
I'm gonna kill you, bitch. Quiet down!
I swear to God, I'm gonna kill you.
Enough of that.
Patients with peripheral vertigo
do not require CT scanning.
What clinical test will diagnose BPPV?
Anyone?
Sheila?
Could you repeat that last part?
Ah, come on, guys.
Positional test for vertigo?
( sighs )
Rectal temp's 87.6 degrees.
I think he's coming around.
Hey, what's your name, man?
Doug.
Doug, you want to tell me what happened? Talk to me.
A hockey initiation.
I'm cold.
Well, we're working on that.
You want to start pleural lavage
with bilateral chest tubes?
No. Let's do external rewarming.
He's groggy and under 89 degrees.
That's the criteria for active rewarming.
Yeah, but he's progressing on his own.
Let's get a warming blanket, heated IV fluids,
and heated O2 by mask.
What happened to this guy?
Well, looks like Doug's friends here
took him sledding, and he wound up swimming.
Temp: 87.6.
We're using passive rewarming.
Rest of the vitals?
BP is good: 112/78.
Pulse: 106.
Sinus tach on the monitor.
Films?
PRATT: Bilateral calcaneal fractures
and a compression fracture of L-5.
Doug, can you wiggle your toes?
Can you wiggle your toes, Doug?
All right, let's get an MRI
to rule out spinal cord injury.
No. Lumbar compression fractures
like this almost never have cord involvement.
He can't moves his toes.
That's probably from the frostbite.
Try some warm water immersion.
CARTER: Yeah.
DTRs are two plus and equal.
How's the rectal tone?
Pretty normal. Good.
Sacral nerves are intact.
S two, three, four,
and keeps the poop off the floor.
There's sensory loss in the toes.
Not in the distribution of a dermatome.
Warm up the toes and reassess.
No MRI.
( Doug breathing loudly )
I can't feel my toes.
We're warming them up, Doug.
I can't feel anything.
What's happening?
Well, you broke both your heels
and one of your vertebrae.
Oh, my back's broken?
It's a compression fracture.
Your legs took most the impact.
So, am I paralyzed?
We're still waiting.
No. Am I paralyzed?
Just tell me.
( Doug breathing loudly )
Get the MRI.
Look, can you call my dad?
Can somebody call my dad?
But Dr. Carter said...
Just do it.
Dr. Pratt, you're a hard man to track down.
Bob Harris.
I'm with the hospital's Risk Management Department.
Yeah. I can't talk right now.
Yeah, I realize you're busy, Doctor.
I need you to write up your recollections
of a case regarding an MVA patient
by the name of Martin Brodie.
He suffered from ankle...
Ankylosing spondylitis.
Yeah. The disease turned the guy's neck
into a breadstick.
Were the injuries he received
from the car accident exacerbated by his condition?
He came in having trouble breathing.
I tried to help him.
And there were complications?
Look, I snapped the guy's neck.
Now he's a quadriplegic.
The insurance settlement
on this one is going to be in the millions.
Do you have any idea
how much 24/7 nursing care in a state facility costs?
I mean, Martin Brodie's a 19-year-old boy
looking at, what, 40-50 more years
of total paralysis?
Have your notes on my desk by 9:00 a.m.
GALLANT: Pupils equal and reactive.
I hope he rots in jail.
Pulse: 105; BP: 118/82
with descent sats around 94%.
Smells like her blood alcohol's about the same.
MORALES: From what I can tell,
all these lacerations are superficial
and both her lungs are up.
Is there any chest pain, belly pain?
Hey, Amy, stay with us.
Where did he go?
He's being arrested.
Listen, she's going to need a head CT.
Keep her on the monitor and stand by with a tube
just in case she starts to go south.
All right.
Hey, do you hear something?
Sounds like a kid crying.
( gunshot )
Wait! Wait, wait, wait.
It's just a kid. It's just a kid.
Drop the gun, son.
I thought you were my dad.
( panting )
With a normal neurologic exam
and a Glasgow Coma Score of 15,
you do not need a head CT,
and you save $2,000 in health care costs.
We do about ten unnecessary scans a day.
Dr. Kovac,
the costs to procure and maintain a CT scanner
are relatively fixed, am I right?
Yeah.
So, if you eliminated half the scans,
wouldn't that then
double the costs of the tests you did do?
There would be no real savings in health care dollars,
and the patient would actually be billed twice as much.
Wouldn't the real solution be
to have several hospitals share one scanner?
Did you send Mrs. Wintermuhe
to radiology?
No, I sent her home.
What about her abdominal pain?
Uh, it was more discomfort than pain.
Her husband's been off work with a worker's comp claim,
and her son just moved back home with his daughter
while he's going through a nasty divorce.
Did you get her whole family history?
Half the people that come in here
just want to talk to somebody.
How's your son doing?
Uh, fine.
He hasn't given himself a thoracotomy yet,
so that's good news.
He'll probably end up a brain surgeon.
Yeah, or a grave robber.
You're a "glass-half-full" kind of guy, huh?
Hey, how's the teaching going?
Ask Kem.
She seems to be doing most of the talking.
Yeah, she can be a little inquisitive.
I'll talk to her.
Don't any of these patients
have primary care doctors?
There's a three-month wait to be seen in the clinic.
( loud coughing and wheezing )
Hi, Mrs. LeMonier.
I'm Neela.
( coughing and wheezing continue )
Can you tell me what's wrong?
My children are sick.
You don't sound very well yourself.
Parlez-vous Francais, Madame?
Ah, oui.
D'ou etes-vous?
Haiti.
She's from Haiti.
Do you recognize that?
Pneumonitis?
It sounds like pertussis.
Whooping cough? Really?
CARTER: Hey, there you are.
John, I think this woman has pertussis.
Is that possible?
Yeah, we get the odd case.
In Chicago? Mm-hmm.
How's the lecture going?
Interesting. Luka's an excellent teacher.
( laughing )
I should probably be getting back,
but I think Neela needs a translator.
Oh, I think we can probably manage that.
Dr. Farina called.
He's ready to give you a tour
of the infectious disease department.
What about the lecture?
I think he'll understand.
Hey, Neela, can you take Kem up to 5 West?
Certainly.
If you see Luka, tell him I'm sorry
I missed the rest of his lecture.
Yeah, come find me when you're done.
And check out that woman.
Is that the domestic?
Yeah. Superficial lacs, maybe a broken arm.
We got a kid, too.
He almost shot Gallant's head off.
So, how are you liking Chicago?
It's very... nice.
How long have you been here?
I've been in America for seven years.
Chicago for the last three.
Do you like it?
I still feel like I'm getting settled in.
But it's quite pleasant for a big city, really.
Although it's not quite London.
No. Or Paris.
No.
It's much more agreeable in the summer.
Tad warmer, too.
That is good to know.
The people are friendly enough.
Yeah. They're larger than I expected-- the people.
Yeah. They're quite fond of their giant portions here.
Big Gulp, Supersize, Monster Fries-- all that.
I saw a woman drinking a bucket of coffee this morning.
Actually, that's quite common.
Is this a med-surg admit?
Yeah. And let's run in a gram of Ancef, too.
No. I just want to go home.
Okay. We'll see what we can do.
How we doing over here?
It's okay, Rudy.
Dr. Carter's one of the good guys.
He's going to help you and your mom.
Physically, he's fine.
How are you?
My ears are still ringing, but I'm cool.
Did you call DCFS?
Yeah.
Okay, Rudy,
I'll be back in a little bit
to check in on you and your mom, okay?
Vitals "q" 30 minutes and CBC in an hour,
and set up a suture set with 4-0 nylon.
Okay.
Doug. How are you feeling?
Better. Warmer.
Good. Where's he coming from?
MRI.
I said he didn't need that.
Pratt thought otherwise.
It's not my job to make sure
your residents listen to you.
I'm getting pretty tired
of the doctors thinking that we work for them
or that they can tell us what to do.
The patients think it works that way, too.
I'm staying out of this conversation.
And what is with Kovac
and his holier-than-thou healing hands?
I'm getting pretty sick of that.
Oh, I don't know.
Those healing hands
have their good points, right, Abby?
Did you go out with Kovac?
Briefly, yeah.
And Carter? Yup.
Abby's the ER slut.
I went out with two doctors
in the five years that I've worked here.
Hey, Abby, are we still on for tonight?
Yeah. Great.
( chuckling ): We're studying.
And you shouldn't talk, Chuni.
( chuckling )
Kovac gets around.
Our goal is to get
all of our triple combination therapy patients
to an undetectable viral load.
I'd be ecstatic
just to be able to follow CD4 counts.
Would it be possible for me to visit the AIDS ward?
It would if we had one.
15 years ago, we had an entire floor of AIDS patients.
Now, the few inpatients we care for
are on the general medical service.
We had a gentlemen earlier in the week with Kaposi's,
but he was discharged yesterday.
It's so different from what I deal with.
I see thousands of deaths from opportunistic infections.
You're welcome to observe in the outpatient clinic.
These are your AIDS patients?
Mm-hmm.
NEELA: Breath sounds are diminished on the left, I think.
He has a scar over his fifth rib.
From a chest tube.
That's right.
Some quack stuck one in me last year.
You're not going to do that again, are you?
Not if we can help it.
Did you send the human toboggan for an MRI?
Yeah, I was just...
Even though I told you it was unnecessary.
The guy started freaking out once you left.
He was worried about paralysis.
Uh-huh, and you...?
I was trying to be thorough.
Ah, well, so was I.
Next time you disagree with my orders,
come and talk to me about it, okay?
Okay.
You ready to present this?
Neela.
Mr. Morgan is 64.
He has Wegener's Granulamatosis,
which is an inflammation
of the upper and lower respiratory tract.
Vitals are in the normal range.
So, he's satting at 92?
He's not taking any deep breaths.
'Cause it hurts like hell.
I told you that already.
Sounds like pleural effusion.
Yeah. You need to do a thoracentesis.
I've already paged Pulmonology.
Well, that's good, as long as Mr. Morgan
doesn't mind gasping for air until sometime tomorrow.
Tomorrow? I could be dead by then.
He's had a number of bronchoscopies.
They put his lung down last year doing a thoracentesis,
and had to put in a chest tube.
He'll be better off if they do it upstairs.
He will... Yeah.
...or you will?
You sent a guy for an MRI this morning that he doesn't need
'cause you were worried about paralysis,
and now you don't want to do a thoracentesis.
So?
So, sounds to me like you're still a little gun-shy
from... breaking that kid's neck.
Man, there's tons of scar tissue around his lung.
Besides, a thoracentesis down here
only opens him up for a risk of infection.
Okay. I'll do it.
Neela, would you set me up for a thoracentesis, please?
All right, Betadine the chest.
Load up a syringe with one percent of Lido.
I got this.
I really don't mind doing this.
I said I got it.
Okay, Mr. Morgan, we're going to sit you up
and drain some of the fluid out of your lungs
so you can breathe better.
It's about time.
Does this guy know what he's doing?
You are in very good hands with Dr. Pratt.
And I'll be back in a little bit.
I've been looking all over for you.
Hey. You're back already?
You really should come and see this patient.
How did it go with Dr. Farina?
He was very nice and generous
with his time and his data,
but I'm still ten years away from the results he's getting.
Are you finished with Mr. Yarrow?
Leg lac in Two.
Yeah. He's good.
Just wash out the wound, give him a tetanus shot
and eight of morphine.
Anything else?
That should do it.
Have you ever heard of Echo Free?
Let me guess.
Something Kovac does instead of pain meds?
No. It's a club on LaSalle.
My friend DJs there.
A bunch of us are going tonight--
if you don't mind hanging around with nurses.
I don't think I'd be much good tonight.
I'm having a bad day.
All the more reason to go out with us.
Nurses make people feel better all the time.
Mmm.
Hey, Pratt, pick up line six.
Take a message.
It's Dr. Chen.
She's calling from Shoe Goo, Kin Goo--
Okay. somewhere in China.
I have to take this.
Hey, what's up?
What?! When?
Oh, I'm sorry.
What room is Mr. Yardley in?
Listen, it's not your fault, Jing-mei.
You know that.
Pulseless foot? You paged a surgeon.
You just stay focused
on getting your father better.
Dr. Lawson came and got him.
No, I was talking to somebody else.
Who?
The radiologist.
They took him down for an angiogram,
wound up doing angioplasty and putting in a stent.
He's good.
Yeah, I know. Well, that's wonderful.
But someone could have at least called to tell me.
Dr. Pratt, Mr. Morgan's
dropped his pressure-- 86/66.
All right, look, I've got to take this.
Talk to Dr. Chen.
Her mother just died.
Vouz-avez d'incontinence?
Oui, un peu.
All right, uh, let's get a bordetella PCR,
pertussis serologies and a culture.
Avez-vous des autres enfants?
( coughs ): Oui...
j'ai un bebe de 18 mois.
Il est chez moi avec ma maman.
Est-ce qu'ils ont malade?
Ma mere, elle est très malade,
mais elle ne viendra pas a l'hôpital.
Elle n'aime pas les docteurs americains.
D'accord. Pas de probleme.
Merci.
Did you get all that?
She has another kid?
An 18-month-old
who's at home with her sick mother.
Well, they both need to come in.
They're both probably infected.
Grandmother won't come to the hospital.
She doesn't trust American doctors.
That's a problem.
Can't treat them unless they come in.
What if we go there?
This is America.
We don't make house calls.
Don't.
What?
( laughing ): You know what.
I'm not leaving the hospital.
Do you see how many patients I have?
Okay, I mean it. Stop it.
( sighs )
Gallant.
I need you guys to make a run for me.
I'd like to stick around
with my buddy Rudy here, just until DCFS shows up.
After that, then.
Carter, Pratt needs you in Exam Three.
Sats 78.
It's a tension pneumo.
16 gauge angiocath and betadine.
He's not breathing. Should I bag him?
No, it'll make the pneumo worse.
Open up a chest tube tray.
Size 8h gloves.
Heart rate's dropping. Do you want a crash cart?
All right, slow down. ABCs.
I know what the problem is.
Then treat it.
No pulse.
He's not breathing.
Okay, bag him.
I knew this was going to happen.
This is why I wanted pulmonary to do this.
Takes a minute for the lung to re-expand.
Chest tube is definitive.
Pressure's 94/62. It's coming up.
Ten blade.
He's waking up.
Okay, let's run in the fluids, wide open.
I've got a femoral pulse.
Curved Kelly. Pressure's coming up.
Sats 82 and rising.
28 French.
Here, you wanna sew this?
Sure.
Uh, where you going?
This guy's good, and I've got other patients.
Uh, Dr. Pratt...
I'll be back.
Hey, have you seen Pratt?
Nope. What about Kem?
Haven't seen her, either.
Maybe they're together.
You need to keep better track of your woman, Carter.
Hey, Chuni, have you seen Pratt?
Sorry. We have rules, too, you know.
What are you talking about?
What the hell's going on?
The paramedics needed a translator.
You took her with you?
She's persuasive.
She's febrile. She's also diabetic.
Weak pulse, and was already pretty out of it when we found her.
( baby crying )
She was still talking when we found her.
I just can't believe that you would go out there.
Temp: 40.2. Accucheck: 252.
All right, full set of labs,
uh, pertussis PCR and culture, and blood cultures.
( coughing ) Well, that sounds good.
How long has she had that?
Several months. Several months.
She said a lot of other people in the building are sick.
And you exposed yourself to them?
Has she been coughing up anything?
MARQUEZ: Ectopy. Ma'am?
All right, run a liter wide open.
Let's get a 12 lead on her.
BP's dropping 92/56.
Okay, she's septic and hypotensive.
Let's mix up some dopamine, titrate
to a systolic of 90, 3.375 of Zosyn
and 150 of Gent.
Pertussis is not a risk to my pregnancy.
You don't know what else she's carrying. Maybe TB.
What do you think I'm exposed to back home?
Why don't you go ask Mrs. LeMonier
if her mother has any advanced directives.
You sure you two aren't married?
I need a portable x-ray.
Get him in here. Pratt!
I need another set of hands.
I've got a pretty nasty head lac in here.
Get a med student to do it.
You need to sit down and roll up your sleeve, Louie.
If you don't get your epa shot, you're going to get sick again.
Do you want to be sick, end up in the hosp...?
Hey, hey, hey! Help! Security!
Hey, Louie, put her down, or I'm going to call your mother.
Now say you're sorry.
Sorry. Sorry.
She didn't give me any gum.
All right, well, that's no reason
to pick her up. Here.
Sit down and behave yourself.
You okay?
I just... Yeah.
Louie's a lifter.
He likes to pick things up, including nurses.
Just have to give him a stick of gum before you give him a shot.
Yeah, now you tell me.
Um... listen, about earlier.
I don't want you to get the wrong idea about Luka.
He's a good guy.
I'm not looking for anything right now.
Okay. I just thought you should know.
Thank you, but independence works pretty good for me...
although I wouldn't mind some regular sex.
No kidding. I'd settle for irregular sex.
Can you help my husband?!
LOCKHART: What's the problem?
It's my leg. Did you fall?
No, no. She shot me.
Mom's still sleeping off
her bender-- she got about 30 stitches.
Her head CT was negative,
but surgery wants to watch her overnight.
BP's 110/78 after three liters,
and her crit's 41. That's pretty good.
Listen, if they're going to discharge her in the morning,
why don't we just keep the kid here with her overnight?
Oh, DCFS won't let us do that.
They'll want to place him under foster care.
It's only one night.
Then we need to admit him.
What?
He's looking a little dehydrated.
He was complaining of abdominal pain earlier.
Let's observe him overnight for a rule-out appy.
Look, if he was your kid...
I'll start a chart.
Hey, Rudy.
Got good news for you.
You and your mom-- you get to spend the night at my hospital tonight.
You hungry? Is there anything I could get you?
They took my gun.
The police took your father's gun because it's dangerous, okay?
You could hurt yourself or somebody else.
How am I going to protect my mom?
Look, buddy, your dad...
he's going to jail for what he did.
Okay? You don't have to be worried about him now.
He'll get out. He always does.
Turns off the lights so I can't see him
hitting my mom... or find the phone...
but I can always hear him.
BARDELLI: Yo, Mike.
Yeah, in a minute.
We got to roll, man.
( sighs )
Look, I'll be back, okay?
I promise.
Everything'll be okay.
No cardiac motion, no effusion or tamponade.
Resume CPR. Qu'est-ce qui se passe?
KEM: Les docteurs font tout qu'ils peuvent.
Zosyn is up, another liter up.
Another round of Epi and atropine.
Could be massive PE or MI.
Hypovolemia-possible.
Hypoxia-possible.
No pneumo, hypothermia, or tamponade.
All right, hold CPR.
V-tach. I'll shock her.
Charge it to 360.
Clear.
V-fib. Clear.
She's flatlined.
MARQUEZ: Want to pace her?
You ran it. You call it.
Time of death: 5:48.
I'm very sorry, ma'am.
Maybe if she had come in
two weeks earlier, we could've...
You ran a good code.
Didn't help her any. Nous sommes desole,
ma'am, mais il n'y a rein qu'ils pourraient faire.
Non! Ce n'est pas possible. Carter, Abby needs you in here.
Two liters in, pressure's up to 120 systolic.
Gram of Ancef. Update his tetanus.
What's up? You tell me.
GSW with no exit wound. I can't find the bullet.
Pelvic and chest films are clear.
Maybe it migrated to the foot.
I checked, but let's get a foot and a tib-fib.
I didn't even want a gun in the house.
And now I know why.
KELLY: It was an accident.
I told you I didn't want to learn how to use it.
SAM: First hemocue's 12.4.
Frequent PVCs on the monitor.
Repeat the hemocue in 30 minutes.
Sir, do you have any heart problems?
No.
Do you use cocaine or crystal meth?
KARL: No, no, no.
Ooh...
Bullet's in the right ventricle.
LOCKHART: Are you kidding me?
What is it? Di-Did you find it? Mm-hmm.
The bullet traveled up your femoral vein
into the inferior vena cava into your heart.
( alarm buzzing )
What is that? Run of six--
100 of lidocaine.
Can you get it out?
Yeah. He'll need an operation.
KELLY: On his heart?
The bullet is irritating his heart, right? Yeah.
Let's page Corday and cardiothoracic
just to be safe,
and re-bolus 50
of lido in five.
Help me roll him on his right side.
Will that help it to come out?
Uh, no, but that should keep the bullet
from entering into his lungs.
Is that bad?
We don't want that to happen.
You put a bullet in my heart?
I shot you in the leg,
and it was an accident.
Um, you got this?
Yep.
Paramedics ran over our ball.
Yeah, well, it happens.
So, seven is my record.
What?
We lost seven patients in one shift
my second year of residency.
Is that supposed to cheer me up?
( sighs )
You know... when you first got here,
you were... dangerous, reckless and arrogant.
Is this your idea of a pep talk?
Hey, we all get our confidence rattled.
If you don't, then you should start worrying,
'cause it means that you've stopped caring,
and believe me, you could do
a lot more harm playing it safe.
So we're damned if we do, damned if we don't.
What do you want me to tell you...
everything's going to be okay?
That you're going to get so good
that nothing bad is ever going to happen again?
Forget it. This is what we do.
If we're successful in our jobs,
then patients live, and if we're not...
sometimes they die.
Or wind up paralyzed.
Did you do what you thought was best?
Was there a chance that you might've been right?
Afterwards, did you tell the kid what had happened?
Yeah. All right, then.
Quit feeling sorry for yourself.
You're a good doctor.
Start acting like it.
CARTER: Hey.
How's the daughter?
Better than I would be if I'd just seen my mother die.
Are you angry with me?
No.
But I didn't expect you to be doing paramedic ride-alongs.
Did you even eat lunch today?
I'll grab something.
You need to eat properly.
Carter, did you treat the woman with pertussis?
Yeah, why?
I think you better get out here.
I don't speak French,
so I don't know what they're saying.
Who are "they"?
( people coughing harshly )
They're Mrs. LeMonier's neighbors.
I told them that everyone in the building should be
examined and possibly inoculated.
You did? ( coughing continues )
Now you're angry.
I'm not angry.
Let's get everybody into Triage
and round up as much pertussis vaccine as you can.
Can I help?
I love you!
( chuckles ): Yeah, yeah.
John, where's the man with the bullet in his heart?
He's gone.
What, he's dead?
No, no, no, they took him upstairs.
Who?
Um, Dr. Lawson. Who the hell
is this Dr. Lawson?
He's the new invasive radiologist.
I was supposed to pick my daughter up 40 minutes ago,
but I stayed late because I was paged down here.
Well, he said he wanted to do it
so that you didn't have to. Jeez.
What are you doing?
You must be Dr. Corday.
That's right.
Uh, sorry, you got involved in this case how?
I was downstairs.
I saw his chest X ray.
Well, I was the consulting surgeon.
Actually, this is the second patient of mine
you've poached today.
Got it.
Advancing the guide sheath and moving south.
If there are options in treatment,
we should present them together to the patient
so they can hear the risks and benefits of both procedures.
I'm sorry.
I thought you'd appreciate
having two fewer procedures to do today.
Bullets in the femoral vein.
You can have your patient back now.
What?
You can take him to the OR for a cut-down.
It's nice to finally meet you, Dr. Corday.
I look forward to working together again soon.
Good night.
DOUG: Hey, Dr. Pratt.
Hey. Hey, I just wanted to thank you.
You saved my life.
Not really.
I came in here a few hours ago with a broken back,
and now I'm going home.
Well, you still have a compression fracture
of your vertebrae.
Yeah, I know, but I'm not paralyzed.
Thank you.
You're the best.
Mom, can you hear me?
Mom, wake up.
Mom.
Hey, little man.
What's happening?
My mom won't wake up.
It's all my fault.
No, it's not.
The doctors just gave her something
so she could sleep.
( sighs )
I couldn't protect her.
That's not your job.
Yes, it is.
She doesn't have anybody else to do it.
Well, it says here you do a great job
of taking care of your mom.
Then why is she in the hospital?
You know, sometimes things happen
that we have no control of.
Bad things, even when we do our best.
But
I think your mom's lucky to have somebody like you
looking out for her.
( people coughing )
TAGGART: Your arm may hurt.
You may feel a little achy.
( speaking French )
But it'll pass.
( speaking French )
If it doesn't, you need to come back
to the hospital.
( Kem speaking French )
Hey, Luka, you busy? No.
You mind helping me examine these patients?
They all may have been exposed to pertussis.
Why not?
You don't mind?
Nope. This at least I'm good at.
Hey, Kem enjoyed your lecture.
Yeah, she's the only one.
I don't think I got through to any of the others.
Maybe it's the accent.
WEAVER: What the hell is this?
KEM: These people may be infected with whooping cough.
Well, then they should be seeing their primary care physician.
From what I've seen,
you are their primary care physician.
Kem. If you don't give these people
the medical care they need,
they won't seek treatment elsewhere,
and you'll have a full-blown epidemic on your hands.
Mm, yeah, I think what Kem's
trying to say... All right, Carter,
she doesn't need you interpreting for her.
She's making herself perfectly clear.
Looks like you've got your work cut out for you.
All right, do it, but do it quickly.
And from now on, no one else is going to Africa.
I'm tired of this Dr. Schweitzer routine.
Did I say something wrong?
Not at all.
18-year-old, Peter Spratt, took a hockey puck to the face.
Looks like a possible mandible fracture,
like he swallowed some teeth and a lot of blood, too.
Okay, I got this.
Uh, he's not moving enough air
and his jaw's too busted up to intubate.
All right, let's get a 7-0 ET tube and Surgilube.
I'm going nasal.
Um... Pratt.
It's okay.
Dr. Kovac showed me how to do it.
Tachy at 112, sats are 92 and dropping.
Apparently somebody's been listening to you.
( coughing continues )
I'm sorry I'm a little late.
No worries.
They're just watching a movie.
Hi, Ella.
Okay, it's time to go.
Put your shoes on.
It's almost over.
How were the puppies?
Uh, messy, but the kids had fun.
You want a piece of birthday cake?
No, I haven't had dinner yet.
Well, in that case, how about a slice of pizza?
I'll even throw in a glass of wine.
All right then.
So, uh, how was your pancake-juju thing?
My what?
Your surgery.
The operation you were doing this morning.
Pancreaticojejunostomy.
You made that up, didn't you? No.
Oh, come on, admit it.
You have the perfect job for getting out of things.
I mean, who's going to argue with a surgeon?
"Yeah, I'm really sorry.
"I'd love to help you move this weekend,
"but I have to separate a pair of Guatemalan twins
who are joined at the testes."
( chuckles ): Actually, a pancreaticojejunostomy
is a replumbing of the upper GI tract.
Sounds painful.
Can you get that from working out,
'cause my shoulder's been killing me.
I believe that's called old age.
Ouch.
After I go to all the trouble of making you this nice dinner?
Cheers.
Cheers.
Happy birthday.
GALLANT: Hey, Rudy.
How you doing, man?
You hungry?
I went and picked us up
some burgers and some French fries
because I am starving.
I also got you this.
Go ahead. Take it.
So you don't ever have to worry
about the lights going out.
Busy.
No kidding.
How was your day?
Sucked. Yours?
Same.
About this morning...
Oh, forget it.
No, I know sometimes I can be overzealous--
is that... is that the word?
I don't know. Is that Croatian for "jerk"?
I'm sorry.
I didn't want to take my frustrations out on you.
You know, sometimes I just feel very passionate...
KEM: John!
Want a bite?
No. What are you doing?
I thought we were going to Ike Ryan's for dinner.
Oh, no, we are, but I was just famished.
I needed something to hold me over.
All this?!
( laughs ): I couldn't decide.
There was too much to choose from.
I got Twinkies and Ho Hos.
This is all crap. MoonPies.
This is all junk food.
I know, but it tastes so good.
I must be getting cravings.
All I can think about is chocolate and sex.
God, I am so happy.
Are you happy?
Yeah.
Thanks for letting me come to the hospital today.
I love to watch you work.
You're such a stud!
Oh, stop it.
It's true.
It was all I could do to keep my hands off you.
That's it-- no more sugar for you.
Can I come tomorrow?
Uh, no.
Why not?
'Cause Dr. Weaver said she'd fire me if you did.
She didn't.
Actually, she did, yeah.
I should talk to her.
No, please, don't. No, no, no.
What? Did I do something wrong?
Did I get in the way?
Did I ask too many questions?
I asked too many questions.
Did I ask too many questions?
How many of those chocolate bars did you eat?
CARTER: Après-vous.
KEM: Merci.
