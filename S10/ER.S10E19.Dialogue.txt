Previously on ER:
You're a doctor?
Yeah.
Yes, I am.
Mike, I'm leaving that stripper in Curtain Four
with the broken toe just for you.
Try not to TUBE her.
What are you talking about?
Totally Unnecessary Breast Exam.
It's Sandy.
Sandy Lopez died today.
What am I supposed to do now?
Give me back my son!
Mom, guess what?
Dad's here.
I don't like working on old people
or children or drunks.
NEELA: Go to bloody Iraq and tell yourself
you've done something noble.
( guitar plays simple chords )
Hey.
Hey, Mom. Mom, Mom, Mom.
Look at this.
( playing simple chords )
Hey, that's pretty good.
Dad's been teaching me to play.
Says we might get my own guitar today.
Oh, really?
Hey, Alex, you want scrambled eggs?
Sure.
You could have told me you needed groceries.
I would have gone.
You all right? Yeah.
Yeah? Mm-hmm.
Listen, take this, okay?
What's this?
That's, you know, grocery money,
rent money, guilt money.
That's not much guilt.
Look, there's more where this came from.
I've got a few jobs lined up and... Uh-huh.
Look, I'm sure there's something you and Alex need,
so I'm just going to leave this here, okay?
What, like a guitar?
Yeah, why not?
It's good for a kid to learn an instrument.
I mean, music, you know, it stimulates the brain.
Yeah, prove it.
Well, it helps score the hot chicks,
that's for sure.
Hey, Dad, teach me something else.
All right, buddy. Here, let me see.
This one's a little trickier, but it's very cool.
You're going to like it.
I've had, uh, pretty good luck
with this one with the ladies.
( chuckles )
WOMAN: Let go of me, you dirty freak!
Calm down. Calm down. No!
You want Haldol?
Yeah, that and a hammer.
Need any help, Morris?
No, this is going great.
Stop touching me!
Okay, try and relax, Mrs. Garrison.
You know her?
Yeah. She's off her meds. Oh, you think?
What do you want, five or ten of Haldol?
Ten. Five.
( strained cries )
All right, this is going
to sting a little, Mrs. Garrison, okay?
You want hard restraints? No!
Nope.
Soft restraints? No. No restraints.
She'll be fine. ( screams )
( screams in pain )
MALIK: Whoa!
Guess you should have put her in restraints.
( screams in pain )

Their argument is that Sandy was his biological mother,
and you never legally adopted him.
We were in the process.
And that will help.
Perhaps if the child's genetic father
was willing to assign you his rights.
He was an anonymous donor.
We will establish parental intent.
And I'm confident we can secure
some sort of temporary custody.
Temporary? Henry is my son.
Look, the good news is, the state has adopted
a sexual-orientation neutral approach
to child custody determinations.
But there are other factors at play here.
Like what?
Well, in addition to being gay, you're single,
and your work requires
a great deal of time away from Henry.
Now the Lopezes present a blood relationship
with a loving, intact family unit,
and a stay-at-home mom.
I'll change my schedule.
Hell, I'll quit my job if I have to.
What happened to you?
Got bitten by a patient.
What are you doing here?
Working.
You should have a nurse look at that.
It's okay.
Sam, wash out Dr. Kovac's bite, update his tetanus,
and check for hepatitis and HIV on the source.
Sure. I'll call you.
I'll let you know how it goes.
There's another difference
between Sandy's family and me: money.
And I'll use everything I have to get my son back.
Make sure they know that.
I'll make them aware of that.
What are you doing?
Icing my 'nads.
Excuse me?
One of the patients grabbed my junk.
So Alex must be excited.
What?
Today is first day of spring break, right?
Oh, yeah, right.
So you guys want to do something after work?
He's has been talking about this rock and roll bowling alley
with glow-in-the-dark balls and lasers.
Uh, we can't.
Not tonight.
Alex's father is in town.
He just showed up.
Oh.
Yeah, he does this every now and then.
Usually without warning.
Kinda like a tornado.
I wish he'd just stay away for good.
Oh, well, he's the boy's father.
Barely.
He only sticks around long enough
to run up my phone bill and drink all my beer.
He's staying with you?
( door opens )
Somebody call for a psych consult?
You on psych now?
Yep. But don't worry.
I'm keeping an extra ID in my pocket
just in case someone mistakes me for a patient.
That was a joke.
( chuckles nervously )
She's in the Suture Room.
MORRIS: Give me the chart.
It's my patient. Have you done an H&P?
I pulled the chart. Have you done an H&P?
What the hell are you two doing now?
He's trying to steal my patient.
What? I'm trying to help you.
Who are we talking about?
Back pain in Two.
I'll settle this.
You three should be ashamed of yourselves.
Well, here's a beauty for you:
Blue and puking in One.
Blue?
( coughing, retching )
LOCKHART: Okay, Mrs. Garrison.
We're going to take you upstairs
and get you some lunch.
I'm really not hungry,
although I wouldn't mind a nice glass of merlot.
See what I can do.
I'll try to get her admitted for a few days.
She'll be fine once she gets back on her meds.
How's the psych rotation?
It's kinda scary.
The patients?
No, me. I like it.
How about you, everything good?
Sam's ex-boyfriend's back in town.
CARTER: Hey, Abby.
Can you take Mr. Chen here upstairs?
Not unless you want him admitted to psych.
Oh, don't tempt me.
Fall to an outstretched hand.
It's nothing serious.
Except it's his right arm
and now he won't be able to do anything,
not that he would.
I've already been through four home care workers.
I can help you out.
I can't get any more nursing shifts,
I really need the money
or I'm going to have to drop out of school again.
Abby, you don't want any of this.
( speaks Chinese )
( speaks Chinese )
( both arguing in Chinese )
Coffee?
Yeah, good idea.
So...
So...
How's Kem?
She must be getting big.
Very.
You should see Susan.
How's she doing?
Well, you know how some mothers
talk to their unborn children? Mm-hmm.
Susan threatened to pull hers out
with her bare hands if it didn't hurry up.
You been doing anything differently,
exercising, sports? No.
Any heavy lifting?
You help a friend move, anything like that? No.
Slip or fall recently?
Nothing.
( giggles softly )
Sorry, I'm just checking your lymph nodes.
I'm ticklish.
I'll make a note of that.
You ever have a mammogram? No.
You do self breast exams? Sometimes.
Hey, Sam, can you give me a hand.
I need to perform a breast exam on Miss Campbell.
Sure. You do?
It's just routine.
Now you really should do this every month.
You have to get to know your breasts.
You can't rely on friends.
Right after your period is the best time.
Blood bank's on line six for you, Sam.
Thanks.
All right, first you look at yourself in the mirror
This is Taggart. for any changes in shape...
Yeah, I drew blood on Mendoza.
...dimpling, puckering of the skin or nipple changes.
You lift up your arm, and you do it again.
I signed all of them. My initials are "S.T."
Then you gently squeeze the nipple
to check for discharge.
Okay.
Now you start by circling the nipple Okay.
moving out in large and larger circles...
Okay, it's been a little busy down here.
...feeling for any lumps or bumps along the way
until you reach the outer edge.
This guy needs two units type and crossed right now.
Be sure to feel all the breast tissue.
He's vomiting blood.
Just beneath the skin with a soft touch
and down to the rib cage with a firmer touch.
From the collarbone to the top of the abdomen, Yeah.
and from the armpit to the midline.
Do you want me to come down there?
I don't appreciate any masses.
That's good, right?
That's perfect.
You can sit up.
Forget it.
Jut send two units O-neg.
You should also do this in the shower.
Skin's a lot more slippery when it's wet,
and sometimes it helps.
(man screaming): Oh, make it stop!
Oh, please, give me something!
Connor, James, 28, passenger in an MVA.
Other car T-boned into them pretty good on his side.
Give me something!
KOVAC: Vitals?
He's been thrashing too much for us to get a B.P.
No LOC. He was walking and swearing on the scene.
Three centimeter temporal lac with some glass.
My arm is killing me, man!
Come on! Driver's right behind us.
She got the worst of it.
Where's Pratt? Right here.
Okay, this guy's yours.
Neela, come with me.
( man continues screaming )
Seat belt and harness airbag didn't deploy.
Where do you hurt, ma'am?
All over.
What happened, man?
(panting): We were just driving.
Some guy blindsided us.
Oh, God! Oh, God!
Save my arm! Save my arm!
You're not going to lose your arm, sir.
She your girlfriend?
Naw, man, I just met her last night.
She was driving me home
from her place.
( crying ): I should have taken a cab.
Big closed deformity on the right elbow.
( yells ) He's dislocated.
No radial pulse.
A hundred of Brevital. Brevital?
Yeah, and a hundred of fent.
All right, man, just hang in there, okay?
We're going to fix this up real quick.
( whimpers ): Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
What do we want, Neela?
Full trauma panel, a set of hemocues, and X rays.
You want me to guess which ones?
Chest, c-spine and pelvis. Thank you.
I think I'm gonna be sick. KOVAC: On the monitor.
MALIK: Get suction.
NEELA: Periumbilical ecchymosis.
Pretty tender in the upper right.
Systolic's 90. First hemocue is 11.
My head feels funny. Okay, get another line.
MALIK: Already done with a liter on board.
( man yelling in other room )
Is Dr. Pratt working?
Okay, two units of O-neg
on the rapid infuser.
Can you get him?
MALIK: Still tachy at 118.
NEELA: She's going to crash.
Have a seven and a half ready,
and I need the ultrasound. I'll get it.
Somebody call surgery again.
( hysterical whining )
Brevital is in.
It's not helping!
It's not...!
Thank, God.
All right, we got about 20 seconds.
Pull.
Dr. Pratt, this patient's asking for you.
For me? ( groans )
He's waking up.
Almost got it.
( Pratt grunts )
( groans, whines )
What happened?
We fixed your elbow.
Holy crap, you're good.
You can pick up your Dr. Greg Pratt
Fan Club ring at the door.
MALIK: Barely holding at 100 systolic.
Blood's running.
Hypoechoic in Morrison's...
How are we doing in here?
Greg, is that you?
Yeah.
RASGOTRA: Foley is on. Blood on the dip.
What's the name on the chart?
Rena Carlson.
We hooked up last year.
We met on the El, remember?
Oh, yeah, right.
KOVAC: Okay, make sure
the blood bank gets a clot.
Let's drop an NG tube and pack her up.
Rena, you injured your spleen,
and you're going to require surgery to repair it.
Oh, God. I'm all messed up.
PRATT: No, you're going to be okay.
We're going to take very good care of you.
( sighs )
Abby.
Hi.
I, uh, see Mrs. Garrison is back.
Yeah, she bit one of the attendings in the ER.
Well, better them than one of us.
Mr. Rosenblum was asking for you.
Oh, great.
You should take it as a compliment.
It took me two years before the Duke
would even talk to me.
Maybe it's your nursing background.
It's probably a combination of nursing and genetics.
My family's pretty high maintenance.
You can lead the group today.
By myself?
No better time than the present.
Okay.
Hi.
Hi. I'm Abby Lockhart.
I'm a medical student,
and I'm going to be running the group today.
Ow!
The elbow's good.
Sutures will come out in a week.
But the ortho clinic will want to get some more X rays
and start you on P.T.
So, does that mean I can go?
Yeah, but you're not going to stick around for her?
Like I said, man, I just met her.
You spent the night together, right?
That don't make us married.
What's her status?
Stable after four units
of packed cells and some fluid.
Corday's waiting for her upstairs.
I have to have an operation.
Don't worry.
Dr. Corday's an excellent surgeon.
Will you come see me after?
Sure.
Friend? Not really.
Could you, uh, just let me know how she does?
Okay. Thanks.
Labs and films on Campbell.
And Sussman is starting
to get some short-term memory back.
Thanks.
Neela?
Neuro checks on Mr. Sussman q hour.
I can't. I'm working at the lab at 4:00.
Doing what?
Stroke physiology research.
You're going to the mouse house?
It's an elective.
I'm doing a lousy job down here.
Everyone seems to think
I'm better suited for the lab.
Yeah, well, God forbid you disappoint them.
Hello.
I'm sorry this has taken so long.
So, what's going on with you, Denise?
I've just... I've been feeling pretty cruddy,
like, um, sick to my stomach and headaches.
At first I thought it was just the flu
un-until I started losing the feeling
in my hands and my feet.
So, you're not here because of your skin?
No. That's-That's from the amiodarone.
I have a ventricular arrhythmia.
It's pretty sad, huh?
You know what the guys at school call me?
Smurf.
Everything looks good.
No fractures, no arthritis, no bony lesions.
I'm thinking it's probably just muscle strain.
But I told you I didn't do anything.
Maybe you didn't realize it at the time.
It may not have been a sudden strain.
You could have slept funny or been sitting too long.
That's it?
Yeah. It should get better with time.
Try a warm bath and some ibuprofen.
Come back and see me if it gets any worse,
or you start to feel numbness
our weakness in your legs.
BARDELLI: Yo, doc!
Excuse me.
29-year-old woman
with syncopal episode.
Housekeeper heard a crash, found her down in the kitchen.
She on any meds? Nothing we could find.
Neela!
Ma'am, can you hear me?
Ma'am?
Excuse me.
Could I speak with someone in charge?
What do you need, ma'am?
Would it be possible to speak
with Dr. Pratt's supervisor?
Uh... yeah, okay.
What are you doing here?
Where's Alex?
I thought I'd take you to lunch.
Where's Alex?
He's showing one of the doctors his guitar.
( strumming )
What, was this a bad idea?
I can't just leave for lunch.
Well, I asked Alex.
He said it would be all right.
He's ten.
ALEX: Hey, Mom, look.
He did it. Dad said
he would buy me a guitar, and he did.
So I see.
Uh, th-this is my dad.
Hi.
Hi.
ALEX: Isn't it cool?
Do you know how to play, Luka?
Uh, no.
Well, my dad's in a band.
Luka, your little old lady stopped breathing again.
Oh, um, it was nice meeting you.
You, too.
Some old gal stopped breathing?
That can't be good. People die in here all the time.
It's no big deal.
( laughs )
He already sounds like a doctor.
It's great.
You going to play something for me, buddy?
This lady fainted and is altered.
What are we looking for?
Normal sinus. She's not having an MI.
Think about the differential.
No ectopy, QT interval is not prolonged.
QRS duration is point one zero.
Normal.
Pupils equal and reactive.
What's the common final pathway in syncope?
Low blood pressure. I don't hear a murmur.
No. It's the lack of vital nutrient delivery
to the brain stem reticular activating system.
Which is usually caused by low blood pressure.
Or hypoxia, or hypoglycemia.
Abdomen is soft and nontender.
So, what are we ordering, kids?
CBC, lytes, head CT.
And a urine tox screen.
And call a family member to verify
she's not on any meds.
What medications cause
orthostatic hypotension?
Antihypertensives.
Beta blockers, dig, diuretics,
phenothiazines, nitrates,
antidysrhythmics, antidepressants,
alcohol and cocaine.
You know, we don't have to do this
if you've got something better to do.
No. I've got the papers right here.
I'm just going to be stuck at the hospital
for another couple hours.
Is there any way that
you could have a notary, uh, come here?
( door opening )
Oh, that'd be great. Thank you.
Carter, I'm so sorry I stranded you here.
They're going to admit him,
so I can drive you home now.
( chuckles ): I just arranged
for somebody to come over here
with some papers for me to sign.
Plus, I got to be at work in a couple hours.
I think I'm just going to stay.
Okay, I just ruined your whole day, didn't I?
No. Don't worry about it.
You can buy me lunch.
You know what you can do?
You can help me pick out nursery colors.
Hey, what do you think? Circus--
colorful, fun, developmentally stimulating.
Oh.
Aquatic-- soothing, yet educational.
Sort of for the young scientist.
Or, jungle--
environmentally positive,
a celebration of his African heritage.
If you had a baby, which would...?
I like the jungle.
I'm sorry.
I wasn't even thinking.
Yeah, Carter, no, it's okay.
Don't worry about it.
I mean, you know, sometimes I forget about him myself.
Actually, I think that's when I feel the worst--
when I realize that I haven't thought
about him in, like, a week or so.
You know,
ever since my, um, mom died
and my dad got sick, I, uh...
I've been thinking about him a lot.
You know, when my dad goes,
I'm not going to have anyone else.
No aunts, cousins.
Nothing.
Have you ever gone to see him?
Maybe you should.
Maybe I should have kept him.
I mean, he is three years old now.
( laughs )
( laughs )
The nightmares have stopped.
But I feel like killing myself.
MAN: Oh, so what else is new?
I smell something.
I can't smell anything.
I developed anosmia after my accident.
Nobody accidentally
puts their head in a paint mixer.
Well, let-let's let Larry finish.
MAN: Why? It's the same damn thing
every week.
I want to kill myself. Blah, blah,
blah, blah...
He needs new material. You need a soul.
Please stop fighting.
PujwI' Hivlu'chugh quvbe'lu'
What's-What's he saying?
No one here speaks Klingon.
MAN: It's rather odd, don't you think?
Yeah. No. Uh, no.
I think we should just take a minute.
Where did you go to school?
What?
I'm going back to school.
I want to be a lawyer.
Last week he wanted to be a lion tamer.
At least he has goals beyond
how many women he can screw.
Ooh, you jealous?
Hey. Okay, okay.
You're a pig.
Oink.
Stanley, if you continue
to disrupt the group,
I'm going to have to-to ask you to-to leave.
Oh, that's a good idea. Oh, that's
a good idea. That's what you should do.
Can't we all just get along? Yes.
Is it just me, or are we a pretty kooky bunch?
Okay, that word is... I smell gas.
Sit down, sit down. Roger, sit down.
When I become a lawyer, I'm going to sue this hospital.
You can't sit on a jury
if you have multiple personality disorder.
Does anyone else smell gas?
It's coming from Larry.
Why don't you shut up?
Next time you cut yourself,
start with your tongue.
Oh, leave her alone.
You have nothing... Do us a favor and slit your wrists.
You have nothing inside you. You make everybody sick.
( both talking at once ) Hey!
No.
( speaking Klingon )
You can't smoke that in here.
It's against the law.
So is suicide.
You've got an addiction.
Well, I'm trying to quit.
I'm allergic to smoke.
It only takes 11 seconds
for nicotine to reach your brain.
There are 50 different kinds
of carcinogens in cigarettes.
You better put that out before somebody catches you.
Stanley, what about you?
Do you have a problem with this?
My mother died of lung cancer.
It's a nasty habit.
Well, now that we've all agreed on something,
let's talk about personal goals.
CAMPBELL: I don't want to make a big deal out of this.
He just made me feel pretty uncomfortable.
How so?
He did a breast exam, and, I don't know,
he seemed to enjoy it.
Was there a nurse present?
Yes. Um,
it was her.
Did you voice your concerns
to Dr. Pratt?
No. I guess I was caught off guard.
Well, I can assure you
he's a very professional physician.
However, if you want to file a formal complaint...
Oh, no. No.
I-I don't want to make a big deal out of this.
I just felt
I should tell someone.
Maybe they could speak with him.
I'll speak to him.
Thank you.
Where's Pratt?
With a patient.
What do you need?
I need Pratt. Hey, Sam, hold up.
Where are you going?
I'm going to grab a quick bite
with Alex and his dad.
Did you assist Dr. Pratt in examining Campbell,
the woman in Curtain Two?
Yeah.
Was there anything unusual about the exam?
I don't think so. Why?
He gave her a breast exam for back pain.
I don't know what her chief complaint was.
I was on the phone with the blood bank
and juggling five other patients.
Sounds like
he TUBE'd her.
She wasn't intubated, Morris.
No, no. You know a TUBE.
T-U-B-E.
Totally unnecessary breast exam.
You're such an ass.
What was that?
Sorry.
No, not you.
Where did you hear that term?
I... I don't know.
I didn't make it up.
Well, who did?
What-What happened?
Where's my daughter?
Your daughter's with your neighbor.
My name is Dr. Pratt.
You fainted at home, but all your tests look good.
We checked your heart, your lungs,
and your brain.
You're not anemic or dehydrated,
and all your electrolytes are normal.
I feel fine.
Are you taking any medications? No.
Could be anything over-the-counter--
diet pills, cold medicine?
Nothing.
You ever have any heart problems?
Palpitations, shortness of breath?
I'm healthy.
Anyone in your family ever have seizures?
I did when I was a kid, but I grew out of them.
How long ago was your last one?
I don't know.
Years and years.
I was on phenobarb until,
like, fifth grade.
They said I had epilepsy.
But when I stopped the medicine,
they went away.
I never had another one.
That was almost 20 years ago.
WEAVER: Dr. Pratt, can I see you
for a second?
Yup. Just give me a minute.
Can I go home?
I need you now.
All right.
I'll be right back. Okay. I have
a baby at home.
I just need to run a few more tests, okay?
Here.
What's up?
Did you treat this patient?
Yeah. Why?
She basically accused you
of sexual harassment.
What?
Did you "TUBE" her, Pratt?
What?
Well, that's what you call it, isn't it?
When you want to feel up a good-looking patient.
If she hires a lawyer, you could be charged with sexual harassment.
If I'd found a lesion, I would've saved her life.
But you didn't. So I'm being punished because she's not sick?
It's not about her condition. It's about your behavior.
There was nothing wrong with my behavior.
She had tenderness over the fourth and fifth lumbar vertebrae--
bony tenderness-- and none over the paraspinous muscles.
I also felt a one centimeter lymph node in the axilla.
Are you saying you weren't the least bit attracted to her?
Oh, come on, bone pain and axillary lymphadenopathy
in a woman who's never had a mammogram.
You know damn well you'd have done the same thing.
It's not about what you did. It's about how you did it.
I did it with a nurse present,
per hospital policy. The patient felt you were enjoying yourself.
Oh, come on, please, would you give me a break?
Have you ever gotten turned on giving a breast exam?
I bet you don't even have a nurse in the room with you while you do it.
I'm a woman. Who sleeps with other women.
I've never TUBE'd a patient.
Yeah, well, neither have I.
You coined the phrase. No, I did not.
That phrase has been around since I was a student.
You've been overheard using it on more than one occasion.
So what? It doesn't mean that I've done it.
And if she was so uncomfortable with what I was doing,
how come she didn't say something?
Maybe she was intimidated by you.
Oh, right, scared that the big black doctor
was going to bend her over the bed... Oh, don't you dare
turn this into a race issue. Oh, no, no, no.
When you're black, it's always a race issue. I'm not going to let you
hide behind that. I'm not hiding behind anything.
Dr. Weaver, call for you. Take a message.
It's your lawyer, line four.
Don't go anywhere.
Where's Sam?
I think she's with her son.
Hey, Dr. Pratt.
Neela's patient collapsed.
She was coming back from the restroom.
Ma'am, can you hear me?
All right, somebody find Neela!
Let's get her up on the gurney, okay?
Ready? One, two...
Malik, monitors.
MALIK: Positive sternotomy sign.
What happened? She's in v-tach.
She has a ventricular arrhythmia.
She's on amiodarone. Tetrology of Fallot, repaired in 1975.
Why's she in today?
Flu symptoms. What's her labs show?
They haven't come back yet. Need another set of hands?
Did you open your big mouth to Weaver?
MALIK: Can't get a pulse ox. What?
Airway's clear. Start bagging.
Did you tell Weaver I TUBE'd a patient?
RASGOTRA: V-tach, no pulse.
Come on, Denise, stay with us. Charge to 200.
I'm charged. Clear.
MALIK: No change.
Going again. 300. Well, did you?
No!
Somebody did, though.
Clear.
Sinus. RASGOTRA: Good carotid pulse.
100 of lidocaine. What'd you say to her?
Nothing! Uh, that that hot patient was complaining
about you. MALIK: Good breath sounds.
I'll call about her labs. Perhaps the fact
that you two are referring to a patient as "hot" is a clue
to the problem. First of all, I never called her that,
so she's the one with the problem. Oh, really?
Can you even imagine what it was like for her to come here?
She's feeling ill, worried, scared.
Probably waited several hours to be seen,
only to have a stranger fondle her breasts.
Secondary survey.
( coughs )
Good gag. She's waking up.
You're okay, Denise.
Labs? CBC, electrolytes,
calcium, L.F.T.s, creatinine...
Lab reports her amiodarone level less than zero.
She said she sometimes forgets to take it.
She must've stopped taking it
a few weeks ago to have a level of zero.
She give any indication why she would do something like that?
Maybe because men are idiots.
ALEX: Can I play pinball?
Sure. Uh, finish your lunch first.
I'm full.
You barely touched your hamburger.
I don't want to get mad cow disease.
Then finish your fries.
God, he's grown a foot
since I've seen him last.
It's been a year.
You've done a great job, Sam.
He's a cool kid.
Thanks.
I guess I can't take much credit for that.
Anyway, is he, uh, doing good in school?
Yeah...
when he's not being expelled
for performing medical procedures on himself
or dissecting dead squirrels in the schoolyard.
Really?
It's not funny.
He seems to like that, uh, Russian doctor.
Croatian.
You two, uh...?
We've gone out. Nothing serious.
Does he have any friends his own age?
Yeah, he's got some buddies at school.
That's good, considering how much you guys move around, that's good.
Well... you got to go where the work is, right?
Yeah, tell me about it.
That's the good thing about Chicago.
Always building... How long are you planning on staying?
You sick of me already?
It's not about me. It's about Alex.
Well, he seems happy that I'm back.
That's the problem.
The longer you stay, the harder
it's going to be on him when you leave.
Well, maybe I won't leave this time.
KOVAC: What's going on
with Hollis in Two? Cardiology was supposed to come get him an hour ago.
Call them again.
What about Dunn in Exam Three?
Some sort of recurrent seizure disorder.
I'm waiting on an E.E.G.
They can do that upstairs after she's admitted.
We need to free up some beds.
Medicine won't take her. Why not Neurology?
They don't think she had a seizure.
Was there, uh, witnessed tonic-clonic activity?
Not really. Did she bite her tongue?
No. Was there urinary incontinence?
I don't think so.
Then she didn't have a seizure.
Discharge her, and she can have an outpatient E.E.G.
If she passes out again, she could hurt herself.
So send in a D.M.V. card.
There's also a baby at home who could get hurt.
Look, she had a syncopal episode,
and I'm going to rule her out for M.I., so while we wait
for the six hour troponin, might as well throw on an E.E.G.
Dr. Pratt, Denise's parents are coming in to talk to her,
and I spoke with her cardiologist.
He's going to switch to sotolol,
which should help with her skin. Hey, Neela?
When's your, uh,
research rotation start?
15 minutes.
Good luck.
Thank you, Dr. Kovac.
Hey, let me ask you a question. Yeah.
When you do a breast exam on an attractive woman,
it's awkward, right?
For you and the patient. Right.
Yeah, see, I'm just as nervous and uncomfortable as they are.
I don't know-- maybe it comes across as something else.
What do you mean?
How do you do it so that they don't think
that you're enjoying yourself?
Well, it's a... it's a medical procedure.
It's, uh, no different than looking for rebound or guarding.
MORRIS: I pretend it's my mom.
Yeah, it's a little trick I picked up
from my OB/GYN attending.
It works... I mean, unless your mom's hot, too.
You're a freak.
Every workstation has its own microfuge.
We share the ultracentrifuge.
Cold room for tissue culture media,
bacterial plates, DNA ligations.
Arun and Angelie are looking at expression
of heat-shock proteins in glial cells.
This is Neela.
Hi. Is that an electron microscope?
Yeah. E.M.'s kind of old school
for showing apoptosis in neurons,
but, you know, looks sexy on the page,
so Lundgren still likes it.
Lundgren? Dr. Lundgren,
the guy whose huge R-0-1 grant is funding your butt.
I'm not getting paid. It's rotational.
I'm a fourth year med student.
I'm an eighth year, PhD program.
Eight years? God.
Yeah, we don't get credit around here for wiping snotty noses.
I've actually got to discover something new
in neuroscience in order to get my degree.
Takes a while.
I'm supposed to be helping with some kind of stroke study?
Okay. Well, everyone here is researching some aspect
of brain hypoperfusion and tissue injury.
You're going to be with Yuri and me.
We're looking at the effects of ketamine
on cerebral ischemia and tissue damage in mice.
Yuri, Neela. Neela, Yuri. Hey.
No one said anything about working with animals.
Is that a problem?
All the tests look good,
but we'd like to figure out why she had a seizure.
Yeah, I-I thought that was something
she outgrew as a kid.
May be totally unrelated.
Here we go.
What's all of that?
We're doing an E.E.G. to monitor her electrical brain activity.
It takes several hours, some of which is done
while sleeping.
Can I stay with her?
Sure, just try not to wake her up.
We're more likely to pick up the seizures when she's asleep.
Thank you.
You hear that: we got to let your mama sleep, okay?
Hey. You know...
when I ask you to assist me on an exam of a female patient,
it's so that I don't get accused of things I didn't do.
Ooh, don't blame me for this.
You were right there. I didn't do anything.
I did everything I could to put that patient at ease.
Guess it didn't work.
I was trying to be friendly.
One man's friendly is another woman's creepy.
You're a flirt, Pratt-- you can't help yourself.
I wasn't flirting. I was breaking the ice.
It's a breast exam, not a cocktail party.
You don't have to break the ice.
Nice package, by the way.
What?
Your package. Amira and I were noticing earlier.
Must be those pants.
Okay, I see what you're trying to do, and you're way off, okay?
I didn't say anything even remotely inappropriate to that woman.
But it was going through your head. No, it wasn't.
You weren't thinking about what a great rack she had
when you were examining her? Hell, no,
and even if I was, which I wasn't, so what?
She can't read my mind. Of course she can.
We all can-- it's not that difficult, believe me.
You're a guy.
Men only think about three things: food, sports and sex.
Dogs are more mysterious.
If they ever invent a refrigerator
with a wide screen TV and a vagina, we're all doomed.
Yeah, okay.
You think I'm kidding, but I'm not.
When you check us out,
you might as well be asking us to show you our tits,
because that's what it feels like,
and believe me, it's not a nice feeling.
I didn't check her out.
Dr. Pratt, your patient's seizing again.
All right, find Kovac.
Jordan? Push two of Ativan!
I knew it. MALIK: Pulse ox 97.
Up the nasal oxygen to five liters.
What's happening to her?!
Malik, another two of Ativan, and mix up dilantin.
She's going to be okay.
Just give the medicine a chance to work.
How long has she been seizing?
Less than a minute. I just stepped out for a second.
NICK: It's okay... it's okay, Jordan.
It's okay... you're okay...
Caught the seizure on the E.E.G.
Is this just going to keep happening?
She'll need to go on the anticonvulsant medication, but after that,
everything should be fine. KOVAC: See any spikes?
Not yet.
Can she hear me?
Sure. You can talk to her,
but she's not going to be awake for a while.
Hey, sweetie... it's me.
I'm here with Caroline.
Everything's going to be okay.
You're doing good.
Dr. Pratt?
I'll be right back.
She's going to be fine.
Looks like Neurology can't refuse to admit her now.
That wasn't a real seizure.
What are you talking about?
The E.E.G. doesn't lie.
No focal spikes, no sharp waves, and no spike-wave complexes.
She was faking it?
She had a pseudo-seizure.
Call Psychiatry.
Legh Sott wa'leS.
Ghaj a QaQ ram, Hawthorne.
( growls )
I learned a little Klingon.
That's good.
And we had to get rid of our Klingon translator
in the most recent round of budget cuts.
( chuckles )
You're serious.
My buddy's hospital in Seattle
had to hire someone who speaks Elven-- full time.
Thank you, Mr. Tolkien.
So that was an interesting approach today.
Yeah, um... I'm sorry...
Look, I know it's cruel throwing students into a group like that,
but it is a good indicator of who has what skills.
I-I was kind of freaked out.
I've never seen them respond to a student
the way they did to you.
Of course, they've never seen
anyone show as much disregard
for hospital policy.
I think you scared them.
You kinda scared me.
( beeping )
I'm being paged to the ER.
Yeah, we could try hypnosis.
On who?
You. Might help you quit smoking.
Mmm. I'll get back to you on that.
PRATT: I told her to look for any changes
in the shape or size of the breast
and I felt for any lumps.
I told her to watch out for dimpling and puckering of the skin.
This is stupid. Continue.
( sighs )
Told her to check for discharge.
then to gently squeeze the n...
Jerry.
I can't help it.
My nipples are sensitive.
What?
Your lawyer, Mr. Brooks, is here.
Excuse me.
So, are we done here?
No. I want you to prepare a lecture for the med students
on gender sensitivity in the physical examination.
Abby's down from psych for your patient.
Pardon me.
Yeah.
Do you mind?
Bored yet?
Actually, I find it extremely interesting.
I prefer working with empirical data over patients.
Not a people person?
Not when they're sick.
Watch it! ( groans )
Sorry...
You contaminated my eliza!
You shouldn't have coffee in the lab.
I always have coffee in the lab.
You just ruined my sample.
Do you have to rerun it?
Can't. Don't have any serum left.
You just set us back six weeks.
PRATT: I don't know, maybe she's faking it.
Well, she's not faking if it's a conversion reaction.
There was nothing on the EEG.
Yeah, but that doesn't mean her symptoms are under voluntary control.
I mean, whatever's happening to her is on a subconscious level,
maybe due to some sublimated emotional trauma.
Would you listen to Miss Freud over here.
Okay, okay, so what are we talking about, postpartum depression?
Maybe. In some women, it can turn into full- blown psychosis.
Hey, where are you going, Mrs. Dunn?
Home.
Mrs. Dunn, hi, I'm Abby Lockhart from Psychiatry...
I already told him.
I don't need a shrink.
I have to go.
My husband's waiting for me in the car.
Jordan, if you don't stay,
we can't help you.
That was my easiest consult all day.
( chuckles )
Remember to get your prescription filled, Mrs. Epstein.
Hey.
I got these back today.
( laughing )
Oh, my God. Look at you guys.
Yeah, you can keep those.
I got double prints.
Thanks.
Good night.
Luka.
I didn't know he was coming.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Hey, how did Rena Carlson make out?
MVA, came up for an exlap.
Mm, she had a lot of clot in the belly.
We had to take out the spleen, I'm afraid.
What about the liver?
Good. Mesenteric arteries are fine.
Kidneys, too.
She's a lucky girl.
She should be awake by now.
I think she's in ten.
Thanks.
You working banker's hours now?
Hardly. I only stepped out of surgery once today
and that was to pee.
I'm sorry to hear that--
for you and your bladder.
Are you up for some dinner?
Tonight? I can't.
You can't eat?
Not with you.
Oh, really?
What's wrong?
Who's that, a patient?
Um, it's difficult to talk about.
Sounds serious.
Could be, I still have some tests to run.
Is there anything I can do to help?
No, no, nothing. I think I'd better go.
Hey.
Oh, what are you doing here?
I thought I'd surprise you.
Well, you certainly did.
Hey.
Dr. Jeremy Lawson, um, Mr. David Spencer.
Mr. Spencer.
How's it going?
It's going very well, thank you.
Have a good evening, Dr. Corday.
It was nice meeting you.
What's with the James Bond routine?
He's English.
Oh, that's nice--
a little taste of home.
Mmm.
Dr. Weaver, I'm sorry to bother you about this,
but if I don't get more nursing shifts,
I'm not going to be able to pay for my spring tuition.
Are you okay?
Kerry, why don't you take some time off?
You need to give yourself some time to grieve.
I don't have that luxury.
I lost my wife, and now I'm fighting to keep my son.
I'm sorry.
I've been begging and arguing with lawyers all day
just to get Henry for the weekend.
They're "granting" me two days with my son.
Well, if there's anything I can do...
Thank you, and, uh...
don't worry about your tuition--
it's been paid.
What?
Yeah, the registrar said it's been paid through graduation.
You need to sign this.
What is it?
Uh, it's a visitation agreement.
Basically, it says you'll return Henry to the Lopezes
by Monday at noon.
Hey, baby.
Hi!
Hello, baby!
There you are.
How are you, huh?
He's been a little fussy.
Maybe he's teething.
Yeah, I don't think so. It's too early, isn't it?
You don't have any teeth, do you?
You just miss your mommy.
That's my baby.
Not all of us think the way my parents do.
They're pretty old-fashioned.
I know Sandy would be really pissed
if she knew what was happening.
She'd be cursing up a storm.
I know she'd want you and Henry to be together.
I hope it works out for the two of you, that's all.
Thank you.
Thank you.
That's my boy.
That's my beautiful baby.
What?
What are you doing?
Waiting for an ambulance.
Carter... What?
I'm not taking your money.
What are you talking about?
You know what I'm talking about,
and I'm not one of your charities.
Oh, I was hoping to count you as one of my friends.
Well, neither a borrower nor a lender be.
Abby, I'm not loaning you the money.
I'm giving it to you.
I want you to think of it as an investment
in the future of medicine.
You'd be better off with tech stocks.
You know, in the time it's taken us to have this little conversation,
I've made your salary for the rest of your life-- in interest.
Wow, when you put it that way,
how about a couple extra grand for a new car?
( motorcycle approaches )
Uh, hey, hey, you can't park there.
This is where we bring the ambulances.
He's with me.
And I will pay you back.
You know, you both should be wearing helmets.
My throat hurts.
It's from being intubated.
I didn't think you'd come.
I said I would.
I think you said you'd call me, too.
Well, this place keeps me pretty busy.
You don't remember me, do you, Greg?
That's okay.
Is there anybody you'd like me to call?
My mom lives in Detroit.
Her last name's Henderson--
Julie Henderson.
I'll write the number down if you've got a pen.
