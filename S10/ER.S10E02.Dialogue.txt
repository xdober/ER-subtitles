Previously on ER:
See? Didn't even hurt.
What should I tell Weaver?
Whatever you want.
Someone has died.
Who?
Someone named Kovac,
a Dr. Luka Kovac.
You're going to go back there?
Why? 'Cause I left him there.
Left him where?
At a clinic in Matenda.
You sober?
I'm sorry?
You look sober.
I make it a rule to always land
in Kinshasa drunk.
It's my third.
Steve Davidson.
John Carter.
Oh. Shell? Xerox?
No?
( chuckles )
You give me a second, I'll figure it out.
I would say,
Coke out of Atlanta. Am I right?
The new bottling plant?
Sorry, no.
Excusez moi.
May I have another Dewar's,
please?
Could I get you something?
No.
Okay, I give up.
Who are you with?
I'm just here on a personal matter.
Oh.
Well, there's not much competition
for the seats, is there?
I guess the "See a Brutal Genocide" tour package
didn't sell very well.
( laughs )
So what about you?
Why are you going to the Congo?
I'm with the Embassy.
Financial Liaison.
Furthering the American investment interest abroad.
Spreading the
Democratic ideals one Big Mac at a time.
Merci.
So, a personal matter, huh?
A friend of mine was murdered. I'm going to go bring him home.
Oh.
I'm sorry to hear that.
DAVIDSON: If you need to see
a familiar face while you're in Kinshasa,
you give me a call.
Thanks.
S'il vous plaît, monsieur?
Vos papiers, s'il vous plaît.
John!
( sobbing )
So, what happened?
We don't know.
What about Patrique?
He's still missing.
Was the Red Cross able to recover Luka's body?
Excuse me.
10,000 people have been killed in the last
two weeks.
There are many bodies in Kivu.
How much longer do we have to wait?
It's the Congo. Could be days.
( sighs ): Oh.
How are you feeling?
Oh. Terrible.
Who are we waiting for? I...
Please. No more talking.
MAN: Gillian?
Bonjour.
Salut. Huh?
Hmm.
Andre, Je te présente John Carter.
C'est un docteur Américain.
Dr. Carter.
Nice to meet you. Yeah.
Please.
Can you tell us what happened?
No, I'm afraid not.
After numerous attempts,
we were able to negotiate a passage
into the Mai Mai-held territory
to evacuate wounded noncombatants.
The Mai Mai provided us with a list of the known dead.
( clears throat )
That's it?
They also provided us
with some personal items
to identify remains.
Can we get the body back?
Are there ways that that can be arranged?
Yeah. I'm sorry.
Um...
When the fighting stops,
we'll make every effort to identify remains.
How long will that take?
I have no idea.
Days? Weeks? Months?
Someone from the negotiating team might know more.
Can we speak with them?
They're in Kisangani.
Debbie?
And Gerard.
Have you tried Bob Chase
from the American Embassy?
He has contacts with the Congolese Army.
He may be able to help you.
Who's Debbie?
She's with the Red Cross field office in Kisangani.
You'd like her.
She's your type.
What's my type?
We shouldn't have left him out there.
He didn't want us to stay.
Should have stayed anyway.
Then you'd be dead, too.
CHARLES: Gillian, we have to go,
or we won't get back before dark.
( whispering ): Go, go, go.
( sniffles )
What should I tell Weaver?
Whatever you want.
Can I tell her you're coming back?
I don't know.
Don't do anything stupid.
Like what?
Like getting yourself killed.
MAN: He wasn't an American citizen?
CARTER: No, but he'd been living and working
in the States for years.
You might have better luck
going to his embassy for help.
It's tough for us to make inquiries
on behalf of citizens of another country.
Does Croatia have an embassy in the Congo?
Croatia?
No.
He was a close friend?
Yeah. We've worked together for years.
( sighs )
The Mai Mai believe
that foreigners are looting the Congo's natural resources.
They see us as the enemy.
It is very dangerous for Westerners.
Um, can some sort of exchange be set up for the dead?
I mean, aren't those things normally done?
These guys don't know
about the Geneva Convention, Doctor.
Most of them don't know about shoes.
Nothing?
He said to be patient.
What?
Excuse me.
Can you tell me, is Mr. Davidson working today?
DAVIDSON: What did Bob Chase tell you?
That we'd have to be patient.
Oh, I'm sure that he knows better than I.
There have to be other channels that we could pursue.
Well, have you tried the UN offices or the Red Cross?
Yeah. We've been bouncing around from office to office all day.
Oh, I'm sure they're trying everything they can.
Look, Dr. Carter,
I am not suggesting this,
but my experience has been
that there's not much in this country
that can't be bought.
Quatre-vingt seize, quatre-vingt dix-sept,
quatre-vingt dix-huit, quatre-vingt dix-neuf.
Vingt mille dollars Américains.
Merci.
What's he saying?
Well, he's just a little concerned
that you're going to walk around Kinshasa
with $20,000 in your pocket.
What does he expect me to do with it,
stick it in my shoe?
Well, it may not be safe
to carry that much cash in the Congo.
It's not safe to carry that much cash anywhere,
but I don't think
the Mai Mai take travelers' checks.
You can afford to put $20,000
on your credit card?
( loud moving vehicle engine approaching )
FAC.
Government soldiers.
Heading west,
away from Kivu.
They're retreating.
The Mai Mai will come again soon.
( shouting )
Oh, God.
Refugees from the fighting.
More come every day.
The hospital is worse.
I'll put these in your room.
Give me that big one there.
Thanks.
( children squealing, shouting )
Still working bankers' hours,
I see.
Hello, Doctor.
( zipping )
I'm so sorry about Luka.
How are you holding up?
Doing what we can.
I brought you some things.
Sterile gloves,
needles, catheters, syringes,
IV Ceftriaxone and Cipro.
( chuckles )
DPL sets,
suture kits, old pulse ox...
Ooh, look at this.
Microscope.
Tried to get a portable X ray
but it wouldn't fit in my carry-on.
Where did you get all of that?
My hospital in Chicago donated it.
Do they know they donated it?
Yeah, more or less.
Tout est pret, Docteur.
You busy?
Ten-year-old with an abdominal GSW
and gross hematuria.
I'm not a surgeon.
Dominic's assisting,
and he never finished the sixth grade.
Kétamine et poinction lombaire.
We still have enough amoxicillin?
Oh.
Are you feeling all right, Doctor?
I'm just tired.
Merci, Docteur.
I'll need help. Set me up with lidocaine,
a suture kit and a scalpel.
You'll be fine.
GILLIAN ( over radio ): Base to mic One.
Luka, Patrique, are you there?
Luka, are you there? Over.
Mic one to base.
Bonjour, Gillian. On est là.
Luka, the fighting is getting heavy east of you. Copy.
Copy that.
Have you had any problems?
No, no. Patients are improving.
I'm going to revise the flap on the little girl
in a few minutes.
You warned Patrique what he's in for, right?
He's tough. He'll be fine.
Um, I should go. Save the batteries. Over.
Okay. Be safe. Clear.
Yeah, you, too. Out.
Docteur? Docteur?
There she is.
Debbie.
Hey.
Gillian.
This is Dr. Carter.
Uh, he was a friend of Luka's.
Oh...
I'm very sorry, Dr. Carter.
Thank you.
The ICRC in Kinshasa said that you were part
of the negotiating team,
that you might have some information
about what happened to Luka.
No, sorry.
They just gave us the list and a few personal items.
Steve Davidson,
American Embassy, said maybe you could get us into Kivu.
I'm trying to recover Dr. Kovac's body.
And I've brought a substantial amount of cash along
with me to spread around if you think that might help.
How much cash?
$20,000.
( whistles )
Wow. That's a lot of cash.
I work for the Red Cross, Doctor.
Our safety is dependent on our neutrality.
If any of the various armies or militia involved in this mess
knew we were giving money to the enemy,
money that could be used to buy weapons or food, we'd be dead.
And I don't mean dead in the water.
I mean, "head mounted on a sharpened stick" dead.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to offend you.
You didn't. I was led to believe
that money can sometimes be helpful
in situations like this.
So, what'll it take to get his body back?
Time.
How much time?
It's hard to say.
Thanks, Debbie.
Sure.
I told you she was your type.
( chuckling ): What?
Not at all.
Hey!
Richie Rich.
We've been negotiating to get into Kivu
for more of the wounded.
I could use a doc to help transport 'em.
Somebody in one of the camps
might know something about your friend.
Okay. Thanks.
She's definitely not my type.
Yeah, right.
Dr. Luka. Doctor.
Doctor! Please, we have to go.
What?
You have a fever.
Malaria?
I'm fine. Why did you wake me?
The Mai Mai are in Masenga.
They are burning the village.
GILLIAN: You were pretty hard on him.
Who?
John.
He's cute, don't you think?
Not again.
What was the last one?
The surgeon from Atlanta?
Turned out he had a wife and five kids.
So?
You need medicine.
I'll just fend it off.
We have some IV quinine left.
Save it for the boy.
He's getting better.
I'm not that sick.
PATRIQUE: I'll go get it.
No!
Save it for the boy, okay?
Oh, my God.
You guys burned the clinic to the ground?!
You guys...
You guys keep burning down hospitals.
Where are you going to go when you get shot, huh?
Where are you going to go when your mothers get sick?!
CHARLES: Dr. John!
He says many people died here.
They took the bodies to Kasese.
He thinks they're still there.
Doctor?
( sniffles )
What time is it?
Early.
( groans )
Where is everyone?
They left.
Where did they go?
They didn't want the Mai Mai to find them with us.
( shivering ): With me, you mean.
They should go, too.
They are worried about you.
Give me your arm.
Why?
You need medicine.
I told you to save the quinine for the boy.
I gave him one bag, and kept the other for you.
Give me your arm.
( blows air )
They should go while they can.
Pars, fais attention.
No!
You, too, go. I'll be fine.
Just leave me the radio. Take them there to safety.
I'll be all right.
We don't have the radio.
We must have left it at the camp.
When Charles comes, he'll look for us at the clinic first.
It should be safe again by now.
The Mai Mai will have already stolen everything and left.
He's dead, Doctor.
I know you want to get him back,
but Kasese is ten miles from here.
Plantez l'autre la-bas.
I was happy to stop in Matenda 'cause it was on the way.
So just give me a vehicle.
After we've triaged here, I'll have it back.
No, okay? No. And don't make me regret bringing you.
She won't do it.
Je regrette mama, on n'a rien avec nous pour vous soigner.
What's her complaint?
She's afraid she might be pregnant.
She was raped.
They all were.
There are more injured down there.
Bon jour.
I'm going to examine you, okay?
Gillian!
GILLIAN: What? Gillian!
I know you, don't I?
They were at the Clinic.
They were at Matenda when we left.
The boy had pertussis.
Les Mai Mai sont venus.
( both speaking French )
GILLIAN: Mai Mai came.
I think they have gone.
Keep walking.
( metallic thud )
Halte.
Keep going.
J'ai dit halte.
Bon jour.
Nous sommes les doc...
Do you want a beer?
Beer?
It's warm, tastes like formaldehyde
but it's wet.
Hmm.
No, thanks.
( sighs )
What is that thing, a radio?
iPod.
Digital music player.
Fancy.
What are you listening to?
Les Nubians, the Nubians.
No Dixie Chicks?
No Dixie Chicks.
Mm, you don't like the Dixie Chicks?
( blows raspberry )
So they just left him there?
In the jungle?
The Congolese were afraid
to be found with Luka and Patrique.
And that's all he knew?
That's all he knew.
Do you ever get worried that these guys
are going to get bored and just start shooting?
I don't think about it.
If I did, I'd probably never leave Seattle.
You know,
I consider myself reasonably well-informed...
...but before I came, I hadn't heard a thing
about the Congo.
Nobody at home gives a damn what happens out here.
There's no oil here.
Millions of people are slaughtered...
and we're too busy... eating Happy Meals.
What are you doing here?
You don't seem the type.
What's the type?
Macho, adrenaline junkies
and save-the-world peacenik freaks.
( laughing )
Which one are you?
( laughs )
Which do you think?
I... don't know what I'm doing out here.
I've been seeing this woman.
She's great... but it ain't good,
for her or for me.
It's simpler here.
People need help, I can help them.
I'm sorry.
I think I'm... tired.
You should get some rest.
I'm getting up early.
We'll take the Rover over to Kasese
while they load the trucks.
See what we can find out.
Thanks.
( Kovac shivering )
Is she still in there?
PATRIQUE: Yes.
You speak English?
Please, I speak no French.
Do you know what are they going to do with us?
They're waiting for someone to come
and tell them what to do.
Can you tell them I'm a geologist.
I'm not involved in the war.
I'm only here for rocks.
( vehicle rapidly approaching )
Another truck with soldiers.
They're coming.
Can you see?
No.
( gunshot )
Oh, God.
PATRIQUE: They are coming back.
Damn, Gillian,
how can you smoke this early in the morning?
So what made you change your mind?
About what?
About coming out here.
Come a hell of a long way,
I figured the least I could do
was help you get the last few miles.
Here we go.
What was this place?
DEBBIE: A school, I think.
MAI MAI: Les cadavres de Matenda sont a l'interieur.
He says the bodies from the clinic are inside.
You don't have to. We can just go.
Are you religious, Patrique?
No.
I was raised in the church.
Catholic.
I used to go twice a week with my mother.
It was beautiful.
I liked the music, the singing.
Do you still go?
No.
I stopped when my children were killed.
I couldn't believe in a God
that would allow such cruel things to happen.
It's probably hard to feel the Holy Spirit's presence
on a day like today.
( gunshot )
I'm sorry, Patrique.
I shouldn't have let you stay.
Nous sommes docteurs,
pas des FAC ou des RCD.
Alliance des Médecines Internacional.
C'est notre clinique... on n'assiste...
On donnes des medicaments aux maladees.
On n'assiste...
( coughing, gagging )
( coughing )
My God.
( coughing )
Gillian, stay outside.
( gasps )
Eh, laba.
Laba.
It isn't him.
What?
This isn't Luka!
What?!
Ask him!
Was he there when these men were killed?
( speaking French )
This man! Did you see this man?
Where is this man? ( speaking French )
Le, le pretre.
What's he saying?
Le pretre?
Le pretre. Il y etait.
What's he saying?
He says that Luka is a priest.
A what?
A priest!
( grunting )
No, please, please, no, no, no...
( two gunshots )
( speaking Croatian )
( speaking Croatian )
( speaking Croatian )
Joshua!
Pretre.
Tu est pretre?
Dis, tu es pretre?
Oui!
Il est pretre.
C'est un homme de Dieu.
( speaking Croatian )
Mon pere, benissez-moi je vous prie.
( speaking Croatian )
( Kovac speaking Croatian )
Le pretre.
Luka...
Is he alive?
Thank you.
Thank you.
Hey...
Hey!
How you feeling?
Terrible.
Where am I going?
Home.
Where's that?
America.
Got a medical transport plane in Kinshasa
waiting to take you back.
Expensive.
I know somebody who knows somebody.
Give this to Abby when you see her.
You're not coming?
I think I'm going to stick around for a while.
If she asks,
just tell her...
tell her I was lost, and now I'm found.
Thank you.
Well, back to work.
You really don't like the Dixie Chicks?
Everybody likes the Dixie Chicks.
Everybody?
Everybody with any taste.
( engine starting )
