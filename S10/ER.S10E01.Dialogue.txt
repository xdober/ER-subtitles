Previously on E.R.:
LOCKHART: You're going, right?
To Africa?
It's not Rio.
But it's not here.
Bonjour.
Bonjour.
( romantic pop music playing )
* Wait for me
* And wait for me...
( explosion, screams )
( speaking French )
Get down!
Je vous en prie! Ne tirez pas!
...du gouvernement.
Don't do anything stupid.
Like what?
Like get yourself killed.
Hi.
Hi.
When did you get back?
Just now.
It's 5:30 in the morning.
My flight from London was delayed.
I missed you.
Did you just let yourself in?
I'm sorry about how I left.
Can I have my key back, please?
( keys jangling )
( keys clanking )
( door slams )
Sorry we're late.
I couldn't get Hannah going.
Same with Katie this morning.
I don't want to sit in the middle.
In the car, please.
I sat in the middle yesterday.
Hannah, will you sit in the middle this morning?
Move over, Matthew.
Can we trade days next week? Steve has to go
to Seattle, and I don't have anybody
to sit with Devon. Sure. Can you call and remind me
over the weekend?
Thank you, Hannah.
Bye, Matthew.
Sorry you got stuck with that
Art Institute field trip.
Luck of the draw.
( kissing sound )
( kids laughing )
Hey, Beth, it's me.
What do I have at 3:00?
Can we cancel Howard or move him till later?
Crap!
No, not you.
Traffic.
I'll have to call you back, Beth.
Excuse me. Pardon me. Excuse me.
Excuse me. I'm sorry, ladies. I'm late for work.
( sighs )
Just made it, you know.
If I'm late again, my boss is going to kill me.
You're a doctor?
Yeah.
Yes, I am.
Where are we, Mommy?
( phone ringing )
We're almost there, sweetie.
Denise Johnson.
No, Beth, I'm still stuck.
I'm taking...
Mom?
Mom!
Look out!
Mom, look out! ( screaming )
PRATT: Yes, it can be challenging,
and at times it is dangerous,
but it's very rewarding.
You know, you get to make money
and be an asset to your community and...
Now what?
( over PA ): Attention passengers,
due to a delay ahead of us, we are unable to proceed.
We apologize for the inconvenience.
Thank you for your patience.
LOCKHART: Thank you.
Says he'll have them out in a few minutes.
WEAVER: How many? Four.
A mother and three kids.
And there's another guy trapped under a car across the street.
MARQUEZ: Six-victim MVA. Great way to start a shift.
MALIK: Yeah, I was supposed to have today off, too.
Aren't you graduating soon?
Yesterday.
Congratulations.
You know what they call the guy that graduates
last in his class from medical school, right?
That joke is so tired.
Doctor.
Ha, ha. I graduated fourth in my class.
When is this supposed to be finished?
Weaver said they'd be done last week.
So they should be done by what, Thanksgiving?
So why don't they just shut us down during all this?
Oh, please.
That would make way too much sense.
( electrical crackling ) Hey.
Hey!
( screams ): Hey!
Is that absolutely necessary?!
Does anyone know where Susan is?
We're going to need extra hands.
Think she's in the handicapped head.
Again?
We're out of copier paper.
I'm not Department Chair anymore.
Tell Dr. Lewis.
We're over our monthly allocation
and the Chief of Staff's office
refuses to authorize any additional overages.
That's you, right? ( electric crackling )
Excuse me.
Are you deaf?
I said stop!
Excuse me, can you help me, sir?
You need to find a triage nurse.
No, I'm sorry. I work here.
Lucky you.
I'm supposed to start today. Neela Rasgotra?
Rag what?
Rasgotra.
Don't we hire Americans anymore?
Hey!
( screams ): Hey!
I'm talking to you!
Dr. Lewis in there?
Oh, yeah.
Susan.
Yeah?
Uh, see you later.
Yeah. Uh, you know what, maybe.
Um, I don't know.
Fire's almost got the MVAs out.
Three adults, three kids.
I thought you were divorced.
We are.
Carter's back.
Yeah?
He tried to apologize.
No, no. Did he screw it up?
You said Friday. Why do they even bother?
I said maybe. Didn't say for sure.
Dr. Lewis, you got another TWA.
LEWIS: Oh, hi, I'm Susan Lewis.
Are you a resident?
Neela Rasgotra. Third year medical student.
That's a nice outfit.
You may want to wear something different next time.
It gets kind of messy down here.
You can put your stuff down here.
Where's the ceiling, huh? Where are the doors? The glass?
Is this your first rotation? Yeah.
The tile? Look, we usually wait until...
No, no! I don't want you to wait.
I want you to take what you have and do it now, finish it.
Have you ever been in a trauma before?
No.
32-year-old restrained driver
in a high-speed rollover with PSI.
No LOC, complains of hip and low back pain.
Pulse 120, B.P. 130/82.
Okay, Neela, hang close.
WOMAN: The kids...
Please help the kids.
Eight-year-old female. Bilateral femur fractures,
head trauma with altered mental status.
B.P. 90/60, resps 24.
CHEN: What happened?
Her legs were crushed between the truck and the seat.
Took CFD a long time to cut her out.
How many more incoming? Three.
Any other attendings? No.
You a doctor yet?
I graduated yesterday.
Good enough. Where's Pratt?
Don't know.
Frank, where's Dr. Pratt?
How should I know?
Okay, Jerry, I want you to start paging Pratt
and don't stop paging him until he calls back.
My computer just went down.
Whoa, they're all down.
Son of a bitch!
Oh, for God's sake.
( Pratt gasping )
Oh, man.
Oh, no, I'm a doctor here.
All right.
Hey! How was Africa?
Hot.
( pager beeps )
That's your pager going off. Yeah.
Going to answer it? Nope.
I'll catch up with you later.
Matthew, back middle passenger wearing a lap belt.
Scalp lac from the dome light, closed left wrist fracture.
WEAVER: Doctor, you're late.
I was outside helping the paramedics.
You were supposed to be here at 8:00,
not five after or ten after or 20 after.
( electrical sizzling )
Hey, Frank.
Where's the lounge?
Down by X-ray.
Morning.
You bring Kovac back with you?
Nope.
( strained ): Where's my mom?
Can you call my mom?
Hey, how you doing, Matthew?
I'm Dr. Gallant.
Good vitals. A and O times four.
Doctor? When did that happen?
About 20 minutes ago.
Where does it hurt?
( groans ): My arm.
Can you push my hands with your feet?
( Matthew grunting )
Who's in there with Dr. Lewis?
New med student, I think.
Yeah, his belly is tender.
( groans ) But soft.
It's probably just bruised.
Get abdominal CT and a wrist series.
I'll be next door, if you need me.
Hey.
You need some help?
LEWIS: Sure.
Trauma panel includes CBC, Chem-7, LFTs, amylase,
PT/PTT, urine toxicology screen and a BAL.
I'm Dr. Greg Pratt.
Neela Rasgotra.
WOMAN: I don't know what happened.
I was driving, then we were upside down.
"Neela," that's Indian, right?
Mm, yeah.
WOMAN: My daughter, is she okay?
Please?
We need to make sure you're fine first.
Pupils four millimeters equal and reactive bilaterally.
Sinus tach, hemocue is 8.1.
8.1, that's pretty low.
Yeah, we have to find the source of the blood loss.
PRATT: Could be hemothorax,
bleeding in the chest.
Chest is clear.
Or it could be
intra-abdominal hemorrhage.
Belly is soft and nontender.
Or it could be something else.
( woman gasps )
( gasping )
Like a unstable pelvic fracture, Professor Pratt?
( loud hammering )
Hey. An attorney called every day while you were gone.
Said he was the executor of your grandmother's estate,
needs to talk to you.
Call him back, would you?
I am not your personal assistant.
OLIGARIO: Hey. Welcome back, Carter.
Yeah, you, too.
( paper crinkling )
What do you have?
Pelvic fracture with a low crit.
How was Africa?
It was... great.
She hypotensive?
No, pressure's holding.
But there's a little girl next door may need some help.
Is that Hannah?
Is she okay?
Need a hand?
CHEN: Welcome home, stranger.
Open your eyes, Hannah.
( groans )
Responds to pain.
Hannah?
( groans )
When did you get back?
Last night, late.
JERRY: They pulled another kid out.
I'll take the new one.
Let you two catch up.
She's altered. Right parietal hematoma.
I'd call for a head CT.
Crush injury, bilateral femur fractures with good pulses.
She needs Hare traction.
She broke both her legs.
So, put on two.
Not room for two.
Are we arguing?
I just don't want to adduct her legs.
She needs traction. Well, we can
rig a Sager in the middle, with a double harness bar.
Why didn't you say that in the first place?
Morison's pouch is between
the liver and the right kidney.
Any liquid blood appears anechoic
between the two organs.
Big black stripe, right?
That's right.
Can I steal a nurse, Susan?
Yeah, sure.
Central line's in. Hook up the infuser.
Dr. Chen, this is Neela, our new medical student.
Hi.
Nice to meet you.
Okay.
Uh... no blood visualized.
Moving to the left upper quadrant
to view the subdiaphragmatic space.
Malik, can you join me?
Yeah. Thank you.
The transverse suprapubic scan
looks for blood anterior to the bladder.
I'm stealing your aprons.
Okay, go ahead.
I found your present hanging on my locker.
It was subtle.
It was very subtle.
TECH: All clear.
MARQUEZ: Hemocue seven point nine.
LEWIS: Bring me the films when they're done.
How's her pressure? 110 over 78.
If she's anemic and losing blood,
why doesn't she drop her pressure?
She's young and healthy.
Ma'am, we're going to stabilize your pelvic fracture.
I need you to keep traction. Come on.
Okay, this is going to hurt some, Denise.
I'm going to go check on your daughter, all right?
Keep two of O-neg on the rapid infuser, just in case.
Be back.
( panting )
LEWIS: Need a pedes vent?
CHEN: Called for it.
At least five rib fractures
with a flail segment.
Prep for a 28 French chest tube.
All right, I'll get you some help.
Hey, Gallant, how you doing?
Fine. You want to run it?
Yeah, eight-year-old boy.
Middle rear seat passenger.
Scalp lac, left wrist fracture.
Seat-belt sign.
Rule out an interperitoneal injury.
Okay.
Hey, unilateral open book fracture.
She drop her BP yet?
Well, she's a trooper.
Okay, I'll call upstairs. Go next door.
Jing-Mei needs some help.
Hey, Frank, can you call Angio,
and tell them to reserve a room for my pelvis?
CHEN: Where's the Thoraseal?
I only got two hands.
I can pitch in.
Good.
You sure you can tear yourself away
from your med student for a moment?
She's doing fine.
Oh-silk?
Are they together?
MARQUEZ: Who?
Them.
Oh, yeah.
My hands are starting to cramp.
Well, I'll go get those towel clips.
I don't know what happened.
I was driving, and then we were upside down.
And the truck hit us.
( shuddering )
How are Matthew and Katie?
I don't know.
Has someone called their parents?
Lizzie and Steve are Katie's.
Matthew's dad is Andy.
Oh, God.
( shudders )
Is that one of the girls next door?
Is that Hannah?
Oh, God, Hannah!
Please, please...
( sobbing ): Be okay, please...
Is that Hannah?
PVCs.
What's her pulse ox? Run of four.
All right, 30 of lidocaine. Let's crank up the O2.
You think her T waves look peaked?
No, no, it's too early for hyperkalemia.
Carter, they look peaked to me.
Just push the damn lidocaine.
V tach.
Lost the pulse. Starting compressions.
Charge it to 30.
DENISE: What are they doing?
What's happening?
I can't tell from here.
Is something wrong?
Please, ma'am, don't move.
Denise?
Mrs. Johnson?
I need some help in here.
Hey!
Hey!
What's going on in here?
Pelvic fracture with anemia.
Just dropped her pressure. Who are you?
Medical student. Who's her doctor?
I'm stabilizing her fracture.
Yeah, while she bleeds out. Are you from the East End?
No, West London.
MARQUEZ: What happened?
Chuny, I want a second line, wide open.
How much O-neg has she had?
None. She was stable.
Well, now, her pressure
is 60 over 40.
Did anyone bother ultrasounding the belly?
Negative for blood.
What about chest X-ray?
All clear. Pressure's up to 80 systolic.
Okay, I want a second line in, prep for a DPL.
What's her CBC?
PRATT: It's not back yet.
You! Go pick up her labs.
Right now?
No, next Thursday.
B level, Specimen Processing.
Take the elevator in the lobby. Go!
CORDAY: Prep for an IJ.
I'll do a mini-lap for the DPL.
Excuse me? The elevators?
CARTER: And clear!
ABBY: Still V-tach.
All right, charge again to 60.
Let's open an intubation tray.
Her chemistries are almost ready.
And clear.
Okay, sinus tach.
Another half bolus of lido.
Say that again.
More lidocaine.
Eight-point-three, thanks.
Well, her potassium's eight-point-three.
All right, 30cc's of bicarb,
five units regular insulin, amp of D25.
T waves are peaked.
You should have listened to...
Yeah, can we do this later?
Kayexelate by NG, call for dialysis,
and let's open a 12 French double lumen femoral catheter.
Spell the last name again.
Johnson.
J-o-h-n-s-o-n.
"Specimen pending."
Says Dr. Shine is reviewing the slide.
Where's Dr. Shine?
Hey, you can't go back there.
Sorry, won't happen again.
Hey, this is authorized personnel only.
I'll only be a second.
Dr. Shine?
Dr. Shine?
Dr. Shine?
Are you working on Denise Johnson?
Who wants to know?
She's crashing in the ER.
This is a very unusual smear.
MARQUEZ: Pressure's up to 95.
CORDAY: Fluid looks clear.
Hang two of type specific.
No, don't give her type specific.
She has an autoimmune hemolytic anemia.
Give her type specific, she'll go into renal failure.
Where's the lab slip?
I reviewed the slide with Dr. Shine.
She's got microspherocytes, hyperbilirubinemia
and a high retic count.
Hang more of O-neg. Get Shine on the phone.
She said she was driving,
and when she woke up, she was upside down.
The anemia could have made her pass out, right?
MARQUEZ: I have Dr. Chen for Dr. Shine.
Dr. Shine, line one.
Dr. Shine...
Pressure's 105, pulse is down.
...a med student was just up there.
Damn, girl.
E.R., please hold.
E.R. What? E.R.
No, this is not CICU.
No, you have the wrong extension.
OB is 1687.
E.R. No, this is not the cafeteria.
E.R. No, sorry. Surgical Post Op is 7204.
Why would I transfer you?
E.R. E.R.
What the hell is going on?!
Hey, jagoff, what, are you screwing up
our phone lines now, too?
What are we going to do?
Don't answer 'em.
Charts for waiting patients are over here.
Do an H&P and call me. You ever do history?
Yeah.
Good. Grab an easy one
and come find me when you're ready.
Hey,
don't you cats hear the phones ringing?
Med student?
Mm-hmm.
Hey, I saw you a bit earlier.
Your first day?
Yeah.
Are you Indian?
Yeah. Punjabi.
FRANK: Perfect.
This must be, uh, quite an adjustment for you.
Uh, no, not really.
My family moved to London when I was 11.
Yale for molecular biology and biophysics
and Chicago for medical school.
Okay, then.
Let's get you started.
Whoa.
Penile discharge.
Probably not your ideal first patient.
AV infected graft.
Sounds about right.
Come on.
What the hell is going on down here?
Hey, glad to see you, Dr. Romano.
Yeah, I doubt it. Who was that?
One of those University of Calcutta carpetbaggers
you people insist on hiring.
I think she said she went to Yale.
Yeah, her daddy's probably a drug lord.
Built a new wing on the Yale library with his poppy profits.
How's the arm?
Gone. How's the prostate?
About the size of your head.
I'm up four times a night to pee.
What's with the beard?
I hear the ladies like it.
Whose bright idea was all this anyway?
ALL: Weaver!
Dr. Romano, you're back.
Yeah, try to hide your wild enthusiasm
at my return.
I find overt displays of emotion embarrassing.
Hey, page Weaver for me.
Dr. Carter, you got a minute?
Lumens are flushed. Cut.
Bactroban and opsite.
Call me if you need me.
I won't.
What do you got?
HIV-positive patient.
Came in a couple of weeks ago
with oral candidiasis.
Got a prescription for Nystatin,
but he's back, with worse.
What was that all about?
The moons must be lined up or something
'cause Jing-Mei's pissed off, too.
What's Deb upset about?
Misunderstanding.
Abby still mad at you?
So what did you do, anyway?
Oh, I don't know.
I left, I guess.
This guy's not on Medicaid?
No, he's uninsured, so I referred him to ADAP.
So, what do you want to do with him?
ADAP's out of money.
They told him it would be at least two months
before they could get him started on his meds
if he's only HIV positive.
Mr. Williams?
Hello, I'm Dr. Carter.
Mind if I take a look?
How long has he been HIV positive?
Two years.
Does it hurt when you swallow?
Mm-hmm.
I've been taking my medication.
You're not on the triple cocktail?
AZT, 3TC?
No, uh, I have a prescription, but the guy at the pharmacy
told me it's 1,200 bucks.
I can't afford that.
Well, I've got some good news and some bad news.
Um, the oral thrush from last week
has spread down into your esophagus.
That's the bad news, huh?
No, actually... that's the good news.
It's a, um, an opportunistic infection.
It means you now qualify for Medicaid
and the anti-retroviral therapy.
So what's the bad news?
Candidal esophagitis is an AIDS-defining infection.
That's why you qualify now.
I have AIDS?
Uh...
We're going to write you a prescription
for Diflucan
to help fight the infection.
What is that going to cost?
Nothing. Medicaid's going to cover it,
and we'll send you up to the financial counselor's office
to help get your paperwork straightened out.
He came straight from the airport to your place.
That's got to tell you something.
What, he's horny?
Or that he really missed you
and felt badly about leaving that way.
Tell him how it made you feel
and give him the chance to make up for it.
Oh, for God's sake,
where are we supposed to go? Second floor.
Screw that.
I mean, he just shows back up
like he never went away...
and like he wasn't a jerk
for leaving like that, and like...
That's the men's room.
Howdy, boys. Don't mind me.
Guard the door for me, would you?
Make up for it how?
Flowers, a nice dinner.
If you're really mad, jewelry.
I could use a new transmission for my car.
You're a real romantic, you know that?
AV graft connects the brachial vein
to the brachial artery for easy dialysis access.
See the redness and the swelling?
Mm-hmm.
Is there any pain here?
It hurts like hell.
Yeah, the fluctuance and the infection
is pointing with discharge.
Feel for the thrill over the graft.
Listen for a bruit.
You have beautiful skin.
Thank you.
You use anything special on it?
Not really.
What a lovely color.
Lastly, you want to check the heart
to make sure there's no murmur.
What do you think we'd be worried about?
Bacterial endocarditis.
Good, good.
So what do we need?
Labs?
Yep. CBC, Chem 7,
Gram stain, and a culture from the abcess,
and get me, uh, three grams of Unasyn IV piggyback.
Uh, do we drain it?
No, not in the E.R.
She goes to the O.R. for an I and D...
so check her vitals every 15 minutes
until she, uh, goes up to the O.R., and, uh...
grab another chart.
Just talk to him-- haven't you punished him enough already?
It's not about punishing him.
Oh, no... ROMANO: I'm chair now, Kerry...
You know, if he starts in on me again,
I swear I'm going to cut the other arm off.
We need more beds...
...a same-day surgery center
so that we get more paying customers
into this place. That's not your concern anymore.
This department is a money pit!
We have more people coming through the door,
and we're legally obligated to treat them.
Which is why we should grab some wood,
nail the entrance shut, and paint "Go away"
in big letters.
( sighs ): Frank, are the phones working again?
Two lines. The rest we don't answer.
Some guy looking for Cubs tickets
last time I checked.
Oh, Dr. Carter, that guy
from the foundation called again.
Did you take a message?
No, I told him you were here.
He said he was coming by with some papers to sign.
I don't want him coming by here while I'm working.
Well, tell him yourself when you see him.
( welder's torch zapping )
Hey. Hey.
You want to... get a cup of coffee? Yeah.
Okay.
Excuse me, Dr. Carter, right?
Tom Williams.
Uh, you sent me up to financial counseling
to get on Medicaid for my throat medication?
Right.
I filled out the paperwork
and I went to the pharmacy,
but they can't give me the prescription
until I get my Medicaid card.
Should I keep taking Nystatin until then?
Did they say how long it was going to take to get the card?
A few weeks.
You need to take the Diflucan now.
Can you cover the cost of the prescription
till the card comes in?
It's 300 bucks.
Okay, hang out.
I'll call the pharmacy myself.
Now what?
The pharmacy won't fill his prescription
till he gets his new Medicaid card.
Why don't we just take him out back and shoot him?
It'd be easier.
My Frank died four years ago.
Liver cancer.
Married 52 years.
I was a teenage bride.
No, really, I, uh...
I was 16.
Never dated nobody else.
Never kissed nobody else.
Oh, boy, that man was a perfect slob.
God love him.
Yeah, had six boys to boot
and not one of them worth a damn.
You married?
No. I've been in school.
Oh, well-well, don't put it off too long, dear.
He doesn't have to be handsome.
Just make sure he treats you right.
Okay. All done, Mrs. Ferguson.
I'll be back soon.
Wait, where do you think you're going?
It's 2:30.
So what?
We stop at 2:30.
It's barely lunchtime.
We started at 7:00!
I started at 6:00!
This is unbelievable!
Labs go...?
Uh, right over there.
How's it going?
Dr. Gallant's been very helpful.
Oh, I'm pretty sure he has been.
You need another patient?
Yeah.
All right. Come on.
( sighs ): No...
( laughs ): No.
Ah, here, try this.
Take a history and come find me.
Okay.
( phone ringing )
Hello, Emergency Department.
I-I-I'm sorry, I can't hear you very well.
For who? Anybody seen Carter?
Yeah, he's outside with Abby on a break. Excuse me,
but the phone was ringing, and no one was around,
so I thought I should answer it. Big mistake.
It's long distance, overseas for a Dr. Carter.
Of course. Who else? Take a message.
Yeah, can I take a message?
Uh, they say it's important.
Someone has died.
Who? Someone named Kovac.
A Dr. Luka Kovac.
So how was it?
It was incredible.
And it was terrible.
It was, um...
It was kids with polio,
it was kids dying from malnutrition
and malaria and whooping cough and...
And it was beautiful.
I mean, the country's beautiful.
Hospital doesn't have enough staff
so the patients', uh, family members,
they stay with them.
They cook for them, they clean for them,
they even, uh, change the sheets.
It was a life-changing experience.
I just don't know how yet.
Where's Luka?
Is that what this is about?
No.
Luka's fine.
Luka's more than fine.
What does that mean?
Nothing.
Nothing.
Do you know we don't talk?
We're not talking now?
Your mouth is moving.
I mean, you give the impression
we're having a real conversation,
but when you finish, I have no idea what you're thinking.
I was trying to tell you about Africa.
I don't know.
You knew I didn't want you to go and you went anyway.
What, were you trying to hurt me?
( sighs )
Why would I want to hurt you?
I don't know. I don't know.
Why would you want to hurt me?
It wasn't about you.
Oh, come on.
You weren't even going to tell me you were going.
If hadn't bumped into you
when you were leaving, I wouldn't have even known.
I wasn't trying to hurt you.
I wanted to feel like
I was really doing something.
Did you even think about me?
Yes. Okay.
What did you think?
What did you think?
I don't know why you bothered to come back.
You just going to walk away? Yeah.
Okay, walk away, Abby.
That's what you do best.
Okay.
You want to know what you do best?
You make this all about my problems,
but you know what, you have some problems, too.
You've got some really big problems.
Why did I come back?
I mean, Luka's over there changing the world
and I can't even get a hospital pharmacy
in the richest nation on Earth
to give an AIDS patient enough damn
Diflucin to him... from dying from a sore throat.
Kisangani, West Africa.
Do they know how?
No.
Does he have family here?
No.
Hey.
You okay?
I didn't know him. Who was he?
An attending.
Friend?
No, not really.
So how's your shunt?
That's where I'm going.
Well keep an eye on her.
Surgery should be down soon.
Where did she go?
Do you know where my patient went, Mrs. Ferguson?
Infected dialysis shunt, older woman.
I have no idea.
What's up?
Ready to present that old guy in Curtain One?
Mm, yeah.
All right.
Uh, 72-year-old man
notes constipation without fever, nausea,
vomiting, weight lose or hematochezia.
His only medication is Vicodon TID.
Abdomen is soft, flat, non-tender.
Normal bowel sounds.
Negative guaiac, no evidence of inpaction.
So what's your assessment?
Constipation due to Vicadin use.
What is the number one
neoplasm in terms of national mortality?
Breast cancer?
No, that would be lung.
And number two?
Colon cancer.
Over 50,000 deaths per year.
The common presenting symptoms are?
Anemia, hematochezia and constipation.
So wouldn't you agree that a constipated,
elderly patient merits an evaluation for colon cancer?
The stool is negative.
He got all bound up when he started the Vicadin.
Order a bowel prep and schedule
an out-patient barium enema.
You're serious?
You heard the lady.
You know, you were pretty rough on her.
You really think that was necessary?
Who we talking about?
PRATT: Come on now.
I was trying to teach her.
So whatever you think...
Look, no, you come on now.
You were all over her.
It's humiliating and embarrassing.
I wasn't all over her.
Look, don't make a fool of me, okay?
I'm not trying to make a fool of you.
Hey, there's an old lady in here bleeding out.
No breathing,
no pulse.
Get the crash cart.
Bag her on 15 liters.
Who's patient is this?
She's mine.
Greg, start compressions.
PRATT: You're kidding.
I'll do it.
Excuse me, I'll be right back.
CHEN: You left an infected
AV graft unattended.
She needs a central line and saline.
No, what she needs is a hearse and pine box.
The graft was in a major artery.
She needed constant monitoring.
I was supposed to check her every 15 minutes.
GALLANT: No, she was
my responsibility.
PRATT: Asystole.
Amp of epi.
I went to her room and she was gone.
I thought she'd been taken to surgery.
I moved her in here to give her more privacy
for a 12 lead EKG.
Did you tell anybody?
Yeah, I changed it on the board.
CHEN: Did you check the patient board?
It's not her fault,
it's mine.
( sighs )
Four units of packed cells,
four liters of saline and another
round of EPI and atropine.
CARTER: In Zagreb,
Kovac, K-O-V-A-C.
Uh, yeah, Croatia.
You can connect me, great.
Yeah, uh... in Za... English?
You speak English?
Zagreb, Kovac.
K-O-V-A-C.
Hey.
Do you know Luka's father's first name?
There's like 100 Kovacs in Zagreb.
Uh, okay, sorry.
No, thank you, thank you.
What are you doing?
The Alliance.
They're going to have all of his contact information.
I can just get it from them.
Do you know who's this is?
What are you doing?
There's a 12:00 flight to Paris,
and then I can connect
to Kinshasa with a four-hour layover.
Wait, wait, wait-- you're going to go back there?
Why?
Cause I left him there. Left him where?
At the clinic in Matenda.
I should have stayed.
You're not making any sense.
John.
Doctor, what are doing?
I'll inventory it. You can bill me.
It wasn't your fault.
You've got blood on your sleeve.
What's a TWA?
What?
A TWA.
Where'd you hear that from?
The old guy at the front desk with the flat head,
he called me a TWA this morning.
I don't know what it means.
Third World Assassin.
TWA.
Hey, come on, I want to show you something.
Come on.
Was that today?
32-year-old mother of two
with a rare blood disorder.
Still alive tonight.
I'll see you tomorrow.
You don't have to go tonight.
I'll call you when I get to Paris.
Just, can't you just please wait
until it's a little bit safer?
No, I can't leave him there.
Well, just, I don't want you to go.
I'll be gone a couple days. I'll call you.
John, please, please, just stay.
I can't keep doing this.
