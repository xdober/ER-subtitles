Previously on E.R.:
Congratulations, Mr. Nathan, you're on call tomorrow night.
32 hours straight.
Labs on your baby.
You two need to figure this out.
I was going to call first, but Jody got sick.
Who's Jody?
You show up here with this girl
who's barely out of her teens.
Aren't you due back at the base?
Not for a couple of weeks.
Couple weeks?
There it is--
You can see his heart beat.
You can tell it's a boy?
Because I can't.
No, it's just a... figure of speech.
It's just a pronoun.
Are you hoping for a boy?
Not particularly.
I mean, a boy would be nice
but I... I don't care.
I don't even really want to know.
As long as it's healthy, right?
The rash of Lyme Disease is called...
Erythema migrans.
Starts two to 20 days after the tick bite.
But it occurs in only 60 to 80 percent of cases.
The hallmark of the rash is...
Erythmatous plaque. Central clearing.
Yeah. And the most common neurological symptoms?
BOTH: Facial nerve palsy.
Okay, all right, settle down.
This is a teaching hospital, not medical Jeopardy.
Where are all the doctors?
Who are you looking for?
Anyone. Carter, Weaver, Pratt; I'm not picky.
Uh, Carter's stuck in triage
Pratt's on at midnight, and Weaver's MIA.
What else is new?
Kovac is sleeping.
With who? Thought he was suspended.
He's back-- in the lounge.
Hey, Harkins, you want to try
casting a Colles' fracture on a cranky old lady?
Sure.
What's the antibiotic of choice?
Doxycycline.
Beth, this is Erin.
She's going to be putting your cast on.
Beth? Miss Garrison?
I can't feel a pulse.
Oh, geez, she's cold.
She's dead?
Bag her on 15 liters.
I need a crash cart in here.
Sister Beth?
She was a nun?
She is.
Oh, boy.
Nathan?
Nathan, let's shake a leg, come on.
Corday's looking for you, man.
Be right there.
( heavy sigh )
ER. Please hold.
Think you could take this somewhere else?
Me? I need to use the computer.
Use one of the ones over there.
I don't want you anywhere near me
when God strikes you dead for killing that nun.
I didn't kill her.
You didn't save her.
She was an 87-year-old woman in poor health.
What, you only save the healthy ones?
She stroked out; no one could foresee that.
You don't have to explain to me.
I'm not the one who's going to be doing the judging.
GSW ten minutes out.
Wake up Kovac.
Is Dr. Corday still down here?
John Doe; found him down in the park
altered, no signs of serious trauma.
Promise me you won't let them near my face.
Promise me you won't.
Sir, what's your name?
Do you know your name?
They dropped right out of the trees--
right near my face.
Nobody's near your face, sir.
Don't, don't let them near me!
Whoa, whoa, settle down.
Okay, get five of Haldol!
Don't let them bite me!
Relax... sir.
We're trying to help you!
Security! ( screams )
Stop it!
It's the damn dyskenesias.
Still need the Haldol?
Yes.
We got it.
All right, put him in soft restraints.
You okay?
Yeah, I'm fine, thanks.
Are you okay?
Nothing that 12 hours of sleep wouldn't cure.
Okay, put him on pulse ox
two liters O2 by nasal cannula.
Mineral oil on the cotton balls should act as a solvent.
Come on in.
Let's, uh, get him inside.
Make sure his nasal passages stay clear.
Hey, Jody, what are you doing here?
Um, I'm looking for Eric.
CARTER: Abby.
Hi, Abby.
Hey, what's going on?
Where's Eric?
I was hoping you knew.
What do you mean?
I don't know.
We were in Indiana
on our way back from my parents'...
They had a fight.
It was hardly an argument.
I mean, he got really angry.
I was just asking him about us and our future
and stuff like that
and he took off.
I didn't mean to upset him.
Maybe he went back to his base.
No, I called.
They said he's been U.A. for two weeks.
"U.A."?
Unauthorized absence.
Abby?
Abby? He's AWOL?
Joel Seaton, 67--
syncopal episode at Navy Pier.
Paramedics found him dehydrated, systolic of 90.
Came up with 500 saline.
Joel was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer
three months ago.
What sort of treatment have you been on, Mr. Seaton?
Megace and gemzol.
They said I might have a year with the chemo.
I'm not doing too good.
He's had two stents in his common bile duct
to relieve the obstruction.
It's probably clogged again
which explains the fever.
How's your pain?
Every night I go to bed
I keep hoping I'll wake up in the morning
and I'll be better, and the pain will be gone.
Think there's a surgical alternative that could help?
I'm afraid not.
What happens
if you don't do anything?
You'll get more jaundiced.
Slip into a coma
from liver failure.
Your kidneys will fail, and your heart
will stop from a high potassium level.
Is that a painful way to die?
Not once you slip into the coma.
We can arrange for home hospice care.
A nurse will visit you twice a day
to give you the pain medications you need.
When my wife was living, she used always to say
I'd probably die in my Barcalounger
watching the football game.
I'm starting to think that's not such a bad way to go.
Does that mean you're no longer interested
in further treatment, Mr. Seaton?
( screaming )
Sorry. Let's have Ativan now.
( whimpering ): I can't see.
All right, just relax. I can't see.
I need some flush.
Did you try to kill yourself, Greg?
No, it was an accident.
He didn't mean it.
Okay, page E.N.T. and Optho.
Get me a woods lamp and flourescein.
Who, Greg? Who shot you?
Tommy.
Who's Tommy? Is he a friend?
He's my brother.
He's ten.
Okay, two view of the face
along with a trauma panel.
Look at this light, Greg.
Can you see this light?
A little.
Where did Tommy get the gun?
He was playing with our dad's gun.
I tried to take it away from him so he wouldn't
hurt himself, but it went off.
We'll do everything we can to make you comfortable.
Thank you.
Let me know
if there's anything else you need, okay?
Thank you.
We should have pursued other options.
What? With Corday.
There are other treatments to consider.
I did; I asked for the surgical consult.
She didn't think it was a good idea.
Yeah, but what if it's in the patient's best interest?
I know you went up against Carter on a terminal patient
but that's not your job.
You're a med student.
I'm saying it could just be this guy's having a bad day.
We try to do what's best for the patient
and respect their wishes.
If we're lucky, we get to do both.
This is one of those times.
Have Pedes page me when he comes out of surgery.
Dr. Kovac?
Mike Dobbs.
I think you know my wife, Heather.
Look, we've been having some rough times recently
but I'd appreciate it if you'd stop seeing her.
Maybe you should speak to your wife about this.
Yeah, I did.
Are you married?
I was.
Well, then you know how hard it can be.
Look, I'm not trying
to threaten you or anything, man
but I got two daughters.
What am I supposed to tell them
when their mother doesn't come home at night?
I don't know.
Just trying to keep my family together, that's all.
Hey, Eric, it's me again.
Listen, could you please call me back?
You don't even have to talk to me.
If you just leave a message on my machine
I'd appreciate it.
Thank you.
Looks like your day's sucking as bad as mine.
Yeah, I just, I'm worried about my brother.
I can't get in touch with him.
At least you haven't killed anyone.
I'm 0 for two.
All these patients could be my next victim.
Aha. "I think I have the crabs, and it itches bad."
So, you're not taking the chest pain in four?
Not if he wants to live.
The guy in Exam Two has scrotal swelling.
Pretty safe bet.
Uh, I'm not that desperate.
At least it's medical.
He's pushing 300 pounds.
It's a big scrotum.
( chuckles )
He's a heart attack waiting to happen.
Half these patients are.
Old, diabetic, old, old and diabetic...
Did you reach him yet?
No, I keep getting his voice mail.
Oh, screw it, give me the swollen scrotum.
Maybe he's off with a buddy, or something.
Dr. Carter, could you reassess
my allergic reaction in Two?
Yeah, I'll be right there.
Where's Jody?
She's checking into a hotel.
Do you want to get a cup of coffee or something?
He didn't respond to Benadryl or Cimetidine.
Try solumedrol.
I did; he's still wheezing.
Try an albuterol treatment.
It didn't work.
Maybe I should push an IV epi.
I'll be right back.
What are his sats?
83. On oxygen.
Medical facility, please.
Hi, I'm calling from Chicago's
County General Emergency Department.
We're treating a patient from your base-- Eric Wyczenski.
We're going to need his medical records faxed over.
I don't have the chart in front of me.
Does it matter who the doctor is?
Okay, uh, uh, just a second.
Um, the physician's name is Dr. John Carter.
Oh... Excuse me.
It's okay.
How are you feeling, Greg?
My eyes hurt.
Can you see anything?
No.
Hey, Chuny...
Yeah.
I'm sorry... about everything.
Me, too.
Am I blind?
You have a shotgun pellet inside your eyeball
but we're bringing in an eye specialist to repair it.
You were lucky-- you could've blown your head off.
My dad would be less mad at me if I was... dead.
He shouldn't be angry with you at all.
You probably saved your brother's life.
Hey. Can I talk to you for a second?
Shoot.
HALEH: Carter!
Carter!
Is there anything wrong with him?
Not that I can tell.
Neighbor heard the baby crying.
Found mom down in the backyard, the kid still in the swing.
Mom's got no sign of trauma.
Could be a possible mixed O.D.
G.C.S. four-one-five, but she's uncooperative.
B.P. 122/78, pulse 84.
Okay. What's her name?
The neighbor wasn't sure--
thought it was Tenji or Tong-yi, something like that.
She didn't have any ID.
Ma'am, I'm Dr. Carter.
Can you tell me your name?
I have a 16-year-old boy who's going to go blind
if he doesn't get here fast.
Then tell me where he is
so I can at least call for some initial orders.
He's where?
Eyes open to painful stimuli.
Is your name Tenji or Tong-yi?
Is she oriented to person? Her little boy's fine.
Does she understand English?
Gag reflexes present.
I smell alcohol on her breath.
Got your bloods.
Okay, what do you want?
C.B.C., uh, lytes, E.T.O.H...
Aspirin and acetaminophen levels. ( phone ringing )
Hello?
Eric.
What about charcoal?
Where are you?
The 2001 recommendations from the American Academy...
LOCKHART: Jody came by; she's looking for you.
Okay, I need to see you.
I need to talk to you about a couple things.
She can't tell us when she took it.
Right. 25 of charcoal.
I need some Surgilube and an N.G. tube.
Abby, she needs a Foley and a urine tox screen.
Damn it.
And... let's change the saline to D5
half at 75 an hour.
Blunted deep tendon reflexes-- could be benzos.
Oh, should we try flumazenil?
Only if you want her to start seizing.
Did you lose him?
Yeah, I lost him.
MAN: It's not unusual to experience these sort of feelings
when dealing with a chronic illness.
Mr. Nathan
may I have a word?
Excuse me.
What's he doing in there?
Oh, that's Dr. Harvey; he's the attending psych...
I know who he is.
I asked you what he's doing.
He was down on a psych consult on another patient
and I asked if he would come and speak with Mr. Seaton.
Did you run this by Dr. Lewis?
No.
But Dr. Harvey agreed. Mr. Seaton was depressed
and wasn't in a position to be objective
about his own treatment.
He's refused treatment.
But now he's willing to consider other options.
A Whipple, for instance.
A Whipple?
No, please don't tell me you suggested a Whipple for this patient.
I'm not sure who brought it up.
Well, whoever did must be utterly insane
because nobody in their right mind would be suggesting
a six-hour operation for this man.
An operation that requires
months of recovery, assuming he ever recovers.
And for what?
He's dead in two months if we do nothing.
That's right.
But only you seem to be unwilling to accept that.
Well, shouldn't we at least present him
with all the facts and let him decide?
You've done enough, thank you.
Normal vitals, satting well on room air.
Did you get your phone working?
No.
Tox screen is positive for barbiturates only.
Blood alcohol level is only .065.
Urine dip's negative, but ICON's positive.
She's coming around.
Ma'am!
Do you know that you're pregnant?!
You speak English?
Where's Chen? Maybe she can translate for us.
I want to rule out an ectopic.
Where's the, uh, portable ultrasound? I'll get it.
Uh, can I do it?
Yeah, I'll be right back.
I'm sorry, Abby
but that was right in the middle of a trauma.
I know. Maybe he'll call back.
Did you check your home machine?
No, I didn't have a chance to.
Well, how did he sound?
That depends on who you ask.
He sounds great-- he's happy, he's carefree
he's having the time of his...
life.
I think just the, uh, fact that he called is a pretty good sign.
Yeah, he's manic, Carter.
Say, Abby!
Here's two of the country's finest
looking for a patient.
I'm Sergeant Andrews with the Air Force's
Office of Special Investigation.
I understand you're treating Eric Wyczenski.
No. Uh, we were, but we're not now.
He left against medical advice.
Any idea of where he may have been going?
Uh, no. I'm sorry we can't be more helpful
but we have an emergency coming in.
What about the doctor who treated him?
He had to take a trauma upstairs.
If you leave your card with the desk clerk
we'll call you if he shows up again.
What was all that about?
I was just about to tell you.
( sighs )
These are your brother's medical records?
I said we were treating him.
You'd still require his signature.
And a written request from his attending physician
which in this case was...
You forged my name, too?
Do you know how much
trouble we could get into for this?
Just read it.
No. I have no right to read this
and neither do you.
Okay. He took a leave of absence for post traumatic stress
following a near-miss incident.
Yeah, so? He's an air traffic controller;
it's a stressful job.
He had therapy, but was never medicated.
Probably no reason to.
Just a reaction to the event.
Okay, what if it isn't PTSD?
What if it was depression?
The initial presentation of a bipolar disorder?
He's too old.
He's not, he's under 30.
Well, then he'd be
at the far end of the curve.
He's been suffering from insomnia, lack of appetite...
Both of which are consistent with PTSD.
Okay. Six months ago, he was depressed
now he's cycling up to a manic phase.
The timing is perfect.
I know this.
Well, then, why didn't the Air Force catch it?
Because they're not looking for it.
Look: "No family history of psychiatric disorders."
He's lying to the doctors.
Like you did to get those records.
( sighs )
Oh, I thought this was a surgical consult.
It was.
What happened?
The fat lady sang.
Fat man in this case.
We did everything but order him a deep-dish pizza.
MALIK: Just say no to drugs
and double bacon cheeseburgers.
You know, his size is probably something
that he couldn't control.
Certainly not if he was running downhill.
( Malik chuckles )
Nathan, we didn't mean to offend you.
You didn't.
I'm sorry, I'm having a really bad day.
Not as bad as him.
What the hell is that? I don't know.
You can't drive on here, you idiot.
Which one of you is Dr. Abrams?
I'm Abrams.
You need to come with me now.
I've got a 14-year-old boy with a ruptured globe
who may lose his eyesight
because you didn't answer your page.
You're insane.
Get in the car.
Get out of here.
Get in the car, now.
You don't have to listen to this guy, Vic.
Are you a doctor?
I'm an oral surgeon.
Then shut up! Let's go!
What about my clubs?
You, take his clubs.
You're doing a good job clearing patients today.
Easy to be fast when you're just killing them.
I'm going to be taking some time off.
Yeah? For what?
Uh, to deal with some personal things
that I've been putting off for a while.
And with Romano out of commission
you'll probably be the one forced to pick up the slack.
Bad idea.
Do you mind?
We're having a conversation here.
I don't mind.
Well, I do. I mind.
I mind your insinuations and your smart-ass comments.
This is an E.R.; people come here because it's an emergency.
And guess what? Some of these people are going to die.
I've saved hundreds of lives.
Dr. Lewis... Yeah.
You know that drunk you intubated this morning?
( sighing ): Yeah?
Well, he asked to take his tube out.
Chuny, he can't talk if he's intubated.
I think you better come.
He's going to vomit and aspirate. Ah, geez.
( hushed ): 20 bucks says she kills this guy, too.
Frank, did my brother call?
Nope.
Are you sure?
Let me double check. Nope.
CARTER: Hey, Abby.
Tell Abby what you just told me.
An unauthorized absence can be a serious offense.
But if it's a first offense
and you can prove extenuating circumstances
then you can usually get off
with a minimum of punishment.
That's good to know. Thanks.
Do you have a minute?
Yeah.
Your girlfriend Harkins was looking for you.
( chuckles )
Um, why are you talking about my brother
to med students?
Gallant's in the Army.
So?
So I'm just trying to get information.
I thought it might help.
Yeah, well, you didn't have to say it was my brother.
Excuse me, Carter.
This is Mr. and Mrs. Yeung.
Their child was brought in. Which one?
The three-year-old, he was brought in with your patient.
Oh, I... I'm sorry, I thought she was the mother.
No, Tong-yi's our nanny. I'm Aidan's mother.
Is our son okay?
Yeah, he's fine.
Chuny, you can take Mrs. Yeung to see her son.
Sure, this way.
Sir, if I could just ask you a couple of questions first.
Yeah... okay.
Um... is Tong-yi a drug user?
No.
Has she been depressed?
No.
Can you think of any reason why she would want to hurt herself?
She wouldn't do that.
She tested positive for barbiturates and alcohol.
Well, she's been up all week with Aidan.
He had an earache.
She might've taken a couple of sleeping pills
maybe a glass of wine.
But she is not suicidal.
Does she have a boyfriend?
I don't think so.
Why?
I just... I don't know, maybe she's got some problems
in her personal life.
Well, if she did, we'd probably know.
She lives with us.
Has been for four years now.
Ah.
Can I see her?
You wanted to see me?
Did you review Zollinger?
Was I supposed to?
He's under, Dr. Corday.
Thanks, Shirley.
We're really going to do a Whipple on this guy?
He's a little old, isn't he?
I thought you didn't want to do this.
I didn't, but thanks to you
Mr. Seaton and his family seem to think
the operation is worth the risk.
Of course, they may have second thoughts
after we resect his pancreas, duodenum, gallbladder
and a large portion of his stomach.
He's got a daughter and grandchildren.
Any extra time he gets, he can spend with them.
He can get up to a year from this.
Perhaps.
If it comes with a small miracle
which may be in order, seeing as you seem to have become
the patron saint of the terminally ill.
Are you prepared to assist?
Really?
You got us into this.
CARTER: We're still running some tests.
Okay, Sonosite is ready.
I need both trauma rooms.
Double MVA en route, auto versus motorcycle.
Can I take these two?
Yeah.
Grab trauma gowns and gloves. Come on.
Can we take her home?
She should stay overnight
for observation.
In that case
I'd like to have her moved to a private facility.
Did you ask her why she did it?
( speaking Chinese )
( speaking Chinese )
( speaking Chinese )
She's not depressed.
It was an accident.
She had taken a couple of sleeping pills
with a glass of wine to help her sleep.
And she's sorry to have caused you any trouble.
She said all that?
Yes.
Suction here, so I can see the field.
Are you okay?
I've been up for 24 hours.
It throws off my meds.
Does it usually bleed this much?
There are numerous branches
off the superior mesenteric artery.
Hemostat.
Do we tie off or bovie?
( alarms sound )
Pressure's down to 90/60.
Okay. Bolus a liter and check a crit.
Like this?
You need to isolate the source of the bleeding.
Come on, Nathan.
I need better exposure.
Wait, stop, stop.
You're up against the portal vein.
Pull out before you tear the wall and kill him.
Shirley, can you take over, please?
No, just tell me what to do. I'll do it.
I'm trying.
Shirley, suction.
( metal crashing )
What was that?
T-tube for the common bile duct.
Do you have another tray?
We can autoclave this one.
I don't have 30 minutes
to stand around waiting for this.
Tell me what you want me to do.
Nothing. Shirley
pick up the instruments, get them resterilized.
This will pass in about an hour.
Carl Vanosh, 32, motorcycle driver
versus stakebed truck.
Had to be extracted.
Unable to breathe for three to four minutes.
He's purple. Violaceous discoloration.
Classic traumatic asphyxia.
I'll meet you inside.
This the driver of the truck?
No. Motorcycle passenger.
Quinn Vanosh, 11.
BP falling after two liters. 90/60.
Nobody told me they were bringing in a kid.
He's tachy to the mid 120's.
We were going to tube him, but we were almost here.
Go get one of the attendings.
Which one? I don't care. Anyone.
Who's that?
I thought you were treating her.
I am.
Dr. Chen is translating for me.
I should be doing that.
Oh, that's okay.
We're a full service facility.
Excuse me.
( speaking Chinese )
Um...
( speaking Chinese )
Hmm. She didn't know she was pregnant.
Did she say who the father is?
No.
Ask her if she's sleeping with her boss.
What? Ask her if she's sleeping with him.
( speaking Chinese )
( speaking Chinese )
CBC and plates, crit times three.
Chem seven, urine and foley.
He's got Tardieu's spots.
Tardieu?
Facial petechiae.
What fell on him? A truck.
LEWIS: Kerry, we need help in here.
He's got crepitus over the left chest.
His pelvis is tender. Sats 93.
It hurts to breathe.
Kerry, I need help in here.
VANOSH: Quinn? What's wrong?
GALLANT: Left breath sounds decreased with right tracheal shift.
( alarms ) Sux and fent are in.
Sats are still 90.
He needs a central line
and probably a chest tube.
You're doing fine, Susan.
Just take a deep breath.
It's decreased on the right.
I think he's got tension pneumos on both sides.
What's wrong with my son?
We're working on him. Malik.
HARKINS: What do you want me to do?
Bag him up.
HARKINS: Ectopy.
Okay, don't do this to me, kid.
Oh.
( speaking Chinese )
Your wife seems upset.
She's worried about Aidan and, uh, Tong-yi.
That's all.
Oh, our doctor's coming to move her to another facility.
Hey, what was your relationship
with Tong-yi again?
I told you.
She works for us.
Right, she's lived with you for four years?
Have you been sleeping with her?
Excuse me?
Have you been having sex with her?
'Cause she's pregnant.
She says the baby's yours.
Even if that were true, Doctor
it's really none of your business.
No, it is my business.
It was my business the minute
she became my patient.
Well, she won't be your patient much longer.
Hey, Carter.
Eric, where have you been?
Everybody's been worried about you.
Oh! Come inside.
Oh, Jody was driving me nuts.
Nothing like a road trip to bring out a person's issues.
Please limit your personal baggage
to two carry-on items.
She must have peed 1,000 times
between here and Indianapolis.
She's worse than a beagle.
She's probably got a bladder thing happening. I don't know.
Wait a second. I thought you guys flew.
Oh, we were until she got airsick.
Airsick, carsick, homesick.
The girl gets sick a lot
which supposedly runs in her family.
Don't get me started on her parents.
Let's just face it.
If she turns out to be anything like her mother
she's going to be too much woman for me to handle
and I don't mean to be mean, but she's big
like sumo big, minus the agility.
I'll come upstairs later to see how you're doing.
Will you still talk to my dad?
I'll do even better.
I'll convince him you're a hero.
You know, the in-house team could have done this.
You are the retinal specialist.
According to the CT
the other eye has a pellet in it, too.
Now, I can't even promise
I'll be able to save his sight in that eye.
Then perhaps if you had come here sooner.
Ophthalmology isn't emergency medicine.
You know, some guys wait a week
to do this kind of surgery.
You know, all you did was stop me from shooting an 82.
Tell it to him.
LOCKHART: Luka.
Dr. Lewis needs you in Trauma One.
Oh, thanks.
ERIC: Hey, Abby.
So, I'm in a position where I can buy the Cessna
or two planes that need some fixing up for the same price.
I'll be at Admit if you need me.
( clears throat )
I've been calling you.
So I hear.
I'm sorry Jody dragged you into this.
She's immature. She likes the drama.
What can I say? It's the Jerry Springer
generation, you know.
You were supposed to be
Did they call here? Uh, no.
That's the second time this year somebody's messed up my leave.
I can straighten it out with a phone call
but I'll have to report for duty on Monday.
We should do something crazy.
Do you guys want to go somewhere?
How about you, me and Carter fly to Vegas, huh?
We could do a little gambling.
Maybe hit an Elvis wedding chapel.
You guys could take care of business.
You may now kiss the bride.
Shh, shh. Thank you very much.
Eric, just come here. Just stop it.
They said you're suffering
from post traumatic Stress?
That was nothing. They cleared me.
Every controller I know has had a couple PTSD assessments.
It's our way of working the system
to get a little extra time off.
We even joke about it.
How do you know when an air traffic controller is suffering
from post traumatic stress?
Eric. His tackle box is missing.
You know, he's gone fishing.
But I hate going fishing. I mean, I...
Remember when I got that... that hook stuck in my finger?
Do you remember that? It was a frog lure.
I got your medical records.
What?
You didn't tell them Maggie was bipolar.
Oh, you did what?
What are you, the KGB?
No, I just...
Sergeant Eric Wyczenski.
You called the MPs?
No. No. Why did you do this?
You're under arrest for unauthorized absence
from the United States
Air Force.
Hold on a second, guys.
Somebody was supposed to cover for me
and he got in a bad accident.
I was on the road.
I didn't find out until now.
I-I called my CO.
I'm headed back to base now.
I came here to tell my sister.
They called here looking
for me and freaked her out.
It's been a huge mix-up.
Abby, tell them what's going on.
We'll figure that out on the way back.
Hold on. That is very unnecessary.
Let me get my stuff out of my car!
Stop! Let me get my stuff.
Don't hurt him.
Listen... let me go.
I can explain everything.
Okay? Just... I need to go!
Seriously.
I can't be arrested.
I've got a job to do.
Can't we talk about this
or at least let me give him
something to calm him down.
We can't do that, ma'am.
Is this what you wanted, Abby?
No, no. Are you happy now?
Yeah, that's right.
Lock me up and throw away the key.
Eric's been a bad boy.
Thanks a lot, Abby. Thank you.
Suction.
Oh, damn it.
Bag him. Was he ever awake?
He was for a few minutes.
He wasn't mentating well.
He's stage four shock, non-responder.
Both lungs are up.
Breath sounds with bagging.
Third unit of O-neg.
You want to try this?
No, you got it.
Stabilize the neck.
I'll do a cricoid.
Damn. Suction.
He's so small.
Short chin.
Anterior too.
Not your lucky day, huh?
( alarm sounds )
Sat 88, pulse down to 90.
You need help in here? No.
Yes. Suction.
He'll need another central line
for pressors.
What do you see?
I can't see squat.
Okay, let's take a break.
No.
Tube, now.
Bradying down to 80.
Cords.
Got it.
Bag him.
CHEN: Good job.
All right. You got this?
What?
Where are you going?
I have other patients.
Susan, you're not finished here.
He's in good hands.
What's happening?
We put him on a vent and he dropped his pressure.
Good lung sounds.
Give me a spinal needle.
Lost the pulse. Starting compressions.
Betadine. Tamponade?
Could be a tension pneumo.
Breath sounds could be transmitted.
Sats are dropping.
CHEN: Could be hypovolemic.
Try the other side.
No.
Milligram of epi.
Good pulse with compressions.
Thoracotomy tray.
Holding CPR.
Looks like PEA.
Betadine the chest.
Trendelenberg and roll him left side up.
Blunt force trauma, Luka. It's over.
Mediastinal air after intubation.
Blade.
No pressure, no pulse.
What is he doing?
Spreader.
Opening the chest cavity.
Pericardium looks clear.
Quiet.
( squeaking )
Okay, bag him a couple of times fast.
( squeaking ) Hear it?
Hilar leak.
Clamp.
Bag.
How long?
Almost a minute.
Again.
Got it.
Cross clamp.
Can you get me a 50cc syringe
with an 18-gauge needle?
Okay...
pressure's going up-- 50's.
Evacuating the air.
That's why he couldn't pump blood.
CHEN: Weak pulse.
Got a pulse.
Wow...
So you can stay here
you can be safe here.
Can you explain the concept of a woman's shelter?
Um...
( speaking Chinese )
( speaking Chinese )
What is she so afraid of?
Living in poverty, deportation...
Take your pick.
It's called "trafficking in persons."
You know, young women are brought over
from some foreign country
they get offered jobs
and wind up as indentured servants.
I can't leave my baby.
Uh, you don't have to.
This is... this is your baby.
Nobody's going to take your baby.
Not this baby.
Aidan.
The three-year-old?
Is Aidan your son, too?
Yes.
Okay, Kit, let's try a t-piece trial.
NATHAN: Normally we would have extubated
in the OR, right?
CORDAY: Normally.
No chest wall excursions.
Stats are going down to 89.
Why isn't he breathing on his own?
AC of 14.
I'll go talk with the family.
No. I'm afraid I get to do that.
I knew something was wrong, I knew it.
I told you.
It's going to be okay.
No, it's not. Don't say that.
He's sick.
I don't even know where they took him
and the Air Force is not like the police.
I can't just go there and bail him out.
I don't even know who to call.
( sighs )
And what if they put him in some VA loony bin?
That's not going to happen.
How do you know?
'Cause we'll get him a good lawyer.
We'll help him through this.
Why don't you go home?
I'll get somebody to cover your shift.
I can't.
Go home.
Get some rest. Call me if you need me.
Hey, I thought you'd left.
How's that kid?
He had a Hilar leak.
Kovac had to crack his chest.
Pedes surg is with him now.
It looks like he's going to pull through.
( sighs )
You would have done the same.
Kerry, I killed three patients today.
It would have been four
if I would have stayed with that kid.
No, you were unable to save three patients.
You didn't kill them.
I mean, I've seen you save twice that many
without breaking a sweat.
Go home.
Have a drink
maybe two.
Tomorrow's another day.
But if you lose more than one patient
you're fired.
Thanks.
Hey. Hello.
How you doing?
Good, good.
Did you?
No.
Are you going to?
No, you can.
No, you should.
Come on.
Okay.
Susan, um...
we're going to have a baby.
What?!
You're pregnant? No.
Uh, I am.
Oh, my God.
Kerry...
Congratulations.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
CARTER: Tong-yi, where you going?
She's going home.
I'm not talking to you, you step back.
This is between me and my patient.
She signed out against medical advice.
All right, Deb, call the police.
Don't bother. She won't press charges.
We have laws
against slavery in this country.
Tong-yi, you don't have to do this.
( speaking Chinese )
I'll bring the car around.
( speaking Chinese )
All right, don't do this, Tong-yi.
It's wrong. It's wrong.
I need my job.
I have family in China, they need my money.
We can help you find another job.
I can't leave my baby.
If you go back there
they're going to take your baby
just like they did with Aidan.
I spend more time with him than they do.
You should, he's your son.
Does he even know that you're his mother?
He doesn't.
But I do.
How's Mr. Seaton?
He's still on the vent.
When you first came to me, you requested
that I treat you like any other medical student
on my rotation.
And I appreciate it.
I know your disease
presents you with innumerable challenges
and the very fact that you're standing here
is testimony to your character.
But the truth is I would fail
any other student with a similar performance.
I realize I have to make certain adjustments
to accommodate my disease.
No. No.
Political correctness aside
you are physically handicapped
and I would be doing a disservice
to your future patients.
So that's it?
What's the appeal process?
A promise.
I will pass you
if you do not practice clinical medicine.
You can do radiology, psychiatry
but you must give me your word
that you will never treat patients.
No.
I can't do that.
Then you will fail, Mr. Nathan.
( sighs )
Is someone sitting here?
No, no.
You look like you've had one of those days.
Yeah, you could say that.
What do you do?
I'm a jockey.
Ah, he has a sense of humor.
Not really.
It's pretty dead in here tonight.
That's the way I like it.
I don't believe that for a second.
You look like you know how to have fun.
You think so, huh?
Yeah.
( cell phone ringing )
Excuse me.
Hello?
No, I can't talk to you right now.
Yes, he came to see me.
Yeah, I think you need to stop calling me, okay?
Sorry about that.
( phone ringing )
Why don't we, um... get out of here
and see what kind of trouble we can get into?
Where would we go?
I'll leave that up to you.
Okay, I think I know a place.
It's 300 an hour.
2,000 for the night.
( chuckles )
You coming?
Hey.
I've been calling you.
I was on the phone.
Did you reach him?
Might have to wait till morning.
Well, I got some
fish and chips from Brennan's.
I'm not hungry.
I bought it on the way home from work.
It took me an hour to get it out of the bag
and then another 45 minutes to pour it in the glass
and I still haven't had a sip.
I just want everything to stop, you know?
I just want to stop thinking...
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
I'm so glad you're home.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I wanted you to be wrong.
For both of you.
My family's so screwed up.
If I were you
I'd run for my life and never look back.
You don't hold the monopoly on screwed-up families.
You met my mother.
She's not certifiable.
I have an idea.
I think we should get them all together for the holidays.
Gamma, my parents, your mother...
I'm really scared for him, Carter.
I know.
And it's so unfair.
'Cause he was such a good kid.
And we went through so much growing up
and I really thought I got him through.
I thought... he was safe.
He's going to get all the help that he needs now.
We're going to make sure that he does.
And nothing that you did or didn't do
would have prevented this.
It's just that Eric...
uh, he was the only constant thing in my life.
He was the only thing I could ever really count on.
That's not true anymore.
Promise?
'Cause I really need something to hang on to right now.
I'm not going anywhere.
