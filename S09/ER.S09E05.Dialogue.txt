Previously on ER:
When you're waiting on a patient's results
it's not necessary for you to boff
that patient's mother in the storage closet.
I'm so sorry, Robert.
About my arm, or about my being there?
A memo from Weaver.
I've made Abby the new nurse manager.
The job is yours, like it or not.
"Like it or not"?
I don't care to argue about it.
Duroziez's sign is a to and fro murmur
when the stethoscope is placed
over the femoral artery.
What's another peripheral sign of aortic insufficiency?
Weak pulse. No.
Poor cap refill. No.
Those are both signs of shock.
It begins with "Q." Anyone?
DeQuervain's.
No, that begins with a "D"
although there is a "Q" in it
so, you're getting warmer.
Does Quinkie's sign ring any bells?
And it manifests itself how?
With a visible... puh...
Pulsation.
Correct. Where?
On the... nnn...
Neck.
Navel?
Nail bed.
Good night.
Go home.
Rounds start
at 7:00 a.m.
Be sure to read Sabiston's chapter
on the acute abdomen.
So much for the future of medicine.
Jacy, would you be sure to ring Mr. Ingles?
Remind him not to eat anything after midnight.
I don't want to have to reschedule his hernia yet again.
I'm going trick-or-treating.
Oh, what's Ella this year?
A cow.
Wasn't she a cow last year?
No, last year she was Dorothy, I was the Cowardly Lion, Mark...
Mark was the Scarecrow.
Right.
I get to be a farmer this year.
Happy Halloween.
Dr. Corday. Yeah.
Your med student called-- Nathan.
What, the one who didn't bother to show up today?
He said he'd be here in a few minutes to speak with you.
Well, it's too late.
Dr. Romano would also like to talk with you before you leave.
Tell him you couldn't find me.
ROMANO: I heard that!
FRANK: What the hell are you supposed to be?
Hey, you want a candy, little fella?
FRANK: Put some meat on those bones.
Hey. Hi.
I thought everybody was getting dressed up today.
We were supposed to; there was a memo.
I didn't bring anything to change into.
Neither did I.
Yeah, but you're still a nurse.
You should have called me.
What, and then I would be the only one in costume?
I don't think so.
Frank, where's your costume?
I don't observe pagan holidays
that celebrate devil worship.
Well, this is only for Satanists.
It's kind of working for you.
( chuckling ): Shut up.
If you give me an order and I think it's wrong
I'm going to ask you to clarify it.
Not in front of the patients.
I only questioned the dosage.
You've made mistakes in the past.
I have not.
CARTER: Is there a problem here?
Yeah, you've got no guts.
I'm not working with him.
Why?
Because he treats nurses like idiots.
KOVAC: If your boots fit...
Shoes.
Whatever.
Are you wearing that for your shift?
Yes. It's Halloween.
You know, Jerry sent out a memo.
Ooh, Naughty Nurse.
Not a Naughty Nurse.
I like it.
It's an old- fashioned nurse.
Looks naughty to me.
So, you're what, like a kurva nurse?
What's that?
How do you say, a slut?
You know, like a tramp, a whore...
Yeah, I got it.
You know, maybe I should have worn
that schoolgirl outfit you bought me.
( chuckling )
She's making a joke.
Cautery.
Robert, what are you doing?
A laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
But you can't be.
I had no choice.
This poor swine is full of stones.
Oh, for heaven's sake.
I hope you're not expecting me to scrub in.
No, just giving my right hand a workout.
It's been five months.
I got to keep my skills up.
Stapler. Though, even with one arm
I'm a better surgeon than the rest of the hacks
in this hospital.
Robert, you're not cleared to do surgery
even on barn animals.
Were you aware that Weaver put through a proposal
to hire P.A.s to cover
afternoon rounds
Yes; I thought it was a very good idea.
That's not the point.
The point is, nobody talked to me about it
and last time I checked, I was still head
of both surgery and this hospital.
The Residency Review Committee...
Oh, sweet Mary and Joseph
will you look at the size
of that gallbladder?!
Look, I know Weaver's been forming alliances
with some of the tribal elders while I was recuperating
but I would have expected a little more loyalty from you, Lizzie.
Just rewrite the proposal as if it were generated from us
and keep me abreast of any other covert Weaver ops, okay?
The last thing I need is Mata Hari
leading a palace coup.
What the hell?!
He's extubated.
Get him back under!
100 of brevitol!
Hold him down! Lizzie, hold him down!
Bloody hell!
He's a pig!
90 degrees-- that's good.
It's not my elbow I'm worried about.
What the hell is going on down there? Brenda!
All right, the wrist.
And flex.
Keep going.
A little bit more.
Ten degrees.
Wrong.
Check it again.
Ten.
It was 15 last week.
Fluctuations are normal, Robert.
With this type of injury
you've got to give yourself
at least nine months.
How does this affect my odds?
You've still got a long way to go.
Yeah, I know. The odds.
For full flexion, extension
and opposition of the digits-- 20%.
But even then, without radial and ulnar deviation
of the thumb, I'm not sure you'll be able to operate.
But you can still be Chief of Staff.
Most of your job is administrative anyway.
Thanks for the pep talk there, Marty.
( door shuts )
Excuse me.
I'm looking for Dr. Corday.
ROMANO: Aren't we all?
Are you a bill collector or a suitor?
Med student.
You must be a slow learner.
It's a career change.
Cowboy and fireman didn't work out, huh?
I'm supposed to start my surgical rotation today.
I'm Paul Nathan.
Dr. Romano.
What happened?
Tennis elbow. Ah.
HARMS: Jane Doe, 80% surface area.
Gave ten of morphine I.M.
How you doing?
Not... good.
What's your name? Amy.
Last name? There was a fire
at the party downstairs.
What's your last name?
Was anybody with her?
Hard to say.
There was a lot of confusion.
LOCKHART: Soot in the nostrils and intraoral burns.
I'm going to need an intubation tray.
Get Corday on that crushed pelvis.
Excuse me. Not right now.
Ed Jemena, 35.
Full thickness burns to the hands and forearms.
This guy was on fire.
I tried to put him out
but I didn't have anything to use but my hands.
Luka, can you get this?
Yeah. What's open?
Curtain two.
I need a trauma room.
You're lucky to get a bed.
Okay, yes?
Oh, Paul Nathan.
Radiology? No, um, surgery.
Resident? Med student.
Okay, good enough.
Cellulitis to the leg after a bug bite to the ankle.
What do I do?
Nice catch.
Whoa, we're full in here.
What do you have?
Doctor, excuse me!
You all need to stay in your assigned spots.
If a doctor or a nurse can't find you
it's going to cause a delay in your treatment.
Doctor, Doctor, can you tell me what's happened to my things?
My apartment's on the fourth floor.
I'll see what I can find out for you.
And the fire was on two.
Will they let us go home?
Check with the fire department.
Did they say how it started?
I'm sorry, I don't know.
Carter, we need you!
The fruits upstairs were smoking dope, that's what.
No one was smoking anything, all right?
What's that for?
It's to keep an eye on the infection.
And what are they giving him to stop it?
Uh, excuse me. Unasyn.
And that will get rid of the infection?
Well, it should.
It's an antibiotic.
Hey, are you a doctor? Med student.
I need that mayo stand.
Put it under his arm.
Got this?
I'm supposed to be... Good.
What are you going to do?
We're going to make you better.
Why can't I feel my hands?
Uh, the burns have damaged your nerves.
Is it permanent?
I don't know.
Where's Terry?
Who's Terry?
My partner.
He's dressed like a jungle girl.
Etomidate's on board.
I need to see Terry.
Trauma panel, ABG and carboxyhemoglobin.
Prime a line of ringers.
What is this?
CORDAY: Rubber mask melted to the face.
I can barely open the mouth.
Better try fiberoptic. Got the subclavian.
I thought you left, Lizzie. Me, too.
I'm supposed to be trick-or-treating.
A little old for that, don't you think?
Open a crike tray just in case.
Guide wire's passing well.
Preload an eight- oh tube on a scope.
Pulse ox down to 85.
15 blade.
JARVIK: I need a different light source.
Don't open the tray unless the intubation fails.
We don't want this... oh!
I'm sorry, sorry.
Got the line.
Run the first liter wide open.
Robert, are you okay?
Oh silk, neosporin
and opsite. Robert?
I'm okay.
Keep bagging on 15 liters.
Get the sats above 90.
If you've got this, Lizzie
I'm going to go check on the rest of the kids.
CHEN: Take slow, deep breaths.
MAN: I'm trying.
CHEN: Have you ever had asthma?
No.
What's this?
Smoke inhalation with wheezing.
Increased breath sounds?
On the right; possible pneumothorax.
May need a chest tube.
Vitals?
I've got it.
Yeah, I'm sure you do.
Get a chest x ray and show it to me.
Digital escarotomy.
Yeah. He needs the same on the left.
I agree.
How old do you think she is?
Uh...
Young.
Hey, Dr. Corday?
Yeah? What have you got?
Urine 60 an hour, but it's bloody.
80% burns, she's going to need 12 liters
in the first eight hours.
Okay, send her for C.T. abdomen and pelvis.
I still need to do an airway.
Dr. Corday?
Yes?
Oh, uh, I'm Paul Nathan.
I was supposed to begin
my surgical rotation with you today.
Yes, you were.
She's got a critical patient next door.
Oh. Where should I put these?
Here. Put them right there.
CARTER: No free fluid.
Liver and spleen look okay.
Scope is prepped.
Standing by with the number five shiley.
Rounds started at 7:00 A.M.
I know; I was...
Not interested in excuses, thank you.
Did you get my letter?
Dr. Corday, your nanny is on the phone.
For God's sake, Frank, take a look around.
Take a message.
She said to remind you
she has a flight to catch at 10:30.
Well, I can't leave now, can I?
What do you want me to tell her?
Tell her to bring Ella here.
Day care's closed, you know.
I know.
Pulse ox 81.
He's throwing P.V.C.s.
We should crike him.
Is there anything I can do?
Yes. Be quiet.
Okay, bag him.
You really want to make up for it
go out there and work up some patients.
Yeah, but shouldn't I...?
You want to be a doctor?
Yes, but... Then grab a patient
WOMAN: I told Martin 100 times
you need to put new batteries in the smoke detector.
No, no.
God forbid he should spend $3 on a nine-volt.
The whole building could have burned down.
Um, his x rays are back.
Oh, okay, good.
How's he doing?
Better than most by the looks of things.
Yeah.
Okay, next time I go hiking
I'm wearing long pants.
And bug repellent.
Your infection's spreading.
Uh, is everything okay?
I'll be right back.
Excuse me, you're a surgeon?
That's the rumor.
Uh, I think there's something here you should see.
You're a student-- you haven't learned to think yet.
I've got a rapidly spreading cellulitis.
Excuse me.
How rapid?
Well, I just drew this 20 minutes ago.
( whistles )
And look.
This looks like sub-q air
consistent with neck fash.
Yeah, nice catch. Let's roll.
We got to take your boyfriend upstairs.
Upstairs? Yeah, to surgery.
What's he on? Three grams of Unasyn.
Okay, switch it
to six million units of Pen G and 900 of clinda.
Where's he going?
Newbie caught a neck fash.
What? What's that mean?
Your boyfriend may have
what we call necrotizing fasciitis.
It's a virulent skin infection.
But they gave him antibiotics.
The infection's spreading too fast.
So, what are you going to do?
We're going to take you up to the O.R.
and remove the infected tissue.
What?
All right, everybody off the elevator!
Take the stairs; you'll live longer.
If we don't stop this
it will continue to move along
and you will develop an overwhelming infection
which will lower your blood pressure.
You could die.
Oh, my God.
Think I caught that in time?
I hope so.
Thank you.
I'm Susan Lewis.
Paul Nathan.
You coming?
In a minute, yeah. You okay?
Yeah, it's just
it takes me a moment to get going sometimes.
Uh... I have Parkinson's Disease.
I'll be up in five minutes, Robert.
You said that ten minutes ago!
I'm with a critical patient.
Find somebody else now, Lizzie!
Good E.T. placement. No infiltrates.
Check ABG, repeat CBC, and work on a burn unit bed.
What about him?
Who? Him.
Yeah, what about him?
Pardon me.
I found his CPK, lytes and UA results.
You headed up to surgery on the "neck fash"?
Yes, as a matter of fact.
Okay, well... I guess we're done here.
I am. You still owe eight hours.
I'm on rounds at 6:00 a.m.
Welcome to surgery.
( grunts )
Excuse me.
Uh, where can I find somebody who was brought in?
Admit.
Come here. Follow me.
Who you looking for?
Wynn Mathison. He's in a tiger costume.
There was a fire... Excuse me, could you please direct me
to the victims of the fire?
Keep your habit on, my man.
Excuse me?
Dr. Pratt? You'll get to be
with your drag queen friends soon enough.
I have food and housing vouchers for the displaced.
Oh, I-I'm sorry, Sister.
Can someone please tell me what room he's in?
Dr. Pratt? What?
He's with the guy in the tiger suit.
( sighs )
Can we get some oil of wintergreen in here?
I hate the smell of rotting flesh. Suction.
Especially when it's increasing by the minute.
Come on, that bacteria's moving faster than you are, Edson.
Bovie. Systolic's down to 95.
Bolus 500. Lap pad.
Still not bleeding. Myonecrosis.
Yeah, it's in the muscle.
Ten blade.
Okay, if it's vascularized, don't cut it.
That's my plan.
Start there and carry the incision
four centimeters inferior.
No, that's eight. Damn it!
We need clean borders.
Where the hell is Corday?
She's in the scrub room.
If I don't remove enough tissue
the infection could be left to smolder inside.
Get her the hell in here!
Maybe she can debride this guy's wound without using a chainsaw.
Hey!
Chris, it's me, Elizabeth.
Listen, you needn't come here.
I shouldn't be longer than an hour.
Dr. Corday, he's asking for you.
Be right there.
to finish packing?
Yeah, I could pick you both up after work.
I could drive you to the airport--
save you the cost of cab fare.
Yeah. Okay. Thank you. Thank you so much.
Yeah, I'll see you soon.
Corazon, uh, would you mind taking the phone?
Not at all.
( metal clinking )
Oh...
Damn.
Was that your wedding ring?
Yep. Yep.
I can't see it.
Can you call Engineering?
They're closed till morning.
I'm sorry.
It's not your fault.
Don't hate me. He wants to talk.
Lizzie, get your ass in here!
I've lost my wedding ring.
Oh, boo-hoo, this guy's about to lose a leg!
I'd say chop-chop, but that would be in extremely bad taste.
Can you call someone
get them to tape this off for me?
Make sure no more water is run down it?
Sure.
Would somebody please call
Tiffany's Search and Rescue Team?!
I'm coming!
He's got 20% surface area burns, mainly upper body.
Oh, God.
Decent prognosis.
We provide ventilatory support
until the lungs heal.
Then we extubate him.
Might take a week, maybe less.
What-what about his face?
He'll need skin grafts.
There'll definitely be some scarring.
( sobbing )
Wynn. Wynn, it's me, Terry.
I'm right here.
He can't hear you. He's sedated.
You should probably have your eye looked at.
Later, okay?
Can I touch him?
I wouldn't.
Yo, newbie. Come on.
Check jungle perv's eye with the slit-lamp.
He may have a corneal burn.
Where's that?
You still here?
Yeah, uh, slit-lamp. Where is it?
How does it work?
Exam Three. Try the on/off switch.
Hey, hey.
You changed.
What? I just put on some scrub pants.
Oh, come on.
You know, Carter
my outfit is really starting to bug me, too.
But we agreed to stay in costume the entire shift.
Yeah, I am.
No, you're not.
It's half a costume.
It's always, like, 50% commitment.
Are you serious or you kidding?
Do you even know what I've been dealing with down here?
Look, me, too. In pumps.
Want to see the whole costume?
No. Here's the whole costume.
Forget it.
I'm a skeleton! Look at me! ( growling )
Carter really likes Halloween, huh?
Perpetual erection.
Accidentally drank his daughter's mandrake smoothie.
Police found him chasing women down the street.
Where do you want him? In a cold shower.
Curtain Three's open.
Okay, get a line in
and push four of Ativan.
Are you open, baby?
( lecherous laughter )
Perfect.
Whoo! ( laughing )
First day labs, charcoal and a Foley for the tox screen.
Release me! I'm the Marquis De Sade!
How am I supposed to pass a catheter through that?
Inject phenylephrine.
Into the shaft?
I'm Rod Stewart!
He won't hold still long enough for a blood draw
much less let me touch his penis.
Oh, she can touch it!
Or we can wait for the mandrake to metabolize.
Why not just give him Haldol, make it easier on everybody?
It might make his symptoms worse.
Hey! Hey, hey.
He just grabbed my ass.
Well, I couldn't reach hers.
I said four of Ativan.
Ask Abby. I'm done.
Okay, you could be a little bit more sensitive.
To what?
( laughing )
* Choo-choo-choo, choo, choo *
* Choo-choo, choo-choo-choo-choo... *
CORDAY: It's amazing how quickly this spreads.
EDSON: Any idea how he got it?
A cut, a scratch, some other trivial injury.
Dopamine's at ten mikes.
Need more suction.
Scalpel.
Easy, Lizzie.
Is it just me, or is this constant commentary
rather distracting?
It's not you.
Just remove the infected tissue and let antibiotics
and Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy do the rest.
You're not serious.
Hell, yes, I am serious.
I'm already into the posterior compartment.
It's still necrotic soup.
Six hours in the chamber
will increase his oxygen saturation
create a bacteriocidal effect...
Robert... ...and give this guy a chance of a functioning leg.
Do you two have a problem with that?
How's a guy with Parkinson's get into med school?
Probably some kind of disability quota
they have to fill.
Forget med school.
How's he expect to practice?
Wouldn't want him taking out my appendix.
He seems to have it under control.
You know, it's a progressive disease.
What's he going to be like in ten years?
Could be dead.
Or want to be.
Happy Abby, always looking on the bright side.
Dr. Weaver, I thought you were out sick.
I was until an apartment fire set us back 30 patients.
PRATT: 35, if you count the bad popcorn balls.
Oh, wonderful.
Thanks for coming in, Kerry.
Yeah, I shouldn't have answered my phone.
Want your messages? No!
I want the air conditioning on!
I'm sweating like a pig!
It's freezing in here.
That's what you get for bringing Weaver in on Halloween.
It's the biggest holiday of the year for her kind.
Lesbians? Wiccan.
She's probably riding that crutch around like a broom.
Oh, come on, Frank.
All women get like that when they're going through the change.
Pratt!
What? She's having hot flashes.
She's moody...
That is so sexist.
And stupid. She's too young.
Early onset.
You've got early onset.
Whatever you say, Nasty Ratched.
( sighs )
It's nurse, okay?
Not Nasty, not Naughty, not Wet, certainly not Head.
Just nurse. ( laughs )
Abby, you're going to talk to Kovac, right?
Yes.
County General on Bravo One.
I finished with the slit-lamp.
I numbed him with alcaine.
Who are you?
Meet Nathan--
our newest oldest med student.
I'm on surgical rotations
with Dr. Corday.
We have to clear trauma. BOA with newborn hypoxia.
She asked that I stay and assist in any...
Good. Follow me.
Don't worry. She doesn't bite.
Much.
Simone Phipps, 42.
Had a home birth, newborn in respiratory distress.
WEAVER: Simone, did you have
a difficult or complicated labor?
No, it went well. I didn't even tear.
One minute Apgar with seven, but he had a little...
Who are you? I'm the midwife.
What's wrong with him?
We're going to find out, all right?
Take him to Trauma One.
Wh-Where is that?
LOCKHART: I'll take him.
No, I... it's okay. I got it, I got it.
I got it.
Simone, you've lost a lot of blood.
Something's wrong with my baby, I know it.
Lily, stirrups. Gallant, labs.
Oh, maybe I should have had him in a hospital.
Simone, you did everything right.
GALLANT: CBC, PT/PTT
DIC screen, type and cross for four units.
We're taking care of your baby. Let's help you now.
BP is 80/60.
Okay, squeeze in another two liters.
What's happening?
You're losing a lot of blood from a retained placenta.
No, I mean with my baby.
Dr. Kovac is taking good care of your son.
I'm going to pull gently on the umbilical cord.
Simone?
I need you to stay with me.
Oh...
Pulse ox is 82. He's retracting.
Pedes intubation tray, number three ET uncuffed.
What do you hear?
Wet crackles throughout.
KOVAC: Fluid in the alveoli.
Okay, let's have a look.
Unhook the bag from the mask.
You can bag the ET once I'm in.
I've never done that.
Squeeze the bag every two seconds
just like he was doing.
Never pass the tube till you see the cords.
Okay. I'm in.
Call for a pedes vent
and set me up for an umbilical line.
Relax. Relax, the hard part's over.
Good.
Notify the NICU team.
What do I tell them is wrong?
I have no idea.
CORDAY: It's no good. We're into the quads.
EDSON: We'll have to do an AKA.
Keep debriding. We're not there yet.
If we treat this conservatively, and it spreads
we're committed to a hip disarticulation
to stay ahead of the bacteria.
It's worth the risk.
Of his being nonambulatory?
With an above-the-knee amputation
at least he can use a prosthetic.
And if it gets into his hip
it'll spread to the abdominal wall
and he'll get septic.
I am trying to save this man's leg.
Dry the field.
What about his life?
He's young. It's the same thing.
Oh, come on, Robert, of course it's not.
CORDAY: Look, this kelly
slices through sub-Q fat like butter.
All right, fine, keep cutting until you hit viable muscle.
It's above the distal third of the thigh.
It's a hopeless wound.
Fine, take it.
CORDAY: Robert...
I said take the leg.
( slams equipment )
Bovie, pickups.
( man and boy laughing )
Tommy.
How are you feeling?
He seems, he seems a lot better, thanks.
Good. Well, uh
Just keep him on clear fluids tonight
and I'll have a nurse
sign you out.
Okay. Thanks.
What's wrong with him?
Shhh, shhh....
How you holding up?
I'm good. Uh, I think the robot can go home.
Okay. I'll get Carter to dispo him.
Okay.
Can I get you a cup of coffee or something?
No, fine, thank you.
Uh, I like your outfit. Mm-hmm?
It's very retro.
( chuckles ): Thank you.
Um, listen, if you ever need anything...
Like a straitjacket?
( both chuckling )
Is your... dyskinesia usually this bad?
I don't want to freeze up when I'm at work
so I up the medication, and this is what you get.
At least it helps to dispel the myth.
You know, we don't all have rhythm.
( both chuckling )
If that happened to me
I'd probably jump on a world cruise
not go to Med school.
I already saw the world.
In fact, I was in Italy when I first realized
I had a problem.
I was sipping wine in this little cafe in Florence
and I noticed that my little finger was shaking.
I just figured it was from living
on espresso and martinis.
How did you find out it wasn't?
Well, I used to hate doctors
so it took a while for me to check it out
but, once I did, it really put things in perspective.
Yeah, I guess being sick does that.
Her baby's not doing well, huh?
No.
How you doing, Simone?
Good. He seems better, huh?
Maintenance fluids
are at 5cc's per kilo per hour.
My mother had me at home.
I thought it would be good for him.
Um, his tests came back.
I'm afraid your baby has a disease called sialidosis.
What's that?
His body lacks an enzyme
that breaks down the waste proteins inside the cells
and there is already extensive damage to the liver
the bones and the nervous system.
( sighs )
I've been staring at him for over an hour now
and I still...
can't figure out what I want to call him.
Would you excuse us, please?
Uh, yeah. Sure.
( Kovac sighs )
Children with, uh, sialidosis are mentally retarded
often blind.
He'll never speak or walk.
His life expectancy is less than two years.
MAN: Dr. Kovac
NICU's on line one.
Thanks.
( sighs )
Excuse me.
Is there anyone you'd like me to call?
( shudders )
( quietly ): No. There's just us.
I don't think it will be necessary.
Thank you.
You having a bad night?
No worse than usual.
That was a little bit insensitive
don't you think?
Hey, I had to tell a mother her baby was going to die.
I didn't need an audience, okay?
Okay.
I'm starting to get some complaints about you.
From patients?
Nurses.
Don't look so concerned about it.
Okay, first you accused Chuny of being an idiot
and then later
when she was sexually harassed by a patient.... Sexually harassed?!
The guy grabbed her butt!
Yeah, that's sexual harassment, Luka.
Oh, come on, Abby, you were there.
The guy's intoxicated with mandrake; he's harmless.
This one's all yours.
What patient? McFadden.
I was checking his vitals and he grabbed my boob.
Okay, what's his status?
He's going to die if he tries that again; that's his status.
See, every time a nurse has a problem
she complains to me.
Everyone complains, it's part of the job.
Yes, and it's part of my job as Nurse Manager
to counsel you. What?
You can give nurses orders; you cannot critique their work. ( groans )
If you have a problem with a nurse
you have to come to me.
Okay, what about you? Who do I complain to
if I have a problem with you?
Well, here's an idea--
maybe you should try fighting for the nurses
instead of fighting with them.
Hey, maybe you should sew some swastikas on that costume.
You could be a naughty Nazi nurse, huh?
You totally suck, you know that?
Hey, careful!
Creating a hostile work environment!
Where's Dr. Kovac?
I don't know; page him.
The baby with sialidosis is febrile to 102.
Chuny, where's Kovac?
Don't know, don't care.
He feels like he's on fire.
Why hasn't he gone up to the NICU?
You'd have to ask Dr. Kovac.
Can you do something for him?
He needs to be pan-cultured.
How much does he weigh?
3 kilos.
Okay, 150 milligrams I.V. piggyback of Cefotaxime and Amp.
Set up for a spinal tap.
He has sialidosis.
Yeah, and he also has an infection; 60 migs of Tylenol.
I'll make arrangements for your baby
to be sent up to the neonatal unit.
We're going to do everything we can for him.
Thank you.
Why are you still here?
Uh, my piano recital was canceled.
Hey, it's me, Elizabeth.
I'm on my way home now; I'll see you soon. Bye.
We did the right thing.
Trying to convince me or you?
Look, I went through a period of adjustment
when I became a mother; every time I had to treat a child.
You get over it.
Oh, please, spare me
the two-dollar psychoanalysis, Lizzie.
Fine.
Hey, look, look, look...
I know most people don't like me; I don't care.
I don't like most people.
But I'm good at what I do.
I save people's lives.
Every day.
People who no one else can help.
If I can't do that...
Robert... I know you're frustrated.
You're an excellent surgeon, and you will be again
I promise you.
You will be.
I'm being paged.
Elizabeth?
Uh...
I'm being paged.
( door closes )
Elizabeth.
I-I just tried calling you.
I'm sorry, I couldn't wait.
I have to leave for the airport now.
Well, what about a later flight?
This is the later flight.
I threw her pajamas, some crackers
a couple toys in here
just in case she had to stay for awhile.
I'm sorry.
No, no, no, it's all right, it's my fault.
We got slammed.
I'm back Sunday night, so I'll see you Sunday morning.
Yeah, yeah. Have a safe flight.
Bye, Ella. Bye.
Hey, did Chris take you trick-or-treating?
( alarms sounding )
What is it?
Dropped her pressure to 60 palp.
Dopamine is up, we've got two liters going
and I'm working on an art line.
Any word from her family yet?
No, we still don't have a last name.
Lily, could you? Oh, sure.
There, it's okay. Hello, little cowgirl.
I'll be with you soon, all right?
Could it be hemorrhagic?
CT was negative; I'm thinking hypoxia.
If we don't find her family soon
they're just going to be ID-ing the body.
Her pulse ox is only 82
on 100%.
She needs suctioning, Abby.
Set up ultrasound; she may have thrown a clot.
I don't know, second crit was only 32.
I still want four units of type specific.
What happened to Mom? In the washroom.
Where are the suction catheters?
Try the cabinet.
What are you doing?
Weaver ordered antibiotics.
No. Who did the LP?
She wanted a full septic workup.
This is my patient.
The baby spiked a fever.
This baby is in a chronic vegetative state.
You are prolonging his suffering and the suffering of the mother.
We still treat kids like this.
You should have asked me.
We couldn't find you.
I told you to leave once already; this is not your case.
Luka. CORDAY: Abby!
KOVAC: You need to check with me before you push meds on my patients.
I have to do a cut-down here.
Morrison's pouch looks dry, but it could be retroperitoneal.
What the hell was all that about?
You want PEEP on the vent?
Not until we get her pressure up.
CARTER: Nathan, why do you think she's hypotensive?
Blood loss?
Not in this case.
Hypoxia can cause myocardial dysfunction.
That's it; I'm filing a grievance against him.
Not now, Chuny.
IV's dry; she needs a fresh one.
I'll get it.
Panic value
potassium's 8.2.
Damn it, that's rhabdo
from the crush injury; 10cc's of calcium gluconate.
PVC's.
Let's push bicarb; ten units of regular insulin
an amp of D-50.
Get me kayexelate and call renal; she may need dialysis.
( gasps )
What the hell are you doing?
I accidentally...
It's okay.
Go see if Frank's found the girl's family.
No, I'll start another one.
Line's in, is the transducer ready?
Where's the saline?
I said, go find the girl's family.
Run of five.
100 of Lidocaine
prep the groin for a quinton catheter.
Sats are falling, 79.
Pressure's down to 50.
Being a little hard on him, don't you think?
V-tac, charge to 200.
What are you talking about?
Nathan, he's doing a pretty good job, considering.
Considering what?
He has Parkinson's.
Excuse me?
CORDAY: Clear.
Still V-tach.
Procainamide's on board.
Stand by with amiodarone.
Clear.
No change.
How long?
How long?
Uh... 12 minutes.
Clear.
Sinus tach.
All right.
Way to go.
Good femoral pulse.
Set up a pronestyl drip, then a repeat K.
Labs on your baby.
( sarcastically ): Thank you.
Glad to see you two have made up.
Hey, I'm being professional.
She's the one having trouble.
I warned her.
Warned her about what?
( sighs ): Nothing.
( laughs ): Oh, my God.
You're such a jerk.
What?
You slept with her?
( scoffs )
That's what this is all about.
What's your problem?
One time.
One time. One time with Chuny
one time with a patient's mother in radiology.
Hey, you never complained.
Yeah, I never let it affect my work.
You two need to figure this out.
So, what do you
want me to do?
I don't know.
Tell her you're sorry. Tell her it was wrong.
Just fix it. I'm not going to kiss her ass.
That's how this whole problem started.
Have them check a gas on 50%.
I'm going to wait right here for you, Wynn.
Don't worry about anything.
I love you.
( sighs heavily )
I should've told them I was his brother.
ICU has strict rules.
He'll need around-the-clock attention tonight
but his lungs are rebounding.
You know what, you should probably go home.
They'll let you see him in the morning.
Home?
Our whole lives were in that apartment.
This dress
is all I have.
I've been watching his heart rate.
It goes down when I touch him, when he knows I'm here.
Has his fever gone down?
A little.
I waited so long for him.
Five years.
Two miscarriages, in vitro.
I lost two boyfriends
because I was so determined to have a child.
I was about to give up...
and then suddenly... he was here.
He's here.
We'll keep treating the infection
but he could start going into organ failure soon.
His systems will shut down.
( quietly ): You're so beautiful.
You're my baby.
His heart could stop beating.
I need to know what you want to do
if something like that happens.
I don't know.
To keep him alive, I may have to open his chest.
Maybe even shock him.
And I'm not sure you want me to do something like that.
No...
( quietly ): I... I don't know.
I don't know.
Tell the unit I flushed the quintin.
He's tenacious.
You've got to give him that.
I wish he'd told me.
Kind of a hard thing to lead with.
Oh, there's Mommy.
There's Mommy.
Hi, uh, Lily had to run Wynn's ABG up to the lab.
Thank you.
Did you reverse her hyperkalemia?
Yeah, just enough to get her to dialysis.
She still has the burns, though.
Yeah, but you got her back.
May I? Oh, I'm sorry, yeah.
Hey. Thank you.
So, did we reach the parents?
No, uh, the girl was actually baby-sitting.
Wasn't even her building.
You know, you might have told me sooner
saved me some embarrassment.
About your condition.
Well, I certainly didn't mean to embarrass you.
How long has it been?
Eight years. I was misdiagnosed for the first two.
And you were late today because...?
My neurologist wanted an MRI.
I'm sorry.
I wouldn't have made you stay...
What the hell, fresh start.
Try to make as many rounds as you can
complete the required reading
take the exam.
I've been reading and taking tests for two years.
This is my hands-on training.
It's a surgical rotation.
I understand that.
Probably the most
physically demanding, emotionally exhausting
stressful six weeks any would-be physician ever experiences.
Part of becoming a doctor.
I'm offering you a pass, Mr. Nathan.
Trust me, you should take it.
I'm here to treat patients.
You have a degenerative neurologic disease.
I know what I have.
It doesn't mean I need a pass.
FRANK: E.R.
I don't want special treatment.
I just want to learn like other students.
You're not like other students.
No, I'm older and smarter.
FRANK: Burn Unit needs you.
I'm on my way out, Frank.
It's your melted mask guy.
Okay. I'll be right there.
Look, go home, think about it.
Report back day after tomorrow.
I'm sure you could use the rest.
I'm fine.
It's just not very practical.
Okay, let's go.
Dr. Weaver?
What?
What time is it?
Are you okay?
Yeah, yeah, I was...
( sighing ): I was just going to lay down for a second.
Can you pronounce a patient?
Did we ever hear back from the NICU?
Uh, no, there was no need.
Oh, come on.
It's been three hours.
We can't board their patients.
They have to call in a nurse from home
or if they won't, I want to speak to their medical director.
Dr. Weaver...
Cardiac arrest half hour ago.
Excuse us.
You should've come to get me.
How long did Dr. Kovac work on him?
He didn't. She signed a DNR.
Where is he?
Who? Kovac.
He's home. His shift ended at 10:00.
All right, I'm going to move her to a quiet room.
Call the social worker
get her referrals for grief counseling.
Are you leaving soon?
I'm just, uh, finishing up with Woody here.
You're the most beautiful nurse in this hospital.
Well, thank you.
You've got class.
May I play with your breasts? Hey!
Excuse me.
Please?
Last request of a man on his deathbed.
You're not dying, Woody-- you're drunk.
I want to go to heaven
on the bosom of a beautiful woman.
I don't think your HMO covers that.
How much longer you have that outfit for?
Tomorrow at noon, why?
Thought maybe I could talk you
into giving me a sponge bath.
What's in it for me, Boney Boy?
Oh, I'll give you a bone
nasty naughty little nurse. ( laughing )
ROMANO: Elizabeth!
Uh... Robert, can we talk tomorrow?
I really have to get Ella home.
I thought you might want this before you left.
It's my ring.
Amazing what you can do
with a laparoscopic camera and a snare.
Thank you.
De nada.
Uh... look, about, uh, about today...
Uh, let's not.
It was a momentary
weakness on my part.
It won't happen again.
You'll work through this, Robert.
Of course I will.
Good night.
Night.
CORDAY: The patient has gastroenteritis
vomits to excess, has hematemesis
no history of PUD.
What are you thinking?
NATHAN: Mallory-Weiss tear.
Laceration of the distal esophagus
results in an upper GI bleed.
You're both correct and tardy.
Sorry.
Don't be sorry, be punctual.
What if that patient vomits and develops chest pain?
Boerhaave's syndrome.
Spontaneous rupture of the esophagus
associated with retching.
Usually tears into the left pleural space.
