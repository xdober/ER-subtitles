Previously on E.R.:
Listen... let me go.
I can explain everything.
I can't be arrested!
Do you even know if there's a flight out tonight?
Yep. United. 9:30 to Omaha.
Hi.
You called her?
The most unreliable
undependable person in our lives?
And you're dependable?
Yeah, to you I am, yes.
This is about Eric.
You can't go back to the way you two were.
There's no quick fix.
Mom was out-of-her-mind crazy and I'm not like that!
It's 300 an hour.
2,000 for the night.
Give me some damn privacy.
But I won. It's all right-- I-I should go.
( glass breaking )
Where's Mom?
You need cable.
MAGGIE: I broke a bowl-- I'm sorry.
I'm making scrambled.
You want some?
No.
You got some cheese?
Just the stuff in a can.
What time is it?
Almost 5:00.
It's a little early for breakfast
don't you think?
Not if it's your last supper.
Nothing fresh?
I'm not hungry anyway.
MAGGIE: You need to eat something.
( quietly ): He's been up since 3:00.
Maybe you should talk to him.
Hey.
What are you watching?
Nothing.
And everything.
You having trouble falling asleep?
Trouble staying that way, actually.
Kind of a crappy neighborhood you live in.
You want to talk about it?
Tell me what's going on?
You had me medically discharged
and I'm about to check into a loony bin today.
What do you think's going on?
( clears throat ): Treatment center.
It's one of the best treatment centers
in the city and it's just days.
My days.
It's been a long trip.
The more aggressively we treat this now
the better your chances are of...
My chances.
MAGGIE: I'm tired, he's tired.
We agreed, Eric.
When the hell did this become "we"?
When you started having to take Depakote.
Is that how it works?
Anything over 500 milligrams gets you locked up?
Eric...
You're lucky you're only 250.
It's weight-based.
CARTER: Follow my finger
with your eyes, Timmy.
Good.
WOMAN: He came in saying he had a headache.
Swears up and down nothing happened to him.
And do you wear a helmet when you ride a bike?
Yeah, but I wasn't.
Both of them are on restriction.
They can't play outside the yard.
Well, what were you guys doing out there?
Playing catch?
Playing a little cops and robbers?
Knowing might help me figure out
whether Timmy needs medicine or an operation.
Or both.
Gravity.
Is that some kind of game?
Uh... I hold him up by the ankles
and see how long it takes
for him to hit the ground after I let go.
One one-thousand.
Okay. Chuny, let's get a head CT, no contrast.
You bet.
How many times have I told you
not to torture your little brother?
Another Kodak moment?
Kid has a concussion--
still wouldn't rat out his brother.
That would make him a squealer.
It's a fate worse than head trauma.
When's Abby due back?
She's back. Yesterday.
Yeah, everything okay?
Yeah. I mean, other than needing a vacation from her vacation.
Uh, no kidding.
If I was stuck on a train with my family...
It's a bad example
because I'd throw myself on the tracks.
See you tomorrow. Bye.
Not so fast.
Weaver wants you to cover her shift.
That is the second time this week!
And it's only Tuesday.
Well, is she moonlighting or slacking?
Dealing with labor negotiations, is what I heard.
Something like that.
Well, so much for salsa tonight.
You losing all your party pals?
Yeah, well, between work and boyfriends
nobody seems to have time for fun anymore.
GIRL: Excuse me.
Are you doctors?
Yeah, but you have to sign in over at Triage.
I can't do this.
I-I just can't.
( door opening )
Should we look, or call security?
( baby crying ) Both.
Less than an hour old.
( baby continues crying )
MAN: Every day begins
with 90 minutes of group.
Individual sessions are twice a week
with recreational therapies rounding out the schedule.
Monday through Friday?
8:00 to 4:00.
Busy day.
Now, we have found
that a four-pronged approach is most effective:
Therapy, structure, social interaction
and, of course, meds.
ABBY: Which you dispense?
Absolutely.
Uh, through there, there's some lockers
where patients can store their belongings.
We provide a hot lunch
and on occasion, we take the group
to nearby cultural events.
What about recess?
Pardon me?
I mean, no swings, no monkey bars, no slides.
Not even a merry-go-round.
Eric.
Honey, why don't we go talk to some of the other people.
Oh, oh, for bipolar show-and-tell? Okay.
There's always an adjustment period.
Um, will you be keeping him on Zyprexa?
You think he needs to be on an anti-psychotic?
He's had some delusional thoughts with his mania.
Well, before prescribing anything
I'll want to review his medical records
and of course, talk with him.
I don't know how much cooperation you're going to get
but I can probably tell you anything you need to know.
Mmm, be more helpful coming from the patient.
But down the line
family therapy may well be a part of the program.
I'll let you know.
( baby crying )
Appears term.
Skin's good.
Well-perfused, no jaundice.
No ID, no information, no nothing.
Fontanel is soft
a little sunken-- definitely dehydrated.
HARKINS: Do you think she had any help?
Delivering? I doubt it.
The umbilical cord is clamped
with a Powder Puff Girls barrette.
Powerpuff Girls.
Um, so we just call Social Services now, right?
Safe Haven Law.
A mom can drop off a newborn, no questions asked.
Bilateral red reflex.
Pupils reactive.
At least she did the responsible thing.
Did she?
Yeah, the baby could've ended up in the dumpster.
But where's the father?
Where's the girl's parents?
Where's the girl?
Out there living life like nothing happened.
Need a heel stick for glucose.
CHEN: And a diaper.
Double MVA: 12-year-old with ankle deformity
and the driver is shocky
with abdominal trauma.
Kid's vitals okay?
We'll find out, they're rolling up right now.
( crying continues )
Coming?
Uh, yeah.
In a minute.
He's vomiting.
Let's turn him.
Poster boy for blunt trauma.
B.P. 100/72.
Any LOC?
Awake at the scene
GCS 14 so far, but he keeps heaving.
Blood and urine in his pants.
Mr. Brenner, I'm Dr. Carter.
Morgan.
HARMS: His kid's in the next rig.
Your daughter's right behind you.
Let's page trauma surg down here and set up for a chest tube.
Hang in there.
Where's my ten bucks?
Right in my wallet, where it's going to stay.
Oh, you're still making that "no shake, no pay" noise again?
Hi, I'm Erin. What's your name? Morgan.
Good sats, but left ankle deformity.
No other injury. Truck hit the driver's side.
Where was she?
Restrained in the back, opposite.
Daddy says he can keep a better eye on me that way.
Why, did you get into trouble?
No, he's a worrywart.
CARTER: Lateral C-spine, chest and pelvis to start.
It's just me... Normal heart sound
but decreased on the left.
Mr. Brenner, can you open your mouth for me?
Good radial pulses.
No dental fractures. Mandible stable.
Her mother's gone...
CHUNY: Sats 90.
CHEN: 28 French on a vascular clamp.
Ooh, he's got a left clavicular fracture.
It's probably a small pneumo.
She doesn't understand...
Ten blade. This the MVA?
Yeah, dropped a lung. Check out the belly.
Sonosite.
I'm Dr. Corday.
I'll be assessing your need for surgery.
Uh, hope not. ( groans )
Tender abdomen, hypotensive.
Tube's going in.
CARTER: Fluid in Morrison's.
Mr. Brenner, you probably have an injury
to your internal organs
which we'll need to repair quickly.
Is there anybody you'd like us to call?
Your wife?
No.
His daughter's next door.
Need a cell saver for the thoraseal. On it.
BRENNER: Is it bad?
CORDAY: Stay with us, Mr. Brenner.
Extra cell saver in here?
Oh, catch.
DP and PT pulses strong.
Is he going to be okay?
Your father's in good hands, Morgan.
Yeah, that's right.
We got our second-best doctor working on him.
Second?
Well, number one's working with you
isn't he?
Looks like a distal tib fib.
Let's get her down to X ray.
Where are they taking him?
PRATT: He might need a test
we can't perform here in the E.R.
Or surgery.
Hey, you got a favorite color?
Yeah, why?
Well, we'll need to put a cast on your ankle
and we've got all the colors
of the rainbow.
I like pink.
( chuckles ): Me, too.
Look for images that best describe your feelings
during the hypomanic phases of your illness.
Hey, does anybody have a Viagra ad?
Kidding.
We find that this exercise really helps them to identify
the seductive side of their mania.
It seems so simple.
Has to be in the beginning.
They are used to chaos--
to acting on their impulses.
This allows them to move into a world
of structure and self-discipline.
He'll adapt.
Obviously, you did.
See you this afternoon.
Thanks, Doctor.
You ready?
I guess.
ABBY: Is something wrong?
MAGGIE: No.
Mom?
You think this is the right facility for him?
Okay. How did I know that was coming?
I'm not saying it's not
but seeing it, seeing what they're making him do...
Okay, the collages are stupid.
That's only one part of the therapy.
It'd be great if he was ten years old.
Well, emotionally, he pretty much is.
No, he's not.
Okay, 15 then.
MAGGIE: I know how he feels.
Like we're trying to take away his personality--
the thing he likes about being him.
Which is also the thing that is destroying him.
What if he does it independently?
Sees a psychiatrist, gets a job
tries to learn how to deal with this on his own.
That would be great.
How do you keep him on his meds?
You can't force meds, or this so-called therapy
down your brother's throat.
( chuckles ): "So-called therapy."
If he's not ready for it, it won't work.
Oh, and you know what will?
Why do you do that?
We're not talking about me.
Why do you always shove it in my face?
Because you keep insisting that you're the expert.
That you know best.
Maybe this once I do.
You know, you are not exactly cured.
And he needs someone stable to help get him through this.
I'm his mother.
Oh, come on.
Come on, you've been in and out of hospitals
for the past 30 years.
You're not anybody's mother.
Okay, wait.
CHEN: Well, he looks good.
How's he doing?
Temp's normal, pulse down to 140.
I think he likes it here.
CHEN: No beds upstairs, huh?
I don't mind.
It's nice to have a healthy baby
down here for a change.
Hmm. Repeat the bolus of 20cc's per kilo.
Then try him on 30cc's of Enfamil q two hours
until Pedes takes him up.
I don't know how anybody could give him away.
Well, I'm sure she had her reasons.
Call me if he won't feed.
GALLANT: 45-year-old woman presenting
with four hours of abdominal pain and vomiting times ten.
Epigastric tenderness without rebound.
Hey, Deb, have you seen Kovac anywhere?
Nope. Sorry.
( sighs ): Of course not.
He's only the swing shift attending...
Well, hemoglobin's normal, as are LFTs.
...the doctor you should be presenting to...
UA and ICON are normal and negative.
...but apparently, I'm the only one around here
with a work ethic.
So, I'm thinking, uh, food poisoning
gastroenteritis, uh, but she has intractable vomiting
despite Compazine and Reglan.
Hi, I'm Dr, Lewis.
How are you doing?
Not so good.
Otherwise you wouldn't be here, right?
Do you know what's wrong?
It's okay, he's my boyfriend.
Your test show an anion gap which could be due to vomiting
dehydration, a lactic acidosis.
We'll need to run some more tests to make sure.
So, will you need to admit me?
You hate hospitals as much as I do?
You kidding? She lives in them.
I'm an R.N.
So as a nurse, you know
we can't send you home if we can't control
your vomiting.
Yeah, and she can't come to my house, either--
I just got new rugs.
Just kidding.
( sighs )
We'll be right back.
Let's give Mr. Brenner another 25 of fentanyl.
You got it.
Are you comfortable?
BRENNER: No.
How long will I be out?
First, we need to identify then stop the hemorrhage.
We may also have to remove your spleen.
No. Out of commission.
There's a possibility you may have injured your bowel.
If that's the case
it'll require a pull-down to reattach your intestines
after the damage has healed.
My daughter?
Morgan has a fractured ankle.
I understand she's doing fine.
Are you sure we can't contact your wife for you?
She barely remembers her.
Sorry?
She left us.
Your wife passed away?
No, no, no.
She couldn't be there for her
so she left it to me to be the mom and dad.
KOVAC: I need some help over here.
Kovac, you're late.
Blame my alarm clock.
Oh, yeah, what's her name?
Probable hip fracture, 82-year-old woman.
Went down in her kitchen. Not "old woman." Matilda!
B.P.'s 100 palp, pulse 120.
Gave her 500 of saline.
Left hip is ecchymotic
with shortened leg and externally rotated foot.
Beautiful name you have.
Bruising on top of the leg.
When did she fall?
Figure a couple of days ago.
Landlord found her 'cause she was late with her rent.
She taking anything?
Would've if she could've.
Found enalapril and glipizide
A diabetic. Lucky she's not in a coma.
Coming through. Precious cargo.
Watch it.
You know what, we're putting you in another bed, okay?
Yeah, one in which we can keep an eye on you.
From what I hear, you're a troublemaker.
Is there a bathroom anywhere?
Uh, it's down the hall
but I need to find a wheelchair.
What she means is
that they've been getting stolen lately.
Well, I kind of have to go bad.
Better get a bedpan, then.
And go here?
Don't worry, we'll close the door
and give you some privacy.
You need some help?
No, I think I can do it by myself.
Okay.
Here. Push four of morphine and find her mother's number.
Pop's going to be in surgery for a while.
( clattering )
MORGAN: It's okay!
Go ahead.
( knocking )
Hey, Morgan, I'm coming in.
No, don't!
Oh, my God!
You're a boy.
A 12-year-old cross dresser?
All I know is anatomically, she's a he.
And you're sure about that?
I've seen my fair share of penises.
Really?
Anyway, she's... uh, he's pretty upset
and I think you should talk to him.
You found the mom yet?
I'm working on it.
No, work faster.
Hey.
How you doing?
I want to see my dad.
He's still in surgery.
How much longer?
I don't know.
So, what's the deal?
Why are you going around dressed like a girl?
Because I am one.
I have the wrong body.
You're kind of young
to be thinking that way, aren't you?
No, I always have.
Is your dad in on this, too?
He moved us so I can start over at a new school.
Nobody knows.
Well, they're going to find out eventually, don't you think?
Not if we keep moving.
And when I'm old enough, I'm going to get the operation.
What does your mom have to say about that?
She has a different family now.
Look, um, your dad's going to be a while
and we need someone to come get you.
My dad's friend lives near us.
No, I think your mom would be more appropriate.
She thinks I'm a freak
just like you do.
Please.
What's this friend's name?
So, what do we do?
Who do we call?
Don't do anything.
Oh, G! G!
Leon, what are you doing here?
( sobbing ): He made me leave.
Who?
He gave me no reason.
He just told me that I was fired.
What?
He was mean, G.
He hit me with a broom.
I didn't even do nothing.
Pratt, Urology, line one.
Yeah, take a message. Come on.
In all my spare time. Hold.
County.
Someone's asking for you.
Did you get a name?
Anita Coffee.
Is that a pseudonym or a cry for help?
Pretty clever, huh?
Hey. Hi.
It's freezing; why didn't you come inside?
Didn't feel like dealing with anybody, I guess.
Did you get someone to cover for you?
Yeah. Is everything okay?
Yeah, just need a little company.
I was hoping the mailman would come.
KOVAC: Good pedal pulses.
Is the pain medicine working?
I don't get much mail.
No letters from your grandkids?
Oh, junk, mostly.
Matilda, I need you to be quiet
while I listen to your chest, okay?
2/6 systolic ejection murmur.
Matilda?
How much fentanyl did she get?
100 mikes.
That wouldn't knock her out.
Might be a CVA.
She could be losing her airway.
Matilda, wake up.
Got 'em.
Initial glucose is 576, bichem is normal.
Not DKA, maybe hyperosmolar coma.
I'll check for the gag.
( gagging )
What the hell are you doing?!
Are you okay?
I was having a nice rest
till this bitch started choking me.
Nice.
Dr. Lewis
this is Jeremy Cranston.
He's here to see his mother.
Oh, yeah-- Hi, Jeremy.
Right this way.
I got home and a neighbor said
she went to the hospital.
What happened?
Well, apparently she started throwing up this morning.
Throwing up?
Yeah, we think she might have food poisoning
but we're not sure.
What did you have for dinner last night?
We had steak; I'm not sick.
Yeah, well, like I said, we're still working on it.
Mom, how come you didn't call me?
I thought you were going to.
I didn't get a chance.
I'll get another chair.
Honey, you don't have to stay and watch me sleep.
I want to.
Besides, Bill's got to go to work, right?
No, that's okay, I can stay.
Let me get you something to read.
Thanks, honey.
The gift store's upstairs.
Um, if you need anything official, or whatever
ask me and not her boyfriend, okay?
Is there a problem?
No, he's just kind of a jerk sometimes.
CARTER: So, how was it left?
She went back to my apartment, I came here.
I'll pick him up tonight, we'll all have dinner
it will be fine... as soon as she leaves.
What happens then?
Then, Eric and I will get into a routine with his treatment
and I'll work days so I can keep an eye on him at night.
Really? And I'll probably get
a bigger apartment, I guess.
You're going to be roommates now.
Well, I can't just let him wander off
and hope for the best.
He needs my help.
You think that's too much?
I think that it's a responsibility
that you could share.
With who? Maggie?
( rueful chuckle )
Do you know
when she would leave us
she used to do it when we were sleeping?
Did I ever tell you that?
So, it became part of our morning routine.
We would get up, go pee
check and see if Mom had abandoned us.
And on the mornings when she was gone
I was left with my little brother--
this skinny little kid who never, ever did anything wrong
and was good and beautiful and sweet--
and I would have to tell him
that everything was going to be okay.
What would he say?
"You're a liar."
Still V-tach.
Amp of epi. Charge.
Epi in, lido in.
Why tell me all that if you're not going to fight?
Clear.
Still V-tach.
You have a daughter who needs you, damn it.
Charge to 300. Clear.
Asystole.
Change the leads; make sure.
Just do it. It's not the leads.
Clear.
Still flatline.
The leads are fine.
Milligram of atropine, five more of epi.
He's oozing everywhere.
No pulse, no pressure.
( sighing )
God, I hate this.
We'll keep you comfortable
till they are ready for you in surgery.
All my life, I've been terrified
of going under the knife.
Done everything I could to avoid it.
You'll be fine.
No wedding ring.
Good-looking man like you?
Oh, it's okay now.
But before-- being alone, being a spinster-- terrible.
Called women like me "lonely hearts."
Were you?
No more than a lot of women I knew who were married.
Oh, what the hell.
Gave me time to improve my chess game.
I'm a killer.
Is that right?
Damn well better be at my age.
Maybe we should play sometime.
I'm pretty good myself.
And what about Mr. Boyle?
Uh, refresh my memory.
Compulsive overeater with abdominal pain.
Oh, yeah, give him an extra lunch
and pray a bed opens up in Psych.
Oh, and Dr. Weaver called
and asked that you cover
the Finance Committee meeting at 2:00.
She asked?
Well, not exactly.
Dr. Lewis.
I used to think that would be so cool to hear-- "Dr. Lewis."
Toxicology came back on Melody Cranston.
Negative for drugs of abuse, serum iron level normal.
Any osmolal gap?
No, but her salicylate level
is 41 milligrams per deciliter.
Aspirin overdose?
Well, it looks that way.
She's a nurse, she knows better.
She also knows that's not a lethal enough dose
to do anything but make her sick.
Do me a favor; pull her medical records.
Munchausen's?
Maybe she wants to get medical attention
instead of giving it.
OLIGARIO: Dr. Lewis.
What?
What do you think of the name Elias?
Don't ask me.
I named my dog Puddles.
Talk about a self- fulfilling prophecy.
Somebody getting a dog?
No, we're just trying to come up with a name
for the abandoned baby.
Which do you like better, Percy or Oliver?
Rudyard.
Hasn't he suffered enough?
What's the matter with Rudyard?
CORDAY: John.
I'm afraid Mr. Brenner didn't make it.
Where's his daughter?
Uh, Pratt was treating her.
She might be in Exam One.
Does she have family here?
Hey, Harkins?
You worked on Brenner's kid, right?
Yeah.
CORDAY: Did you reach the mother?
Dr. Pratt said he was going to handle it.
CARTER: Did he?
I don't know, he's on a break.
Well, the girl's father just died.
Boy.
What?
Uh, Morgan's a boy.
I guess the proper term is transsexual.
Uh, wait, I'm sorry.
His daughter is actually his son?
Yes, I wanted to call the mother
but Dr. Pratt didn't.
Did you get the number?
Mr. Brenner mentioned an estrangement.
Harkins?
Yes, I have it.
Then call.
She's next of kin.
Have a good night.
Hi. How did it go today?
Not so well.
He left.
What do you mean, he left?
He withdrew from the program.
And went where?
You should probably ask your mother that.
Excuse me?
She came and got him about an hour ago.
I got no problem with you.
Fire Leon and you do.
Use a broom on him
and you've got an even bigger problem with me.
He wouldn't leave.
The man shows up on time every day
works his ass off for you
and does every damn thing you tell him to do.
So when he gets kicked to the curb
maybe he doesn't understand that.
Somebody gets into my store after hours, with a key.
How the hell you think they got one?
Think I left it in the door?
For all I know, Leon ripped me off himself.
No, no, no, no.
He's not like that.
Everybody's like that.
Even if it was his friends
then they tricked him.
He wouldn't have a clue.
Let me tell you something.
That dumb ass brother of yours ain't so dumb.
Hey.
The man took a bullet to the head.
He's not dumb.
Get away from me.
Look, he wouldn't do this.
Get away or I'm calling the cops on you and him.
Leave Leon out of this.
You understand me?
Leave him out of it.
CARTER: Mrs. Garding?
What happened?
Hi, I'm Dr. Carter.
I don't know how much
you were told over the telephone...
Next to nothing.
Your ex-husband and your son
were involved in a car accident.
Morgan has a broken ankle
it's relatively minor.
Oh, thank you, Jesus.
Mr. Brenner's injuries, however
were far more extensive
and...
Did he die?
Oh, my God.
I understand that it's been some time
since you've seen Morgan.
Three years.
And are you, um...
are you aware that he's been living as a girl?
His father and I disagreed on how to handle that.
Morgan wanted to live with his dad, so I didn't fight it.
Morgan hasn't been told about his father's death.
I can't be the one. I'm sorry.
That's okay, that's okay.
I can take care of that for you.
I do think it would be better if you were there.
Okay.
( sighs )
Morgan's going to need crutches for about six weeks
and there's a chance that he may require
a little physical therapy.
Otherwise, he should recover fully.
Good.
Morgan?
What's wrong?
Honey...
What are you doing here?
Where's my dad?
Morgan, your dad was hurt very badly in the accident.
No.
And we did what we could for him here
and then he went up to an operating room...
No!
They worked on him for a very long time
in the hopes that his heart would start pumping again...
No.
But it didn't
and he died.
No!
No, no, no!
It's going to be okay.
Sweetie, I'll take care of you, okay?
I'll take care of everything.
How soon before I can play basketball again?
Uh, soon.
After the reduction, put Mr. Trotter
in a sugar tong splint until the swelling goes down.
And a short arm cast for six weeks after that.
Your ears get red when you lie.
How are you holding up, Matilda?
You don't even have to try, do you?
Sorry?
With women.
I, uh, checked with surgery.
They should be ready to take you up in an hour or so.
Is that pronounced "Ko-vack"?
"Ko-vach."
Um, spell your first name
for me, please.
What are you doing?
Oh, tipping you.
You seem like a nice young man.
I can't accept your money.
Why not?
Because you need it for yourself.
I never had a soul to spend it on.
Not even a cat.
I'm frugal, I'm 82.
Trust me, I have enough to last.
No, I can't.
Says who?
Take it.
I'm an old, arthritic woman.
I can't hold my arm out forever.
Now take it!
Can someone really do that?
Never had it happen before.
Well, how much is it?
I didn't look.
A patient writes you a check
and you don't look at the amount?
Oh, my God.
You accepted money from a patient?
I'll look at it.
That's completely unethical.
It made her feel good
to give me a token of appreciation.
So, yes, Susan, I took it.
Hello, have her send you a basket of muffins.
It'll probably bounce anyway.
Uh, it's for $10,000.
Melody Cranston's medical recs.
Certainly thick enough to support Munchausen's.
Well, maybe not.
Six months ago she came in with a fractured orbit
from falling off a ladder.
Which is pretty damned impossible.
Yeah, well, a month after that
she was back with multiple abrasions and contusions
and a forearm fracture.
Broken jaw in 2000, broken ribs in 2001.
Looks like Melody's
got a lousy boyfriend.
( door unlocking )
I tried to call.
( door slams )
What's the matter with you?
He doesn't want to do it this way.
He doesn't, or you don't?
Where is he?
Abby, the only way someone with this disease gets better
is if they want to.
Oh, what, so until then we just wait it out?
Is that it?
No, I didn't say that.
Well, then what are you saying, Mom?
What's the plan here?
Does he even have one?
Do you have one?
We're going back to Minnesota in the morning.
What?
No, you're not.
Do you have any idea
how many strings I had to pull
to get him into that center?
He'll live with me.
I'll get him to see my psychiatrist
at least once a week.
This is a proven program.
I'll keep him on his meds if I can.
If you can?
I realize this is hard for you to understand.
No, it's impossible, actually.
I love him, too.
So what?! I know you think
you're the only one that's ever been there
for either of us, and maybe that's true...
No, that is true!
All right. But Abby, I'm here now.
Where is he?
Afebrile, normal vitals after two 80cc boluses.
WOMAN: What about his glucose?
The last two were fine.
Slow start on the Enfamil, but he's good now.
Okay, then, time to go, baby.
Excuse me.
We've both been in here for hours
and I haven't been able to see his face.
Could I?
Hey, your first roommate wants to meet you.
Beautiful, isn't he?
I love this age.
It's when they really need you.
Okay, say bye-bye.
Oh, okay.
Bye-bye.
You ever figure out a name for him?
Um... no.
Did your boyfriend leave?
He had to get to work.
Right.
So, how are you feeling?
About the same.
Mm, I mean in general.
Have you been upset
or depressed?
No, not really.
Then why'd you take
an aspirin overdose?
What was it? Like, 20 pills?
That must have been some headache.
Are you trying to get his sympathy
or are you trying to get away from him?
We both know you've been beaten.
A lot.
Melody, someone is hurting you.
You have to turn him in to the police.
I can't do that.
I couldn't.
The violence is not going to stop on its own.
I just need a few days.
Look, we both know...
He's joining the Navy.
Your boyfriend?
My son.
All right, Jerry, talk to me. What'd I miss?
Security stopped a guy
with a crossbow coming in
Yosh forgot to put Connie's ice cream cake in the freezer
oh, and, uh, Carter was wondering
where the hell you been.
Hey, I had business to attend to.
What's he care?
I signed my patients out to Chen anyway.
He asked and you asked.
Hey, did you dispo the diabetic ulcer in One?
Yeah, and Mr. Barnstal got moved up to the ICU.
Perfect. Mr. Brenner back from surgery yet?
He exsanguinated in the OR.
What?
Died about an hour ago.
Where's Morgan?
Uh, with his mom, I think.
I thought I told you not to do anything.
Well, you weren't here, what was I supposed to do?
Learn to follow simple instructions, Harkins.
I did, per Dr. Carter.
What are you doing?
I can't bring him home this way.
Please, put down the scissors. Come on.
His step-father will never accept him.
You do not need to do this.
It's my right.
He's my little boy.
I'm doing this for him.
It's the best thing.
So, how often do you get earaches?
Only when it's cold and windy.
( laughs ): And you live in Chicago, huh?
Well, blame my parents.
I'd much rather have grown up in Jamaica.
Hmm.
Where did you grow up?
Dr. Chen?
Uh, she described you.
She said she'd been here earlier.
Excuse me.
Hi.
I changed my mind.
I want my baby back.
Oh.
Is this the mother?
Yeah. Do you want to tell me what happened?
No, I just want him back.
Oh, yeah? For how long?
Can you give me the potassium level
on Mr. Pinkus?
Look, I was just really scared before
but I'm not anymore.
What's your name?
Romy.
Do you think you can really take care of a baby, Romy?
My mama will help me.
You told her?
No, but I'm going to.
He's mine.
Can I see him?
Chuny?
Yeah.
Can you please take Romy to see her baby?
Sure. This way. You going to call Social Services?
Yeah.
Mother of the year, huh?
At least she's trying.
She left her baby with a bunch of strangers.
How is that trying?
Make sure she gets an examination
before she leaves.
( alarms ring )
HALEH: V tach.
Not surprising after lying on the floor for two days.
She probably got a blood clot
that broke off and went to her lungs.
Happens all the time.
Why didn't someone come get me?
She had an advanced directive-- no heroic measures.
How come I didn't know about it?
Gave it to me a little while ago.
Wanted to make sure
it was out of her purse
and in her medical record.
( alarm sounds )
V fib.
Aren't you off yet?
An hour ago.
I've got this if you want to go.
You need the monitor on?
Yes.
Asystole.
Where's the accu-check?
Exam Three.
Hey, you going to bingo tonight?
I can't. I need the overtime.
Blackout jackpot's five grand.
Yeah? Maybe I should go.
Sorry.
Have you called it?
19:28.
It's Navy, huh?
Yeah, what can I say?
I like the water.
I can't fault you for that.
LEWIS: Jeremy?
Is she ready to go? Uh, not quite.
Look like your mother has the beginnings
of a stomach ulcer, probably from taking too much aspirin.
That makes sense. She's always complaining about headaches.
Yeah. Anyway, we'll need
to keep her here for observation.
For how long?
Well, we need to treat her abdominal pain
keep her hydrated on IV fluids.
So, a couple of days at least.
I'm shipping out in a couple of days.
Good thing they invented telephones, huh?
Good luck.
Maybe I misheard.
What was your diagnosis?
Unintentional
aspirin overdose.
Unintentional?
That's what she's telling the social worker.
And we're admitting her?
( sighs )
Her son knocks her around.
Her son?
And he leaves
for good in two days
and she doesn't want it to be for jail.
( sighs )
So, you made up a diagnosis?
No, I stretched one.
Sounds unethical.
So is eavesdropping.
What number?
309.
You have a key?
Yes.
Eric, it's Abby.
( sighs )
Can you let me in?
I need to talk to you.
Are you alone?
No. Mom's here, too.
Why did you bring her?
She's worried about you, Eric.
I don't want you here.
Okay, just hold on, all right?
I don't want you in my life right now.
What?
Are you coming in?
Okay. Wait a minute.
Eric, don't do this.
Move your hand. You need help.
I don't want to hurt you.
You can't do this by yourself.
You need structure and stability.
Let go. Someone you can
rely on and trust.
That's not you anymore, okay?
You don't understand.
Yes, I do.
You think you do, but you don't.
You're not like us.
You never will be.
MAGGIE: I'll call you when we get settled.
Don't bother.
Abby...
Abby?
You taking off?
I have to make up time.
Seems like I took too long of a break.
You can't just leave.
I signed out to Chen.
Breaks are for ten minutes in the hospital.
You were gone for over an hour.
Look, you weren't here...
so I overrode your order to Harkins
but it's not like I had much of a choice.
No. You could have waited.
You could have paged me.
You could have respected the kid's wishes.
He's a minor.
You could have called Social Services in.
To do what?
Remove him from the home?
Hey, I feel bad about what happened, too
but like it or not, she's his only family.
Define family.
That's her.
She never told me.
I just thought that she gained some weight.
Thank you.
LEWIS: Oh, I so need a margarita.
Are you ready?
Uh, I think I'm going to pass.
Oh, come on.
I hate drinking alone.
I mean, I'll do it, but...
See you tomorrow?
Oh!
Next in line.
Help you?
Yeah, I need to cash a check, please.
I.D.
and most recent pay stub.
You realize there's a 20% fee
for cashing a personal check
this size?
Yeah, that's fine.
Hundreds okay?
Sure.
( sighs )
Hey.
What's up?
Be better if I got my job back.
That ain't going to happen.
You talk to him?
Yeah.
Find anything?
Maintenance man at an apartment building.
But they want somebody with experience.
Anything else?
McDonald's, but they're talking minimum wage.
Wouldn't be so bad if it was all you can eat, though, huh, G?
Hey, what's this? X Box, G.
Yeah, I can see that.
What are you doing with it?
My friends heard about me getting fired
so they gave it to me. What friends?
You know, my boys.
They gave it to me.
They won it or something.
Leon... did it come in a box?
Every once in a while
you'll have a really perfect cigarette
you know?
Everything about it is perfect--
the taste, the moment.
Of course, 99% of the time, it tastes like crap.
It causes cancer.
That, too.
I left you a message.
How did it go?
With what?
With your brother.
Are you going to let me in
or do I have to guess, or... ?
Nothing happened.
Nothing.
Come on.
Despite the best laid plans, nothing happened.
Mostly because they left.
What?
They went off into the sunset together.
It was very romantic.
Wait, your mom and Eric-- they're gone?
You know... I don't really want to talk about this right now
'cause it's ruining my perfect smoke.
I'm sorry.
It's okay. I'm done.
I'm done with the both of them.
I'm done with all of it.
Cancel Christmas.
