Previously on ER.
Just you please slow down!
Look out!
You need structure and stability.
Let go.
Someone you can rely on and trust.
That's not you anymore, okay?
Syphilis is not a word the voters love to hear.
Any way we can keep it out of my medical record?
The alderman-- did we ever get his labs back?
They're negative.
He could have untreated syphilis.
He's fine. Let it go.
CARTER: Looks like
you could use some new equipment around here.
What's this? White, liberal guilt?
Probably.
No, thanks.
He survived
a nine-millimeter bullet to the brain.
His IQ dropped about 40 points.
What were you doing with Dukey and those boys?
Did they just hurt you?
Yo, Biz, let me talk to you for a minute.
Stay away from him. You understand that?
WOMAN: He tried climbing a giant ficus in our living room.
Sit back.
Ooh!
No biting. Bad monkey.
His psychiatrist says
that letting Zavery act out his impulses
allows him to better express himself.
Is he on any medication?
Oh, he has an asthma inhaler,
but he hasn't been using that the last couple of days.
not since he entered his simian role-playing phase.
Dr. Lewis, could you help me with this?
Six-foot fall, possible corneal abrasion.
Uh, yeah, put him in Exam Two.
I'll be there in a minute.
How you doing, Aidan?
You know the opening goes in the back, right?
Right.
Oh, you're a wrestler.
Yeah.
Seems to be working for you.
Thanks.
What do you do?
I'm a doctor.
No, I mean, to stay in shape.
Oh. I, uh, I do these.
Bicep curls.
Mm-hmm.
How much?
Sometimes I can lift
a whole pitcher of margaritas.
Bastards.
It's from the cigarettes, isn't it?
Probably.
The biopsy reveals small cell carcinoma.
The x rays show metastatic spread.
I need you to write me up a full disclosure
so I can file a lawsuit against tobacco companies.
Mr. Carmichael, you've been smoking cigarettes
since you were a teenager.
So?
So you might take some responsibility for that.
Instead of looking for someone else to blame,
you should be concentrating on how to manage your disease,
make the most out of the time you have left.
I get it.
This is just the HMOs and big business
covering each other's asses.
Well, screw you, pal.
I'll see you in court.
No, you won't.
( coughing ): Oh, yeah?
You don't think I won't sue you, too?
You're not going to live that long.
What was that all about?
Stupidity.
On whose part, his or yours?
What is it with this country?
Nobody takes responsibility for anything.
Always looking for someone else to blame, someone to sue.
You don't like it, go back to Croatia.
Not near as many lawyers.
Lot more land mines, though.
22-year-old female, head injury. BP: 90/60; pulse: 110.
What's her name?
Brenda Walton.
Weaver!
Hey, don't start, Robert.
I got a full...
Who knew you were such a conniving,
manipulative seductress?
Well, I did, actually,
but you have out-Weavered yourself this time.
What are you talking about?
We were just allotted $2.4 million in new funding.
What?
Yeah, you remember Alderman Bright?
He was in here a couple of weeks ago,
and somehow your team of miscreants
managed to not kill him.
I know, I am as surprised as you are.
Well, he must have been impressed with County.
Yeah, either that or the prostate massage.
In any case, he's coming by this afternoon with a...
What are you talking about?
...a camera crew for a photo-op,
so make sure you broom all these degenerates
before he gets here, okay?
Hey, these patients are precisely why
we're getting this funding.
Don't ruin this for me.
( exhaling )
Open up, G, open up!
Use your key.
I don't have it. Come on! It's an emergency.
All right, all right.
G!
Stop pounding.
Stop pounding!
What?
Get your doctor stuff!
Biz hurt. He's hurt bad!
What happened to him?
I got shot, man.
Who shot him?
I don't know! It happened so fast!
Fix him up, G! Like you fixed me.
I can't. He has a chest wound.
I have to get him to the hospital.
I need to call 9-1-1.
No hospitals, man. They're going to be looking for me.
Who? The police?
What the hell happened, Leon?
It was an accident!
We were going to take some beers and stuff
from the liquor store.
This was a robbery?
But the security guard showed up
and people just started shooting!
Listen to me, go inside and close the door.
Do not come out.
Do not look out the window.
Anybody comes by, don't answer the door.
You understand me? Leon!
That's what I like to see: med students hitting the books.
What are you reading?
Uh, Tintinalli-- acute abdominal pain.
Tintinalli?
Read Zachary Cope's early diagnosis of the acute abdomen.
He wrote it 80 years ago
and nothing has changed.
( clicks tongue ): Damn it.
You, uh, you okay, sir?
Yeah, yeah.
No, I got it.
I got it.
All right, I'll, uh
I'll get housekeeping to mop it up.
Please just get it off!
We will. Just try and relax, Brenda.
Okay, let's start with ten of morphine and a gram of Ancef.
She was demonstrating the cruelty of fur trapping
at the university.
Good thing you didn't try to chew it off.
Is that a joke?
Do you know how many animals suffer needless, painful deaths
every year in the name of the fur trade?
Will you help me open this?
Sure.
Thanks.
So... what's it going to be, huh?
Chechnya or the Congo?
Oh, um...
still thinking about it.
Thinking about what?
Carter's going away
with Alliance de Medicine Internacionale.
Really?
Uh... something I'm thinking about doing for the spring.
Oh, he's going.
I've done it three times
and it makes what we do here
look like... I don't know.
Okay, got this?
Yeah, thanks.
( metallic clank )
I'll be right back.
I've been doing PT every day since I came out of surgery.
Recovery ebbs and flows.
Patience and attitude can be just as important
during rehab as ...
Look, don't give me any of that crap.
I'm losing what little strength I had,
and sensory function is nonexistent.
What do you want, Robert?
Your limb was severed.
Hey, I'm not some poor schmuck
who's worried about how's he's going to be able
to hold his beer can while he whacks away watching TV.
I want my arm back.
It's a miracle of modern medicine
that you have what you do.
Chechnya?
Yeah, we talked about this.
No, we didn't.
Yeah, remember that time that I said
I thought I'd like to practice medicine abroad?
Yeah.
Well...
I thought you meant Paris or something.
Well, they desperately need doctors.
So do we.
What's that stink?
Dr. Lewis got hit with flying feces. Ah.
You know, I find a clipboard is a good shield
for projectile body fluids.
Thanks for the tip and for the sweater.
Abby, can you set up a Wood's lamp
for my monkey boy's corneal abrasion?
He still armed and dangerous?
I think he's out of ammo.
Hey, Dr. Carter, your doctor friend's in triage.
McNulty?
Yeah, he must've wandered in.
He seems altered.
Doreen Brant, 32, took a header down a flight of stairs.
Abby, can you give this to Luka? I have to change.
Sure, Curtain Three.
BP: 124/72; pulse: 96.
MAN: Is he here?
Who?
Sutter. One of our guys was shot during a robbery attempt.
They said they were bringing him here.
Frank?
Got a shooting victim en route,
but nobody said he was a cop.
Maybe they were bringing him in a squad car.
Can you check dispatch?
Sure, I'm on it.
ROMANO: Who summoned a surgical consult?
You're here for a consult?
No, I heard Weaver was teaching a Jazzercise class
out in the Ambulance Bay.
Okay, okay, I didn't know you were doing this again.
You don't have to jump all over me.
Don't even.
Wouldn't think of it.
Aidan Fenwick, this is Dr. Romano.
Aidan developed a gluteal abscess on his right buttock.
Aha.
Oh! I'll say.
You been using steroids?
I was.
He stopped. Not soon enough.
If you enjoy having testicles bigger than raisins,
I'd suggest you don't start using again.
I was going to drain it hit here,
but I could feel a deep perirectal component.
Oh, we all know what a pain in the ass that can be. Good call.
Aidan, your infection has spread up along your rectum,
so we're going to be taking you up to the OR.
I need surgery?
We can't do it here.
Do you want me to get Corday?
Nope, I got this.
Who's going to do the actual surgery?
I will be supervising one of my residents.
Hey, you, give me a hand.
Yeah, that's what I was worried about.
Officer Jason Sutter, 39.
BP's holding at 100/74 after two liters.
How many times was he hit?
Two entry wounds that I could see.
I heard four shots, felt two hits.
.22, .25 caliber.
Hurts like hell all the way down my leg.
Pulse is regular at 106.
Gave him eight of MS.
Any pain in your chest or head?
No. Somebody call Jenny.
You can call yourself in a few minutes.
Hang in there, Hoss.
Okay, Susan, page Corday.
Okay.
CARTER: Mental status?
He's oriented times two.
Dr. McNulty?
Hey, Mac, you know where you are?
I got patients.
He might be in DKA.
Let's bolus a liter of saline, CBC, chem 7, serum ketones, UA.
He's got a pulse of 130, BP: 90/60.
Hey, Mac, have you been vomiting?
Do you have a fever?
Just a cold.
Dr. Carter, we have another hot GSW rolling in.
Be right there.
Accu check is over 400. Damn it!
You have to stop jumping around, Zavery. Zavery!
Where's mom?
She had to make a phone call.
Yeah, to the adoption agency if she's smart.
Proparacaine drops are in.
Zavery,
would you please come out now?
Forget it.
I can't use the gorilla-scope
if you won't come out.
LOCKHART: Oh, right.
We'll have to bring it back to the zoo.
Zavery, can you lie still while we look in your eye?
( grunting )
Okay.
Okay.
I'm going to put some yellow banana medicine in your eye...
see if you scratched it.
Okay, now blink your eye.
All right.
No corneal abrasions.
No signs of scratching.
Susan?
What?
Your sweater.
Oh, my God.
Is that semen?
This isn't my sweater.
Oh, gross.
22-year-old African American male,
gunshot wound to the left chest.
Parasternal GSW to the third left intercostal space.
Tubed for agonal resps. What are you doing with this?
I found him.
Where?
What difference does it make?
I'm being a good Samaritan.
You got a problem with that?
Pulse is up to 110 with two liters.
He needs a chest tube.
This guy a friend of yours?
We're not all related, you know.
He's tachy at 120.
Let's type and cross
for four units and get two units of O-neg going.
All right, sterile gloves.
Prep the left side.
I need a thoraseal with a cell saver.
Pulse ox 95 on 100%.
Pupils are four millimeters and reactive.
What's his name?
I don't know. Cops got his wallet.
Biz Cummins.
Biz, can you hear me?
What's with all the boys in blue?
Cop got shot. Might've been this guy right here.
Neck veins are flat, no signs of tamponade.
KOVAC: I'll do the line-- seven and a half.
CORDAY: I've got two criticals coming up.
I'm going to need someone from vascular surgery.
Did you get a good look at the guy who shot you, Sutter?
There were three of them.
I don't know who pulled the trigger.
How long is that going to take?
No, no, that's unacceptable.
Someone take this bloody phone.
What about the guy next door?
Hey, Doc, can you move for a second?
PRATT: Can't you see I'm busy
trying to save this guy?
He might have shot this officer.
He's not going anywhere. Dori?
No, but his other two buddies are still on the loose.
Blood in the pericolic gutters and Morrison's.
Let's pack him up.
No DP pulse.
Does your leg tingle?
Yeah, like it's asleep.
Liter up.
First hemacue 12.
What's this?
Metal fragments.
He either embolized a bullet fragment,
or the hematoma's compressing the artery.
Either way, the clock's ticking.
KOVAC: Okay, line's in.
Let's hook up the blood.
CARTER: Let's run the O-neg
through the central line when I'm done.
Okay, there's one OR free,
and one anesthesiologist.
My police officer is borderline hypotensive.
I need to take him up.
What's the output like?
Pretty brisk.
500cc's and counting.
He could have a massive hemothorax.
He needs surgery. Whoa, we're not there yet.
Oh, no? What are the indications
for immediate thoracotomy in the OR?
1,200cc's immediate output.
This guy's at 900, but he's
slowing down. You're not thinking
of taking up this lowlife first, are you?
CARTER: It's all about who's in the worst shape
medically, sir.
The guy in there is a cop.
It's going to be 30 minutes before another OR's ready.
Well, can you keep transfusing
and just give me five minutes?
You've got three.
Oh silk and opsite.
First unit in.
500 hanging from the cell saver.
It's slowing down.
How much?
A little above 920.
( alarms stop )
Pressure's up to 110 systolic.
All right, good.
He clotted off the bleeder.
I'll tell them to send up the cop.
Hold on.
950cc's, and that's it for now. Come on, Carter.
You need to keep an eye on his pressure
and an eye on the chest tube output.
BP's 118/78; heart rate's 92.
This guy's rock stable.
All right, if there's another 1,000cc's
in the next two hours, he goes up.
DORI: Pressure's dropping-- 96/74.
Our guy's good; take this one up.
Thank you, Dr. Pratt.
You heard him. Let's roll.
When's he going to be able to answer some questions?
I'll let you know.
( sighs )
( sighs )
I keep feeling like I'm going to puke.
Is there any chance you could be pregnant?
I don't even talk to guys unless I have to.
Helen is complaining
of intermittent right-sided abdominal pain.
She has no fever and a loss of appetite.
Okay.
I think it's a tumor.
I doubt it.
Are you going to say anything?
What am I supposed to say?
It's got to be something else.
Really? What else do you know of
that luminesces under a Wood's lamp?
Oh, it's just so wrong.
Okay, take a deep breath.
Ow.
Do you have any history of gallstones?
Parents? Aunts? Uncles?
No.
Can I die from gallstones?
No.
Okay, let's get LFTs
and a right upper quadrant ultrasound for gallstones.
You know, the real question is, who does it belong to?
Pratt?
Oh...
Frank? Ew!
Jerry? Ooh, stop it!
You're creeping me out.
This guy reeks.
Oh, the copper and Clorox aroma
of a vigorous mixed bacterial infection.
Smells like surgery.
Come on, Jensen, and get in there
and break up those loculations.
If you didn't have to dig,
I would've let those ER stooges do it.
Irrigation.
Oh, little bleeder there. Bovie.
Where?
Just at the inferior edge of the piriformis.
Uh, up on the bovie. More suction.
No, no, no, no!
Not up on the bovie.
Vascular clamp and 3-0 silk.
Pressure: 110/70.
Alcock's canal? Inferior gluteal artery?
Ever heard of those?
I'm having a hard time locating...
Stick-tie that thing before the guy bleeds to death.
All right, give me that.
( alarm sounding ) Turn that thing off.
Hold that up.
All right, now more
that... back this way.
More. Ow, ow!
Stop.
Do you want me to get Corday?
No.
Dr. Romano... No!
( alarm continues ) Did you page vascular?
Twice. Dr. Dorset said he's on his way.
Who?
The new guy.
Laps. Pack around the mesentery.
( alarm continues )
Oh, damn.
Tachy at 110.
Another vascular clamp.
SMA repair looks good.
It's nice of you to finally join us, Dr. Dorset.
This gentleman has a bullet fragment in the femoral artery.
He's going to need a graft or a bypass.
You're in for a long night.
Really?
Well, they call me "Fast Eddie" for a reason--
several in fact.
Ten blade, please.
Stand by with a number four French catheter
bulbs, and have a 3cc heparinized saline ready.
You're going to do a Fogarty embolectomy?
Clamp.
Well, I prefer to call it
the "Dorset Bulletectomy."
Heparin flush.
There's no back flow.
It's totally occluded.
Yup. Fogarty.
Okay, give me a hand here.
Excuse me? Remove the wire.
Oh.
Got it.
( humming )
Hey, somebody's glad to see me.
Clamp off.
Feeding
the catheter.
Pressure and pulse are steady.
Give me your hand.
Excuse me? Your hand.
Now...
he's got healthy interior walls.
I mean, any resistance you feel
against that balloon is the wall itself.
Do you feel that right...
right... there?
Yeah.
Okay, remember it.
Any harder, and you can rupture the wall.
It'll feel hard,
and then suddenly, the balloon
will inflate too easily
meaning you blew through the wall.
Right.
Okay. Bowel fine.
He's a lucky man.
Nothing in my hand
nothing up my sleeve, and...
( metallic clink )
TRAN: Good popliteal pulse.
His leg's pinking up.
Thank you. Thank you very much.
I'll be here all week,
and don't forget to tip your waitress.
GALLANT: You look good.
HARKINS: I feel better.
Okay, it's official.
Thanks.
Hey, Gallant, could you help Dr. Chen
with the thoracentesis on Mr. Atkins?
Okay. Good luck.
Thanks.
Thoracentesis, huh?
Shaw's, 8:00?
I'll be there.
All right. Thanks.
Hey.
Hey.
Feeling better?
Compared to the last time you saw me, yeah.
Yeah, I was going to...
Actually, I need your signature.
Um, resident review.
Yeah, sure.
So, what's next?
I mean, your next rotation?
Um, pediatrics.
Okay, thanks.
Hey, Erin...
You know what? I really have to get going.
I-I know. I just...
I never got a chance to talk to you.
I was in the hospital for three weeks.
I'm sorry.
I was having a bad time.
I never meant to hurt you.
Then you should have slowed down.
Leon, pick up the phone.
I need to talk to you. It's me.
Don't worry...
I'll call you back.
What's the word on Officer Sutter?
Last I heard, he was still in surgery.
The guy you brought in-- did he have a gun on him?
I don't know.
So, what? You just found this guy in the street?
Yeah.
Did you see anybody else with him?
No. Did you hear gunshots?
No.
Hey, Pratt, your boy's losing his pressure, man.
What's in the thoraseal?
950cc's, just like it was.
Well, he's got to be bleeding from somewhere.
Maybe it's the belly.
I can't get pressure with the dynamap.
I'll go get Carter.
Get two more units on the infuser.
So, when are you leaving me?
What?
When are you planning on running off to the jungle?
Oh. Well...
I haven't really decided
if that's something I'm going to do yet.
Really? Luka made it sound like you had.
Luka's a big advocate of the program.
You thought it was cool when he went.
Yeah, Luka went home to his own country,
and he didn't have a girlfriend
asking him not to go.
You could come with me.
Like I don't have enough drama in my life already.
Well, well, well.
If it ain't the Ken and Barbie of the medical world.
You look better.
I am better.
Hello, beautiful.
Hello.
His blood sugar level was over 600, but his serum ketones
levels were negative.
Well, I could have told you that.
Type II diabetics don't get ketoacidosis.
Oh, it was a hypersmolar coma.
You needed insulin and IV fluids,
both of which could have been avoided
if you had taken your medication as directed.
I gave it to a patient of mine.
He couldn't afford his own.
Carter... Pratt needs you.
You should have paged me.
Get ultrasound in here.
When did he crash?
Just now. Nothing out the chest.
I'm guessing the bullet tracked down
to the belly.
From the third intercostal space?
Milk it. What?
Pressure's only 50 palp.
Clots.
When there's no drainage, you milk the chest tube.
( alarm sounds )
Okay, he's in V-tach.
Starting compressions.
Charge to 200.
PRATT: At least another liter in there.
And clear.
V fib.
Thoracotomy tray.
Let's go. Splash the chest. Pratt!
Get the rib spreader ready.
All right, come on, Pratt!
What the hell are you doing here, Leon?
I wanted to see you.
What are you doing to him?
CARTER: He got shot. Statinsky.
Get those internal paddles ready.
Leon, you shouldn't be here.
Get him out of here.
I really need to talk to you, G.
Could you put him in the suture room?
What for?
He's here for a wound check,
and make sure you put him in a gown.
Is-Is he going to die, G?
Just shut the hell up,
and get out of here! Go!
Okay, we are clamped.
Start pumping.
He needs more blood.
How many units?
Four units. His heart is empty.
Charge to 30. Clear.
MALIK: Still in V fib.
Another amp of epi.
30 again.
How long has he been down?
35 minutes.
Clear.
MALIK: Asystole.
You ready to call this?
CARTER: We could try more epi.
I don't think so.
He's young.
He's been down too long.
Call it.
Time of death: 14:45. ( removing gloves )
Is his family here?
I don't know.
LEON: Everything worked out?
PRATT: He didn't make it, man.
He died. Oh, no!
He's dead. ( blubbering )
( Leon sobbing and blubbering )
ROMANO: You move any slower, Jensen,
this guy's going to heal before we can sew him up.
Giving one of your inspirational speeches, Robert?
Elizabeth.
I thought you were doing an arterial caval shunt.
Another lap to me.
I take it he died.
On the contrary-- I'm finished.
The patient's in recovery.
I heard you were having some difficulty, though.
You were misinformed.
Apparently.
I didn't realize you were back on surgical rotation.
Just assisting Jensen.
Ah.
So, uh,
how are we doing, Jensen?
Fine, thank you.
Good hemostasis, no leak.
The posterior femoral cutaneous nerve
runs right next to the artery.
It's easy to cut both.
And the head bone's connected to the what again?
Would you like me to scrub in?
To check?
No.
It would be such a shame
for this young man to come in for an abscess
and go home with a drop foot
because of a severed sciatic nerve.
You're right, you know, and look.
I just figured out a way
you can help me-- leave.
Labs are back.
This is Sydney's friend, Fiona.
What did she take?
She didn't.
Tox screen is negative for everything.
Did you find any pill fragments? No.
ABBY: Looks like, uh,
nuts.
And cherries, maybe.
I smell chocolate.
Her boyfriend cheated on her,
and she went on a banana split spree.
So you called 9-1-1?
I didn't. She did.
She wanted to get her stomach pumped.
She must have ate like 50,000 calories.
Sometimes she binges and purges.
Sometimes? She's lost her gag reflex
from sticking her finger down her throat so many times.
LEWIS: Luka, obviously,
she has an eating disorder.
No, I'll tell you what an eating disorder is.
It's when a mother hasn't eaten in six days because
she's giving what little food she has to her three children.
She just cost the hospital $3,000
and for what?
So she doesn't put on a pound?
LEWIS: Luka...
It's cheaper than liposuction.
CARTER: Did you know him?
Was he a friend of yours?
What are you doing in here?
Came to check on Leon.
Couldn't find his chart.
I'm working on it.
Need any help?
No.
I don't mind.
He seems kind of shaken up about Biz.
That was your friend's name, right? Biz?
Could you excuse us, please?
This is between me and my patient.
Yeah.
Why don't you come find me when you are done.
( door opening, closing )
Did you tell him you know Biz?
No.
I don't know. Maybe.
If I did, it was an accident.
An accident?
It's always an accident with you, isn't it, Leon?
I'm telling you the truth, G.
You told me it was a security guard that shot him.
It wasn't a security guard. It was a cop.
I didn't get a good look.
It happened really fast.
Did you have a gun? It was Biz's idea.
Did you shoot at the police?
I don't know.
I don't... maybe.
I don't remember, G.
Everybody just started shooting.
( sobbing ): I-I'm sorry, G.
Please, I don't want to go to jail.
Don't let them put me in jail, G!
I-I'm sorry, G.
I don't want to go to jail.
I'm going to go out on a limb here
and guess that you're having a bad day.
I'm tired of treating patients
who think ice cream is an emergency.
I'm just tired of it.
I think maybe you should talk to him.
He seems a little depressed.
He's European. That's his baseline.
And besides, I'm still mad at him
for putting that adventure doctor idea into Carter's head.
CORDAY: Mr. Hennessey in Exam One can go home.
Oh, thanks.
How's the cop?
Good. He's going to be fine.
So, this is where you hide out.
Hi, Dr. Corday, right?
Dr. Dorset?
Yes.
Is there something wrong
with Mr. Sutter? No one paged me...
No, no, no. H-He's, he's fine.
I was just wondering if, um,
you wanted to grab some coffee or something?
CORDAY: Um...
I appreciate the offer,
but to be honest,
I'm swamped...
at the moment, so... Right.
Uh, perhaps some other time.
I'm going to hold you to that.
I like coffee. ( Abby chuckling )
He's cute.
Was I rude?
No. No.
( sighs )
Look, the problem is that, um, you know,
I go home half expecting Mark
to be playing with Ella in the backyard.
It's been... a long time since I...
you know, talked to another man.
I think I overreacted.
It was only coffee.
I think Mark would
want you to get on with your life.
I also think if a good-looking guy
is interested in you,
and you're not interested in him,
the least you can do is introduce me.
Hmm.
Thank you.
I'm not kidding. ( both chuckling )
Mrs. Hughes?
Where you going?
Huh? Let's get you back this way, okay?
Now, there's supposed to be...
BRIGHT: Looks like you've got your hands full.
Hi.
Hello.
John Bright.
Uh, she has Alzheimer's.
Oh, poor thing.
Mrs. Hughes, let's get you back in your bed, okay?
Your daughter will be here in just a minute.
Could you please...?
( sighs )
Uh, I guess I owe you a very big thank you.
You provide an invaluable service.
It's the least I could do.
I just hope that we earned the allocation
based on our merit as a health care provider
for the community.
Had I not been brought here, Dr. Weaver,
I probably would not have pushed
for County to get the additional funding.
Did you give me special treatment?
Well, I...
Of course you did.
From what I've seen, you give everyone
who comes through these doors special treatment.
And that kind of dedication deserves to be rewarded.
Oh...
Oh, uh, sorry.
Got to go.
Somebody dropped this off for you.
Made me promise to give it to you personally.
I'm thinking nude blackmail photos?
Not again.
Is this because of McNulty?
What?
You leaving, going to a foreign land
to bring medicine to the natives?
No, I-I mean it.
'Cause he lives in the back of a free clinic,
you don't do enough?
I don't know. Maybe that's got something to do with it.
I don't know why you didn't talk to me about this.
I'm not going anywhere right now.
You talked to Luka about it.
And even if I was, it's for two weeks.
Yeah, and some of these places are really dangerous.
I thought you forgot about me.
You need to go back on insulin.
Oh, no. Oh, yes.
30 NPH in the morning,
15 in the evening, same as before.
I need you need to check your sugars four times a day.
( laughing )
I'd be lucky to find four times during the week to do that.
Maybe you can hire an assistant.
Or find the time to remind yourself.
What's this?
A check.
I can see that.
But I can't take it.
Why not?
Well, for one thing, it's got too many zeroes.
Get some new equipment.
Hire a nurse.
Hire a physician's assistant.
I'm not going to have to name the place after you, am I?
No.
Although "The Carter Family Clinic"
does have kind of a nice ring to it.
Thank you, John.
You're welcome.
How'd you like
to come work for me, beautiful?
Do you have a dental plan?
WEAVER: No, I'm not giving you any time off.
I have sick days.
Are you kidding?
You're lucky you still have a job.
I need time to sort things out.
Yeah, I agree.
And you need to do it on your own time.
Wait...
Hey, where are you going?
Dr. Kovac, can I get a little help? No.
Steven Rafferty, 65 with chest pain,
partially relieved by nitro.
Get a 12 lead and titrate ten of morphine, go.
Sir, can you tell me on a scale of one to ten
what your pain level is?
Luka!
He seems pissed.
Been out here almost two hours.
I figured you couldn't
go that long without a cigarette.
What are you doing here?
Thank you.
Sure you don't want something to eat?
I'm fine, thanks.
Good, I need the gas money.
How's Carter?
He's good.
I like him.
Me, too.
It was the disease.
I was scared.
I was afraid that I was going to end up like Mom.
I didn't want you to see me like that.
Like Maggie.
I never meant to hurt you.
If it wasn't for you, I don't know where I'd be.
It wasn't your fault. You couldn't help it.
It's just....
You protected me for so long,
I felt like I'd let you down.
That's not true.
That could never be true.
I just wish, sometimes, I was eight years old again,
'cause even when things got bad,
and they got bad,
I knew you'd always be there.
And I always will be.
Yeah, but no one's ever there for you.
And, uh, I turned my back on you,
after everything that you did for me,
and for Mom.
And that was a really crappy thing to do.
And I'm sorry.
You don't have to apologize.
I do.
I want to.
I love you, Abby.
You deserve a better family.
( chuckling )
And I just wanted you to know that...
I'm okay.
Unfortunately,
I had to get, um, bad before I got better.
It's not over, you know.
Yeah, I know.
Want to see a picture of my new girlfriend?
Sure.
What do you think?
It's a plane.
Yeah, I bought it.
Sold, uh, my car, my bike, just about everything.
Um, I'm going to run
hunting and fishing charters in Wisconsin.
You're going to be a bush pilot.
( chuckling )
Pretty cool, huh?
It's probably just a mild virus
that will go away on its own.
I'm going to send off, uh, some more bloodwork,
so you'll need to follow up with your family doctor, okay?
Hey, Susan. You up for dinner?
No, I'm going home
and I'm going to take a three-hour bath.
Oh, come on, you can do that after dinner.
I know this great new Thai place.
Hmm... oh, Jing-Mei, thank you.
Oh, sure.
( sighing )
So?
Um, I was using the Wood's lamp today,
uh, when I was wearing your sweater,
and some stuff showed up on it.
Like what?
Well, there were just some stains on your sweater.
I mean, it's none of my business,
I thought you might
just want to get it dry cleaned.
It was club soda.
What?
Yeah, Susan.
I opened up a can this morning and it sprayed all over me.
That's why I had to take off the sweater, to let it dry.
Oh.
Oh.
Club soda.
Yeah.
Soda water glows under black lights, remember?
Good.
I just thought... I don't know.
What, what's your thought?
That, um, I'm this ER slut
with spunk all over her sweater?
No, no, Jing-Mei...
( sighing )
Somebody claim that body?
No.
I heard the cop's going to be okay.
Good.
Pratt.
What do you want from me?
I just want to help you.
Or, at least, prevent you
from getting yourself into trouble.
I'm not in trouble.
What about Leon?
I don't know.
He seemed pretty scared today.
Yeah.
He's a scared little kid.
Except he's not a little kid.
He's 27, and he was probably involved
in a robbery that left a cop shot
and somebody else dead.
I think the cops
are probably going to blame this on Biz.
If Leon went away for a while,
I doubt anybody would go looking for him.
You know what?
I try to keep him out of trouble,
but he wants to have his own friends, he wants to be cool.
And they talk him into doing stuff.
I can't watch him every minute of the day.
I can't.
You ought to learn to let go.
Stop blaming yourself.
Tell Leon I said good-bye.
Gallant.
I need you to do me a favor.
What do you say we go out to dinner tonight?
Someplace nice?
At least for me.
I can't.
Eric's picking me up.
Eric, your brother?
Mm-hmm.
He's here.
And he's on his meds.
He's picking you up to do what?
Um, he's taking me to see his airplane.
He bought an airplane.
Yes.
Want me to go with you?
No.
I think it will be okay.
He seems really, really good.
Are you going to go flying with him?
No.
I'm supportive, not stupid.
I have to go by McNulty's clinic anyway.
He forgot his prescriptions.
So I'll just call you after that?
Okay.
Good luck. Thanks.
Don't go flying with him.
Don't go to Chechnya.
What are you doing?
Your resident asked for a curbside.
And?
There's an area of sensory loss
on the posterior aspect of the thigh.
Jensen bagged the posterior femoral cutaneous.
But there's no foot drop.
The sciatic, tibial, and peroneal are completely intact,
although he'll probably be left with some numbness in his thigh.
I guess he got lucky then.
Yes, he did.
Where's Jensen?
He said he was going up to the roof.
To get a patient?
To jump.
Here you go.
Got some, uh, snacks for you for the trip.
How far is Baltimore?
Ah, you should get there tomorrow night.
Really?
Yeah.
That's cool.
So, uh, you've got the phone number for Greg's Aunt Rose?
Yup.
Let's go ahead and get you on the bus then, now.
What about Greg?
Well, uh, he's going to call you in a few days.
He's not coming?
No, Leon, listen to me.
You're supposed to go visit
his Aunt Rose for a while, okay?
Yeah, right, but is he going to at least say good-bye?
Look, uh, he's working
at the hospital.
( sobbing ): He's mad at me.
No, no, Leon look.
He's just, he's just really busy, man.
He's just really busy.
He sent me away because I messed up.
No... I'm so stupid!
Leon, Leon, that is not true, okay?
I need to talk to him.
Okay, look, Leon, you got to get on that bus.
I don't want to do this.
Leon, listen to me.
You have to get on that bus.
All right, come on then.
Come on.
Come on.
You have a good trip, okay?
Be safe.
Don't do it, Jensen!
My car's down there.
Your patient's going to be fine.
The leg should be fully functional.
There was nerve damage.
Yeah, but it was minimal.
Hey, you'll do better next time.
You're right.
Because I won't go into surgery with you.
( helicopter whirring overhead )
( knocking )
Hey, Dr. McNulty!
You in there?
Hey...
( knocking )
Dr. McNulty?
Mac, you in there? It's John.
Is there a problem here, sir?
No, no, I'm an ER doctor from County.
One of my patients lives here.
I, I think he might be
in a little bit of trouble, actually.
Well, did you try calling him?
Yeah, and nobody's answering.
He's kind of a stubborn old guy
and I treated him today with insulin,
and I'm worried that if he didn't eat any dinner
he might be in a coma from low blood sugar.
Okay, you want me to call an ambulance?
I just need to get inside.
( banging )
CARTER: Hey, Mac.
Doesn't look like he's here, sir.
This is his clinic.
This has been his clinic for 20 years.
He lives back there.
I been working this beat since '95, sir.
That clinic was only here a few weeks.
It used to be, uh, a Christian bookstore
and a tanning parlor before that, so...
I was here three days ago.
Well, these clinics, they come and go.
Some are legit, but lots aren't.
Was that guy even a real doctor?
I don't know.
( chuckling )
