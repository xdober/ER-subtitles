Previously on ER:
Trying to travel to Matenda,
but the main road is blocked.
You're going, right--
to Africa?
Est-ce que c'est la première fois
que vous venez à Kinshasa?
I'm sorry. I don't speak French.
English?
Long journey.
Yeah, I started yesterday.
( clearing throat): Chicago.
Chicago. Michael Jordan
right?
( chuckling )
Yeah. You're going to the Congo on business?
I'm a doctor.
Where will you stay in the capital?
I'm not staying in Kinshasa.
Going on to Kisangani.
Kisangani-- it's in the east.
A doctor in Kisangani.
You will be busy.
Very busy.
MAN: Dr. Carter?
Dr. Carter?
Dr. Carter.
Dr. Carter.
Hi, I'm John.
Charles Baruani.
You doing good, Dr. John?
I could use a shower.
Next plane is only three hours.
Not so much nice as last one.
Many amputees.
Land mines?
Machetes.
Dr. Kovac still here?
Um, he's tall.
He's Croatian.
Lots of black hair, kind of...
Ah,
Luka!
Ah, all the ladies like Luka very much.
He's still at the clinic in Matenda.
Very dangerous place.
Mai Mai fight there.
So... we get mostly trauma,
disease, malnutrition?
Yes.
Any one thing more than the other?
Depends.
On what?
The day.
Welcome to Kisangani, Doctor.
( generator rumbling )
You must be
Dr. Carter.
Angelique Chada.
I was just coming to wake you.
I'm the on-site NGO physician.
You're a medium?
( clearing throat )
You've volunteered for an NGO before?
Um... no.
Is Dr. Kovac here?
Still in Matenda.
Charles tells me you don't speak French,
so, I'll get you someone to translate.
Need a coffee?
Yeah.
Jacques,
apportez un café au docteur.
Now, it's pretty simple here.
Fever and a cough is pneumonia.
Use cotrimoxazole.
Fever and watery diarrhea is cholera.
Rehydrate and use doxy.
If the patient has a fever without source,
assume it's malaria and treat it with fansidar.
If they have recurrent infections
and are wasting away, it's AIDS,
so, prepare the family for death.
What drugs do you have on hand?
Amoxicillin, doxycycline,
fansidar, metronidazole, chloramphelicol.
You still use chloramphelicol?
It's cheap.
What about the aplastic anemia?
75% of the children here
don't make it to their second birthday.
Aplastic anemia is the least of their worries.
For IV antibiotics, we have amp, gent and penicillin.
Cefoxitin, Unasyn, Cipro?
Nope.
What do you do for resistant bugs?
Pray.
If you take your meds, you should be okay.
If you do get a fever, take some fansidar.
Gillian?
Oui?
Gillian Ronin, meet Dr. Carter.
Enchanté.
John. Hi.
Gillian's an old hand.
She'll get you started.
She seems great.
She is.
Where's she from?
Bombay, I think.
She's been here six years.
How many doctors are there?
Counting you, four.
Peter is our Congolese internist,
Deni is from Paris,
Angelique is our surgeon,
and you already met Charles.
He handles logistics and supplies.
We have 200 patients
on six wards, and two surgical suites.
How many nurses?
Five, but the patients' family members
do most of the work.
( chuckles ) What?
Well, it's just the nurses back home
are always complaining about their patient loads.
It's usually about eight.
Yeah, but I wouldn't use the conditions here
as a positive example of anything.
What ward is this?
This is Admitting.
Elle a ete très fatiguée.
Elle a de la fievre et tremble.
Est-ce que la diarrhee?
Tousse-t'elle?
Non, mais elle est très malade.
Temp's 104.
Mom says she's got a headache.
No diarrhea or coughing.
Yeah, she's a little jaundiced, too.
Malaria it is.
Mm-hmm.
So, fansidar?
Yeah, two tablets.
This is going to fix you right up.
Ces medicaments devraient l'aider à se sentir mieux.
She doesn't get a bed?
For simple malaria, no.
Bonjour. Quel est
le probleme?
Saidi ne peux pas uriner.
Il a de la fievre, une toux et le nez qui coule.
Trouble with urination, fever and a cough.
His name's Saidi.
He's about 60 years too young
for an enlarged prostate.
Bladder's huge.
Yeah.
Full?
Nope. Manual compression.
Mild fever-- 101.5.
Are there any, uh, urinary tract infections
that local kids get?
No.
Nous allons l'aider à uriner
dans quelques secondes.
( speaking French )
Assiedes-toi.
Non, non, Papa,
laissez le faire.
Essais encore une fois.
Assiedes-toi.
Okay, tripod sign.
( speaking French )
Okay.
Okay.
Bladder paresis, tripod and head drop signs.
Uh, I'm sorry...
Poliomyelitis.
Without a spinal tap,
we use the tripod and head drop sign
as diagnostic tools.
He has polio?
Yes.
Très bien, mon cher.
C'est la polio?
Oui.
( anguished sigh )
( Ronin speaking French )
How's the jet lag?
It's terrible.
Is that all you're having?
( rueful chuckle )
I've had the food before.
It lacks a little something.
Taste.
Anyway, I'm on a liquid diet consumed entirely after dark.
Where are you from?
Your English is excellent.
Montreal.
We speak a little English up there.
How long have you been here?
Ten days.
I'm a volunteer like you.
Come back for a month every year.
My penance, I suppose.
Penance for what?
My wanton ways back in the world.
CHADA: Hello?
Am I interrupting, or can anyone just drop in?
You're not interrupting anything yet.
You two do know
that I'm sitting right here, right?
She asked how you're doing,
and I said you were doing great,
and that you'll be just fine on your own this afternoon.
So, where are you from?
Uh, Chicago.
I work with Dr. Kovac.
He called me when you got
short-handed.
I'd been thinking about volunteering.
Luka.
What's he like at home?
Um...
I should get back to work.
A tout a l'heure.
Luka...
took an immunization team out to Matenda
three days ago.
We don't get vaccines often,
and when we do, refrigeration is a challenge,
so, he grabbed a team and went.
When do you expect him back?
Yesterday.
It happens.
BASINAKE: Mama? Ce fait combien de temps que Joseph a cette toux?
A peu pres six jours.
On serait venu plus top mais
la marche a duree quatre jours.
( coughing )
He's had fever for a week.
Ronchi and retractions.
( inhaling )
Tell her that he has pneumonia,
and that we're going to make him better.
IV ampicillin.
Le docteur est entrain de l'aider.
Nous allons lui donner des medicaments
et il devrait aller mieux tres rapidemment.
Merci, docteur. Merci.
You're welcome.
Hi.
Who's sick, you or...?
Mon espouse.
Basinake?
Yes, Doctor.
This woman is dead.
Papa?
Le docteur a dit qu'elle est morte.
I knew.
She has been very ill.
Why didn't you tell us that she was so sick
when you came in?
She has had AIDS for many months.
I did not know where else to go.
Je serais bientot... a tes cotes, mon amour.
Je t'aime.
Bonjour.
Bonjour.
How is Fazila today?
Comment ca va?
Ca fait mal.
She's in pain, doctor.
Oh... tell her that I'm sorry that it's so painful,
but I need her to be brave, like I know that she is.
Tu dois etre très courageuse, ma petite...
Okay...
Le docteur a dit que tu iras mieux bientot,
mais il faut etre fort.
Bonjour, Ntam.
Bonjour.
Oh, great.
Power out everywhere?
There's only one line
from the turbine in the river to town.
Mai Mai cut it every couple of weeks.
How are you finding it here?
Busy.
But no insurance forms, no triple charting.
I love that. No health care system.
Personally, I wouldn't mind
filling out a few insurance forms
if it meant I could have an ultrasound.
Charles! Un denos camions!
Qu'est ce qu'il se passe!
On revenez, on les trouve sur la route!
KOVAC: Boy up front has a gunshot wound
to the left upper quadrant!
This one is a machete wound
to the right thigh, lots of blood loss!
Charles, start the generator!
Lumiere, j'ai besoin de lumiere!
Where are Peter and Deni?
Je pense qu'ils sont alles en!
Send someone to find them.
Small-caliber wound to the belly.
Pulse is 120; BP: 80/60.
This water's cold!
You want to wait for someone
to boil it again?!
Luka, take the hack wound. I'll explore the neck.
Dr. Carter, see if you can discover
what's wrong with this last one.
Where are the gloves?
In the basin.
Right over there.
Un, deux, trois!
That's how we found him.
We got a weak carotid,
and he's tachy.
How do you stabilize the neck? Sandbags.
Who's he?
Says that he's the brother.
He wouldn't let us leave without him.
Give me an ET tube.
We don't have ET tubes.
I can bag him.
Oh, great.
Ask him what happened.
I don't see any blood.
He's bleeding somewhere.
Belly's hard. Is he Mai Mai? Yeah.
I got a foreign body under the skin.
He says that a bee flew into his brother,
and his brother fell down.
Femur deformity, closed fracture.
What?
A bee flew into him.
A bee?
( buzzing )
We got a single entrance wound to the right axle.
Bag him on 15 liters. Make it two liters,
or we'll run out of oxygen.
BP est a cent huit sur soixante douze,
le pou est de quatre vingt quatorze.
I've got a GSW to the right axilla,
bullet ended up in the thigh.
An hour isn't enough time!
Unplug every light in the hospital.
How much time will that get us?
Four hours, maybe.
BP's 90/60.
Pulse: 130, pulseless foot.
Get his pressure up with two liters.
I'll be right back.
He's got a trans-thoracic GSW.
Bullet entered the armpit, dropped a lung,
transversed across the belly,
and ended up in the thigh
with enough force to break the femur.
Abdomen's stiff, Betadine.
Going to need a chest tube, maybe two.
Got peritoneal signs.
Positive DPL.
Where's the bullet?
To the left anterior thigh,
but you don't need a DPL; he meets surgical criteria;
he needs an E lap.
Knife.
He's Red Cross category four. Waste of resources.
Hand me that.
There. The least of his problems is solved.
Full-jacketed 7.62-millimeter
with four rifling grooves-- a Dragunov rifle.
His pressure's holding.
Dragunov's muzzle velocity is 830 meters per second.
It can kill from over a half mile away.
Closer, it does even more internal damage.
So we're just going to let him die?
If I take him first, he's going to take
at least five hours to stabilize,
and then he'll probably die anyway.
I have four hours of generator fuel left,
and three boys with injuries I can fix
before the power goes out.
Keep him stabilized.
If the lights are still on when I'm finished with the others,
I'll come back.
( patient breathing heavily )
Have you ever done an end-to-end anastamosis?
No.
Well, now's as good a time as any
to start your training as a vascular surgeon.
Anchor it with a simple overhand...
How much longer?
( sighs ): I don't know.
Still working on the last one.
We need more blood. That's the second unit.
I'm O-Negative.
I could donate.
You can't save the world.
Is that why you're here, working at the Ritz?
( chuckles ): Me? I'm in it for the money.
Thought we had another hour.
It's the roll.
What?
The roll.
They roll the generator fuel tank
when it gets near the bottom
so they can squeeze out every last drop.
Makes the lights flicker.
Last of the 6-O prolene.
Unclamping the femoral artery.
Got a pulse in the foot.
Good. Pack it and leave it open.
He still alive?
Yeah, barely. Prolonged hypertension.
Could be ischemic.
How much time do we have left?
Uh, half an hour or so.
Charles...
Okay, let's see what we can do.
Release pressure.
No bleeding.
All right, let's pack in there
with some more lap pads, come on.
We're out of lap pads.
They've got another five minutes
in the sterilizer.
( grunting )
Here.
I'm losing track. What else?
Uh, liver, spleen, removed a wedge of lung,
repaired the renal vein.
Still have the diaphragmatic repair,
and then we have to run the bowel.
Run of V-tach.
100 lidocaine. Start a drip.
Two milligrams per minute.
Duodenal hematoma. Stapler.
You're going to staple the duodenum?
Faster than sutures.
Okay, drip is 100 in 500 at ten drops per minute.
Okay, I'm going to run the bowel
while you do the diaphragm.
Oh, that's it?
CHARLES: Je viens, je viens!
ANGELIQUE: We're out of time.
We'll have to leave him open.
If he survives the night, we can come back
in the morning and repair the bowel.
There's still fecal matter in here.
It'll have to do.
Pack it. Then tape. Lots of tape.
He's oozing from his fingertips.
( pan clanking )
This is DIC?
Blood around the gums, too.
Are those clean lap pads done?
I can't get a pulse. Irregular.
Come on.
Lost it.
All right. I'm pulling the tape.
Dr. Carter...
( inhaling )
I can't find the heart.
All right. There it is.
I got it, I got it. Starting compressions.
No pulse, no pressure,
no resps.
He just needs more volume.
( exhales )
Leave him be.
Let him be, Doctor.
( sighs )
( sighing )
Tell him I'm sorry.
He knows.
( chair squeaking )
I didn't know you smoked.
Ah... I don't.
When did you get here?
Six days ago.
( sighs )
How much longer are you staying?
I don't know.
I'm going back to the clinic tomorrow.
I have patients there who can't be moved.
I came back for some supplies.
Welcome back.
Thank you.
I thought you might be upset.
About that boy.
I'm okay.
I'm exhausted.
I'm going to bed
and, um...
I hope someone will join me.
How's Abby?
I didn't do anything with Gillian, I swear.
So you won't mind if I...
No.
Knock yourself out.
I'll see you in the morning.
She took the pills you gave her, but the fever came back, Doctor.
Yeah, the fansidar isn't working.
Her malaria's advanced.
IV quinine, uh, ten per kilo
every eight hours.
Le docteur lui donnera des medicaments plus forts.
ANGELIQUE: John?
Meet Doctors Thorpe and O'Brien.
Americans. Fresh off the plane.
Damn, it's hot.
Actually, we got a little bit
of a breeze blowing today.
Gillian? Yes.
Would you finish the tour,
get them started down in triage?
Sure. Welcome.
What are you doing tomorrow?
Is that a trick question?
Charles brought vaccine in on the plane from Kinshasa.
Road's open, but who knows for how long.
Thought you might want to put together an immunization team.
See a bit of the country.
Yeah, where would we be going? Matenda.
but you'll have to find a nurse who's willing to go with you.
...and work in admitting.
CARTER: Who are they?
Interahamwe, Hunde, Banyarawanda.
Hard to tell anymore.
Everyone fights everyone else now.
FAC.
Government's army.
PATRIQUE: I grew up near here.
Everyone very happy.
It was beautiful.
I wish you could have seen it then.
Good trip?
Slow.
What'd you bring?
Polio, DPT, MMR.
Supplies.
What are all those people waiting for?
You.
( girl sobbing )
How do you say "Don't be afraid?"
Well, something like that.
N'aie pass por mon pissin.
( laughs )
She's laughing at me.
Your French is terrible.
See? Didn't even hurt.
Au revoir.
Bonjour.
Bonjour.
( coughing )
( wheezing )
Gillian.
Ask him how long
his son has had this cough.
GILLIAN: Papa, ca fait combien de
temps que ton fils tousses?
Ca fait quelques semains.
Il n'arrete pas de tousser.
About two weeks.
Do we have any erythromycin?
Only amoxicillin and ampicillin.
Pertussis?
Yeah.
Tell him that his son is sick
and we're going to give him
some medicine to try and make him feel better.
GILLIAN: Papa, il faut donner
des medicament a ton fils pour son toux.
Il devrais se sentir mieux.
Merci, madame.
GILLIAN: Charles? CHARLES: Oui?
Monsieur?
Oui? ( coughs )
Bonjour.
( gunfire )
That sounds close.
Yeah, a mile, maybe two.
Pertussis.
We don't have anything stronger than amoxicillin.
Did you tell that boy's father we could save him?
We can.
Whooping cough's
going to eat that amoxicillin for lunch.
He's going to die.
Die from a disease that we could wipe out
with a ten-dollar course of erythromycin.
We vaccinated 200 children today.
When was the last time you saved 200 lives in one afternoon?
( explosions approaching )
( country music playing )
Would you like a drink?
Willie Nelson?
Charles went to college in Texas.
CHARLES: Dr. John!
Get down!
Get down!
( child shrieking )
Luka!
Foot's missing above the ankle.
Get a BP cuff!
On se cacher dans notre maison
quand on a entendu une explosion terrible,
tres proche. ( girl screams )
Et puis elle n'arretais pas dee crier.
Lumiere, j'ai besson de lumiere!
( girl screeches ) Foot's gone.
We're going to operate below the knee.
Is there any surgical equipment here?
No.
What about anesthesia? Ketamine?
Only lidocaine.
Okay.
We need to do a Bier block with lido. Gillian!
Yes? Start an IV in the popliteal.
( girl screeches )
KOVAC: Somebody please get
this poor girl's mother away from here.
Charles, get a suture kit
and the biggest kitchen knife you can, and a saw.
We're going to need to sterilize some sort of saw.
What's her name? Chance.
Chance...
( girl screaming )
GILLIAN: She's unconscious.
Okay, skin's good below the knee.
Tie off the bleeders.
I need the flashlight closer!
They're fighting!
They're coming this way!
We need to evacuate the patients!
Evacuate them where?
To the old plantation.
KOVAC: Go, go!
Il faut evacuer toute le monde!
KOVAC: There's another bleeder.
CARTER: I got it.
Got that one?
We should go. Not yet.
They're getting too close.
KOVAC: Got that one?
Luka, we have to leave her.
No! CHARLES: She's right! We must go!
Saw, Charles, what do we have for a saw?
CARTER: Betadine.
Okay, hold it steady.
Okay, I'm through.
Moist dressing!
( gunfire )
KOVAC: Okay, let's go!
( bird singing )
How's her pulse?
Strong.
Regular.
If there's no infection in four days,
I'll revise it and clean up the flap.
The skin looked good.
Should make a nice seat for a prosthetic.
Yeah, that was impressive.
Looked like you did it before.
I have.
In the beginning, there's always a lot
of talk of national pride and patriotic speeches,
but after a few weeks, it becomes this.
Nothing but death and sadness.
These people just want what everyone else wants.
Their kids to have something to eat.
To see them grow up laughing, happy.
They-they don't care where the border is
or who gets to call themselves President.
They just want this to stop.
Oh, I don't even begin to try to understand the politics here.
You are an American, Carter.
You... believe if people are given the chance
to convert to democracy,
the world would be a better place.
What's the alternative?
Military dictatorships?
You fight wars from the sky with bombs and missiles,
and then your planes land back on the aircraft carrier,
and the pilots watch Drew Carey
on satellite TV.
Hey, American soldiers died in Iraq.
Yeah, but your children don't starve to death
while your men fight.
Your women aren't raped.
( wind blowing )
I remember...
watching the television, reading the newspapers...
certain that we had to fight.
And then my family was gone.
I couldn't remember why it was all so important.
And what difference did it all make?
My children were dead.
PATRIQUE: Hey, here.
One is still alive.
Bring him in.
The food's gone, some supplies.
Where do you want him?
Right here.
Gillian,
we need another IV ampicillin and whatever
we have for pain.
Okay.
FAC.
A government soldier.
Carter?
Small-caliber GSW to the right upper thigh.
He's pale and diaphoretic.
Lost a lot of blood.
( coughing )
He's not really improving.
Do you want to try penicillin?
No. Stay with the amp.
No sign of infection.
Yeah, that looks good.
MAN: Docteur?
Docteur?
Laissez-moi, laissez-moi.
What's his problem? He wants to get back to the Army.
He's afraid to stay here.
Laissez-moi. Je dois partir, monsieur.
Je dois partir.
Does he know where the Army is?
I don't think so.
Laissez-moi.
Je dois partir.
Tell him, uh...
as soon as he can walk, he's free to go.
I have patients who can't be transported.
It's too dangerous.
The fighting's heading back this way.
Angelique wants to abandon the clinic
until it's safer.
The road's open again?
We think so.
A UN food truck got through this morning.
If we move them, they'll die.
How many? At least three.
Take everyone else, leave me some supplies,
and get back for me in a few days.
No, I can't. I won't leave my patients.
I'll try to reach Angelique on the radio.
I can stay, Dr. Luka.
You want to stay, too?
No. I will.
No, please. Just take Gillian.
Make sure she gets back safely.
What was that all about?
The road's open.
GILLIAN: You'll need help.
KOVAC: Patrique is staying.
He has no medical training, and you cannot take care
of three critical ill patients by yourself.
Of course I can.
Oh, yeah?
And how are you supposed to do a Bier block
on that open amputation without a nurse to assist?
You're not staying.
It's not your decision.
You are getting to that truck
with Carter and going.
No, I'm not.
Hey, it's only for a couple of days,
then you'll come back and get us.
Is it Mai Mai?
Qui etes vous, vous allez ou?
CHARLES: Nous sommes des travailleurs
medicaux de WMG,
on transport des personnes
injuriées a l'hôpital en Kisangani.
Qui sont ces gens?
On vient de World Medical Group,
nous sommes tous medecins et infirmiers.
On est medecins, on est neutre.
Vous ne devrais pas etre ici.
C'est le territoire de Mai Mai.
Vous n'appartenez pas ici. On devrais vous tuer.
Justement, partais.
On est medecins, on est tous medicins.
BOY: Byanmungo,
un soldat, un soldat.
Je vous en prie.
Docteur?
Docteur, aidez-moi, s'il vous plaît.
Je vous en prie, Docteur.
Aidez-moi.
( speaking French )
Docteur, aidez-moi, s'il vous plaît.
( both speaking French )
Vous occupez des soldats du gouvernement?
Je vous en prie.
Nous aidons tous les gens qui ont besoin d'aide.
Nous sommes neutre.
Nous nous occupons tout le monde.
Nous, tout le monde.
Silence!
...mon intelligence.
( speaking French )
Vous travaillez pour le gouvernement.
( speaking French )
...Je vous en prie.
( speaking French )
Je vous en prie.
...Je vous en prie.
Laissez-moi.
Byanmungo, c'est les medecins
qui attend de sauver la vie de mon frère.
C'est les medecins dont je t'ai parler qui attend
de sauver la vie de Leon pendant si longtemps.
Qui lui? Oui.
What's he saying?
That you tried to save his brother.
That you tried for a long time.
Hello.
Hi.
...de travailleur pour les soldats le gouvernement...
...tout le monde!
Raphael, viens maintenant.
Merci.
You're welcome.
( gunshot and scream )
( gunshot )
( breathing shallowly )
So, what should I tell Weaver?
Whatever you want.
Can I tell her you're coming back?
I don't know.
Don't do anything stupid now.
Like what?
Like get yourself killed.
( engine starts )
Oui.
Elle est mon trésor.
( door creaking shut )
