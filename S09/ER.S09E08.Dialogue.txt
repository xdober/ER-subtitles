Previously on E.R.:
What's the appeal process?
A promise: you must give me
you word that you will never treat patients.
No.
Then you will fail, Mr. Nathan.
You called the M.P.s?
No. You are under arrest
for unauthorized absence from the United States Air Force.
Lock me up, and throw away the key.
Eric's been a bad boy.
Thanks a lot, Abby, thank you!
GALLANT: It's Sergeant Eric Wyczenski.
Whiskey, Yankee, Charlie, Zulu
Echo, November, Sierra, Kilo, India.
Wyczenski...
Yeah, hold on.
Do you know his squadron number?
I don't know.
I'm not sure.
You don't have a central directory?
Johnny's up; pulled out his hep lock.
Get Connie. I'm off.
Uh, no, no, no, I'm calling on behalf of a family member.
No, no, no.
Okay, then, can you transfer me to the confinement facility?
What?
They don't talk to family members.
Abby, I'm not going to lie to them.
I just want to know where he is!
MAN: I said, stop staring!
She offered her cat a heaping teaspoon... Get away, freako.
Sine equals... I said, get away!
Uh, hello. Lieutenant Michael Gallant, US Army Reserve.
What are you doing?!
Are you deaf?! I said get away! Just stop it!
Crazy retard won't stop staring at us.
Well, he's not hurting anybody.
He smells like piss, man.
Okay, this way, come this way.
Can't you keep the mental cases locked up?
Hey, hey, hey. Hi.
He's not at Great Lakes.
What happened? I kept trying to call you.
I couldn't get any cell phone signal on the base.
Shh. It's just, it's a law.
It's a rule. It's a constant. Sit down...
But they did keep Eric there on Thursday night.
They told you that?
They held Eric in the brig there three nights ago
and then transferred him the next morning.
Transferred him where?
Nebraska. His base.
Yeah.
It might as well be Manilla.
There's like a hundred offices on that base.
GALLANT: Is that Army or Air Force?
I was desperate.
I thought he could use military lingo or something on them.
Great, thanks.
Okay, so they gave me the number
to the 55th Wing Judge Advocate's Office.
I left five voice mails there.
They're closed all weekend.
Oh, did you get the name of his attorney?
I can call back. No, that's okay. Thank you.
I'm just going to go there.
I'm just going to go there.
Okay, all right, why don't we do this.
Why don't I call the travel agent and see if we can book
a mid-day flight out for tomorrow?
I'm going to go tonight.
Well, then you can confirm he's there.
I've been trying to confirm where he is
for three-and-a-half days.
Do you even know if there's a flight out tonight?
Yep, United. 9:30 to Omaha.
My shift just started five minutes ago.
I can't dump it now.
You don't have to come.
You can't go by yourself.
I usually do this by myself.
Hold on, let me see if I can find Chen to cover for me.
She left five minutes ago.
Do you even know how to get on to a military base?
I don't know, there must be a visitors' center.
You have to have a sponsor.
I'll figure it out.
You should at least take Gallant with you.
Yeah, that's exactly what I need, a med student.
Well, to us he's a med student; to them he's an officer.
I'm sure he has better things to do.
He's been on a base before
like you said, he speaks the lingo.
Can you... call me a cab please?
Maybe a few T-shirts there.
just pick out anything that doesn't look like I slept in it.
What about toiletries? Toothbrush, toothpaste...
I'll just buy that stuff when I get out there.
My socks and underwear, in the second drawer.
Just make sure you pull them from the top.
Why? 'Cause those are my respectable underwear.
Oh, right, yeah, yeah. Were they open?
Yeah, just made it.
What?
Dry cleaner. My uniform.
Thought it might help.
You don't have to do this, Gallant.
Never been to Omaha.
What's that?
Internal medicine exam next week.
Oh, that's great
you coerced a med student into failing his rotation.
I'm on a 10:00 flight,
I get in at 11:30.
Just call me on the cell phone if you need anything.
When are you going to sleep?
Just get in the cab.
Thank you.
I'll see you in Nebraska.
Mm-hmm.
( sighs )
Okay, Frank, what do we got?
Four-F with abdominal pain, Exam Three.
JOHNNY: One, two, four, five, ten, 11
22, 44, 55, 110 equals 284.
Jacob gave Esau 220 goats, and 220 sheep...
Come on, Johnny.
Let's see if we can get you something to eat.
Come on, foot.
Come on, come on.
CARTER: You're saying delayed
but you mean canceled, right?
Well, how long does that usually take?
Go ahead.
Can you give me any kind of estimate?
Go ahead, I got it.
No, I could be here a while. Go ahead.
Uh-huh. Have they even started to plow the runways yet?
JOHNNY: ...must be all.
The sum of all the numbers should equal the sum
of each of the columns in each of the rows.
That's part of the magic... must be equal, must be all.
Sum of the major diagonals
should be equal to each row and each column.
Uh, that's a little more tricky
but it can be done
if you know the secret of the magic.
The sum of any two numbers geometrically equidistant from the center...
You okay?
Yeah, it's just worse when I wake up.
At least you got some sleep.
Did it just stop snowing?
Yeah, but don't expect to go anywhere.
I have another 12 hours anyway.
At least they'll be quiet.
( phone ringing )
Hello?
John.
Hey. Hang on.
( spits )
Hey, where are you?
Uh, looking for Eric's commanding officer.
You get on the base?
Yeah, you were right. Gallant's a fast talker.
I'm looking at one of those Stealth plane things right now.
Did you, uh, see the news?
What?
No, what happened?
Three feet of snow, dumped in seven hours.
Carter, I can't hear you.
Three feet of snow
dumped in seven hours last night.
The airport's closed.
I'm at work. I can't get my car
out of the parking garage.
The El shut down.
The El!
Forget it!
Is he there?
Eric... is he there?!
Uh, I-I-I don't know.
Nobody seems to know anything actually.
And I thought the military
was supposed to excel at communication.
Hey.
Everything all right?
Yeah, I'm, I'm fine.
No, no, not you.
What?! MAN: Off the phone!
You're a civilian in a restricted area.
Get off the phone!
Carter, I'm going to have to call you back.
Tell her to get off the phone.
Abby, get off the phone.
Talk to you later.
Uh, sir, your office issued a visitor's pass
and suggested we look for you in Hangar 12.
We didn't mean... That, Lieutenant, is Hangar 13.
Oh.
Oh, what?!
Oh, sir.
Sir. You're Wyczenski's sister?
Yes.
Funny guy.
Popular, too.
Unfortunately, he didn't feel much responsibility
to this squadron or the Air Force.
Is he here?
Because nobody is telling us anything.
Ma'am, I just came off a 72-hour, live-fire exercise
short one air traffic controller.
But if Sergeant Wyczenski was apprehended
Wait a minute, aren't you his commanding officer?
If he was... You don't know if he was arrested?
...picked up in Chicago, he'd be brought here.
Go to your hotel; leave your number with my office.
My brother is suffering from a psychiatric disorder.
I'm well aware of the near-miss depression, ma'am.
No! Bipolar disease.
Manic depression.
He needs to see a psychiatrist.
He needs to be evaluated and medicated now.
So wherever he is
wherever you seem to have lost him, he needs help.
Did you hear that? We're closed.
City offices. Read the sign. We're county.
I see they haven't plowed the bay yet.
No, they're having some trouble getting them on the road.
Chuny, Lydia wants to know since you're stuck here anyway
if you'll take her shift.
Tell her to break out the shovel.
Hey, repeat troponin's negative on five.
Send him home with a sled and some huskies.
It is so quiet.
I know, kind of freaky, huh?
So you're trying to rent a snowmobile?
Considering.
Do they deliver?
I don't know. I can't even get them to answer the phone.
Okay, rack is empty.
Triage is clear, and labs are pending on my only two patients.
Good. So what do I do now?
I don't know. Go play in the snow.
Hey... Ella.
Oh, please tell me daycare is open.
Uh, there's a kindergarten teacher in Exam Four.
My nanny couldn't get out of her front door
the snow was so high.
That's what windows are for.
Look, I'm soaked to my knees.
All we did was walk from the El.
The El is open?
I wouldn't do that if I were you.
We're outside.
On an Air Force Base.
What, do you need clearance to smoke, too?
You can't talk on a cell phone.
You can't smoke.
You see that truck?
Yeah.
It's jet fuel.
Amy Lockhart?
Abby.
Lieutenant Ottenson.
I'm your brother's detailed counsel.
Um, has he been charged with something?
No, not officially.
Is he acting combative, or argumentative?
I don't know. Or delusional.
I haven't seen him yet.
I just got the jacket this morning.
Okay, can I go in there?
'Cause I really need to talk to him.
He's not here. The Judge Advocate...
Just wait a minute!
Wait. His C.O. said that they took him
to confinement Friday afternoon.
And transferred to base hospital Saturday morning.
Oh!
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.
I'm-I'm sorry.
I thought you were Malik.
Do I look like Malik?
Sorry, man, you ain't that good-looking.
Ooh, what are you doing?
You told me to play in the snow.
You can't let him out-flank you like that.
Yeah, right.
Commuting on skis.
What?
Skiing to work.
Yeah, I don't live far.
Nice coat.
Goodwill box.
Hey, did you find him?
Who? Abby's brother.
Oh, I'm just going to try and catch a train
to Midway and wait for it to open up.
Where are you going?
Nebraska.
She's already there. She left last night.
You didn't go with her?
I had a shift.
Oh.
I sent Gallant with her.
Gallant?
Yeah. Why?
LEWIS: Carter, we've got multiples coming in.
Luka's here.
Three criticals: one adult, two kids.
Some drunk plowed through a family
making a snowman in their front yard.
Where's Weaver?
She can't get her car out.
The El's running.
And it's hard walking through the snow with a cane.
She's disabled, remember?
( muttering ): I thought we were closed to ambulance traffic.
How is anybody going to get in here anyways?
We'll be doing a hot unload.
Stay with me.
Always approach the helicopter from the front.
It'll be windy as hell up there
so if anything blows away, don't chase after it.
It's far too easy to become disoriented.
Right.
You need some help?
I got it.
Your stethoscope will be useless.
So will your ears for that matter.
Rely on your other senses.
Look for chest excursion
feel the pulses, study the monitor.
Pulse ox, E.C.G., dyna-map--
they'll tell you all you need to know
about the clinical status.
Don't even try to take a history until...
You have a tremor on the left.
That's the Sinemet-- it works faster when I chew it.
I've only ever noticed it on the right.
Have you had symptoms on the left before?
Oh, stress, you know. Sleep deprivation.
Or a progression of your disease.
My rotation's almost over.
Why do you do this to yourself?
Working these insane hours at the hospital when you should...
Please don't treat me like I'm dying, okay?
Can we just go get this patient?
Keep your head down!
Stick with me, and stay clear of the tail rotor!
Looks like they gave him a drug called Depacot.
Depakote.
And Zypre... Zyprexa.
So apparently he's coherent.
He's scheduled to go up against a Rule 706 Sanity Board at 1200.
Up against?
It's just a formality.
If he was psychotic...
Manic... actually is the term, manic.
Then they won't take him to court-martial.
They'll process him on a medical discharge.
How long will they hold him here for?
If he's mentally stable, they'll probably release him immediately.
So no one calls me to get a family history
or gives me any time to set up treatment for him?
You're just going to boot him out?
If he'd asked for family
I'm sure that someone would've contacted you.
You can't count on him. He's not thinking clearly.
Abby.
Hi.
Hi.
The doctor is in with him now.
Get a name? The mother screamed for Toby and Matt.
I don't know which is who. Toby. The other one's Matt.
Cushing response
vital sign negative.
Pupils blown seven millimeters
bilaterally non-reactive.
No corneal or gag reflex. His brain is mush.
Tell me the drunk driver died on impact.
It was one of those monster trucks.
He was out four-wheeling.
He hit the whole family?
Dad was inside getting a carrot
for the snowman's nose.
CT's ready.
Okay. Uh, scan the belly along with the head.
I need to get to the other one.
You thinking epidural hematoma? If we're lucky.
KOVAK: Pressure's down to 90, set me up for a central line.
Pulse ox is only 85.
Is that the mother?
Yeah, c-spine is clear.
Jumped in front of her kids; truck hit her straight on.
Does your belly hurt, ma'am?
( whispers ): The chest.
Flail segment, 32 French.
Please... oh, my boys...
Please
save my boys.
Full trauma panel.
Type and cross for four
portable chest and pelvis.
All right, another unit on the second line.
Let's set it for a femoral.
Do we have blood yet?
We better, he's got massive contusions
and crepitus over the left chest.
They left my mom.
No, they didn't.
They left her in the snow.
Hey, Matt, follow this light with your eyes for me.
She's here; we're helping her.
Where's Toby?
He's here, too.
( gulping )
Decreased on both sides, bilateral thoracostomy.
All right, ten blade.
Pressure's holding, but he's tachy.
All his ribs are shattered.
He should be dead.
He would be if his mother hadn't jumped
in front of him.
Have you talked to him?
Just briefly on the phone.
( sighs )
It's happening... Mom.
It's happening to him.
He showed up in Chicago with this girl...
he had just met, and I knew he didn't
have that much leave, but I, mostly I just...
I saw it.
I just felt it... right away.
I should've called you, I'm sorry, but...
I didn't know what to do
and then the MP's came and they arrested him.
Actually, I... I got him arrested.
Abby, don't start.
This is not your fault.
No, no, I, I, I needed to know.
I had to know
so I called here and I got his medical records
and they had misdiagnosed a depression in May.
They thought it was stress
which is why he was transferred here.
We thought it was situational.
What?
I made him see Dr. McMangus.
You knew about his depression?
McMangus is a mood disorder specialist.
Even he thought it was PTSD.
PTSD?
Mom, you're bipolar.
Insomnia, loss of appetite, inability to concentrate.
It was all specific to the event
and resolved without medication.
Do you even know anything about your disease?
Yes, Abby, I know a lot about it.
Why didn't you just tell me?
I wanted to protect you.
Protect me?
What about protecting him?
Your brother didn't want you to know.
Can't get a pressure.
No femoral pulse. Check a doppler.
V-fib, crash cart, thoracotomy tray, and prep the chest.
It's blunt trauma.
She had a pulse and was talking.
10 blade. Get FFP from the blood bank
and page cardiothoracic.
Yeah, if they can get here.
The husband wants to come in.
BOTH: No!
Rib spreader.
Metz and pick-ups.
Nathan. Sir, you've got to come with me.
Sir?
( Corday grunts )
Oh, God... No pericardial effusion
no cardiac lacerations.
Satinsky. Nathan, now.
Sir, you've got to come outside with me.
No. Yes!
I'm her husband, I'm...
Your wife is bleeding into her chest.
The doctors are trying to save her; now come with me.
Aorta is cross clamped at 10:27.
Heart's empty.
Empty?! Please, please, please...
Blood must be in the right chest.
Get me another tube.
Set up a thoraseal!
Dr. Corday.
Swab stick, suction on high.
The boy's not oxygenating on 100%.
Carter thinks a rib punctured his heart.
( sighs )
Squeeze in four units then try to defibrillate.
CARTER: 3-0 nylon and opsite.
What happened?
Rib lacerated his LAD.
He's got a huge V-Q mismatch, low pO2
and diminished lung compliance.
Troponin is 32, CK 925 with 20% MB.
He's having a massive MI.
Cath lab first?
Probably irreversible heart muscle damage.
Okay, let's call cards and set up for a swan.
Carter, Abby on two?
All right; just get a number, see if I can call her back.
Ectopy! You can't repair the coronary artery?
It'll just be feeding a dead heart.
Another run, ten beats.
CARTER: Hemodynamically stable.
Okay, okay, call the perfusionist.
We're going to put him
on bypass.
Bypass? Just do it.
Susan! Susan!
Neuro-surg is on the way
but all they can offer is ICP monitoring.
No subdural?
Diffuse cerebral edema
with intraparenchymal bleeding
and complete effacement of the ventricles.
Knocked out the brain stem.
Okay, get a stat EEG and mobilize transplant service.
Transplant? Toby? Is that Toby?
Sir, sir, I'm Dr. Corday. I need a word with you.
Aren't you working on my wife?
I'm working on your family.
Uh, how bad is he hurt?
He wasn't talking.
There's a massive swelling of his brain.
He... he's in a coma?
No...
he's brain dead, I'm afraid.
Brain dead? I'm sorry.
Dr. Corday, we still can't get a rhythm.
Be right there.
1500cc's out the right side.
Susan, can you help Luka?
Yeah. Get him in the suture room.
Look, I know this is sudden.
But your other son Matt, his heart is failing.
The artery that feeds it was severed by his rib.
His lungs are bruised and filled with blood.
Oh, God.
I'm afraid his only chance
is a heart and lung transplant
within the next six hours.
Do you understand?
School was canceled
and, uh, the, the, street was blocked.
The boys just wanted to make a snowman...
Sir, do you understand?
I need your permission to take Toby's heart
and lungs and give them to Matt.
What?
This son is dead.
I might have a chance to save your other one.
No, no, you just s-save them... save them both.
I can't.
Elizabeth, you need to open a right chest.
Kids... kids are resilient, they bounce back.
Elizabeth, I might need you!
Not now. Drunken driver with distracting injuries.
No!
Look, I know this is difficult
but I need your consent now.
You can't just wait a couple days
and see if... he wakes up?
Elizabeth.
Sir, I'll be right back.
Nathan.
Okay. You need to calm him down
explain it to him, get consent.
He's not in the proper state of mind to understand.
So you make him understand.
We just have one shot at his other boy.
What? They're worried about national security?
It's protocol-- military's big on it.
Yeah, but they already said they were going to discharge him.
How long can it take to talk to your lawyer?
I guess he needed to brief him on the hearing.
Hey, there's a PX a few buildings over.
You want something to eat?
Hey, you, uh, you haven't eaten anything
since last night.
I'm fine.
Mrs. Wyczenski? She's fine, too.
Look, Gallant, you came here to help me get on base
and I got on base.
Thank you.
Now you should go.
I mean, I can stay.
You have a test.
Well, Dr. Carter said if I didn't...
I don't care what Dr. Carter said.
Dr. Carter's not here.
And besides, this is my family.
You should go.
Well, there's only one car.
Mom, do you have a rent-a-car?
Yes.
You take it.
Come on, go, go.
Okay, I'm going to take him over in 45 minutes.
Can I go in now?
He asked to see his mom.
Okay, let's go.
Uh, only his mom.
Does he know I'm here?
Yes, ma'am.
And he doesn't want to see me?
Not right now, ma'am.
I'll talk to him, Abby, he'll come around.
Right this way.
( electric saw buzzing )
CORDAY: Spreader.
At least two more liters in the right chest.
Suction.
Vascular clamp.
Looks like a hilar injury.
Tore the pulmonary artery and vein.
Got it.
Resuming compressions.
Is he getting consent?
CORDAY: He's trying.
JARVIK: Hemacue is 6.2
Comes in handy, I guess.
What?
He's good at talking patients into stuff.
Cross another eight of packed cells.
She's in arrest too long.
We only got hemostasis a minute ago.
He's in v-tach!
Four more units on the rapid infuser
then you're done.
35 kilos.
Charge to 50. Where's my perfusionist?
He's still trying to get through the snow. Everybody clear?
( machine buzzing ) .35 milligrams of one to 10,000 of EPI.
Sinus!
Okay, bolus lidocaine and...
V-tach, pulseless.
Starting CPR.
CARTER: All right, 120 again.
I got it.
He consented?
I showed him the EEG.
And everybody clear?
( machine buzzing )
( alarms sound )
The heart's ischemic and the lungs
can't oxygenate; we need to move him to the OR.
Whoa, we don't even have a stable rhythm yet.
Lidocaine, another 20
IV push and charge.
You got his signature?
He's signing now. And clear.
( machine buzzing )
Sinus. Okay, then get his brother upstairs.
Come on, man, hold right there.
Okay, Chuny, we need that transplant team here now.
Back to v-fib.
Damn it.
All right, charge again to 120, procainamide
300 milligrams IV over the next half hour; charge again.
( alarm changes ) Wait!
Back to sinus.
Okay, that's it, let's go.
Lido infusion at 40 mikes per kilo per minute.
We shouldn't move him.
We have a window, he's in sinus now.
Yeah, for ten seconds.
If we need to get him on bypass, he can't last that long.
You want to do this? Heart transplant?
You have any other ideas?
I'm here, kiddo, it's not going to hurt.
I'm here.
CORDAY: We'll set up in the OR.
Have the bypass packages standing by.
Subclavian? No, femoral, ten French.
Activate again, we got to hustle.
What's wrong?
Hey, hold the elevator!
Sats down to 78. He needs to be suctioned.
You got to make this work.
We'll do our best. No, you promise me.
You promise me this is going to work!
I'm sorry, we have to get upstairs.
Pressure's down to 80 systolic...
Uh...
( sighs )
It's okay, baby.
You're going to help your brother, okay?
You're going to help your brother.
Uh, my wife--
uh, we'll bring him in to my wife
and she's going to say good-bye.
Amp of bicarb in. I think I broke his last rib.
Keep going. Good pulse with compression.
Shirley, where are we headed? OR Two.
V fib. Damn it.
Hold compressions. Where are the paddles?
Charging. Clear.
Oh, battery is dead, come on!
Let's go. Check the connection.
Still energized.
Okay, stop, clear.
( sighs )
Okay, battery's dead.
Let's go, grab the slider.
150.
CARTER: Charged.
Clear.
Sinus.
Three milligrams per kilo of heparin.
Then prep for THI cannula.
CARTER: One, two, three.
CORDAY: Where's my transplant team?
What do you want me to do?
Keep him in V fib.
Heparin's in, waiting on gradient.
Run a V tach, half bolus of lidocaine.
200 units per kilo.
Sinus.
Then one per mil of prime.
Shirley? Right here.
Okay, meet the donor at the elevator.
Get him prepped next door.
CARTER: Repeat BP.
MARQUEZ: 100/60.
Ten blade.
Starting bypass at 11:46.
Hey.
You just got him hooked up now?
LAD is shredded.
Irreversible ischemic damage to the left ventricle.
And I thought I had a snow day.
Get the harvest team going.
Wow.
Yeah.
Wow.
Yeah.
( sighs )
He doesn't blame you.
He just can't hide from you.
You saw him manic, and he hasn't accepted it yet.
He's taking the meds.
Not by choice.
That could take some time.
He's emotionally exhausted...
and he's ashamed.
Try not be confrontational.
I've got this down, thanks.
Hi.
Were you expecting a straitjacket?
No.
You look nice.
Oh, fashion is key at a court-martial.
It's not really a court-martial, right?
It's a-a Rule 70...
I know what it is, Abby.
You wanted out anyway, right?
Yeah. It's all a ploy.
You know I love you, right?
You know that.
I was worried about you because I love you.
And you think I'm crazy?
No, not crazy.
Oh, right.
Um... sick.
Mentally unstable.
Suddenly plagued
by a psychiatric illness.
Truth is, I was having... a pretty good time.
( clears throat )
I want you to come back to Chicago with me.
( laughing ): Oh, wow!
That sounds like a lot of fun. Um...
Maybe you could call the MPs again.
Eric, you've seen this.
You know if you don't stay medicated
it can get bad.
I mean, bad.
You could end up wasting...
Abby, she's right here.
Yeah, I know she is. It's not a secret.
She knows it. She'll tell you.
She will tell you.
Mom, tell him.
Tell him, Mom!
Mom, tell him.
I'll be in the waiting room.
What the hell, Abby?
Yeah, what the hell.
You called her?
You didn't... do... ?
It took me three days to find you
and I had to talk my way
onto the base...
I didn't ask you to do that.
Yeah, but you called her?
The most unreliable
undependable person in our lives?
And you're dependable?
Yeah, to you I am, yes.
Well, I'm sorry.
I have to apologize to poor Abby.
Poor, poor Abby.
My career is over
but she doesn't get to be the savior again.
You need help Eric, and Mom screwed up
the first time you went to her.
One-- I don't need help.
And two-- I didn't go to her.
She thought she saw something.
She dragged me to her doctor.
I went to make her happy
and her doctor proved her wrong.
She wasn't wrong.
Then why am I not allowed to call her?
Better get going, Sergeant.
MAN: Hey
Make sure you check my knee, too.
It's killing me.
I hit it on the steering column.
Do you hear me?
Yes.
Then get me something for the pain, brother.
Oh, all the alcohol wasn't enough... brother?
I only had one beer.
This the driver?
Right side tenderness.
The ultrasound looks clear.
Hey, what's your problem, man?
You got Tourette's or something?
Did you do it?
Ask me in six hours.
The transplant team is working.
Did you talk to the father?
Large seat belt contusion.
Safety first.
They let you be a doctor like this?
Only on the patients they don't care about.
Hey, did you just diss me, man?
I think he just dissed me.
Do-do you know what you did?
Do you have any idea?
Uh, yeah, I banged up my knee.
No, you killed a whole family--
a mother, her two little kids.
No, I hit a snowman.
They were making a snowman, you jerk!
Mr. Nathan, perhaps you should help out with another patient.
You have to give him time, Abby.
Oh, now you speak?
Now you have an opinion?
He can't feel we're ganging up on him.
Just don't push him.
I didn't... push him.
You're already talking about going back to Chicago.
They are discharging him, Mother.
What do you suggest?
We put him up in a psychiatric hospital in Omaha?
I'm not so sure he should be hospitalized.
Well, that's not really your decision.
Is it yours?
You know, he only looks normal because he's on Depakote.
And if you had seen him...
I know the pathology, sweetie.
And yes
the easy thing would probably be to try to commit him.
( laughs )
Easy?
But he's got to accept the disease
accommodate it.
And until he does
he needs to be supervised
or he will go off his meds.
You always did.
Well, he probably will at one time or another.
But Abby, trust me on this.
It's like AA.
It's got to be his decision.
He's got to want it, and it's way too early for that.
Mom, I have been living with this disease
my entire life.
Please, don't lecture me.
I know you've been living with this your entire life
but you've never been inside it.
What is that?
What is that?
"Inside it"
like you two have some sort of special bond now.
'Cause you're both inside of it.
Abby, stop it!
This is about Eric.
You can't go back to the way you two were.
There's no quick fix.
Your brother will be struggling with this
for the rest of his life.
Abby?
Has she been vomiting?
Twice this morning.
She started to run a fever
so I brought her in.
Well, is anybody else sick at home?
Her little brother had an earache a couple days ago
but he seems fine now.
Okay, well, let's take a look.
MAN: Well, you can't take my blood alcohol.
I don't give you permission.
We don't need your permission.
So are you hungry at all, Kiley?
No. No?
Any diarrhea, Mom? No.
( screaming and crying )
I'm sorry. What happened?
It was an accident. I'm sorry.
I think I scared her more than anything.
Are you all right, honey?
Did you hit the TM? No.
He just jammed that thing in my daughter's ear.
I don't think I really hurt her.
Well, why is she crying?
( crying continues )
Here.
Where are you going?
I'm going home.
Come back here and finish the work-up.
No, thank you.
We were able
to get Matt stabilized on bypass.
The transplant team's at work.
Is there anybody you'd like me to call?
When will you know?
It's a delicate procedure, especially on children.
There's a waiting room on the third floor.
I can take you there if you'd like.
I can't seem to...
walk out of this room.
What-what time is it?
Uh...
it's almost 5:00.
I'd be getting home about now.
Sylvia would probably pick up a pizza
or some Chinese
because she got busy with the boys after school
and didn't have time to cook.
Toby'd have a picture that he drew
that he'd want me to look at.
Matt would want me to test him on his math.
You made the right decision.
The only one you could.
We woke up this morning.
Everything was white.
And they were so happy.
We all got to stay home.
It may not seem like it, but, um...
I know what you're feeling.
I-I understand what you're feeling.
I'm sorry, Doctor
but you-you don't know what I'm feeling.
You don't have any idea.
I don't even know.
My husband--
his name was Mark-- he died...
My God, I was about to say last year.
It was only six months ago.
I tried to pretend
once Mark was gone, that I could pull myself up
continue like normal.
But it doesn't work like that.
You see, you can't run away from it.
It's...
It's like this big, relentless wave...
( sighs )
...that you have to ride.
But in riding it
somehow, you hold on to what you've lost.
And you find a way to go on without shutting off.
It's not easy, but you do it.
I know...
someday soon
when you look into your child's eyes
all you will see are the beautiful things
that live on in him.
He needs to be okay.
I need him to be okay.
He will be.
( crying )
He will be.
Based on his testimony at the board
they feel they don't have enough information
to conclude that he was mentally incompetent.
So what's he doing here?
He's demanding due process.
I'm trying to contact the convening authority
to get him released from pretrial confinement.
The door doesn't open from the inside
so just pick up the phone when you're finished.
Thank you.
You requested a court-martial?
No.
That's what the lawyer says they're looking at.
I was gone less than 30 days.
The worst they'll do is discharge me.
Maybe give me a couple weeks confinement.
You don't have a couple weeks.
I haven't hurt anyone.
I haven't broken any laws.
I haven't acted irresponsibly.
I just needed a change.
You went AWOL.
But that's between me and them.
They want me to say I'm crazy.
I'm not going to say it.
Nobody's saying you're crazy.
You're saying I'm crazy.
No, I'm not.
Come on, Abby!
You were there.
You even tried to hide it from me.
Mom was crazy.
She was out-of-her-mind crazy
and I'm not like that!
I'm not her.
You can say it all you want.
I'm not her.
CORDAY: Hey.
Shirley, uh, she said she saw you out here
on her break almost an hour ago.
Are you okay?
No symptoms.
It's perfect timing, huh?
You need something?
I owe it to you to give you this in person... your evaluation.
You're not going to open it?
Open it for what?
There's no middle ground with you, is there?
Blind optimism or self-pity.
It's just the truth.
It's going to cripple me.
( sighs )
Just when I learn how to deal with another symptom
it progresses.
What were you expecting?
Time.
I expected time.
Enough time to figure out a...
Time is going to kick my ass.
So, what, that's it?
You're just going to give in?
Isn't that what you wanted?
No.
No, I wanted you to recognize your limitations.
I thought you were trying to prove something
but you probably saved that little boy's life today.
You connected with his father
when he was completely lost.
You guided him to make the right decision.
Any idiot can suture a wound or put in a chest tube.
But you have a gift, Mr. Nathan.
The gift of a physician.
Now it's up to you to decide if you want to share that gift
and then find a way.
By the way, I keep my promises.
I failed you.
All they had was diet Shasta.
They still make this?
I hope so.
( opens soda can )
Um...
they might ask you to testify, you know.
Yeah.
Mom, I need you to be with me on this.
He can't stay in military jail.
I'm with you.
I'm sorry.
( sighs heavily )
I'm just scared for him, and I'm... angry.
I'm angry at you... for having to do this again
and you didn't do anything.
No.
You're angry at me for... giving it to him.
No, no, no, I didn't...
Nah... I know you feel like a mother to him.
Why shouldn't you?
But I'm his mother and I gave it to him.
I gave it to my son.
All I can do now is... try to be his mother.
( phone ringing )
I'm sorry, I gave his lawyer this number.
Go ahead.
I'm going to try to find us a hotel room.
This may take a few days.
Hello?
CARTER: Hey, you turned on your cell phone.
Hi.
Well, did you find him?
Yeah, I found him.
They might court-martial him, but I found him.
Did you tell them that he was sick?
They already knew.
It's a long story.
You still snowed in?
Oh, the city's a mess.
How are you holding up?
Chuny, do we have any spare monitors?
For what?
Fiber-optic otoscope.
Oh, try Trauma One.
GIRL: It's a big machine.
Can she get something to eat?
She's starting to get her appetite back.
That's a good sign.
What do you feel like eating, Kiley?
Pizza. Pizza?
That sounds good, but you should probably just have some soup
until your tummy's settled.
All right, the CT is negative.
She can go home, drink some clear liquids
and come back tomorrow for a recheck.
Excuse me, Dr. Weaver.
I never finished checking Kiley's ear.
Oh, you don't have to do that-- we're fine.
It's okay, I'm not going to hurt her.
In fact, Kiley's going to help me.
Can you tell him that we're fine?
Don't worry, she's safe.
I think I saw something.
So I want you to hold the scope
and I want you to put it in your ear very gently, okay?
You can get to watch it on TV.
Me?
Yeah, you get to be the doctor.
Is that my ear?
Actually, it's your eardrum.
Gross.
Use cotton swabs?
Yeah, every night.
See, that's the problem.
The cotton swab rubs the protective wax out of the ear.
It can cause an ear infection.
And what can you do about that?
Well, I could give her some drops
but it's better if she just never sticks anything in her ear
smaller than her elbow.
My elbow?
I can't fit my elbow.
You can't?
Mr. Nathan
are you almost finished?
Yeah, almost.
You're needed upstairs.
What is it?
Field is dry. Anastomosis sites intact.
Elizabeth, you're either going to make me famous
or get me arrested for cases like this.
Mr. Nathan, Dr. Carmichael.
I toil for eight hours, you're the one with the honors.
Excuse me?
Over here.
MAN: Cardioplegia solution is withdrawn.
Okay...
Shut it down.
This is the part where you jump out of the airplane
and hope you packed
the chute correctly.
Better grab those paddles.
What?
Paddles-- we're going to need them.
MAN: V-fib.
That's your cue.
Clear.
MAN: Heart rate, 70.
( quietly ): Wow.
And that, my friends, makes it all worthwhile.
Start the epi.
Take down the catheters.
CORDAY: I guess his brother will always
be with him.
( quietly ): Wow.
