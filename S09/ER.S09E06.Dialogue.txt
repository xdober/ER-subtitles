Previously on E.R.:
I'm not working with him.
Why?
Because he treats nurses like idiots.
Whatever.
That's it.
I'm filing a grievance against him.
You are such a jerk.
Why?
You slept with her?
I'll wait for you.
Okay, I'll be right back.
Frank, take care of my baby brother.
Is he potty-trained?
What the hell are you doing?
Being a little hard on him, don't you think?
What are you talking about?
Nathan. He's doing a pretty good job, considering.
Considering what?
He has Parkinson's.
Excuse me.
How much did you take out?
CORDAY: None of it.
None of it?
Metastatic lesions are studding the entire abdominal cavity--
present on the outer surface of the liver, the spleen
the small intestines, the colon.
Shouldn't you take out what you can?
Surgical removal won't affect survival.
You'll need to see an oncologist.
Survival?
You don't think I'll survive it?
You'll need to see an oncologist.
No.
Tell me.
Do I have a chance, or don't I?
There's always a chance, Mr. Willow.
How much of a chance?
Given the extent of your disease
with chemotherapy
less than a ten percent, five-year survival.
What's the earliest?
The least amount of time?
I'll have the oncologist see you.
ROMANO: Excessive therapy?
Excessive? How's this for excessive?
I had my arm sliced off.
I mean, what do I have to do to get full therapy?
I have to have a pack of wolves come chew my leg off, too?
Look, my physical therapist, my orthopedic surgeon
and the Chief of Staff of the hospital
that pays your premiums...
What's his name again? That's right-- me!
His insurance company.
...have all determined
I need a minimum of five days a week
in order to regain occupational use.
I need a solid tumor consult for Mr. Willow.
It's not disability, you gnat!
I'm-I'm still working. It's...
Hello? Hello?
Coward.
The peek and shriek still out of it?
No. I told him. You told him?
You were in there for all of 90 seconds.
Start a Dilaudid drip at two milligrams q 30 minutes.
You know, I am going to have
to get you your own complaint box.
There's nothing I can do for the man but pain control.
No, no, your medical student, the martini shaker.
He camped out in my office and says
you refused to put him on call.
He has Parkinson's disease.
Yeah. Hence the martini shaker reference.
Come on, Lizzie, work with me.
Stress and sleep deprivation only exacerbate his symptoms.
He says he's managing it.
Makes a good argument.
I don't think it's fair to the others
to have to make them pick up his slack.
I'm not going to put the man on 36 hours straight.
He'll take a nap. It's bad enough he has to treat patients.
Oh, I get it. What?
You have something against doctors with disabilities.
Only on a case by case basis.
Look, if this guys wants the full ream
surgical rotation experience, give it to him.
The last thing I need is some dim lawyer from the ACLU
coming in here and telling me
I have to put handrails on the urinals.
And, oh, by the way, the guy with the twitch--
he's suing your ass.
And we care nothing about Mr. Nathan?
Who's Nathan?
Him. My Parkinson's student.
Oh. Uh, right.
Uh, no. I don't care. This place is littered with masochists.
Just make sure he doesn't kill anyone.
MAN: I found her asleep on the El train.
LOCKHART: Her name's Sara Paspalis.
She's 14.
Hey, Sara, how you doing?
Sara, can you hear me?
Just let me sleep.
LOCKHART: Did she fall?
She was in her seat when we found her.
I don't see any signs of trauma.
Abby, do you see any signs of trauma?
You could suggest a head CT and LP just to be safe.
Why are you so sleepy, Sara?
I'm tired.
Are you taking any medicine?
What about drugs?
Let's get a tox screen and APAP, CBC and lytes.
Uh, foley
UA with dip and icon, too.
Multiple GSW coming in.
Weaver's stuck in a waste management meeting.
She wants to push your 12:30 meeting to 1:00.
Sure. Uh, wait. What meeting?
Uh, the one with HR.
You know, the nurses' petition.
What petition?
Hey.
Hey.
Hi.
Hi. What are you doing here?
I came here to see you.
I mean, I wasn't planning on coming here, you know
here to see you, but I'm glad you're working today.
I was going to call first, but Jody got sick
so I figured I'd just bring her in.
Who's Jody?
My girlfriend. Your girlfriend?
Yeah, what do you think?
You approve? She's cute.
Yeah? It's only been a couple of weeks.
Come on. Come on and meet her.
I want... You'll like her.
Okay, just one second.
Um, she's not feeling well?
Yeah. I don't know. Maybe the flu.
She has a bad headache, and her stomach was upset.
We had some shrimp in Biloxi.
Uh, smelled kind of funny.
You had shrimp in Biloxi?
Yeah, I rented a Cessna for a couple of days.
Hey, Jody this is my big sister, Abby.
Hi. Hi.
Kind of little to be your big sister.
( laughs )
Eric says you're not feeling well.
What seems to be the, uh...
( retches )
...problem?
That's right, mama-san. I'm bulletproof.
Tachy at 110, B.P. holding at 100/80.
He's going to need blood.
Get four units O-neg.
I don't need blood. I need a beer.
Yeah. Happy hour isn't until 4:00.
How about a nurse to sit on my face?
Are you up for a lap dance, Malik?
Maybe.
Stay away from me, you chocolate homo.
How did you know my stage name?
Abby, we're going to need some extra hands.
Okay. I'll be right there.
So, what do you think? The shrimp?
Well, that's a good theory.
How did you guys meet?
She's really great.
She's smart, funny...
when she's not throwing up.
Does she go to school
or is the bookstore like a full-time thing?
She's 21... almost.
Twenty.
Yeah, she's trying to become a writer.
I mean, she is a writer.
She just hasn't been discovered yet.
I've read her stuff.
I mean, it's good. It's really good.
You guys are... I think it's good.
You're flying around the country?
Part of the Midwest, and the South.
Her parents are from Ohio.
And you can afford a plane?
Rent, rent. Renting the plane.
What's wrong? Nothing?
It just seems like a lot of money, that's all.
We'll get out of your hair if this is a bad time again.
Abby, we need your help. No, it's not.
Okay. Um, it's not a bad time.
I'll be back in a minute.
( alarm sounds )
Muffled heart sound.
I want the American doctor.
Chen is the American doctor.
Betadine, seven-and- a-half sterile gloves
and a 30 French chest tube on a vascular clamp.
70 systolic.
Hey, Abby, have you seen Sara? Who?
The girl that the cops brought in.
She fell asleep on the El.
She was in Exam One.
I was there, remember?
She's gone.
CORDAY: Ten blade, sterile drapes.
Pericardial effusions.
Spinal needle and syringe.
Oh, me love you long time.
Right in the ass.
She's the one with the big needle.
Hey, dude?
Can you hear me?
He's out, but he's breathing. Good.
I think she may have wandered off. Abby?
We're in the middle of a trauma, Harkins.
What would you like us to do?
Stop and help you look for your patient?
I'm in. No pressure and no pulse.
Needle out.
40cc's of pericardial blood.
No blood in the thoraseal.
Hold it. Sinus rhythm.
Pressure's coming up.
Nice needle.
LOCKHART: Third unit's going up.
Dr. Corday?
Pressure's 110/72, sats are at 95%.
Dr. Corday, we have a trauma patient in here
in respiratory distress.
CHEN: Maybe we should crack his chest anyway.
CARTER: Getting no breath sounds at all.
26-year-old female went down in a crosswalk at Felton.
GCS 13, slightly altered.
HALEH: Pulse ox 89, tachy at 120.
She carries her own oxygen, but the tank's empty.
We've been going easy on the O2
in case she's a chronic retainer.
I don't hear anything.
Do you think she has bilateral pneumos?
That doesn't make any sense.
There's no real signs of trauma.
What about the scars?
Looks like she's had lung volume reduction surgery
and a liver transplant.
All right, everybody
quiet, just quiet.
There.
Coarse rhonchi bilaterally.
That's so faint.
ABG looks good.
I understand you had a conversation
with Dr. Romano.
Yeah, he was very supportive.
Unfortunately, he's not the one assessing your performance
so in the future, if you have any concerns
regarding your rotation...
I've told you my concerns.
I'd appreciate it if you go through the proper channels.
Well, I'll certainly try.
Alison, do you have emphysema?
Alpha-one... antitryp...
Alpha-one antitrypsin deficiency?
What can you tell us
about Alpha-one antitrypsin deficiency
Mr. Nathan?
It's a genetic disease.
It causes reduced serum levels
in Alpha-one blood proteins.
Why is that bad?
The abnormal mutation gets hung up in the liver.
Causes cirrhosis.
And why can't she breathe?
Well, without Alpha-one, trypsin is unopposed.
It's eating up
the alveolar surfaces in her lungs.
Yes, and... ?
Pan-acinar emphysema.
She's got the lungs of an 80-year-old chain smoker.
She's...
She's drowning in her own mucus.
Alison, you're not getting enough oxygen.
We need to put a tube down your throat. No tube, no tube.
No, we need to.
How about a bipap? Pressure mask?
Will that work?
It might.
Get one. Call RT.
Good call.
LOCKHART: Third unit's up.
MALIK: Pressure's 100/72, sats 96.
Haleh, do you know anything
about some petition?
Yeah. I signed it. We all did.
Not me.
I can't believe a guy comes in here
with three bullet holes, and nobody pages me.
You are such a trauma queen.
What is it, about cafeteria hours again?
No. Dr. Kovac.
They figure you weren't going to do anything, 'cause, well...
you know. No.
Do anything about what?
MALIK: Don't sweat it. They just whining.
You cut up Denise.
PRATT: Looks like she saved your butt.
We had to put in a chest tube.
That was my wife, you gook bitch.
Hey. I'm coming back for you.
Me and my boys are going to cut you up.
Only boys you're going to be seeing are in the prison shower.
You okay?
Chen?
I'm fine.
Repeat ABG in 20 minutes
and get a portable chest before we move her.
Dr. Corday, penetrating trauma in Curtain Three.
Be right there.
I'd like to follow through the evaluation
for heart-lung transplant.
Complete discharge summaries
and review all ER charts for possible surgical consults.
Can I go to the ball after that?
There's an M&M at 3:00. Don't be late.
She's a good teacher.
Yeah, that's what they keep telling me.
How are you feeling?
Yeah, a little better.
Sorry I almost puked on you.
Oh, it's okay. It comes with the territory.
Where's Eric?
He went out for a smoke.
A smoke?
I know. I-I keep telling him to quit
but he doesn't listen to me.
You should talk to him.
Maybe he'll listen to his sister.
Especially since you're a nurse...
Can you excuse me one second?
Yeah.
( clears throat )
Hey.
I'm, uh, being sent
to the principal's office because of you.
What? I don't know.
You pissed off a bunch of nurses this time.
How?
I think it's an attitude problem.
I have a good attitude.
Hey, Abby... I do.
Abby, I still can't find her.
Jerry, could you help Harkins find her patient?
Uh, big hospital, many patients, very busy.
Abby...
Call security.
OLBES: Darius here skateboarded into a car door.
No LOC, normal vitals
obvious ankle deformity, but good pulses.
Old geezer opened it right in front of me.
Do you have a last name, Darius?
It's just Darius.
Oh, like Cher.
Do you have any allergies, Darius?
No. Have you seen my brother?
Oh, you just missed him.
He wanted to buy cigarettes.
I sent him to the newsstand.
He's getting me lottery tickets.
( laughs ): What?
He offered, I figured what the hell.
It's 87 million.
You realize you have a better chance
of getting hit by a car.
Is that supposed to be funny? Sorry.
You want to go in with me? No, thanks.
Maybe you could use it to cover my malpractice lawsuit.
Hey.
Hey.
Uh-oh.
National Enquirer.
Embarrassing, I know, but Jody's a gossip junkie.
When did you start smoking?
Oh, a while ago.
What's a while?
What difference does it make?
I don't know.
Nobody starts smoking over the age of 25.
Oh, what can I say?
I'm a late bloomer.
You know, I'm serious.
Eric, it's really not good.
Well, you smoke
and you've been smoking since you were what, eight?
Oh, that's cute.
We're not talking about me.
You're right. How's Jody?
( sighs )
I don't know, she seems better.
She's not pregnant.
Was that a possibility?
I don't know. You tell me.
Well, yeah, I guess.
I don't know.
Oh, come on. What if... ?
Okay, what if she was?
Then what? But she's not.
But you just said she could be.
But she's not.
What are you doing, Eric?
What's going on?
Okay, Mom, I'm having sex
with my girlfriend.
I mean, what are you, a nun?
You show up here with this girl who's barely out of her teens
who may be, could be pregnant?
But isn't.
On some weird impromptu leave.
People take vacations.
You were renting a plane that I know you can't afford.
Oh, I forgot, you're a financial wizard.
Uh, don't. Don't mock me.
I'm not the one who's...
Who's what? In love?
Oh, you're in love?
I don't know. Maybe.
Okay.
Is that such a bad thing? No.
MAN: Help!
Somebody, help!
Over here, help!
Can you go inside and tell them I need a gurney?
Fast.
Sara?
Sara?
How long has she been like this?
About two trains.
Is she dead?
Wake up, Sara.
She might wake up if I kissed her.
Sats any better?
93 after a couple of nebs.
She wants to take the mask off.
Okay. Just keep an eye on her rate.
Okay.
( wheezing )
Did you call my dad?
We left a message.
Do you take prolastin for your Alpha-one?
No.
I got hives
then anaphylactic shock.
( wheezes )
Throat closed up.
A true anaphylactic reaction to prolastin is pretty rare.
Lucky me.
They took me off a few years ago.
( wheezes )
You have pneumonia.
Fifth time this year.
A new record.
Well, we can clear that up.
Do you have an allergies to any antibiotics?
No.
( wheezes )
I want to sign a D.N.R.
My liver's sick.
My lungs are shredded.
NATHAN: Well, the antibiotics
will make you feel better.
( wheezing )
Don't take it personally.
I just don't want any more help.
I'm ready to die.
( wheezing )
Can you hold her arm down?
No one mentioned she was seizing.
KOVAC: She is not.
Six centimeter jagged scalp lac.
Looks like it's torn straight through to the bone.
What was she in for?
Uh, we don't know for sure.
Police found her asleep
and hard to rouse on the El.
LOCKHART: Possible drug overdose.
Possible brain bleed.
I just don't understand these girls
who'll take any pill handed to them at a party.
Dr. Corday? Yep?
Can you, uh, witness a D.N.R.?
I need a second physician's signature.
CORDAY: Oh, there's no gag.
She's not protecting her airway.
I got it.
Thanks, Luka.
Okay. Let's intubate her and then get her up to C.T.
You care to do the honors?
Uh, yeah, sure.
Scope in the left hand.
Sats are 98.
CORDAY: Slide along the tongue.
Across and out of the way.
Good.
That's excellent. Now look for the cords.
That's it. Excellent.
Lucky lottery ticket.
Since you're a friend, it's only two bucks a pop.
They're one buck across the street.
Not with my patented number selection system.
She looks like she's feeling better.
She should after 125 milligrams of Demerol.
Well, she had a migraine.
So she needed Demerol?
She failed Compazine, she's allergic to Imitrex
and she's almost 21.
LOCKHART: Oh, he mentioned that, did he?
( chuckling ): He's a funny guy.
Thinks he's in love.
Well, you can't have enough love in the world.
What, you don't like her?
I don't know. I just met her.
So did he.
Jerry, call me when the labs for Fay Graham gets here.
You bet.
Speaking of betting
you feeling lucky today, Dr. Chen?
Oh, reselling lottery tickets is a felony.
Got an officer needs some work here.
What happened?
She was involved in a shooting earlier.
Her hand got shredded by a driver's side window.
She keeps saying it's no big deal, but...
It's not. Here, let's sit down right over here.
I think she's lost a pint by now.
I'm okay, Hal.
Okay, let me take a look at it.
JERRY: Abby?
Director of Nursing's calling for you.
You're late for some meeting with Romano.
Okay. Here, someone will be with you in a minute, okay?
Nathan, you're surgical, right?
Uh, yeah, but I'm taking...
Somebody from trauma or hand should
take a look at this possible flexor tendon lac.
Irrigate while you're waiting
but she might need an O.R.
She collapsed on the street.
She's got pneumonia and signs of liver rejection.
Why isn't she on a vent?
She declined the use of one.
You just said she had pneumonia again
and her lungs are shot to begin with.
How the hell is she supposed to breathe?
Mr. Deluca, your daughter signed
a Do Not Resuscitate order.
She's just depressed.
She gets that way sometimes.
L-Let me talk to her.
I don't think that she wants to be talked out of it.
Well, of course she does. She's just a kid.
She's 26.
She gets tired.
Yeah, she's dying.
We're all dying.
Not like that.
She's in tremendous pain, and she knows
that that's never going to change.
She stopped taking her antirejection meds
weeks ago.
Catch her up.
Can't do that.
Then I'll make her take 'em.
It won't work.
She's still going to be allergic to the only medicine
that can keep her alive.
We'll find new meds!
And when those fail
she's going to need a complete heart/lung transplant
for even a chance of survival.
Then I'll get her one.
So she can face the same disease all over again?
If you don't want to fight for her
I'll find a doctor who will.
Insert and cock your wrist at 90 degrees.
Fired three rounds before I knew it.
Department issue semiautomatic.
If possible, use your pinkie to steady your hand.
It was all really fast, you know?
I'm sure you did the right thing.
It's my first week.
I've been scared every day.
If it's not what you were expecting
there's no shame in exploring other options.
Dr. Corday, I need you.
I'll be back to check the sutures.
Could you put some pressure right here?
Yes, sir.
I'll be right back.
But she was so altered when she came inside... Excuse me.
Don't you think that officer
could possibly be suffering from post-traumatic stress?
Yes. Call a social worker.
You know, I just thought it was me
but you're kind of cool, aren't you?
Pardon?
A social worker?
Isn't it our job to take care of these people?
If you insist on being on a surgical rotation, Mr. Nathan
then act like a surgeon.
Act like I don't give a damn. Got it.
That woman's hand is still bleeding and in need of suture.
That's how you can help her.
Now what was it?
She was so altered when she came in
so I figured it was something that wouldn't show up
on a tox screen--
a rave drug like ecstasy maybe.
And then I remembered I read this article
about special K...
Come on, Harkins, get on with it.
Well, it's replaced roofies.
It's mostly a date rape drug.
It's sometimes recreational.
I just never thought to look before, Dr. Corday.
Of course you disagree, Kerry.
It flies in the face of the culture
you've established.
What? There is no culture.
We're too busy saving lives.
It's not funny, Kerry.
By not occluding it at the onset
you have allowed it to proliferate.
You. You have anything monosyllabic you care to add
other than apologies for being late?
Sorry.
That's two syllables.
So, Mary... answer me this.
What are you looking for from us?
As Nursing Director
I feel a full investigation is in order.
Of Dr. Kovac?
Of the entire physicians' staff.
Oh, come on--
but it's true
we get no respect, but this is one complaint
filed by one nurse against one doctor
that she... knew.
That she what?
Nothing. She just doesn't like him anymore.
CAIN: I have a petition
signed by every nurse in the department.
Right, all of whom are tired.
They're overworked, underpaid and pissed off.
Excluding the males.
And Nurse Lockhart.
Apparently, your relationship with Dr. Kovac
ended better than Chuny's.
Did you really just say that?
So it's true. You're all suckers for the accent.
Robert. The bottom line is
this will all be handled by the medical exec committee
in three weeks.
So until then, how do we untwist everybody's panties?
NATHAN: Open your eyes, I know you're faking.
Flowers from a doc.
( strained breathing )
I like this hospital.
Ah, they were half price at the gift shop. Day old.
Pull off a few petals, they're good as new.
Thanks.
Did he go outside?
Yeah, yeah, he's taking a walk.
In circles?
Yeah.
He did that a lot when Mom died.
( labored breathing )
Sometimes it's harder on the people that love us.
He's in denial.
Thinks there's actually hope.
And so do I.
Excuse me? Excuse me.
Malik, did Weaver get down here yet?
I haven't seen her. Hey, how'd it go?
Luka.
Hey, where'd you go? I was looking all over for you.
I'm sorry, I had a meeting.
Hey, she's resting now.
Can I talk to you in just one...?
She's feeling a lot better
and John was really great with her.
( Lockhart sighs )
Who?
Uh, your boyfriend, John Carter?
Carter? Carter.
Hey, listen
can I borrow your keys?
I think we need to crash for a while.
I was hoping that we could stay at your place.
Oh, yeah, sure, no problem.
We'll grab a hotel if it's a hassle.
I just figured
we could have some fun, spend some time together...
No, you're right, it would be fun.
You sure?
I mean, there's not
a lot of room, but...
Doesn't matter-- Jody's great
and you should get to know her while we're in town.
Okay, Eric, it's fine.
Good. Great.
So...
So...?
The keys.
The keys. Right.
I'm sorry. They're in my locker.
Hold on.
Elizabeth, can you handle the rape exam in Four?
I believe you did her consult.
She's an E.R. case.
Yeah, well, at the moment, I'm down an E.R. attending.
Sorry. I tried to get to you first.
What'd she say?
Suspended, pending an investigation.
I guess the nurses don't like me.
Look, I'm sorry, but once they got the director involved...
It's fine.
Right now, I'm not too crazy about them either.
It could be as little as three days.
You could use the free time, right?
Thanks for the heads-up.
Pull inferiorly on the speculum heel slowly.
I should've checked sooner.
She was alone on the train, out of it.
CORDAY: Open and visualize the cervix.
( Harkins sighs )
Whoop, not so fast.
I'm... sorry.
You sure this is the case you should be learning on?
The patient's unconscious. You have stricter criteria?
Father's here. Should I let him in?
No.
Could you shut the door, please?
Let's swab for a wet mount and a Gram stain.
Is this the cervix?
I think it's the cervix.
A small tear at the introitus.
What does that mean?
Semen present.
Check the culture for GC and chlamydia.
You'll need consent
for a full kit.
What, are they dating now?
CARTER: I don't think he's going to make
the best surgeon.
But he seems to have a way with the patients.
Maybe he could be a nursing liaison.
Need him for something?
No, not at the moment.
Dr. Corday.
Where is she? Where is my daughter?
Mr. Paspalis. Uh, we're examining her right now.
Why do they make those shower knobs so sharp?
Hey, Pratt, head lac, no L.O.C.
Sorry, cat, I'm off.
Good night, Lisa.
So, did you get your lottery tickets yet?
And live on the dole my whole life?
( chuckles )
I thought you were off at 5:00.
Charts. I can't sleep knowing that they're sitting here
waiting for me.
How come nobody told us that being a doctor
was all about killing trees?
Mm.
You need some help?
I think I have it down.
How about a beer, maybe?
WOMAN: No! I don't take trains!
I hate trains! Stop it!
I want to get off...!
Haleh, Ativan's not working on Dorothy.
Give her five of Haldol.
My pleasure.
Let me off! Clicktey-clack...
That guy really spooked you today.
Who?
You should go home.
We treat crazy people here.
It's nothing new.
Come on, get your things, let's go.
We'll split a cab.
Trauma coming in?
Car jumped a curb, and ran straight into a line of people
waiting to buy lottery tickets.
Huh. And some people don't believe in luck.
We out of Haldol?
Top drawer.
Chuny forgot to restock.
It's nothing personal, Abby.
I like Dr. Kovac.
Really? It's hard to tell.
He'll be back to work tomorrow.
We have to do this every couple of years
to send a message.
Do you even know what happened?
I don't care what happened.
Cared enough to sign a petition.
Another nurse asks for my support
I'll give it, every time.
Whether she's right or not?
I've been doing this job for 17 years, honey.
Doctors come and go, but nurses make this place run.
We don't get much credit or much pay.
We see a lot of misery, a lot of dying
but we come back every day.
I've given up on being appreciated
but I sure as hell won't let any of us
be taken for granted.
ALISON: I can't even get to the bathroom anymore.
Well, nobody said it was going to be easy.
But you have a brain that works
a father who loves you.
You hold on to that.
You hold on to that as long as you can
and, who knows, anything could happen.
A cure could happen.
We need to move her.
There are multiple traumas coming in.
Fine. Just about to head up to Six West anyway.
Start looking for that liver.
He's cute but annoying.
Only because I'm right.
Come on, they need to prep this room.
Have you ever been to the ocean?
Better. I used to have a lakeside condo.
I dream about it.
I dream I'm down on the bottom
and no matter what, I can't swim up.
I try to breathe and it's just water-- breathing water.
And then when you wake up, it's true.
But you do wake up.
You know, you open your eyes, you breathe
it's another day.
That's because you're still alive.
Your body knows it isn't over.
Dr. Corday!
What? She woke up.
( coughing )
CORDAY: Good.
Very good.
Sara, do you know where you are?
( weakly ): Daddy?
You're all right now, honey.
What happened?
Sara, do you know where you are?
The hospital.
What's the last thing you remember?
I... I was on the train with Pat and Andy
going into the city.
My head.
Oh, you hit it outside
on the stairs.
Do you remember anything else? Anything you did?
No.
No. We were laughing about something.
And then...
We were laughing.
Sara, we think there may have been
a drug in your system-- a sedative.
No. I don't do drugs.
Daddy, I don't do drugs.
I know, honey.
Sara, upon examination...
Doctor, um
I need to speak to you outside.
Yes, in a minute.
No, I would like to speak to you now, please.
Sara, we'll be right back.
Start O2 humidified mask.
I don't want you to tell her what happened.
We don't know what happened.
I don't want her to know.
Mr. Paspalis...
Look, I will check her out.
I will take full responsibility...
Mr. Paspalis, your daughter was probably raped.
She could be pregnant.
She might have a sexually transmitted disease.
I promise you, I will get her fully checked out.
She may not remember now, but she could easily...
Look, look, someone hurt her body.
That doesn't mean that he has to ruin her life.
Please, I couldn't protect her from this guy
but if she doesn't know, I could protect her now.
Dr. Corday.
B.P. 110/70, pulse 106.
Uh, I'm so sorry.
Can you just wait here a minute.
Lottery line guy.
Good airway, no L.O.C. Refused treatment at the site.
You thought to bring him anyway?
I made an executive decision.
I'm next in line.
I just want to buy a ticket.
The call was for multiples. Who's behind you?
No one. Five minors went to Mercy.
Nine-centimeter penetrating lac over the right frontal...
Oh, bollocks.
What?
Sir, stay very, very still!
Foreign body goes right through.
More tachy, pulse 120. Abby...
Abby, your brother's on the phone.
Lung sounds are clear, bilaterally.
Maybe the keys don't work.
We'll need a neurosurgeon.
B.P.'s dropping 100/70. Eric?
ERIC ( over phone ): Hey, sounds busy. Should I call back?
What's wrong?
No step off or other deformity.
I was looking for the blender.
Mr. Gasmer, when was your last tetanus?
Yeah, we were thinking about making milkshakes.
High school, I think. The blender?
Milkshake sounds really good.
I think it's in the cabinet
underneath the coffeemaker.
Mr. Gasmer, we're going to need to take you
to the operating room for this.
Aw, jackpot's 87 million.
Hey, your breadmaker's still in the box.
Sats are at 96. Pulse 110.
Hey, Eric, how's Jody doing?
Hey, John, she's better.
She was thinking we should go out tonight, down Navy Pier.
Maybe we can get my sister to go dancing.
Yeah, she looks excited.
Abby, get off the phone. Call for a C.T. scanner.
Ow!
Oh, here it is.
Crisis averted.
They're making milkshakes.
Okay, let's pack him up to go.
We need Ativan and an airway box.
Uh, Dr. Carter, Alison Deluca would like to speak with you.
Is she moving air?
Yeah. Sats 93. Her temp's down to 99.
Send her home with Biaxin and a fresh O2 tank.
Uh, she's not ready to go.
She wants a consult from the transplant service.
Did I say the last ticket sold is at 6:00?
He did it. He talked her into it.
She just needed to regain her strength.
She wants to be considered for transplant.
She signed a D.N.R.
Well, un-sign it. Destroy it.
I don't care.
She was upset for a few hours.
It doesn't disqualify her for the liver, does it?
No. No, it shouldn't, but she's not a great candidate.
Please, she wants to keep fighting.
I'll be in to see her in a minute.
Would you excuse us.
So do we call UNOS now, or work her up first?
What are you doing?
She didn't have all the facts.
Do you know what it's going to take
to keep her alive for a transplant?
If she even qualifies for a transplant this time
and they find a match?
It's not worth it?
If there's a shot at a cure?
She's dying. She's suffocating.
That's her reality.
Well, there are a lot of realities.
Stem cell research is a reality.
Stem cells?
It's coming.
Whether the government approves it or not, it's coming.
You know that.
Embryonic stem cells can be used to grow
any tissue in the human body.
What, you told her that we could grow her new lungs?
She's got a genetic disease.
Stem cells can fix the defect at the genetic level.
Yeah, maybe, in 50 years.
No, in five years.
The science is there in five years
Do you know what it took for her to face her mortality?
I think I do...
For me to convince her father to accept it?
Oh, this is about your time?
No, this is about you
going in there with your own agenda
and giving her false hope.
It's not false.
Oh, no? The flowers were an interesting touch.
Well, you gave her ten minutes.
There is such a thing as dying with dignity.
Listen, every time a woman goes in
for in vitro and harvests eggs
there are extra blastocysts...
I know the issues.
She's suffering. She doesn't care about politics.
It's the politics that are killing her!
M.I. in one, cured. All heart disease gone.
Cancer in four, cured. Alzheimer's, cured.
The spinal cord injury this morning, cured.
Parkinson's disease.
Cured.
We're out of business, pal.
I know that you need to believe that...
Pack up all this crap, take it away.
And I would love to believe in miracles, too
but she's dying.
She's dying, Nathan.
And the only question is
how well?
She's 26 years old; there's no dying well.
You're giving up.
( sighs )
You were perfectly happy when he was babysitting your patient.
Because you don't want to deal with him.
He's spending more time in the E.R.
than on the surgical ward.
If her mind was that easily changed
she wasn't ready to sign a D.N.R.
Not if he's distorting reality for her.
He obviously believes that reality.
It's not gangrene, but he'll need Unasyn.
Listen, I'm all for big science and I hope that he's right
but it's not going to save this girl.
He offered her hope. Is that so terrible?
For her? Yeah, it is.
You want him on the ward, I'll keep him on the ward.
No, just supervise him.
Look, the patients are who they are.
I can't change the way he sees them.
Well, it is a teaching hospital.
Quiet, everyone. They're announcing the numbers.
Hey, move, I can't see.
TV REPORTER: ...$87 million.
To win the jackpot, all you have to do is match all...
You better watch out.
They're choosing the next Mega-Millionaire out there.
I thought you already won the lottery.
Oh, I did, when I met you.
( laughing )
Is this going to be warm enough?
I don't know.
Who dances outside in November?
Eskimos.
He doesn't even like to dance.
Well, love makes you do crazy things.
What?
Nothing.
I just wish I could...
go be someplace quiet with him.
Well, give her a chance.
Maybe she's mature beyond her years.
I know.
( sighs )
It's not her, really, it's him.
He's acting strange.
Strange how?
You know, flighty... spontaneous.
Happy?
Too happy.
There's no such thing.
In my family, yes, there is.
He's what? 27?
Yeah, but he's smoking and he's flying around in planes
and he has this milkshake obsession...
( laughs )
What?
Milkshake obsession?
Well...
You don't think that your radar
might be a little sensitive? No.
I don't know, maybe.
Hey...
it's a double date.
I think we can all afford
to have some fun.
Only if you don't make me dance.
I can't promise anything.
You have real commitment issues, you know that?
( sounds of passion )
( moaning )
( door opens )
Yo, Greg! Yo, Greg!
( gasps ) I won! I won, man!
Look at this!
What are you doing here, man?
Get out of here, man.
You're supposed to be down at...
Who are you? Get out!
You pretty. Get out! Get out!
I'm a winner!
What the hell is wrong with you?
I checked the number three times.
Look, I don't care, okay?
Give me some damn privacy.
But I won... It's all right; I should go.
No, no, no, no, no. He's leaving.
Leon, leave, get out of here. I'm sorry.
I'm going to see you at work, all right? Bye.
No, Jing-Mei, it's-it's... Ooh, uh...
Well, are you going to be okay?
Yeah, I'll be fine. Nice meeting you.
Damn it, Leon.
She was hot.
Anybody win anything?
This place is cursed.
WEAVER: Abby! I'm off.
Luka's coming in for counseling tomorrow.
I want to get him back on the schedule by Tuesday.
He agreed to that?
Well, reluctantly.
I threw it on Human Resources
I-I didn't ask to be nurse manager.
Well, are you quitting?
Do you want me to quit? No.
Did you change to go home and then clock out?
Whatever.
Just set a time to meet with him after your shift.
Who? Luka.
( chuckles ): No, no, no, no.
No, he needs to be counseled by the nurse manager.
You know that? Maybe I do want to quit.
It's too late.
Abby, did we get the U.A. back on the rape exam?
I called down there twice.
If it's negative, have Harkins dispo her.
You're sending her home?
With a head injury observation chart.
I mean without telling her.
She's a minor.
What about emergency contraception?
It's the end of her cycle.
So you're going to lie to her?
Her father has the right to sign her out.
She's a 14-year-old girl who was raped.
Doesn't she have any rights?
Just check on the labs.
She wants to go home.
Sorry, I'm off.
What?
ICU admitted Alison.
She's getting her FFP up there.
Fine.
Congratulations, Mr. Nathan.
You're on call tomorrow night.
Thank you.
32 hours straight.
Go home, get some rest.
You'll need it.
( sighing )
I can't wash my hair?
Only for a few days.
Your pediatrician will take your stitches out
in a week.
You like being a doctor?
Some days are better than others.
It must be weird seeing people naked and stuff.
( chuckles ): I suppose it's weird.
It depends on the patient.
I don't care for the hairy ones.
( laughs )
Sara... I have to tell you something very difficult.
Uh... when we examined you
we found evidence of sexual assault.
Assault?
Yes, you were raped.
You told my dad I was raped?
He's just trying to protect you
but you do have the right to know.
The scratches, the bruising--
there's more bruising inside.
You looked inside?
We did a rape exam, yes.
Who said you could?
I didn't say you could do that.
You were unconscious.
We had to make sure you weren't injured.
I don't care. I didn't say you could do that.
Look, I know this is confusing
and scary and if you'd like to speak to somebody...
I wasn't raped, you stupid bitch!
Sara, there were drugs.
Yeah, Special K.
It makes the sex all kind of swirly.
You took ketamine
and had sexual intercourse?
It's like having 20 boyfriends and they all totally love me.
That's incredibly dangerous.
No. I do it every weekend.
You could suffer from long-term brain damage.
I seize sometimes
but we usually have Ativan or Xanax.
And... all the guys say I'm the best.
ERIC: Catholic school refugees
both of us.
Uh, Abby was completely famous.
She had a Sex Pistols T-shirt that she wore over her jumper.
( laughs ): I hope you saved that uniform.
And you were pretty bad yourself.
Because you got caught making out
( laughs ): with, um... Justine Miceli
in the vestry.
Uh, church always brought out the romantic in me.
Good to know.
How long are you guys
going to stay for?
I don't know. Not so sure.
We still got some sightseeing we want to do.
Oh, yeah, I heard the art museum's really neat.
Yeah, but we're just playing it by ear, you know?
Hang out for a couple days before Ohio.
Aren't you due back at the base?
Not for a couple weeks.
I'm on extended leave.
Couple weeks?
Yeah, like I said, I was overdue.
Did you tell her about the interview?
Hmm-mm.
What interview?
O'Hare. They're looking for experienced controllers.
H-Hello.
Don't you have, like
another year left on your thing?
I do, but I'm just exploring my options.
You know, I can't stay in the Air Force forever.
I know, but...
Hey...
Is she always like this?
Don't do that. You know what
you're a little tense.
I think you and I should take a spin.
Oh, no, no, no... Come on.
Do you want me to embarrass you
in front of your boyfriend by telling more horror stories
from high school? All right Stop it.
did you hear about the one time she almost set
the garage on fire? Ah, Eric!
She used to like this guy named Rafe...
Rafe? Oh, okay, that's it.
No, wait, I want to hear more
about Rafe. All right.
He was a rocker dude I said okay!
who wore leather pants.
( country music playing )
She really loves you.
You think so?
Yeah, I mean, you're so comfortable together, you know?
Intimate.
Without, you know, needing to show off.
( chuckles )
Uh, Abby says that you guys have know each other
for a couple weeks.
Yeah.
I love this song.
Don't you love this song?
Do you want to dance?
Come on, let's dance.
Come on.
Come on.
( clears throat )
Hi.
Hey.
Uh, you hear the organ service got Alison on the UNOS list?
Yes, I know. Status two.
It's a nice feeling.
What?
When you realize you've affected someone's life.
Touched them in some way.
You think she'll last long enough?
One can only hope.
( train approaching )
You on your meds?
Uh, got a little off schedule.
You can't get up, can you?
I'll catch the next one.
I can wait, if you...
No, no
it's all right.
They'll kick in.
You know, it's a nice night.
It's okay, go ahead.
I'll see you tomorrow.
I expect you will.
