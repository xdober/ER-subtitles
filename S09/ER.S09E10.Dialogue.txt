Previously on ER:
Is someone sitting here?
No.
I think you know my wife Heather.
I'd appreciate it if you'd stop seeing her.
When you're waiting
on a patient's results
it's not necessary for you to boff
that patient's mother in the storage closet.
You just get red when you lie.
You don't even have to try, do you?
Sorry?
With women.
Patient #1 refused treatment.
Patient #2 on high-flow O2
with 500cc's of normal saline in.
Pressure 100/80.
ETA of about four minutes.
Say again the neuro exam on patient two.
Ma'am, can you tell me your name?
What's your name, ma'am?
Still unresponsive to verbal.
GCS is 324.
Copy that, 37.
Hey, you from County?
Hey, buddy.
Country General clear.
Sit on my lap
and tell me what you want for Christmas, little girl.
I want it to be January.
Ho-ho-ho!
( screams )
It's okay, honey.
He's really not Santa.
Frank, can you please stop scaring the kids?
Since when is Santa scary?
Since he looks like a fat, old, homeless dude.
Pratt, two incoming. Stick around?
Do I look like Bob Cratchit to you?
Just hang out till we see how...
Anybody work here anymore?
You want to go in now?
I don't know if I'm ready.
Okay.
Systolic's 100 on maximum dopamine.
Satting at 91 with five of PEEP.
He said he was run-down
and I told him to see a doctor.
We're going to take Rick up to ICU.
Why don't you sit with him until we find him a bed?
He said it was stress from winter exams.
It's okay.
He moved. Is that good?
It's probably just a reflex.
Repeat the Hemocue and ABG in half an hour.
* This poor youngling for whom we do sing... *
Try something more cheerful.
You think we should up his PEEP?
His pressure won't tolerate it.
How'd it go?
Intermittent decerebrate posturing.
Neurosurg needs to put him on an ICP monitor.
Where's Dr. Kovac?
Went home. Get him back here.
I think he needs a little time.
Get him back.
This shouldn't have happened, Abby.
It's not his fault.
He missed it.
He's just a little burned out.
I always thought of you as a big man
but compared to Jerry, you're just sort
of an ambitious elf, aren't you?
Dr. Romano, will you tell him to change?
I always do Santa.
Not since I've been here.
I have the perfect ho-ho-ho.
Sounds more like the Jolly Green Giant.
You guys, we already have a wasted angel of Bethlehem.
Can we not have feuding St. Nicks?
The gastroenteritis in One is free to go.
The urticaria in Three is waiting for solumedrol.
Who's got the incoming?
MVA, LOC on scene. Me.
Received needle thoracostomy in the field.
Oh, my God.
It's Harkins.
Know her? She's a med student here.
Last pressure, 100 palp.
What happened? Was she alone?
She's with one of your docs.
Can't get a pulse.
Get a wheelchair!
JING-MEI: Let me check your head.
Luka.
Luka, you should sit down.
Trauma panel. Get four of O-neg.
Come on, Kovac. Let's take a look.
Jing-Mei, we've got enough hands.
Robert, she might need an ex-lap.
All right. I'll go free up an OR.
Prime the rapid infuser.
Pulse is 110, thready.
Why isn't she on a backboard?
He cleared her clinically.
With a distracting injury?
Gallant, he needs a fresh kerlix.
Pressure's down to 80.
All right. Squeeze in two liters.
Get her in a collar and tape her head down.
I need X Ray for a lateral C-spine, chest and pelvis.
She was walking on scene.
You should step back.
You might contaminate the field.
Systolic's only 60.
Free fluid in Morrison's pouch
and the right pericolic gutter.
Probably liver laceration. Page trauma.
Dr. Kovac, what happened?
( crashing, glass shattering )
You okay? Did you hit your head?
No, my side.
Neck pain?
No.
The door. It won't open.
Call 911.
I'll go see about the other car.
We hit someone?
Just wait here.
Stay still! I'm a doctor!
Can't move my leg.
Paramedic's on the way.
It was the other guy's fault.
He was driving like a maniac.
( boy groaning )
Are you all right?
I don't know.
I think you dislocated your hip.
Are they okay?
Who?
In the other car.
Yeah, yeah.
Don't move for now, okay?
What's your name?
Dwayne.
Dwayne...
take a deep breath.
It hurts.
Stridor.
How bad is that?
Ouch.
His collarbone may be broken.
Can't breathe...
Can you help him?!
I'll be right back.
Wait! Don't leave us here!
An adult with a posterior hip dislocation
and a kid with a compromised airway.
Paramedic ETA is less than five.
I thought I had a tool kit!
I can't believe you did this.
I need pliers! Pliers?
I have to elevate a depressed clavicle fracture.
How about a suture kit?
Hold on!
MAN: Dwayne, I think you're starting to pass out.
Wake up, Dwayne.
This might hurt a little.
Aren't you going to give him something?
I don't have any drugs with me.
Shouldn't we wait for the paramedics?
He's not getting any air.
Scalpel.
You should sit down.
I'm okay. I'm okay.
Plastic set. 15 blade. I'm okay.
Wake up, son. Wake up, son.
Don't move him!
( gasps )
Oh, God!
Gauze.
You want the kelly or the needle driver?
Kelly clamp.
Radial pulse is pretty thready.
I need a tenaculum or a towel clip.
Wait, they're here. They're here!
They don't have any surgical instruments.
He's getting cyanotic.
Get out of the way, please!
He's an OR doc.
Possible dislocated hip there, airway obstruction here.
( breathing normally )
Okay, take him.
We should get cleaned up.
I'm fine.
Looks like 43 got the call, too.
There's some saline and kerlix over here.
Okay.
Did you get the guys in the other car already?
It's just us.
Us?
Erin!
Weak radial pulse.
Any other injuries?
She was complaining of right side pain.
Maybe a lacerated liver.
She needs two liters of saline
and high-flow O2. Hurry up!
Who was driving?
I was.
Squeeze my hand.
Pressure's down to 90 systolic.
Pulse ox 86.
Turn it up to six liters.
How far are we?
About six minutes. Roads are pretty icy.
I can't hear anything.
Give me an 18-gauge angiocath.
She already has two IVs.
I think it's a tension pneumo.
Take it easy. We'll be there in a few minutes.
I'm going to needle her chest.
Give me the angiocath.
You suffered a blunt head injury.
I don't think you...
Then you do it!
No way.
She's going to arrest.
Danny, you want me to pull over?
No, keep going.
Sats are up to 92.
It's not your fault.
I should have been more careful.
Can you slow down?
These things happen.
Two months in the ER doesn't make an expert, okay?
I'm upset, too.
It's not just you.
Please slow down.
These things don't just don't happen.
Not if you know what you're doing.
Okay, pull over.
Let me out.
Luka!
Luka, they're ready for her in the OR.
Okay, thanks.
Don't you want to talk to them?
It's okay.
You do it.
Okay, so we're going to take you upstairs now
and the surgeons are just going to remove the clot.
Is the other doctor here?
Who? Dr. Kovac?
The cute one.
Dr. Chen, have you seen Luka?
On his way out.
Will you thank him for us?
He made them give Jane the CT.
Sure.
What, are you just going to leave?
My shift's almost over.
Anyway, it wasn't my shift.
What's going on, Luka?
I'm fine.
I'll be fine.
It's not about you.
What you do outside of this hospital
that's up to you, but not when it starts
preventing you from doing your job.
Not when it starts hurting patients.
Do you even care?
Do you even care that that kid is lying out there
as good as dead?
HARKINS: Hey, Luka.
Luka!
Hey, um, can we get some coffee or something?
Um, Dr. Lewis said I should go.
I need some sleep.
Yeah, but I could use the company
and I thought you might, too.
I'm sorry about in the elevator.
It's okay.
It's a crappy day.
Maybe I gave you the wrong idea last night.
Not at all.
Well, good night then.
Hey, um, can I at least get a ride?
Crit's up to 19 with two units in.
Sats?
89 on 100% with five of PEEP.
How long was he waiting?
I'm not sure.
Abby.
Harkins, you should go home.
Well, isn't there something else I can do?
Not right now.
Okay.
Luka thought he had the flu.
Did he listen over the stomach after intubation?
I don't know.
Did he use the end tidal CO2 detector?
I don't know, Susan.
He would have had another few years.
Ten if he was lucky.
He was a lot sicker than he seemed.
It doesn't matter.
He was a lot sicker
than anyone would have known.
Betadine the neck.
More suction.
HARKINS: It's as high as it goes.
There's way too much blood.
KOVAC: 11 blade.
Forget it. Bag him.
Number seven sterile gloves.
Skin hook.
Suction here.
Damn it.
Pulse ox's only 72.
Hemostat.
70 of lidocaine.
Two by twos.
CHUNY: Multifocal PVCs.
I can't see.
HARKINS: Pulse ox 68.
There.
Stabilize the tube, Susan.
Give me the bag.
Run of five.
You're in the pretracheal space.
Trousseau dilator and a fresh shiley.
CHUNY: Heart rate down to 40.
Amp of atropine, open the crash cart.
Is that a seizure?
Decerebrate posturing.
Got it.
Platelets are here.
Squeeze them in.
Easy to bag.
You're in.
HARKINS: The posturing--
is it from cerebral hypoxia?
So it's brain damage.
I'll go talk to the girlfriend.
No, I'll do it.
Luka.
I said I'll do it.
Leukemia?
He didn't know he had it.
Nobody did.
If we'd sent off a CBC earlier
we could have started the transfusion
and antibiotics on time.
But now he's showing signs of brain damage
because he was deprived of oxygen for too long.
Isn't it possible he could still get better?
It's unlikely.
But it's not impossible, right?
No, it's not impossible.
We waited out here for so long
before they took us in.
I know.
So many people got seen before us.
Why did we have to wait so long?!
He should have received better care.
Do you believe in God?
Do you believe
He punishes people?
It wasn't God.
Would you pray with me?
I would feel better if you prayed with me.
I can get the hospital chaplain.
Get a post-intubation film and a blood gas in 20 minutes.
Sats are dropping.
It's okay. Give them a minute.
They'll come up.
Do you want some coffee?
No, I'm fine.
This is your flu kid?
Pulmonary edema. I had to intubate.
CHUNY: PVCs. Pulse ox is 68.
Something's not right.
HARKINS: There's a lot
of resistance.
Damn it! Pull out the tube!
You're in the esophagus.
I heard bilateral breath sounds.
They must have been transmitted.
Listen over the stomach.
Couldn't you see the cords?
It was hard to tell.
( exasperated sigh )
Bag him up.
Maybe the tube moved when the nurse taped it in.
LEWIS: Open up another
8.0 ET tube.
HARKINS: Pulse ox up to 80.
Do you want me to do this?
No. Let's go.
Oh, my God.
What? Yankauer.
Too much blood.
CHUNY: CBC's back.
Go on.
White blood count's 85,000
with 6% blasts.
He's got acute leukemia.
What?
Platelets?
12,000.
No wonder he's bleeding so much.
Hang two units, type-specific.
Cross another four. Platelets and FFP.
Blood culture's done?
Not yet.
Oh, he's septic.
Bag him.
Set up the fiberoptic
and open a crike kit.
We're going to have to crike him?
There was no indication of leukemia.
He presented with a simple fever.
It didn't look like anything.
An operation could save that girl
but we have to catch it in time.
I'm sorry, I didn't realize
I should have pushed her ahead.
I need to know that when I ask you to do something
it'll get done.
Okay.
Whatever happens outside the hospital
doesn't change anything when we're at work.
Is this about last night?
I'm just trying to get through the shift.
How are his sats?
Only 82.
What took you so long?
I had a patient who needed a CT
and I wanted to give the lasix a chance to work.
All right. Chen needs Versed in Three.
I'll be right there.
He's not responding.
Push the induction meds.
Rick, I'm going to have to put a tube in your throat.
How come?
To give him more oxygen.
Call my folks, okay?
You're going to be just fine.
When you wake up a machine will be
breathing for you.
You won't be able to talk.
If you need money, hock the ring.
Shut up.
20 in. Sux, too.
Suction.
What's going on?
Pulse ox down to 80.
Can't see anything.
Cricoid pressure.
Is something going wrong?
He's too interior.
What are you doing?
It'll help me reach the cords.
Pressure's down to 75.
What's happening?
Chuny, maybe Abby can help.
Let's take a walk, okay?
This way.
Start dopamine, ten mikes per kilo.
There.
Bag him and call for a vent.
You know, Frank, you should dress like that every day.
Why not? You dress like a doctor.
I need my tox screen back on the girl in Two.
Frank, where did we put the tinsel from last year?
In the drug lockup behind the Viagra.
Hey, what happened to my menorah?
We had a security breach.
KOVAC: And bring the food poisoning in from triage.
PRATT: Already got it.
This is bad, Frank.
The menorah has great symbolic value.
Do you know what it represents?
Has anyone taken the GERD in Exam Four?
Yeah, yeah. Eight crazy nights.
Hello?
I was going to say our liberation.
You're Jewish?
Converted.
Like Sammy Davis, Jr.
Right.
FRANK: Help you?
I'm investigating an assault on an old man.
Was brought in here.
Uh, Vladko Dor... Dorick?
Doric.
You take care of him?
Yeah, we both did.
There was also another older man
uh, might be his attacker.
That's what the victim's daughter told me.
I don't remember.
Me, either.
LOCKHART: Luka, do you have a minute?
This is a serious matter.
Doric is almost 80 years old.
He could have died.
PRATT: Yeah, but he didn't.
And we don't remember any other old guy.
Do you mind if I look around?
Sure.
Hey, treat yourself.
I did a Hemocue on Rick Kendrick.
His hemoglobin's 5.2. It's way too low.
Was this a capillary sample?
I pulled from his purple top.
Did you draw above the IV site?
Luka...
Hmm?
It's from his angiocath before he had any fluid.
I think he needs cultures and a real workup.
JARVIK: Dr. Kovac.
Uh, do another Hemocue.
Type and cross?
She's seizing.
Just check the CBC and hold a clot for the blood bank.
What's wrong? What's happening to her?!
Push four of Ativan.
She's not breathing.
Okay, let's bag her.
Open a crash cart.
She bit her tongue.
Why is she still here?
CT said they were backed up.
I was waiting for them to call.
How long were you planning to wait?
Jane?
She's postictal.
Honey, I'm here.
Call CT and tell them I'm bringing her up.
Luka!
Pulmonary edema.
Pulse ox down to 78.
Pressure's 100 systolic.
Okay, put him on 100% non-rebreather.
Wet crackles throughout.
What's that mean?
Your lungs are filled with fluid.
What's that mean?
I'm not sure yet
but the oxygen should help.
One nitrospray and push 40 of Lasix.
Should I go ahead without you?
Coming.
You're not leaving, are you?
I'll be right back.
Etomidate and sux? Have it ready!
I have two criticals ahead of her, and after that...
You have to do it now.
She had a seizure in the ER while we've been waiting.
Dr. Kovac, you are not the only doctor in the hospital.
Meanwhile, you're playing around up here with a TIA
who's clinically stable
and a drunk with a simple scalp lac.
His doctor reported he was acting odd after a fall.
It's called eggnog.
This is an 11-year-old girl who could have
an epidural bleed and might need
surgery to save her.
Doesn't look like she had a head trauma.
She's got ataxia and a positive Romberg.
TECH: Mrs. Gallagher on deck?
No. Yes.
This is Jane Irby. She's next.
( mumbling )
He says he doesn't get sick much.
Good. Then you should rebound fast.
You taking any medications?
Uh, just vitamins.
Deep breath.
( inhaling )
Pressure's up to 100 after a liter.
Okay, sounds good.
He might need another two.
His parents are coming in for the holidays
and I really need to clean up our place.
It's the first time I'm meeting them.
Is it okay if she leaves?
I don't think you'll be here too long
but she should stay until we see
if you need any medicine.
Medicine?
Pain meds, anti-nausea agents...
You know
they can make you lightheaded.
Okay.
I'll be right back.
Hey...
what do you want?
CBC, a dip of urine and a chest X-ray.
No Hemocue?
He's looking pretty pasty.
No, he just needs to be hydrated.
Are we okay?
About what?
Last night.
In the bedroom?
Did I do something stupid?
You don't remember?
I had a couple of drinks.
A couple of dozen.
Okay, as long as we're all right.
Let me know when the CBC's back.
I'm concerned, all right?
He's got the flu, Abby.
You worry too much.
You may need some 6-0 nylons.
Doc, you're not really going to press charges, are you?
You punched me in the face.
( sighs )
What happened?
A... vicious midget.
Hey!
Uh, this is Laura Ruiz
Rick Kendrick's girlfriend,
Dr. Kovac.
Thank you for looking after Rick.
Doc, I was just reaching up.
With a clenched fist?
I'm 4'11." My fists are always clenched.
Come on, Luka. Let's get you fixed up.
Wh... come on...
You can't be sick.
Your parents are going to be here tomorrow.
I know, I'm sorry, babe.
We don't think you're going to have to stay here overnight.
His parents are kind of scary.
( chuckles ) They're lawyers.
They think we're too young to get hitched.
Look, he gave this to me in the library.
Wow. Level C stacks.
Modern philosophy.
Don't tell her it's cubic zirconium.
Shut up. It is not.
How old are you?
19.
I'm 20.
Older women.
( chuckles )
We met in church.
So, when's the date?
New Year's Eve, we're going to elope-- Reno.
No time like the present, right?
Congratulations.
Shouldn't you be gone by now?
I keep trying to leave.
Mm, one of those days, huh?
( sighs )
You know, I learned a valuable lesson:
never host a party
when you have to work the next morning.
Are you here through the holidays?
Yeah, you?
Yeah, I guess so.
We're pretty shorthanded.
It seems like everyone's got someplace to go.
So us single people get the short straw.
Couples, people with kids
they all get to take off.
We have to stay here and mind the store.
Yeah, I don't care.
Christmas-- it's not what it's supposed to be anyway.
No?
Back home, it was different.
You know, we'd take the kids sleigh-riding
cut down our own tree.
And my wife...
made the fish night before
and then turkey for Christmas Day.
Sounds perfect.
Yeah.
Wound edges aren't under tension
so I'd keep those in for five days.
You know, if you're not doing anything next week
I'm having a few people over for Christmas dinner.
( chuckles ): Your orphan friends?
Just some folks who can't get home
or don't want to.
Rick Kendrick's BP is down to 80.
Who?
Your flu kid.
Oh, uh, put him in Room Two.
I already did.
And give him saline wide open.
He's been waiting all morning.
I'll be right there.
Okay.
You should think
about joining us, Luka.
I will. Thanks.
Six liters by nasal cannula, and let's get an ABG.
That man-- I want him arrested.
Hey, you just take it easy.
Bilateral rales to halfway up.
Any chest pain?
No.
I take aspirin every day.
Ah, good for you.
WOMAN: Dad?
You okay?
Was it a mugging?
I don't know. It happened so fast.
We need to redo the portable chest.
Okay, we need to step out for a minute.
Come right back, Hannah.
I need you here. I will.
Continue his nitro drip and push another 80 of Lasix.
( groans )
Did they catch whoever did this?
He was brought in by paramedics soon after.
You know, he says he knew your dad
from before... It's not important what he says.
He's not thinking clearly.
But he's here?
You're helping the person who hurt my father?
That's our job, too.
He brutalized a harmless old man.
Someone like that
doesn't deserve your help.
You can wait here till they are done with the X-rays.
What are you doing?
Why not just give it up?
He's 80 years old, Pratt.
Yeah, so what?
That doesn't mean we have to help him lie.
The past is the past.
You can't outrun it.
He's doing a pretty good job.
Yeah, until today.
MAN: That's it!
You two are out of here!
Hey, you started it, fat-ass!
We just want to see our buddy. Out, out.
Frank, put down the menorah!
What's going on?
He won't let us see our friend.
Don't you have reindeer to milk?
That's it.
( grunts ) ( gasps )
Hey, Abby, 50 migs of Captopril for the old guy in Two.
Uh, nope. How about Lotensin?
Okay, I'll ask Luka if that's okay.
It's okay.
20 milligrams should do it.
Okay.
You practicing your suturing?
Thanks for the kit.
You get home okay last night?
Yeah, I did.
( sighs )
You know, you should be careful.
About what?
There's a lot of gossip around here.
There's nothing going on.
It's just that he's a doctor
you're a med student...
Abby, there's nothing going on.
Okay.
But...?
Uh, Luka tends to not think things through sometimes
and I don't think it would be good for either of you.
Thanks for the pill.
Up the nitro to 40 mikes. ( muttering )
Do you need plaster for his wrist?
20 of Lotensin.
I asked for Captopril.
Abby said it was the same.
GUTTER: It's him!
Him! Sir, calm down...
Don't help him! Calm down!
You taking him up?
CT showed a Grade 3 liver lac.
Let him die. He doesn't deserve your medicine!
No splenic damage?
Not according to the resident.
He needs an E-lap to repair it.
Shut up!
You deserve to die!
You madman!
( both men yelling )
Sir, you're going to have to calm down.
That guy needs help.
Put this on. You need the oxygen.
He's crazy, you know?
What all he's saying.
( exhales )
So, any recent illnesses?
No.
Did you fall in the game?
No, I think I'm okay.
It was just a headache.
Will you walk across the room, please?
Stand feet together...
Hands out, eyes closed.
Nothing happened.
Jane...
you know, this can also be a lie detector.
I took a hard check in practice.
My helmet flew off.
Coach had me sit down for a few minutes
but I wanted to get back in.
Why didn't you say so?
My dad's really protective.
He'll make me stop.
Neuro checks "Q" ten minutes...
Mm-hmm.
...and make sure she gets a CT.
You won't tell my dad, will you?
Let's just get you better, okay?
Sorry, honey, no marshmallows.
Here you go.
Hey, are you leaving now?
No, I'll wait until she's dispo'd.
Do you want me to find Dr. Chen?
Let's just get the girl to CT, okay?
Okay.
Hey. Hey.
Hey, you ever seen bullous myringitis?
No. I've heard of it.
Well, I got one in Exam Four.
You can take a look at it
when she gets back from x-ray.
Let me know.
All right. Okay.
Hey, so, uh, how long did you stay at Susan's?
Not very.
Oh, I missed my dance.
I'm sorry about that.
Next time, I promise.
Sure.
Will the police come?
Probably. You beat up on somebody, right?
How's he doing?
Ah, he's mostly worried about getting ratted out.
They won't understand-- the police.
They'll put me in jail, but I did nothing wrong.
Didn't you attack Mr. Doric?
Yes.
Why would you do something like that?
Are you Jewish?
No.
Still, maybe you can understand.
I didn't see that man for almost 60 years.
Then I see him... on, on the street, my own street
and old man now, like me...
with a face I'll never forget.
He worked for the ustasha.
The what?
It was like, uh, Gestapo.
That man, Doric
was our neighbor.
He told them where to find our family.
I ran to the woods when I saw them coming, but...
Mama, Dada, sisters...
they went away to Jasenovac camp.
I never saw them again.
Dr. Chen was called away on a penetrative trauma
before she could do the workup
on Jane Irby.
The hockey girl?
Okay, start her up. I'll be in.
Okay. I couldn't find another doctor.
Okay.
When I saw him at the bus stop today
he was laughing.
I couldn't control myself.
Well, how can you be so sure it's the same guy?
Some things stay in your head forever
as they were yesterday.
Get the Sonaside full trauma panel, chest and AB post.
Oh, please. I can't go to jail.
( sighing )
CHEN: Hey. Hi.
I didn't know you were on today.
Yeah, I got the call from Weaver.
Oh... too bad for you. Huh.
Hey, um, so what's the story
with Luka and Harkins?
There's a story?
They left together last night.
She probably needed a ride home.
They were dancing at Susan's.
So? I was dancing with Yosh.
( chuckles )
Oh, hey, Luka! Hey.
So, you're out of here?
Harkins is with a girl in Three
you might want to keep an eye on.
Okay, sure thing.
See you later.
See, that wasn't so bad, was it?
A couple hours saving lives
and now you're back on the streets.
I feel like crap.
You don't look so great, either.
Thanks a lot.
Mat Gutter, picked up
after getting sideswiped by a bus.
Bystanders said he was running away from an altercation.
ABBY: Why were you running, sir?
Not much of a talker, this one.
His last name is Gutter?
Is he Croatian?
( speaking Croatian )
( speaking Croatian )
He doesn't want the police.
Okay, Trauma One's open.
I'll be right there.
You better go before you get sucked back in there.
Everything okay?
Maybe I should stay in case that guy doesn't speak English.
No. We're good. Go home.
Where should this go? Oh!
Back in the box.
What time did Luka say he was coming in?
He didn't.
You want us to cut the net off this tree?
Well, unless you want to keep it for next year.
Toberen's scan is negative.
ENT's draining a periauricular hematoma.
All right, check that they premedicate him.
Sure you don't want to meet me in Boston?
I think you need some quality time with the old man.
You'll be missed.
I always am, right?
WEAVER: Luka, two, three hours tops.
Just to get us through
the rough patch until Chen comes in.
Kovac and Harkins, huh?
I don't think so.
Sure looks that way.
Hey, she's not like that.
CARTER: We got Jane Irby. She's 12.
Presented with a migraine.
Her father brought her straight from hockey practice.
She needs an H&P and a dose of Compazine.
You want to scan her?
Your call. Then Casey
is the foul-mouthed drunk in One who fell off the night train.
Yeah, I've seen him last week.
He got thiamine and sutures.
He just needs to sober up, wake up
get the hell out of here.
How are you doing?
A little tired.
Serves you right for being a party animal.
Thanks for coming in.
Not my choice.
Anything else?
Yeah.
College kid in Curtain Two, Rick Kendrick.
Looks like influenza, but I'd check it out.
Have you seen him yet?
Just his triage note.
Where are you headed?
I promised my father I'd spend a couple
days with him.
Everything all right?
Yeah, it's just his first Christmas alone.
Have a good trip.
Bye.
Hey, are you, uh, taking over now?
Yeah.
Yeah, look, I feel much better.
I don't really think I need anything
so I'm just going to tough it out.
Stick around till we're sure.
We'll get to you soon, okay?
( Frank humming )
Hey, what do you think?
I don't know if you're the Santa type, Frank.
What? Too sexy?
Triage is packed and Mission's on diversion.
Can Carter stay on?
No, he's catching a plane at 10:00.
I have to get upstairs for an administration meeting.
Who's available to come in?
Nobody.
What about Kovac?
Probably not a good idea.
Call him.
He looked like he was coming down with something last night.
( phone ringing )
( whispering ): Hello?
Hello? Is Luka there?
( clears throat ): Yeah, uh, he's sleeping.
Who's this?
Uh, just a second.
Luka. Luka.
It's for you.
( sniffs )
Yeah?
Who was that?
What?
Uh, Weaver wants you to come in today.
( sighs )
I'm off today.
I know, but we're swamped.
It'll just be for a couple hours.
I didn't promise that.
( clears throat ): I can't.
He can't.
Give me that.
Get your ass in here!
Sorry.
Careful driving-- it's icy out there.
( sighing )
I shouldn't have answered that, right?
( groans )
Um... I don't get my present.
( laughing )
Well, this one is for Dr. Carter.
Ooh... What's to understand
about edible undies?
I think it's supposed to help you catch a man, or something.
Yeah. Well, it's the thought that counts.
Ooh!
( laughter )
Furry handcuffs.
The gift that keeps on giving.
( Chen imitates cat growling )
Okay, are we done?
No, you have to open your present.
Oh, I've still got the rubber sheets from last year.
That's where those came from, huh?
Earrings. I can tell it's earrings, right?
Come on, come on. Open it up.
Is it edible?
Oh.
Ooh.
Ooh, a snow globe.
Oh.
It's pretty.
Who gave it?
Well, I guess your Santa will have to stay a secret.
Um, Susan, where'd you put my coat?
You're not leaving, are you?
I've got to work tonight. ( all aahing )
Uh, it's in the bedroom.
Merry Christmas.
Ciao.
Happy New Year.
Hi.
Hi.
You going?
Yeah, it's getting late.
Ooh, somebody knows you pretty well.
What did you get?
( "What Child Is This?" playing )
You all right?
We don't talk much anymore.
Like we don't know what to say.
Well, we should fix that.
We could get a cup of coffee or something.
Or you could come over for dinner.
Carter orders up a mean pizza.
I miss you, Abby.
Um...
Okay, I'm going
to take a wild guess here.
You've been drinking.
So?
So...
maybe we should talk about this some other time.
You don't look happy.
I'm happy.
Th-That's good.
I want you to be happy.
I'm just saying that if you're not...
I should go.
I made mistakes.
A lot... a lot of mistakes.
Don't make another one.
CARTER: Hey, you ready to go?
Yep.
Luka.
You're missing all the fun.
Yeah, you should stay.
Got to go.
Are you working tomorrow?
No.
Lucky for you.
Lucky for the patients.
Merry Christmas.
Yeah.
( softly ): Merry Christmas.
Hey.
You know it's a party.
You're supposed to hang out with people.
Yeah, I thought someone
was maybe buried under these coats.
Well, Dr. Lewis has the dance floor going.
Luka don't dance.
Come on.
Show me some of those Croatian moves.
( sighs )
Maybe in a minute, okay?
Okay, well, I'm not going anywhere.
Where's the bedroom?
Whoa-ho.
( chuckles ): You go too fast.
Let's talk sweet nothings first.
You need to go to sleep.
Hey, Erin?
Yeah?
You are a very pretty girl.
You know, if you're trying to seduce me
this is a very unconventional approach.
Really?
You're supposed to get the girl drunk.
I thought you were.
The bedroom?
I think it's up there.
( chuckles )
You staying here tonight?
I'm going to sleep on the couch.
There's more room in the bed.
Oh, there always is.
No, no, no, I can do it.
No, no, I got it.
You don't have to work tomorrow, right?
No, no, no, no. No work.
That's good.
Why do you want to be a doctor?
I don't know.
Good at science.
I became a doctor to take care of people.
To heal them.
( sighs heavily )
You do.
Every day.
( groaning )
But strangers.
Only strangers.
And not tomorrow.
Good night, Dr. Kovac.
Systolic's only 60.
LEWIS: Free fluid in Morrison's pouch and the right pericolic gutter.
WEAVER: Probably liver laceration.
Page trauma.
Pulse 140. Sats are down to 78.
Put her in Trendelenburg.
LEWIS: 10 blade and a 32 French.
GALLANT: Dr. Kovac.
What happened?
She needed a ride home.
WEAVER: Got the subclavian.
LEWIS: I'm in. O-silk on a driver.
Draw up etomidate and sux for an intubation.
ABBY: 200cc's in the thoraseal.
