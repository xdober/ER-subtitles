Previously on ER:
So why do you have a PICC line?
Uh, stage three "C" testicular cancer.
You have a kid?
He's being raised by good people.
Aren't you good people?
I was worried about you because I love you.
You mean you think I'm crazy?
Mentally unstable.
Suddenly plagued by a psychiatric illness.
What do you think?
You mother asked us to notify you that a small aircraft
your brother Eric Wyzcenski was flying has disappeared.
She was unable to reach you by phone.
Explain to me how somebody just goes off radar.
( keys jingling in door )
( clock alarm beeping )
( drops keys on table )
Abby?
( beeping continues )
( unzips jacket )
( beeping continues )
Abby.
( beeping stops )
( train clacking )
KOVAC: Kerry!
Sorry.
The intercom thing is broken.
Did I wake you?
No.
Good.
Want to come in?
Uh... no. I'm on my way to work.
You remember that place where you used to practice medicine?
I told you I needed some time off.
Yeah, and you've had it.
Rumor is you've quit, but I've seen nothing official
so I've scheduled you to work
the 12:00 to 12:00 shift today.
I still have some things to do.
Yeah, and one of them is to decide whether you still want
to be a doctor.
Be in by noon or don't bother coming back.
Hey!
WOMAN: My God!
Oh, my God!
WEAVER: Oh, God, don't move.
Don't move. Call 9-1-1!
Don't move. Hey!
Wait, wait, wait!
Come back here!
You could be seriously injured!
You assho...!
( clattering )
( gasps )
You scared me.
You okay?
When did you get here?
A couple hours ago.
You were still sleeping.
Any news?
How about some breakfast?
Can you eat?
Did the phone ring?
I thought I heard the phone ring.
No.
You could just leave that stuff.
I'll clean it up later.
You want some aspirin?
Will you call me if they call here?
Where you going?
I took a shift.
You're going in?
I've got to keep busy.
Well, let's go do something.
You must be exhausted.
Don't go to work. I can't drop it.
I'll call for you. I'm going to work.
Hey, hey, hey.
They're going to find him.
Thank you for coming back.
If you cancel your cell phone and call your bank,
you should be okay.
Yeah, I got to renew my license,
get a new phone, replace all my credit cards.
Hey, listen up!
If anybody gets a scruffy white male in his 20s
who looks like he got hit by a car, find me.
Where's Pratt?
Paramedic ride-along.
What, did you clip somebody on the way to work, boss?
I wish.
LEWIS: Hey, where were you?
CHEN: Curtain Three.
No, when I needed you.
I called you about a dozen times last night.
Oh, I must have had my phone off.
We had a deal-- if I call you and it rings once
you're supposed to call my cell and bail me out.
Wait, I thought you canceled with that guy.
Well... I did, but he kept calling me,
so I just met him later for drinks.
Oh, you caved.
I know, I'm a sucker.
Was it that bad?
Well, let me put it this way--
I almost had to fake it.
An orgasm?
A seizure.
I called you at 11:00 to commiserate
but you still weren't home.
I spent the night at his place.
Whose place? His.
"Spent the night," spent the night?
GALLANT: Hey, Dr. Lewis.
Do we lavage for a rectal temp of 92?
Is she altered?
Yeah, but she has a history of Alzheimer's.
I want details.
Hi, I'm Dr. Lewis.
She wandered outside for over an hour
before I realized she was gone.
Passive external rewarming.
Put her on heated humidified O2 by mask.
Uh, she's usually more alert.
They upped her medicine.
Aricept.
Aricept.
WEAVER: Okay.
She, uh, probably just has a mild case of hypothermia.
I'll check on her as she warms up.
Thank you.
What are you doing back here?
Visiting.
Respiratory distress.
I think it's pneumonia.
BOY: Do I really have to wear this thing?
I mean, I've just got a cough, right?
Temp's 102.6.
Neutropenic two days ago.
( sighs )
You have no white blood cells
and this place is crawling with germs.
CBC, blood and sputum culture,
chest X ray and half a gram
of imipenem IV.
Did you miss me?
No.
Mmm.
One of my guys found him this morning when he opened up.
He's a bum.
Must have crawled in here last night sometime
after we locked up.
( opening car door )
I can't get a pulse.
Get me the quick-look paddles.
Sorry, Doc.
This is our show. You just watch.
Then why am I here?
To appreciate what we do.
No pulse. No resps.
Ooh...
Looks like lividity.
Is that some sort of disease?
It's pooling blood.
This guy's dead.
Hey.
Where you going?
Back to the bus.
You're supposed to observe us.
This guy is a corpse.
And whatever you two do with corpses, I don't need to see.
I'm going back in the rig where it's warm.
Hey, Doc.
If you pronounce this guy,
we can call the coroner and all get out of here.
I thought this was your show.
That's more of a guideline than a rule.
( sighs )
( knocking on door )
( knocking continues )
Yeah?
( knocking )
( groans )
Yeah.
( clears throat )
Hi, John.
Maggie.
Is Abby home?
Um... no, no.
She went to work.
Work?
WEAVER: What did he take? Crystal meth.
BOY: He was just smoking some glass.
I think I'm having a heart attack.
What do I...? Wait, you can hear it, listen.
Seriously. You better do something
before it bursts out of his chest.
You think this is funny? Yeah,
he never smoked before.
He just started puking and freaked out.
The long-term side effects of crystal meth
include brain damage, paranoia, hallucinations...
Whoa!
Later, Zeki.
Don't let them give you a baboon heart.
( breathlessly ): I didn't even want to do it.
Please don't let me die.
CBC,
tox screen and a UA.
What is...?
What? Your brain.
Let's get him on a cardiac monitor
for a couple of hours until he calms down.
Give him two of Ativan and then call his parents.
No, no, don't call my parents.
My parents will kill me.
No, drugs will kill you, not your parents.
You don't know my parents.
MAN: Need some help here!
WOMAN: Help...!
WOMAN: Jared? Jared, wake-wake up!
Get a gurney.
WOMAN: Help!
Help!
Okay, what happened?
My son.
He got run over.
Get Weaver back here.
I need a backboard and a c-collar.
MAN: You should've called 9-1-1.
WOMAN: They weren't coming.
Okay, put him down slowly.
Try not to move his head or his neck.
Prep a trauma room and page surgery.
What's his name?
Jared.
Jared, can you hear me?
Can you open your eyes?
I got a pulse and shallow resps.
Did you see the car that hit him?
My car. I hit him.
Spiders, snakes, scorpions, any member of the weasel family
rats, any kind of vermin--
these are thing I spray for; these are not pets.
Bunnies, puppies, kittens.
Anything you can cuddle, those are pets.
Which do you have?
Nothing. Breathe.
I'm not kidding.
They banned me from the pet store.
They keep my picture posted by the gerbils.
But you're a doctor.
Please, I'm only good with people.
Breathe.
( inhales )
Although I had sea monkeys once.
Breathe.
And on the package they're really cute.
These little families swimming around
with crowns on their head through the underwater castle. Yeah.
Turns out they're just brine shrimp.
( chuckles )
Everybody knows that.
How old were you when this happened?
Thirty.
You-you...
I'm just kidding. Oh.
I was a teenager, just like you.
Okay, I'll check on you later.
I'll be here.
He's back.
Yeah, I thought I buffed him up good enough last time.
Sure he's just not back for the company?
I think he has a crush on you.
Oh, please.
For starters, I'm old enough to be...
Well, I'm an older woman.
Mmm, here's to you, Mrs. Robinson.
MARQUEZ: Dr. Lewis.
Lab and films are back on your boyfriend.
You guys are sick.
And Mrs. Langston is starting to come around
when you get a chance. Thanks.
You know, younger men have a lot of energy.
Not when they have cancer.
Oh, sorry.
You know, sometimes I forget they're sick.
I know. Me, too.
So... you and Pratt are going
together now?
You think he thinks that?
I don't know what would give him that idea.
Have you guys seen Abby?
Uh, yeah, Trauma Two.
Thought she was working triage.
Bad MVA. Little boy.
Apneic.
WEAVER: 6-0 cuffed tube
and a two mac blade.
I-I thought he was in the house. He must've run out
to say good-bye.
Full trauma panel, type and cross for six.
Oh, my God. I was-I wasn't going fast.
I was just backing up.
I-I was just backing up. The drugs are in.
( sobbing ) He's loose.
Set of crits and a foley.
Sats are down to 91.
Cricoid pressure.
Suction.
No.
She wants to talk to you.
No! Abby.
Now.
I can't.
WEAVER: John.
What's happening?
Your son isn't breathing
on his own.
That was fast.
Well, your white blood count's up to 1,900,
with 80% segs and bands.
Uh, my immune system's back.
Yes, it is.
But I have pneumonia?
Because your metastatic lesions haven't decreased in size.
But I had two more cycles.
They should have responded by now.
Well, at least it's not growing.
Right?
How long?
Four minutes and 30 seconds.
How long do you wait?
Five minutes.
And if he doesn't breathe after that?
That would be a strong indicator of brain death.
Jared, I just got off the phone with Daddy,
and he'll be here really soon, okay?
He'll be here any minute.
No excursions. SATs are okay.
No spontaneous breaths.
No ocular vestibular response.
MALIK: That's five.
That's it?
I'm sorry.
Jared can't breathe without the ventilator.
When you're ready, we can talk about
how long you want him to be on the machines.
No, my husband... Oh...
( sobs )
You have to give my husband a chance to get here.
We'll do everything that we can.
Oh...
He hates it when I leave.
( sniffling )
Stalls me
with hugs and kisses.
He was running out
to give me another hug.
CARTER: You should really just go home. There's nothing
you can do here. I don't want to go home.
I don't want to stay here. I want to talk to Abby.
She's just a little preoccupied right now.
Her brother is missing. There's not a lot that she can do right now.
Look, you have cops coming in and out of here every day.
She must know one of them. We have to go down...
The FAA has got the Coast Guard searching on both sides of the lake.
I called the FAA. I called the Coast Guard.
They won't give me any information over the phone.
They think I'm a terrorist or something.
They keep referring me to the Chicago PD.
Okay, well, if it makes you feel any better, I know the desk sergeant.
I can call him. Yes, yes, John, thank you.
But we have to go down there. We have to push them.
I know she's busy, but we've got to do something.
Okay, let me go talk to her. I want to talk to her.
No, please, Maggie. Just give me one minute.
Look, I can find her myself. No, no...
Please, we'll deal with this.
Just sit right here, and give me a minute.
John, we have to find Eric. I know.
Is everything all right? No.
I thought you were off today. I am.
Hey, if Abby needs to go, she should go.
I was surprised to see her.
Yeah, I just need to find her first.
Trauma Two.
Is Luka here yet?
The Croat?
Does he still work here?
I guess not.
Dr. Weaver? Yeah?
There's a guy in Triage, looks like a possible MVA.
Think he matches your mugger's description.
All right, tell the nurses to keep him busy.
I'll be right there.
LEWIS: Hey, Gallant, bad news.
Pathology lost Mrs. Pinkus' pap smear.
You need to swab her again,
and stand by while they examine it.
What? Just swab her again?
Yeah, that bad, huh?
Possible wrist fracture, multiple abrasions.
He said he fell over a curb.
That's him.
Get security and hard restraints.
How about giving me something for the pain?
My freaking arm's broken.
Where's my purse, creep?
I don't know what you're talking about, lady.
Hey, get back
into bed.
You can't keep me here.
Hey, man! Hey.
Get out of my way.
Is she manic?
She's upset.
She's blond.
So are you.
Look, his plane disappeared yesterday.
She wouldn't decompensate overnight.
I've seen it happen.
Well, then make your own assessment.
Can't you deal with her?
She's not my mother.
Who knows? Maybe she can help...
JANN: What's wrong? This machine is going off.
Bradying down. Are we treating?
Yeah, till her husband gets here.
All right, mig of atropine.
No pulse.
Starting compressions.
Mommy's here, Jared.
Mommy's here.
Oh, sweet boy.
I've got you.
Nothing?
No change at all?
Some cancers are more resistant than others.
Then why would the oncologist put him through that?
Well, he said 20%.
Well, if you would give me
the appropriate IV antibiotics and oxygen
and whatever pain meds
he needs to stay comfortable,
I would like to take him home as soon as possible.
My white count's up, Mom.
I can beat the pneumonia.
Sean...
LEWIS: You need to think about
how aggressively you want to handle this.
There's a good possibility you'd be put on a breathing machine.
Fine. Let's do it.
And then what, hmm?
More pain?
More nausea?
More infections, vomiting?
I can take it.
I know you can.
You have been... so brave
and so strong.
But do you want to spend the rest of your time
on machines in a hospital?
What choice do I have?
MAN: You are not going to take any more.
You're not going to take any more.
I only have nine left.
Nine what? Toes!
You already took the big one.
Relax, I'll look at the...
I'm not going to relax.
I'm not going to relax.
Kelly Graham, full-term, vitals stable,
contractions three minutes apart.
Just get it out.
I want an epidural.
You didn't give her anything?
She said no drugs.
I changed my mind.
I think I need to crash at your place tonight.
What?
I took care of the roach thing.
Just need a few days for it to air out.
Uh, uh, no.
What? You'd make me get a hotel?
I have a thing.
What thing?
A thing.
Oh, more secrets.
No, it's dinner with Susan.
You know, she's been kind of lonely and depressed lately.
Oh, my God...
Oh, she let loose a geyser.
Get him away from me.
You know what? I got this.
You can go.
All right, I guess I'll see you then.
Yeah, I'll see you.
No, what are you doing? Don't send him away.
Who? Dr. Pratt?
I love him.
He thinks pregnant women are sexy.
Oh, ow!
No, no, don't push!
I have no control over this thing.
Mrs. Langston, do you have any chest pain,
any shortness of breath?
Comprend pas.
Can she speak English?
She used to speak it fluently.
Since she was a teenager.
Not anymore?
The Alzheimer's
started affecting her speech a few months ago,
but now she can only speak French.
Her first language?
I never bothered to learn.
I never needed it.
Je voudrais un petit gout de melon.
It means, "I would like a taste of melon."
It's the first full sentence I learned in high school,
and, uh, the only one I remember.
Poule au pot?
Quoi?
Uh, we'll try and find a translator.
Maxed out on atropine.
Try another round of epi?
( popping ) What was that?
I may have broken a rib.
V tach.
Okay, charge to 100.
We're going to have to shock him.
Will he feel that?
You don't have to be in here.
I'm not leaving him.
Okay, clear.
Got a rhythm.
Got a weak pulse.
Is he alive?
He has a pulse.
Better mix up some dopamine.
Are you sure you want us to do this?
Quit asking me that. He's my son.
Abby, I'm flying to Cleveland.
I bought you a ticket if you want to come.
I talked to some police sergeant.
I used John's name, and he said
that all search and rescue operations
for Lake Superior are stationed out of, uh...
out of the, um... Cleveland District Command.
Abby?
( pounds door )
I am not flying to Cleveland, Maggie.
Have you spoken with anyone else?
The FAA Chicago field rep
told me he would call me...
The FAA is not going to tell you anything until after the NTSB...
I don't need them to tell me anything.
What? You don't care?
Eric is dead.
He is missing.
He was trying to kill himself.
No, no, he was not.
He did not.
He was in therapy. He was on his meds.
Really? You sure about that?
Yes, I'm sure about that.
Did you watch him every day, huh?
Did you make sure he was...
He was not suicidal.
I saw him.
Two weeks ago, he came to see me,
and I didn't get it then,
but now I understand what it was.
He was at peace because he had a plan.
No, no, he was doing well. He was on schedule.
Even showed me a picture of the damn plane.
Planes crash, Abby, and people walk away.
He came to say good-bye.
People walk away, Abby!
It was good-bye.
( clears throat )
You're in the wrong place if you got a sore throat.
I, uh, have a specimen.
Good for you.
Put it with the rest.
I was... I was told to wait while you did it.
You see this body here?
I got three more just like it
before you.
Okay. I guess I can, uh,
leave it and come back later.
Like I said, put it with the rest.
( cup dropping )
Sounds like you're going to need another specimen.
Uh, Dr. Upton?
Just leave it.
I'll get someone to clean it up.
Uh, Dr. Upton!
Is that supposed to happen?
No.
Well, don't just stand there.
Unzip it.
HARMS: Someone told him electrical current neutralized snake venom.
( laughs ): Yeah, and kills you.
Hey, again.
Hey.
I'm going to go and restock the rig.
Do you mean steal stuff?
Uh...
So, how's Mom?
What?
You know, the lingerie labor.
Oh.
Big boy-- nine pounds, six ounces.
Ooh, that's a keeper.
And that's the most important thing, isn't it?
That she keeps it.
What?
Oh, you know, you like kids.
You-you like pregnant women.
That's great.
How about you just relax?
I didn't expect you to be a mom, that's all.
I'm not a mom.
I had a baby. That's all.
Hey... I feel for you,
but we all made mistakes when we were young.
Hmm. I wasn't a teenager, Greg.
It was two years ago.
Yo, got to roll.
LOL slip and fall on Dickerson.
Yeah, in a sec.
Jing-Mei?
Listen, you feel guilty about something,
that's your thing.
I don't care either way.
At least I know how you feel.
That's not what I meant.
LEWIS: Hey, Pratt, there's someone
I want you to meet.
Yeah. Not now. In fact, you've met him before.
Come here. You, too.
Listen, I'm riding with 37 today.
We had a...
BOTH: slip and fall.
Not anymore.
You don't look lonely and depressed to me.
What?
Nothing.
MORALES: Holy crap!
You pronounced this guy.
GALLANT: And he scared
the hell out of me
when he came to in the morgue.
His alcohol level was .322.
His blood was practically antifreeze.
Even the two of you should know
you're not dead until you're warm and dead.
Yeah, but he had lividity.
We call that dirt.
MRS. SIMMONS: Excuse me?
Dr. Lewis, could I speak to you for a moment?
Of course.
Uh, this is Dr. Pratt.
He's going to give you a nice, warm bath.
With bubbles?
( laughs )
Later, dude.
Yeah.
With bubbles.
( laughing )
I don't want Sean to suffer anymore.
I know it's grim right now, but he seems
pretty determined.
Can you tell me something different
than all the oncologists?
Every specialist?
Because if you can tell me
that he has a chance...
And it's Sean's decision.
No.
No.
He didn't even want to do the second round of chemo.
But he did it for me.
I made him.
( sniffling )
Do you have any idea what it's like
to watch someone you love suffer like that
just because he loves you?
Mrs. Simmons...
He went through hell to get to the point
where he... and I finally accepted
that he was going to die.
And then he met you.
He likes you...
as a doctor and as a woman.
( sniffles )
And without meaning to or not
you're giving him false hope.
I just want Sean to come home.
( sniffles )
He'll listen to you
if you tell him that's what's best.
Mr. Kroll.
I'm very sorry,
but your son has suffered a severe head injury.
What are you saying?
He shows no sign of any brain activity.
The machines are breathing for him.
And we've been keeping his body alive
until you got here.
JANA: I didn't...
I didn't see him, Michael.
I didn't see him.
Okay.
There must be some kind of hope.
I know that you need to believe that,
but you have to understand your son is gone.
He died.
Multifocal PVC's on lidocaine.
What does that mean?
CARTER: He'll soon fall back into cardiac arrest,
and we might be able to stop that temporarily,
but not indefinitely.
MARTIN: I need to see him again.
Can I see him?
Of course.
I don't know how you work here.
Look, I'm sorry. I didn't mean...
Abby, don't say anything.
I thought I could control him.
I thought I was, and maybe I was blind or stupid,
or refused to see the signs,
or maybe I'm just nuts.
But I'm not ready to bury him.
The last time I saw my son,
he was alive, and that's my reality
until someone proves otherwise.
He is alive.
Will the El take me to Midway?
Mom...
Will the El take me to Midway?
Eastbound track.
I'll call you from Cleveland.
Where's your mom?
Uh, she's out getting stuff from the nurse to take home.
You don't have to put yourself
through this, Sean.
Not for her.
What about me?
The most you'll get will be a couple of months.
It's not a cure.
My mom wants you to talk me
into going home with her, doesn't she?
Hmm?
What would you do?
Uh...
I can't answer that.
I don't want to die.
Then you should fight.
With everything you have.
( sighs )
FRANK: Damn.
KOVAC: What?
Looks like I just lost 50 bucks.
You shouldn't gamble.
Hey, Frank, where's Weaver?
She's at Personnel, looking for new docs.
You, uh... you still work here?
I think so.
Seizing teenager in Triage.
Drug user? Yup. Coming off a meth high.
Just started... tonoclonic activity.
How long?
Maybe two minutes.
Did you give him anything?
I pushed four of Ativan.
Uh, recheck a temp. He's burning up.
Amphetamines can raise body temperature.
The high fever makes you seize.
( beeping )
GALLANT: Oh, man.
It's 107.3.
MARQUEZ: We need to keep him on the monitors.
Grab four liters of irrigation.
We need to get
his temperature down now.
What about ice packs to the axilla?
That won't work.
Then start a cold gastric lavage.
We don't have time.
Give me the saline.
He needs to be wet
to increase the heat transfer.
He's seizing again.
No. He's just shivering.
V fib.
What's that?
It's an unstable heartbeat.
What will that do to him?
His heart isn't pumping enough oxygen through his body,
and in a minute, it'll stop.
And that's when you would shock him?
Mm-hmm.
( stifling sobs )
( stifling sobs )
I love you, baby.
I love you, sweetie, so much.
( phone ringing )
( phone continues ringing )
Hello.
Yeah, this is she.
Uh, was it...
damaged?
( monitor beeping )
Well, then, where's my brother?
Did he leave a-a bag or a note or-or...?
Is it?
Well, do you think...
Do you think you could leave it there
so if he comes...?
No. Okay. They found his plane?
Uh, what's the name of the town?
Thank you.
Intact. Intact?
Yeah. Tied down in a field
outside of-of Sault Saint Marie.
He's alive.
And he cared enough to tie down his plane.
Yeah.
Guess Maggie was right.
God, I'll be right back.
Mom!
Mom!
Mom!
What the hell are you doing, Luka?!
He was cooking his brain.
He needs to be on a monitor!
Ice immersion can cause an arrhythmia or a heart attack!
Not in a young,
healthy patient.
He'll get frostbite.
He won't be out here that long.
Temp's down to 104.
Okay, that's good. Let's put him on a gurney.
I just saved his brain,
heart, kidneys, and liver.
Yeah, well, I guess it's a good thing
you decided to finally come in.
Where is it? I don't see it.
A little further north, like Canada?
No. Michigan, I think.
Oh, wait, here it is-- Sault Saint Marie.
Michigan, yes, you're right, Michigan.
You know, you were right.
About what?
He's okay.
Yes, but you could've just as easily gotten
the other phone call...
and in his mind, it wouldn't have been selfish.
It would have been a whole lot of other things.
He doesn't want to be a burden.
He's not.
Well, we have to make sure he knows
that he's not.
He's canceled his cell phone,
but he still has his e-mail address.
Don't you think we could send him a message?
I think if he wants to get in touch with us, he will.
Abby, I have a little money.
You and I could go up there and look for him,
or I could hire a private investigator.
No.
We don't get to do anything.
We just have to wait.
( sighs )
He's my son. How can I wait?
It's really hard,
but you just have to...
go about your life, and do everyday things.
Go to work, do your laundry, clean the house.
You know, just try to keep your mind off
all the horrible things that might be happening to him,
and... and you do that...
for a week, or a month,
or maybe... a year.
And then someday he'll show up,
and we'll drop everything and go to him.
Or we get the other phone call.
( sighs )
Welcome to the outside of the disease.
Sure looks good for a corpse.
You heard? ( chuckles ): Yeah.
Look, I'm sor... Hey, listen, I wanted to say...
No, go ahead.
No, no, you go.
Well, um, before...
you know, maybe you were right.
Maybe I was a little judgmental.
That's good to know.
Look-- I feel like people are judging me all the time,
and I hate it.
So, if I did that to you, then I'm... sorry.
Especially because I like you and respect you.
I mean, what the hell do I know anyway?
You sure don't know how to apologize.
( laughs ): No, I don't.
( chuckling )
So, what were you going to say?
You want to see a picture of him?
Yeah.
( sighs )
You know, I get these letters from his adoptive parents,
and I look forward to getting them,
but I also don't.
His name's Michael.
( chuckles )
He's black. Half.
( chuckles )
Okay, okay, Asian-African-American.
It's a great combination.
He's beautiful.
Thank you. You almost ready?
Uh, yeah.
Just give me ten minutes. I'll be right there.
Night, Dr. Chen.
You told me you were going out with Lewis tonight.
Uh, yeah.
Jing-Mei, come on.
I'm just taking the paramedics out.
I told Harms and Morales that I'd buy them dinner.
I only see Harms.
Why don't you come with us?
I don't think so, but, uh, have fun.
Ugh!
What's wrong?
Pratt.
What'd he do?
He has a date.
No.
Yeah, with Harms.
The paramedic?
( sighs ): It's my own fault.
You're forgetting the #1 rule of dating:
men are scum.
And women don't know
what the hell they want.
Am I right? I'm right, right?
They all want a commitment till you give it to 'em,
then they want their freedom.
So, naturally, you oblige.
Then, they accuse you of trying to be with somebody else.
I'm telling you, you can't win.
Women can be hard to figure out sometimes.
Sometimes?
Nah, you know who's got it all figured out, I think?
Homosexuals.
No, I'm serious. Just listen to me.
Look, there's two guys living together.
Toilet seat's always up. Channel's always on ESPN.
You can drink beers in bed, leave clothes on the floor.
I'm telling you-- gay cats got it good.
Why are you telling me this?
I have no idea.
I thought you were on vacation.
I thought you quit.
Can you take hives in Four? Bad seaweed wrap. I'm not on.
Just one more patient. I was never on.
What are you doing here? I have no idea.
John, did you call Trauma two?
Yeah, Transpo's moving him now.
Grief counselors are in with the parents.
Did you want to stay and work a swing?
( laughs ): Not a chance.
You already missed half your shift.
I told you I had things to do.
Well, good, you can work a double. Whatever.
Ward's full. You better get started.
I did start. Good.
Hey, the prodigal doctor returns.
Why is there a Sumo wrestler in One?
See? Like you never left.
Takeout should be here any minute now.
Okay.
Hey.
What you reading?
Uh, Mansfield Park.
For like, the 45th time?
No, it's just the third time.
Why read, man, when you got TV?
Ahh...
You know, I don't, uh...
I don't want to wait.
I, I think that we should try again.
You feel like there's something missing here, Kerry?
( chuckles ): Yes... yes.
Okay, well, are you sure you're ready?
I was thinking that it should be...
( sighs )
I was thinking that it should be you this time.
Me?
Kerry, honey, listen.
You know what I do. I'm the roofman.
I can't swing a Halligan
when I'm six months pregnant.
You could take a leave. I mean, you're younger.
You'd have a better chance.
Listen, I know I'm supposed to feel
like I want to carry a baby, but I don't.
Once that baby's inside of you, it's...
I mean, it's incredible.
I mean, it's, it's...
Kerry, I don't want it. It's...
I don't want it.
And I know that makes you feel like I'm not a...
a total woman or something, but... No, it doesn't.
It doesn't... doesn't make me feel that.
( sighs )
Babe, listen to me...
listen.
We're being totally honest here.
I can't.
I'm sorry, but I, I can't.
Not even for me? Come on...
Don't do that.
Come on. That's not fair.
Well, none of this is fair, Sandy.
None of it's fair.
Call the takeout guy.
Should've been here by now.
( sighs )
Hey.
Don't put it out on my account.
I only wanted half.
Nobody smokes half a cigarette.
I do. And I'm trying to quit.
Oh, back to that, are we?
I like routine.
Yeah...
like disappearing on me.
I know. I'm sorry.
It's no problem.
You had bigger concerns.
Yeah, like ruining your vacation.
Who knows? You might've saved me from a shark attack.
Run away, Carter.
Run as fast as you can.
( sighs )
Where's Maggie?
She went home.
Minnesota?
Please.
Well, you want to hide out at my place for a while?
Did you hear what I said about running away?
I block out about half of what you say.
Only half?
Negative half.
I'm sorry.
No. You're right.
I am negative.
It's hard not to be
when you attract misery everywhere you go.
I'm not going to let you do this.
I'm like a magnet for it.
And you shouldn't have to deal with this.
Now you're pissing me off.
Maybe you should just cut your losses.
You know, Eric is alive.
You could take two seconds and rejoice in that.
I did.
I hugged you, and then I ran away to find my crazy mother,
and I never even came back to thank you.
Thank you for traveling all night.
Thank you for working all day just to be with me.
You're welcome.
'Cause, you know, my life is on hold.
It will always and forever be on hold.
You don't want to be on hold.
Then don't put it on hold.
I have no choice. You do.
Right, your life sucks, now and forever.
There's nobody that you can love.
There's nothing you can do about it...
You don't want me to love you.
Can I decide that for myself?!
Fine, decide. What do you want? What do I want?!
I want you to stop being so afraid,
I'm not afraid... I want us to stop being so careful,
I want to marry you!
( helicopter approaching ) What?
I want to marry you!
Oh, you're proposing?
Yeah!
You're crazy!
Well, then I'll fit right in!
