Previously on E.R.:
I've been here for sixteen hours.
I have been ignored and yelled at
and called honey and sweetie and bitch.
And all I've had to eat is gummy bears and diet coke.
I'm not leaving until I get what I came for.
Those are my friends G.
Yeah, well this is my house.
Mine too.
Oh, what you pay rent? C'mon watch out man.
No does that mean I can't have no friends?
MAN: How, how you doin'?
How you doin', how you doin'?
( metal rattling in jar ) How, how you...?
How you doin', how you doin'?
How, how you doin'? How you doin', how you doin'?
WEAVER: Hey! Oh, how you doin'?
Hey, why is there a rule-out MI parked in the elevator lobby?
Because there's no beds.
Well, Two's open.
Two was open.
Lithobid 300 in Five, 50 of Benadryl in Six.
Susan, I know that the system is overwhelmed...
The system? ...but you know, you've got to manage it better.
Kerry, I swear to you, I am about
to lose it so unless you want to take over...
Move all noncriticals off of monitored beds
and into the hallway and treat and street triage.
Have you seen the hallways?
How you doin'?!
Does he have to be here?
Dr. Kovac says he can go
as soon as his banana bag's done.
Then do it outside. Are you serious?
Yes! Yes! Yes!
Room 1847, please. Gallant
is this guy yours?
Yeah, yeah. Mr. Fierson?
Come on. Get out of my way.
Eric Wyczenski. Okay
I'll lean on Mercy
and see if they can accept some of the overflow.
Break some legs if you have to.
Hey, it's Abby. Um, I'm totally swamped here.
I'm not going to be able to make lunch
but, uh, page me and we'll reschedule for dinner.
CARTER: Frank, call security.
You have to let me go.
Your patient? I'm not supposed to be here.
Yeah. What's he doing with the box?
You'll kill me! You'll kill me!
Mr. Barney, we don't want to kill you.
We want to help you.
I take it you called security.
( thumping, grunting )
Probably out ticketing our cars.
Are those the same guys
that plant those orange stickers on our bumpers?
Oh, yeah, they're multitalented.
They're impossible to get off.
Try Goo Gone.
Goo, Goo, Goo, Goo Off from Pep Boys.
Really, that works?
Yeah, it comes right off.
Do you know how to get blood out of white suede?
Try white vinegar and club soda. Really?
Hey, how you doin'?
Groovy. How you doin'?
PRATT ( chuckling ): Damn.
Ay-ay-ay.
Hey, check this out.
Foreign body. Ten inches. Uh-huh.
Extra-large vibrator, still on.
One day, I'm going to show you
my bowling pin X ray.
Little guy, but very flexible.
( chuckles ) Ten out of ten.
My pain is ten out of ten.
Mr. Mullen, today is not a good day.
I know, I got a slipped disc.
I need a pain shot.
But you don't care. I just saw him
bending over the water fountain.
I seen the guy in here 15 times
in the last two months asking for Demerol.
LEWIS: We're doctors, okay?
That's it. We shouldn't have to take down
a needle-throwing psychotic.
We can't be everywhere at all times.
Simple law of physics.
We need you here when we call. Period.
We've been through this over and over again.
Why can't we hire a new company?
Hey, I'm understaffed.
MVA rolling up.
I got turnover up the wazoo. Carter?
Ten bucks an hour is not going to keep
any half decent guys here.
What's open?
You're kidding, right?
Harkins, Gown up. You're with me.
I am in agony here.
Turf this guy to the pain clinic.
Nah, I'm waiting for him to lebs.
Lebs? Leave without being seen. Lebs.
Near-miss auto versus pedestrian.
GCS 14, no LOC.
BP and pulse stable within normal.
I am not leaving! Give me my shot!
Can you tell me your name?
Anonymous.
Hey, Morales, move your patient.
I'm waiting for a bed.
Muevete, amigo.
Right. ( mumbles in Spanish )
Have you been drinking, Anonymous?
I thought he was nice.
He paid me extra.
Then he tried to run me over with his Mercedes.
Oh, God. Did you call the police?
Yeah, I got them on speed dial.
We got swelling to the right
lateral malleolus. We got abrasions
to the left forearm.
Uh, Dr. Carter, I think she's posturing.
No, she's greedy.
Okay, um... can you let go?
I worked hard for that. Hey.
She'll put it in a safe place.
Does this hurt?
( inhales sharply ): Lower, lower.
Right in here?
Yeah.
Bilateral lower quadrant tenderness. What next?
Ask if she sees a gynecologist.
Do you see a gynecologist?
Yeah. Every Sunday after confession.
ABBY: One, two, three.
How did he fall out of bed?
He can barely move.
They'd just gave him a bath or something.
Are you in pain, Mr. Berk?
Forget it. He's gorked out.
What nursing home?
Garden Sunrise in Schaumburg.
Sunset is more like it.
Yeah. I wouldn't send my mom to that dump.
And I hate my mom.
LEWIS: This the hip fracture?
Yeah, hard to get a baseline.
End stage Huntington's.
Luka is screaming for you.
Says he's been waiting for 45 minutes
for a lighted speculum.
Well, I'm an hour and 45 minutes behind.
Great. Piss him off some more.
Protecting his airway. ( man moaning )
That's a clue. What do we know, Gallant?
GALLANT: Huntington's hits you in your 30s and 40s.
Start with emotional lability
and depression.
Leads to a progressive loss
of motor control and cognitive function.
Death in ten to 20 years.
He's been diagnosed for 15.
Let's roll him.
What's he pissed about?
Well, hurt.
About what?
Abby.
Oh, no, he doesn't care.
Ew.
Nasty pressure sore.
10x18 centimeter decubitus.
Have you talked to him about it?
Why?
I don't have to. He's fine.
Ooh. Is that sacrum?
All the way down to the bone.
You know, we got this. At least get him his speculum.
B.P.'s 80. He needs fluids.
Hey, Abby, I need a frog-leg finger splint.
Try central.
Abby? Yeah?
I need a detox bed
for the child prostitute in the hall.
Oh, yeah, they're as jammed as we are.
She's 12 years old.
Cocaine, probably crack.
Okay, I'll see what I can do.
PID?
Tubo-ovarian abscess.
Ooh, lovely.
Hey, how does Original Thai sound?
Tonight, we take your brother out.
I get to hear some embarrassing childhood stories.
He's allergic to MSG.
That's unfortunate.
HARKIN ( grunting ): I really think
we should switch places.
Come on. Keep it coming.
Kovac's pelvic exam?
Curtain Three.
You push enough Valium?
Any more and he'd be unconscious.
Ow...! Damn.
CARTER: We'll let him pick the place.
He doesn't know any places.
First time in Chicago?
Usually, we have to meet up in a strange city
in front of some psychiatric institution.
You said your mom sounded fine.
She is. She does.
She's fine. Okay.
How about Morton's?
He's not a vegetarian, is he?
No. Beef's good.
You started.
Finished.
Didn't know when you'd get here.
Did you say you're done? Yeah.
You can put your legs down, Mrs. Lundgren.
Effie, please.
Lundgren's my husband's name.
Mrs. Lundgren tried to vacuum out her period.
Menstrual extraction.
Very common practice.
Practice for what?
The day when the men who run the world
take away your freedom of choice.
Until then, you could perforate your uterus
end up infertile or bleed to death.
If men needed abortions, there'd be drive-thrus
with beer on tap and TVs tuned to ESPN.
It's still no reason to do this
to your body.
You got to wake up, honey.
We're at war.
Conscientious objector.
( exhales )
CBC
type and screen, Beta and a urine.
Sorry.
Yeah.
So, are you taking any oral contraceptives?
Want to give me a reason to?
These are yours.
Thanks.
That's it?
"Sorry" and "Thanks"?
What do you want from me, Kathy?
Nothing. I don't want anything.
Uh, Icon, too?
What?
Menstrual extraction. You want Icon, too?
Uh, if you want.
You okay?
Yeah.
No, that was just, uh...
You know... Yeah.
But are you okay?
Yeah. Managing 14 patients
a little too much grappa last night.
Other than that...
Other than that.
Hey, I'm-I'm happy for you, Abby.
A golf ball?
The size of a golf ball.
Around your fallopian tube, near your ovary.
What do you do to get rid of it?
Antibiotics might clear it up.
If not, laparoscopic surgery.
It's sexually transmitted.
No, duh. I ain't stupid.
Well, then maybe you can tell me your name.
Your real name.
Tina. Tina Jones.
Well, Tina Jones, I don't know
what got you in here at 12
but if you want to make it to 20
you've got to stop smoking crack.
I can get you into a detox bed today.
Yeah, that'll fix everything.
That'll fix one thing.
Then maybe you can get started on the rest.
Carter?
Lewis want you to ship McPheny to outpatient.
Not now, Malik.
When do I get my money back?
After detox.
You can't do that.
Sleeping with strangers for money.
That's what you want?
I've got to take care of myself.
Well, I'm trying to give you a chance to do that.
You don't know what it...
You don't know.
I know it's not too late.
School, friends...
birthday parties.
The things a girl your age should be doing.
You have a choice. I'm giving it to you.
CHUNY: Carter?
High-speed MVA coming in.
MAN: Excuse me.
Excuse me.
I will be right back.
MAN: Hey, do you...?
Hey, Gallant.
Why is Stella on a monitored bed?
Positive Homans'. She could have DVT.
Sorry, quick question.
Triage, down the hall, to the left.
Go get a venous doppler and then street her.
You are not her personal physician.
Hi, I'm looking for Abby Lockhart.
She's a nurse here.
Are you Eric? Yeah.
Hey. John Carter.
Sorry, things are a little crazy around here today.
Yeah, the guy at the desk told me
that you were closed and to go home.
I was expecting an Air Force uniform.
Oh, well, I'm undercover.
Dr. Carter? Excuse me. Um, what do I do
if pathology refuses to analyze a foreign body?
You get a Polaroid for the medical record.
And how do I get a camera? Look for one.
MULLEN: Do I have to puke on the floor to get
some attention around here?
We have heart attacks, strokes
and bleeding ulcers and they're all ahead of you, okay?
Abby? What?
I have been here for four hours
and you haven't done... Hi.
...a damn thing. My God.
What are you doing here?
I thought you were going to feed me.
I am in pain every single minute
of every day. Don't you
check your messages? Hey!
I am talking to you.
Pratt.
No, not him. He doesn't want to help me.
Dr. Pratt is only concerned
that you're building up a tolerance
to the narcotics.
Yeah, well, that's
why I need more.
Is it like this every day?
Who the hell are you?
Eric.
Well, yes, Eric, I'm in pain every day
and they don't want to do anything to help me.
You know, if I came in here
in a suit and tie
they'd give me my meds in two minutes.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, now get out of here. It's about time.
Wait a minute. Vicodin?
Take it or leave it.
One Vicodin's not going to do it.
Well, that's what you're going to get.
Go play Lakeshore.
Hello?
Oh, yeah, thank you. Thanks very much.
You know, you think you're a bunch of heroes, or something?
You know what, look around!
You are not doing anything!
You're not helping
anyone!
( grunts )
Hey!
Get out of here.
We like excitement.
Did you hear she got a dog?
Yes. "Dumpy."
Is that right?
'Cause he was dumped at the pound.
Yeah, it turns out he's got a vitamin deficiency.
He needs a special diet
so she cooks him bacon and eggs in the morning.
She never made me breakfast in my life
but she'll cook for the dog.
No, no, she cooked for you.
Well, she can cook for the zoo as long as she's happy.
I mean, she's good, even.
I think maybe this time...
Maybe.
Thanks.
I'm sorry I wasn't there the last few times.
It's okay.
No guilt.
It's not our fault, remember?
( door opens )
Hey, Abby, where's the baggie of fingertips?
Uh, in Exam Two.
The cops brought them in before the run got here.
It ain't there.
Chen's freaking out.
Baggie of fingertips?
Yes.
Two neighbors tried to trim their hedge
by hoisting a lawnmower in the air.
Thank you.
Teamwork.
You know what?
I don't think I'm going to be able to get a break
so maybe we should meet at your hotel at 6:00.
Adele Newman for you on two.
Uh, can you take a message?
Or 7:00 actually would be better
and then we can go out to dinner, show you the city.
Well, I can't
'cause I got to get an 8:15 bus to Offut.
Offut? What's Offut?
Offut Air Force Base, my new station.
Abby, I need a transfusion set up in Five.
Okay, in a minute.
Uh, it's a menstrual extraction victim.
I thought you cleared her.
A different one.
Some kind of party.
One hell of a party.
You're getting transferred?
Um, reassigned.
I got to report in the morning.
Again?
Yeah, it's the Air Force.
C-Can you hold this for a second?
GALLANT: Okay, blow out all your air.
( exhales )
Now breathe in.
Oh! Right there, honey.
Yeah, yeah.
Abby, can you order a right upper quadrant ultrasound for me?
Yeah, in a minute. Have you seen a bag of...?
It's in a bucket of ice by the X rays.
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.
Don't ask.
When did this happen?
Last week. Got to read your e-mail.
Well, how come it's so soon?
I'm sorry. That's top secret.
( men arguing ) Okay, I got 'em.
What happened?
Uh, got here before they did.
They're all in one bag?
Guess they didn't sort them at the scene.
Well, we need to sort them now.
Okay, one minute.
Where is this?
Nebraska.
MAN: Hey, hey!
Is she going to get her clothes back?
They're in a bag under the bed.
I heard it's kind of pretty.
It's closer to you, it's closer to Mom.
Abby, LOL in Four has diarrhea.
Oh, good. You said you needed a stool sample.
You could scrape it off the floor.
Mm. Starting to appreciate why you dissed me.
I'm sorry.
You actually like this?
Yeah. It's not that different from air traffic controlling.
Without the menstrual extractions.
MAN: Hey!
Where her shoes at?
Yeah, in a minute.
You go do what you got to do. I'll wait for you.
Okay, I'll be right back.
Hey, Frank, take care of my baby brother.
Is he potty-trained?
CHUNY: Turned him off
his decube, and he bottomed out.
70 systolic.
But he is so pale.
Is it a hematoma?
Are you his nurse?
No, I'm his mother.
16 in the left AC.
He's still got good veins.
Get some O-neg from trauma
type and cross four more.
Phillip...
I'm sorry.
I... it was
the best home that I c...
I could get.
I don't have much, and...
Nothing definite on the ultrasound.
Get me a triple lumen kit.
Pressure's up to 86.
He's-he's in pain. Can't you give him something?
He's had 200 fentanyl.
It could be the cause of his breathing problem.
But he's suffering.
Can't... can't you see how much he's suffering?
Please!
( monitor flatlining )
Morales.
Morales!
Hmm, what?
What are you doing?
( monitor beeping ) Loose connection.
Can I get a bed now?
This would go a lot faster
if these guys identified their own fingers.
What if we made a mistake?
You think this is a pinkie
or a ring?
Looks like a cocktail wienie.
Ah...
I got Morales' TIA in Four.
Oh. Yeah, put her on a 12 lead.
I'll be right there.
Have you guys seen my brother?
What's he look like?
He's about six feet, he has brown hair
looks like me might be my brother.
Mmm, yeah, he's cute.
I think he went to get some coffee.
Oh, yeah. The place was tripping him out.
Yeah, I wonder why.
Pratt, you have three thumbs.
What? Unless one of your patients is a circus freak.
Look, if you think you can do a better job...
Just did.
Then be my guest.
What's this?
Match game.
Pratt's having a little trouble "fingering" it out.
Oh...
Come on. That's funny.
So you got my detox bed?
Uh, shoot.
I have to call Adele back. I'm sorry.
You didn't admit her?
No. They're clearing a space.
Then where is she?
Who?
Frank, did somebody move
the navicular fracture in Two?
I think she eloped.
Why didn't you come and get me?
She didn't say anything.
She just took off with some guy.
( clicks tongue )
He asked me for her clothes.
What?
He asked me for her clothes.
I didn't know who she was. I'm sorry.
I asked you to get her a bed.
I was trying to get her a bed.
FRANK: You think he was her pimp or something?
Her pimp, her dealer, her boyfriend.
Damn it. I had her talked into it.
Well, who let the guy back there?
The hell if I know. Dr. Carter.
The whole world can waltz right through here.
Dr. Carter!
What?
No, no, no, no, no. Nobody move.
GALLANT: All right, it's cool. Nobody move.
It's cool.
It is not. It's not cool.
I am in pain.
I need Demerol, and you're going to give it to me.
Yes, I am. I am going to... Abby?
Go to Drug Lock-Up, get a case of Demerol...
I don't need a case.
I just n... I just need my shot.
150 milligrams.
GALLANT: Okay. 150 milligrams then.
See? There's no problem. It's all right.
Look, no problem.
No, we got a problem!
This here's supposed to be a county hospital.
( whispering ): Call the police.
What? Call the police.
You're supposed to care about people, but you don't!
You don't care!
I care now.
( chuckles )
Yeah. That's right. You do.
What's taking so long in there?
I'm coming.
You care 'cause I'm making you care
'cause I got this gun.
Because I'm the one
who gets to decide.
You don't have to decide...
No, I get to decide who's going to feel pain
and who's not going to feel pain.
Just like you.
Every day.
Show it to me.
Show me it.
Show me the label.
Abby.
Stay right there, Eric.
Okay, come on. Come on. Come on.
Hurry up. Hurry up.
We're going to help you, give you the shot.
Why don't you put the gun down?
I'll hold onto it if it's just the same with you.
Okay, where do you want it?
Why'd you want to be a doctor?
Excuse me?
A doctor.
Was it the money?
That's part of it.
And what's the other part?
It's complicated.
Well, explain it to me.
I mean, you can't tell me that you actually wanted
to help people.
Or maybe you did, right?
Maybe...
maybe you all wanted to help people
but then little by little
you realized that there's
just too many people to help.
( moans softly )
Who's going to survive?
Thank you.
Hey, remember this...
...for next time.
( panting )
How much did you give him?
400.
That'll do it.
( sirens blaring )
Is he breathing?
What do you care?
I don't, but why don't you get some narcaine
off the rig.
WEAVER: We'll need to monitor his breathing.
Pratt, get a gurney. Four-point restraint.
Put him on a pulse ox and call psych.
You should go inside and lie down.
I'm fine.
You should go lie down.
I don't need to lie down.
Where you going?
Hey, whatever happened to those metal detectors?
Not now, John. Where's Chen?
We were supposed to have those a year ago.
It's all part of the security plan.
What security plan?
So you like it here then?
Yeah.
Keeps the days from blurring together, you know.
What are you doing, Abby?
You came on the wrong day.
From what I can tell you're smarter than
most of the people here-- smart enough
to know you shouldn't be working here.
Well, that career advice is just a little bit late
but thank you.
You don't find it even a little self-destructive?
No, no.
And, honest, I think I'm happier than I've been in a long time.
Besides the gun in my face, you know.
What happened to med school?
Uh...
I have to go back to work.
I'm sorry, but, um, uh...
call me and give me your numbers.
I got three more hours.
I know, but I'm already juggling
like, ten patients and there's more stacking up
and I know I'm not going to have
any time, so call me and have a great trip.
Okay?
WEAVER: John, read the newspapers.
County healthcare expenditures are down
over 30%...
I don't have to read the newspapers. I'm here.
And security is not a place to save money.
Yeah, we're wasting it on patient care.
Oh, come on, Kerry
you know these aren't the same budget cutbacks.
We were supposed to have the metal detectors two years ago.
It's not just the metal detectors.
Well, I think it's a start.
If you put them up, you've got to man them.
Oh, that's a crazy idea.
I'll talk to the medical executive committee.
PRATT: Hey, where do you want him?
Take him straight to the unit.
Now. We need it now.
We need a secured triage area
we need more guards, we need better guards.
You just work on clearing the board...
I cannot clear that board!
I am treating a 12-year-old girl on the street, cracked up
PID, tubo-ovarian abscess, run over by a car
and I've got two minutes to spend with her because...
Yeah, and we're getting even more buried
while we stand here arguing about it.
...I somehow managed
to talk her into to detox.
Before I can get her a bed
we let her dealer pimp boyfriend
walk in here and waltz her right back out.
John, I am just as frustrated about this...
Then do something about it!
I am!
Just treat your patients.
Wow, way to go, boss.
Frank, where's the yellow pages?
Bottom shelf.
Hey, in the future
can we try not to agitate the drug seekers?
It's not my fault they got a gun in here.
I never said it was.
What are you doing?
I'm ordering metal detectors.
Now you're talking.
Let's get some cattle prods while you're at it.
Shut up, Frank.
So he went home, got the gun
and came all the way back.
He probably went to the corner and bought it.
CHUNY: Dr. Lewis.
God, sometimes I hate this place.
Sometimes?
CHUNY: Pulse ox 90.
He vomited twice before I could turn him.
There's little use for the PEG now.
He can't breath.
Get an RT and set up for a vent.
Okay, he's full of junk.
Aspirated and decreased on the right.
Not again.
His cords are scarred from last year.
He was on the vent two months.
Meds are in. Okay.
Be ready to roll him.
The etomidate might make him vomit.
Once you put the tube in, that's it, right?
That's not coming out.
No, that's... yeah, we want the bulletproof.
What's he doing?
Contracting out our new triage area.
Are we finally getting that?
Yeah, yeah, and I've got
the phony purchase orders to prove it.
Gallant, what did I just tell you about Stella?
What? She has a positive Murphy sign.
That's because you keep feeding her cafeteria food.
Dr. Carter, I still need to rule out cholelithiasis.
Yes.
Do it. Get her out of here.
Street her before she presents with something else.
She's going to suck him dry, isn't she?
Yes, she is.
No, no, sooner than that.
As soon as you can.
Why don't you just come out and take a look at the space?
What are you doing?
I'm trying to make us all safer.
You ordered six metal detectors retail?
Yeah, they should be here in about a half an hour.
No.
We have a procurement department
that handles all capital expenditures.
You canceled it.
Yes, I canceled it.
This is not your job
and believe me, you don't want it.
We had another 15% budget reduction again this year.
I am just trying to keep the doors open.
Well, close them
'cause it's not worth it.
You shouldn't have to risk your life to work here.
Of course not, but you have to be responsible about it.
You have to get competitive bids.
No, Kerry, you know what's irresponsible
is letting this go on as long as we have.
And I have been in staff meetings
14 hours a month
for the past two years working on this.
Where you going?
To the ambulance bay to wait for my metal detectors.
When he calms down have him see me.
Abby?
( phone ringing )
Answer the phone, Frank.
You know, we have patients to care for.
He's right, Kerry.
Do you have a plan?
No.
Plain or peanut?
Huh?
M&Ms.
Oh...
No?
Gum? Cheetos?
How 'bout some nylons?
What?
Well, I hear they sell panties in vending machines in Japan.
Save your quarters.
You sure?
You know, chocolate is the universal comfort food.
Listen, I'm sorry about what happened.
But the guy was a known drug hound
and I wasn't going to play his game.
But you got to understand
I would never do anything to jeopardize you.
Carter, maybe, but not you.
Not my future lover.
( chuckles )
Hey, look, look, look, I'm sorry, okay?
Look, sometimes I get a little punchy when I get nervous.
Hey, I was scared, too.
Oh, oh, you were scared?
You know, I'm the one who almost had a cap busted in my head.
( chuckles )
Oh, oh, and that's funny, too.
Cap busted in your head?
Come here, come here.
No. What are you doing? Pratt?
I'm consoling you.
Well, don't.
All right?
( sniffling )
You finished?
Yeah.
Plain.
I want plain M&Ms.
Voila.
Did you hear a fire alarm?
Oh, not another evacuation.
Now what?
I have no idea.
Well, you got everybody out here.
You should say something.
Why are you talking to me like we're planning a prison break?
In case this thing gets ugly.
You don't know me? That's right.
Hey, what's going on?
Talk to Norma Rae.
We're not working
until the install some metal detectors
and get some additional security.
Really?
Oh, cool.
My shift's over in an hour anyway.
Uh-oh, looks like a showdown.
Listen up!
Unless you are on a scheduled break
you are in violation of your hospital contract
and are all in danger of being summarily fired.
Part of our contract guarantees
that the hospital provides us
with a safe working environment.
Look, today's incident was, uh, eh... horrific
but we are already taking steps
to ensure that it doesn't happen again.
You always say that, but nothing ever happens.
I don't always say that.
We've heard it before.
And this is how you choose to solve the problem?
Hey, what's going on?
We got a 62-year-old man
hypotension, low back pain.
BP's 80 palp.
You better do something about this today.
Yeah, and everyone here needs to get back in there
while they still have a job.
Don't even think about
touching that patient, Gallant.
Get him in there, Gallant.
Gallant, you are a student.
You don't have a contract, you just fail.
All right, let's go.
Could be a ruptured aneurysm.
Hi.
It'll be another couple hours
before I can get him up to the OR.
But his stats have leveled off
and we're giving him as much pain medication
as his blood pressure can tolerate.
Do you know what it's like to watch someone die for 25 years?
That's what I did with his father.
Every day.
I can refer you to another nursing home.
I don't know what you're planning now...
He was a singer.
Did you know?
When he sang, it was the most beautiful sound in the world.
And I...
I prayed it would pass him over.
When he got to be 29, I thought
my God, maybe we got lucky.
Then he started having trouble at work.
He'd forget things...
and when he'd talk
sometimes it was hard to understand.
And of course...
of course, he couldn't sing... anymore.
It just takes everything away.
You... everything.
Can I have a piece of paper?
What for?
I'm going to start work on my resume.
You'll be fine.
I know.
Usually they just decapitate the leaders
of the insurrection
and send the peasants back to work tending the fields
but thank you.
What took you so long?
Abby, I need a repeat blood gas on my Huntington's patient.
We're staging a walkout.
Yeah, I get that.
I need a PH. He's throwing PVC's.
In fact, I have ten other patients
on monitored beds who no one is watching.
So maybe somebody will pay attention.
So you quit, go outside and pout?
Too many patients.
No room.
Overwhelmed staff, and it's dangerous.
This keeps up, we're not going to able to treat anybody.
News flash: The healthcare system sucks.
Our job is to treat people in spite of it.
Well, I can't. Not anymore.
And I don't expect you or anybody else here not to.
But I can't do it.
So, too bad to the ten-year-old with status
asthmaticus arrests?
We've had one staff member murdered on duty...
Or the mother of three with pyelo...
I'm trying to save the people that roll in here tomorrow!
I know, Carter, you're an emergency room doctor.
It's about getting through the shift.
Do you even know how many guns and knives
pass through here in a year?
( sighs )
LEWIS: No, I don't.
But I do know how many people are depending on us
at this very moment.
I got stabbed.
Lucy got killed.
And today, Abby and Chen get a gun to their head.
I'm sorry. No.
( sighs ) It's got to stop.
Otherwise, it's not worth doing.
Fine. You know what?
You fix tomorrow.
I have to go
treat the patients that need us today.
( sighs )
He coded?
You think they closed the paramedic runs?
I can't tell.
Think that they replaced us all?
I can't tell.
Think it's going to rain?
Look-- a new recruit.
Shouldn't she be waving a white flag?
Dr. Carter, let's, uh, take a walk.
The metal detectors will be here either tonight
or tomorrow morning.
And we've accelerated our negotiation
with the new security firm.
What about triage?
Construction starts as soon as we can approve the bids.
Thank you.
No. No, you don't get to thank me.
You get to go back inside and clear off that board.
You were already four hours behind.
Fair enough.
And it will be hard
to avoid a disciplinary committee hearing.
It's nothing personal, Kerry.
Yeah, well, uh, speaking of that
I had hoped to control some of these costs
but now that we're paying more for immediacy
you'll have to offset that
by either laying off three senior nurses
and hiring new grads, or canceling X-ray
and lab service after 10:00 p.m.
Whatever you think.
No. You forced us to do it this way.
You get to decide.
Well, you can't run a trauma
in the middle of the night
and have to go to the lab.
That's true.
Nurses then.
Three.
I want their names on my desk
first thing in the morning.
( applause )
Congratulations.
Thank you.
Very nice, very nice.
( chuckles )
( sighs )
What are you doing?
I know you're not going back inside.
Oh, I got patients.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Shouldn't you be getting
like, some very serious therapy right now?
What, and ruin all this hard-won repression and denial?
So, you're serious, huh?
Go home, Pratt.
Are you sure you're good?
You know, it's not your fault.
Go home. All right.
Okay. You okay?
Oh, people have to stop asking me that.
Okay. Yo, I am Spartacus.
Come here.
That proletarian revolt you staged
left us a little short-handed down here.
( laughs )
Oh, did you think that was clever?
Yeah. It wasn't a joke.
Sorry.
I told Weaver to fire you
but, uh, you can't trust a lesbian to do a man's job
so instead, I ended baby-sitting three gorks
and a dirtball with the DT's.
Last time I did ER scut work
I had ponytail and a lava lamp.
I do not enjoy revisiting those days.
Am I clear, Dr. Carter?
Yeah.
Dr. Romano, uh, the TAB is "A" negative.
Should we give her RhoGAM?
Huh. Well, apparently
some of the med students take their oaths a little
more seriously than the doctors.
No. She gave this speech about
what it means to be a doctor.
Well, that you need to figure out all by yourself.
I'm looking for a doctor.
Why don't you try sitting in chairs?
Right over there.
We'll be with you as soon as we can.
Is it true construction is starting in a week?
I don't know.
You know what they say about construction.
Nice work, Dr. Carter.
Oh, let's hope you feel that way tomorrow.
What do you mean?
You should go home.
And lie down? And lie down.
Yeah. Yeah.
Dr. Carter, I need you
to sign a Prevacid script for Exam One.
Stella?
Yeah, well, she still has a esophageal reflux.
She's still here?
I was outside with you.
Which I appreciate.
( clears throat )
Hmm.
I'm looking for a doctor. Oh, right here.
We're very busy, sir.
You need to take a seat
and someone will see you as soon as they can.
I need to see him.
I know he works here.
Did he treat you for something or... ?
I don't know how to get home.
Security! I lost my way.
You can't be here, and I can't help you
unless you tell me who you're looking for.
Tell me where he is.
We need you to leave.
Hold on. I took the wrong train.
I didn't know which way to go.
Where do you live? G. Get G.
He's my brother.
Who? Who is G?
G! Greg!
What does Greg stand for?
( crying ): Greg Pratt.
Somebody get Greg Pratt for me, please.
( crying )
* Won't you take me to... Funky Town? *
New career?
I've been on hold for 15 minutes.
Hold that. Trubull's had his ReoPro.
Let's move him to the cath lab.
Uh-huh, mm-hmm.
Shelby's chest is negative.
Let's treat him with ibuprofen.
Yeah, I'm still waiting on the dig level on Six.
What's his name? Uh, Cardova.
Yeah, find him, get it, and then find me.
Okay, great. Can you find my stethoscope?
I left it in the ambulance bay somewhere.
Wasn't your shift over, like, four and half hours ago?
Five and a half.
How long are you staying?
Till we clear the board.
So, you decided to die here, huh?
Uh, excuse me. Deb, I sent you home.
You know, I was in the middle of six criticals
when that psycho came back.
So, go home now.
No. I-I've got about a dozen charts to finish.
Oh, forget the charts.
I just got stood up.
Let's go hit a club.
What? Hot date?
Hot, but clearly not datable.
Orbital's playing at the Shadow Room.
You know, what the hell?
I lost a patient; I almost got killed by another.
I'm in.
You, too, Abby.
Girl's night out?
No, I think I'm going to go home.
Yeah, if I'm going
you're going.
You're asking him?
Okay. No, uh, late night
confessions.
No male strippers.
Okay, you got it.
Give me ten minutes.
What?
What?
FRANK: Dr. Lewis
Dr. Tsung on three.
Who?
Primary on your Huntington's.
Dr. Tsung, this is Dr. Lewis.
I saw your patient, Phillip Berk.
Right.
He came in this morning
with aspiration, pneumonia, and cellulitis.
We intubated him and gave him antibiotics
but he got septic and died about an hour ago.
Have you seen him in the last month?
Yeah. Would you mind signing the death certificate?
Yes. Yes, thank you.
Thank you. I'll send it right over.
No coroner?
We can release the body to the mortuary.
Are you older or younger?
Older.
His mama took me in when I was nine.
Oh.
Was she nice?
Not really.
So, what happened to your family?
Don't know, don't care.
G's my family.
What happened to you?
I went by the hospital.
What, you got lost again?
I remembered where the hospital was.
Come on.
Come on.
Look, I tried to call you.
Nobody answered
so I got Shannon down in personnel
to get me your address.
That place sucks, G.
Yeah, thanks.
I knew I threw my back out as soon as I fell.
MAN: How you doin'?
My chiropractor--
she says I have mild scoliosis.
Everybody's got mild scoliosis.
That's just something chiropractors say.
You can't give me anything?
No. I think you'll be fine.
Oh, Donahue is
guaiac negative.
Schwartz's repeat accu-check is 87
and the urine Icon is positive for Mr. Ramirez.
Can I go home now?
Find my, um... ? Yes.
LOL with altered mental status
and lower abdominal pain.
LOL?
Little old lady.
How you doin'?
All right, down to one board.
Dr. Carter, thought you might want
to sign for these.
Four entrances, six metal detectors. Rush.
How you doin'? How you doin'?
Yeah, that's right.
How you doin'? How you doin'?
You want to show me where you want them?
Right this way.
* Oh...
How you doin'?
Don't make many night deliveries.
We got to pull the old ones out?
No. These are the first.
Hey, how you doin'?
I'm good.
( dance music plays )
That is the last time I ask a guy out.
Oh, you asked him out?
Yes, and he stands me up.
Who was he?
Oh, he's in...
venture... ca-capitalist... m.
Or private equity.
Something or other. I don't know.
One of those undefinable money jobs.
See, then, right now
you'd probably be sitting in his apartment listening to...
Thelonious Monk... or...
something.
You're right.
But women who date those kind of men
don't get vomited on
on a regular basis.
Or get a gun to the head.
Another one?
Yes, thank you.
No, thanks.
Where is she anyway?
I think she went to the bathroom.
You think she'll be okay?
Yeah, I think she's going to be fine.
