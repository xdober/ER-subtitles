Previously on ER:
This is Dr. McNulty, formerly of Curtain Two.
He needs a head CT, CBC, chem seven, urinalysis.
When's the last time you had a tetanus shot?
1949.
You have a license for this?
Why'd you get beat up?
I didn't have the gun when they asked for it.
We got to get it back, G. They want it.
I can't find the heartbeat.
Here, let me try.
It's not there.
I'm sorry.
PRATT: He's a hard worker, he's strong
he's got a great attitude.
How's he going to work with a bad hand?
It don't hurt.
Cast will be off in three weeks.
Cool, G.
You said six before.
I've seen you around, right?
You, uh, work upstairs?
Yeah, I'm an ER resident.
All part of the County family.
I hate doctors.
You all think you're the queen of the damn Rose Parade.
I'm not a doctor.
Not the sharpest nail in the box.
Just give him a chance. You'll see.
Okay, kid, let's talk.
Alone.
All right, look. Listen, listen.
I got to get back down to the ER.
Now you make sure that you tell him
that you work real hard, okay?
Okay, G.
I'll see you at home.
Right. All right.
I work real hard.
I don't want to be here.
Sand truck rolled on I-40.
Three DOAs at the scene.
Jessie Callahan, 35-year-old restrained passenger.
High speed T-bone, BP 122/78.
Pulse 93, bloody scalp lac, she got a liter.
Okay, Trauma One.
Where's Tom?
Jessie, can you tell me where it hurts you?
I left Tom, I left him all alone.
Her husband's still in the car.
Fire department's cutting him out.
Paramedics are working on your husband, Jessie.
You got to let us help you though, okay?
So just Neosporin on the abrasion or what?
Yeah, and tell him to stop for a while
or he's literally going to jerk it off.
JERRY: Dr. Lewis.
Paramedics pulling in with a fall.
Okay. Oh, Jerry, could you call those morons in engineering
and tell them to get down here?
We're okay. Nobody panic, nobody panic.
And call psych.
The sun goes down, the nuts come out.
Are we ready for him?
Who?
The alderman.
( shouting )
Back up, you can't come in here.
Keep them back.
John Bright, 55, eight foot fall of a stage.
It was a dais.
BP 124/82, pulse 79.
No LOC, complains of neck, hip and right knee pain.
Alderman, it's an honor to have you here.
I'm Dr. Kerry Weaver.
Are you taking any medications, sir?
No and call me John.
Gently, people.
CBC, chem panel, type and hold UA.
Chest is clear.
Chest, chest is clear.
All right, pupils four millimeters and reactive.
Who are you on the phone with?
Uh, the office.
She's my assistant.
Jennifer, try to breathe.
You need to shut that cell phone
off when you're in here.
You're welcome to use
our phones if you'd like.
Just dial nine.
You don't have to answer that, sir.
No, I haven't.
I'm on the program.
Just got my two year chip.
Okay, then.
Open wide and stick out your tongue.
Okay, don't worry, sir.
You're in the finest hospital in Chicago.
Okay.
CARTER: The emergency power will kick on in a second.
Let there be light.
Shooting.
Thank God something's working.
Get that into exam two, move it.
Jessie, we're going to take a scan of your belly
to make sure you're not bleeding internally.
Is Tom here yet?
We'll find out for you.
Come on, get the lead out.
We got a VIP customer waiting.
Leon, come on, what are you doing?
I work here.
Me, too, G. I got the job.
Okay, good. It's cool, man.
Hey, hey, this is Dr. Weaver in the ER.
Get, get your fat union asses
down here and fix the power.
I got the job.
We're going to be working together, man.
Pratt.
Hey, kiss your friend good-bye
and get back to work.
Hello?
Damn it. Hello?
LEON: It's all going to work out
just the way it's supposed to.
Okay, I get the overtime...
Hey, Leon, how's it going?
I got a job.
Glad to hear it.
She's stable, but I want you to check
another hemocue before you send her to CT.
She may need some blood.
Okay.
You ain't got nothing, man.
You got nothing to worry about.
After I get off, we'll go to Mario's
we'll get some pizza and we'll celebrate.
No, G, I'm working tonight.
On the late shift. Tonight?
I even get my own uniform. Isn't that cool?
And you know where to pick it up from?
Yo, I got the address and everything.
They wrote it down.
I could find it by myself.
All right, good. Congratulations.
Quit worrying, man.
We're going to be working together, man.
We'll be working together.
Shh. Shh.
All right, G. I'll see you later, man.
JENNIFER: Work on a press release
and fax it over.
Somebody get me a fax number.
All right, engineering is coming down now to work on the power.
How are you feeling, Alderman?
Pampered.
I'm sure you have other patients.
This ER sees about 90,000 a year, doesn't it?
Mm, that's why I'm tired all the time.
More like 110,000.
It's a damn miracle what you people do.
We have a great team but we could do more
if we had better resources.
No medial or lateral instability.
You probably tore a ligament when you fell.
There goes my dream of being an Olympic gymnast.
I'll page Dr. Hullverson.
He's our top orthopedist. Excellent.
Give the alderman
six of morphine.
We should see a tox screen first.
What?
Who are you?
Was it cocaine, Alderman?
Oh, my God. What?
Ray MacGee, Chicago Times... Get out.
I have a right to be here.
Leave this man alone.
This is a hospital.
Have you ever heard of the First Amendment?
Have you ever heard of an awake colonoscopy?
Wherever you stole that scrub top from, I want it back.
Jerry, can you try and keep out the fake nurses?
So many rules to remember.
Fake nurses?
Uh, don't ask.
Don't we have enough trouble with the real ones?
Ah, looks busy.
Lucky you.
Yeah, I hate nights.
MVA coming in, two minutes.
Is that from the I-40 pile up?
Yeah, it's that lady's husband.
I'm off. Can you make sure somebody finds her if it is?
Sure. Good.
Ooh, hot date?
No, I got to give a check
at this symphony fund raiser thing.
Lifestyles of the rich and famous, baby.
Hey, look what the patient fairy brought you.
( chuckling ): No.
Mrs. Hawkes, 44, fever, cough times three days.
I'm juggling ten patients already.
I'm just waiting for a chest film.
If it comes back clear, just write a little scrip
send her home, easy dispo.
Okay, good, it's probably just the flu.
Give it to Pratt. He'll hate it.
Done.
Ten minutes.
Oh, you two have fun.
So you're sure you want to go?
Definitely.
Free canapés.
What is a canapé, anyway?
Don't worry, I'll use the right fork.
Next time, we'll do something fun.
Next time, we'll do something that you want to do.
Oh, you mean, like, miniature golf or bowling?
Things my people enjoy doing?
It's too bad Cats closed.
I'll just shut up now.
( whistling )
That's sexual harassment, isn't it?
You bet.
I'm going to circulate a petition.
Excuse me. Dr. Carter, right?
I'm Sarah Wilson.
I work with Dr. Mac.
Um, you called the clinic, said he needed to come back.
Oh, yeah, he left before his chem panel came back.
Oh, he's dizzy, he's dehydrated
and I'm worried about his diabetes.
Yeah, well, he really needs to come in.
Well, there are always patients at the clinic.
He won't leave them.
Uh-huh, and there's nobody to cover for him?
Well, he's a one-man show.
10:00 to 10:00, seven days a week.
Another one from the pileup.
Pulse 110, 20-minute extrication.
Take a deep breath, Mr. Callahan.
My wife, Jessie...
Yeah, Mr. Callahan, she's here, she's stable
and we'll make sure that somebody knows
that you're looking for her.
I need you to come down to the clinic and talk to him.
What makes you think he's going to listen to me?
Well, he likes you.
Sure had a good way of hiding it.
He's going to kill himself.
He won't listen to me.
Stop by, please.
Carter! Just for a minute.
They're calling for anesthesiology
back up in Scanner Two.
That's Pratt's patient.
Jessie Callahan. She crashed on the CT table.
Will you come?
Uh, if you leave the address at the desk, I'll try.
She might not even make it down.
Prep the rapid infuser in Trauma One.
Pneumonia. Her right lobe's complete socked in.
So much for an easy dispo.
Did you run labs?
White count was 27,000 with a left shift.
Gram negative rods in the sputum.
Call ICU.
It's got to be klebsiella or pseudomonis, right?
Yeah. Not good.
Sats are only 85 on two liters.
Okay, crank her up to five liters nasal cannula
and get a gram of cefotaxime IV
and 500 of biaxin.
( coughing )
This is Dr. Lewis.
I've never had flu this bad.
She's coughing a lot.
Do you guys have any cough medicine?
We're giving her all the medicine we can right now.
I need to talk to your mom for a minute, okay?
Hey, you guys want a soda?
Go on.
Is our mom really sick?
Well, she has pneumonia.
It's a serious disease
but we're doing everything that we can.
We should call...
No, Mom would freak.
Call who?
Doug. He's our brother.
Does he live with you?
No, he's 20.
He has, like, 50 earrings.
I just need some sleep.
You know, Marten never should have called 911.
Well, I'm glad he did.
This type of pneumonia's very dangerous.
My kids have homework, they need dinner...
Mrs. Hawkes, you're too sick to leave the hospital.
Write me a prescription.
I'll get it filled on the way home.
If we take you off the medicine, you will probably die.
Is there anyone we can call?
A relative to be here with you?
Someone to watch your kids?
My husband died last year.
My Aunt Sarah.
She lives in Detroit.
But what about your son, Doug?
No, I don't want him here.
I don't want him near my kids.
Is there anyone else nearby we can call?
No.
I'll call Sarah. She'll come.
CHUNY: Pratt!
Carter needs you now.
Your MVA, she crashed in CT.
CARTER: Charge to 360.
All right, clear.
Still in V-fib.
Another milligram of epi.
Let's charge again to 360.
What happened? Shut up and bag.
What was the second hemocue?
Did you check it?
Yes, I did.
Coarse v-fib.
All right, and clear.
Let's go.
Sats dropping to 91.
Push the lido.
Ten blade, say it.
Ten blade.
Can you find my wife?
We will, Mr. Callahan.
Right down to the rib.
Curved peon clamp next.
Pressure's falling down to 80.
Okay, elbow up.
Push harder.
Lean with your hip.
Okay, tension pneumo.
Line's in, let's hook up two units of O-neg.
Okay, pressure's coming up.
Nice work.
Malik, hook up the thoraseal.
O silk on a driver and Vaseline gauze.
What do you have?
Tension pneumo with intraperitoneal blood.
Oh, yeah, ex-lap. Don't even bother to scan him.
Come on upstairs, sir, where the good drugs are.
Mr. Callahan, you're bleeding in your belly.
You need an operation.
Is that Jessie?
Yes, the other doctor
is taking care of her
but we need to take you up to surgery.
I just want to see her.
I need to know she's all right.
One minute, okay?
PRATT: No pulse, no pressure.
She should never have left the department.
She's got a huge retroperitoneal bleed.
Carter? Not now, Luka.
Mag and bicarb are in.
Round four. Jessie!
Can you close that door?
V-fib. Shock again?
Yeah, charge 360 stacked.
Charged.
All right, everybody, clear.
Looks like sinus.
No pulse. It's PEA.
How long?
Ten minutes.
She's brain dead.
Her heart's barely beating.
He wants to see her before we take him up to the OR.
Should I bring him in?
Yeah.
I'll tell him.
Thanks.
All right, everybody, see you tomorrow.
( sighing )
Hey, Jerry, can you call housekeeping?
Pizza kid with braces puked again in Three.
Sure. Nacho?
Oh, thanks.
Cheesy.
Jerry, where's our alderman?
Um, I think he's still up in X-ray.
Damn it. I asked them to put a rush on it.
Get them on the phone.
Mmm, Kerry, we need to discuss our alderman.
Did you know that he's the one
who wrote the bill to finance the spousal abuse shelter?
He's one of the good guys.
Mmm, not too good.
When we were checking for pelvic fractures
I found a sore on his penis.
I think it's syphilis.
Did you swab it?
Yeah, we're waiting on labs.
Dr. Weaver? Uh, they just finished with the alderman.
They're bringing him down now.
Thanks, Jerry.
How should I handle it if it's positive?
You won't have to.
I will.
( weakly ): Her heart's still beating?
Her pupils are dilated.
That means her brain was deprived of oxygen for too long.
Maybe she'll wake up.
No, she won't.
Mr. Callahan... your bleeding is getting worse.
We have to take you up to the O.R.
We wanted a family.
We couldn't.
I couldn't.
She didn't like talking about donors or anything.
She's gone.
You're putting yourself in danger.
I can't just leave her here to die alone.
( knocking )
Okay, cowboy, I got a vascular surgeon, an anesthesiologist
and three surgical residents waiting upstairs
in an O.R. suite that rents for five grand an hour.
He wants to stay with his wife.
Well, isn't that touching. She's dying.
Well, if she doesn't die faster he's going to be dying with her.
I've explained all that. I'm going upstairs.
If he's not up there in ten minutes
I'm going to take out your spleen.
BRIGHT: We're the richest country in the world
and we can't provide
basic health services for our citizens.
Yeah, it's not just emergency care.
Prenatal screening, drug and alcohol treatment.
We do what we can with limited resources.
Everybody at City Hall should come down here
and see what the hell kind of war you fight every day.
Well, you've been fighting some pretty big wars yourself.
Don't tell me we can't find a private room for the alderman.
Nice to see you again, sir. Robert Romano.
Heard you were down here.
Want to make sure you're getting all the care you need.
We're just waiting on a few tests.
I don't want a private room.
Lets me experience the kind of service
my constituents get when they come in.
Of course. And you're in good hands with Dr. Weaver.
But if you need anything- anything at all--
hope you'll give me a call.
( sotto voce ): Find him a room.
I was on the committee that hired that man.
Well, he's an excellent surgeon.
Tragic about his arm.
Lots of people downtown wish it had been his head.
( chuckles )
Well, you haven't broken your knee.
But it looks like you have some blood in the joint.
Is that serious? No.
But you'll feel better once we drain it.
That sounds unpleasant.
( sighs ): Sounds worse than it is.
Could you give us a minute?
Oh, sure.
Espresso's calling.
Girl lives on caffeine and chocolate.
Alderman...
when Dr. Lewis examined you, she found a sore.
Yeah.
Uh, is it what I think it is?
We're still waiting for the lab results.
Well, you have some idea.
It's probably syphilis.
Wasn't the diagnosis I was hoping for.
How many partners have you had in the last year?
Oh, only one.
Okay.
We'll just give you a shot of antibiotics
and you'll be fine. Good.
But we'll need to report it to the Health Department.
Any way we can keep it out of my medical record?
It's automatic.
Once the labs are done, then...
But there's no need to worry.
Your records are confidential.
No, your health records are confidential.
Every time there's an election, they have to release mine.
And syphilis is not a word voters love to hear.
I understand your concerns.
We'll both get treatment.
You don't think everyone deserves some privacy?
JARVIK: Her sats are still falling.
Down to 83.
Okay, call Lewis and put on a mask.
RACHEL: Doug!
Aah, hey, monkeys.
( grunts ): You making trouble?
Nice to see you.
Hey. I'm Dr. Pratt.
You must be Doug.
Yeah.
Hey. Hey.
( laborious breathing )
DOUG: Hey.
( breathlessly ): What's he doing here?
He's worried about you.
He doesn't worry about anyone but himself.
Aah, yeah, good to see you, too, Mom.
Did you find Lewis?
She's coming.
I told you not to call him.
I don't want you near my kids, Doug.
Make him leave.
( raspy breathing )
LEWIS: What's up?
Her sats are down to 83.
Doug...
Doug, you're high, aren't you?
No.
Get the hell out of here!
Who's he?
Her son. RACHEL: Mom, please.
Let Doug stay.
So you can sit around and watch him get stoned?
Come on, they live with you.
Watch you sit around and get drunk.
Get the hell out of here! Get out!
( hacks )
Get him... LEWIS: Take slow breaths.
( raspy breathing ) ( alarm sounding )
RACHEL: Oh, God.
Mom?
Sats down to 78.
Crank up the O2.
Get them out of here.
Come on. Come on.
She's not moving any air. Bag her.
Get 20 etomidate, 100 of SUX.
Set up for an intubation.
You called him? Aunt's in Detroit.
The brother's here. I was just trying to help.
You can help by learning to listen
when the patient asks you not to do something.
Jerry, Dr. Lewis mislabeled a swab.
Can we pull it from the lab tray?
Labs went out an hour ago.
I need you to call and cancel it.
It's under Bright.
The alderman? Yeah.
I can try.
LEWIS: She's oxygenating well.
Turn her down to 80%
and check a gas in half-an-hour.
I.C.U. is full.
Call again, she needs a bed.
Hey, listen, I'm sorry about that
but I was just trying to do the right thing.
You exacerbated a terrible situation.
I told you to call the aunt.
I did. She's 69 with MS.
She can't take care of those kids.
Well, you think stoner boy is going to do any better?
Doug?
Hey, you guys, I've got to talk to the doctors, all right?
You okay?
Uh, yeah, I smoked a little
this afternoon, you know, but I-I'm fine now, so...
Hey, did I kill her?
No.
We had to put a tube in her throat
to help her breathe.
Why did she cough up all that blood?
She has an infection in her lungs.
Hey, look, I'm sorry I said all that stuff.
It's just... she just gets to me.
( exhales heavily )
Your mom's in stable condition right now
but she's going to have to be in I.C.U.
for at least a week.
Rachel and Marten need a place to stay.
Tonight, at least.
Yeah, I guess.
Well, it doesn't look like your mom's aunt
is going to be able to help out.
Oh, Aunt Sarah?
She can't even feed herself.
Is there anyone else who can take care of those kids?
No.
There's nobody.
Packed cells are in.
Tom, listen to me.
You have to go to the O.R.
( weakly ): I won't leave her.
( sighs )
You could die, too, if you don't.
She's not dead.
Malik, can you see if the next two units are ready?
MALIK: Yeah.
You remember when we went up to Lake Louise
biking that summer?
( machine alarm sounding )
Is that it?
Yes.
She's gone.
( crying softly )
Time of death 1934.
Mr. Callahan...
Thank you for letting me be with her.
Okay, let's move him.
I'll call surgery and catch up to you at the elevators, Malik.
You got it.
( machine beeps rhythmically )
Labs came back on your alderman.
Positive for syphilis.
I asked Jerry to pull his swab.
It was mislabled.
When you want labs, you can't get them.
When you don't want them, suddenly they get all efficient.
Chuny, do you know where Lily is?
I need a repeat potassium on Mrs. Callahan.
What is she still doing here?
She's an M.V.A.
I know; Kovac pronounced her an hour ago.
She's in and out of V-tach, but she's got a pulse.
Jerry, I thought I asked you to pull the alderman's labs.
I called them. I'll call them again.
No, it's all right.
I'll take care of it myself.
Hey, paramedics are pulling up with a kid.
Took a fall.
Don't they call ahead anymore?
Jerry, make sure those TV news vans
are out of the ambulance bay.
Hey, Luka, why is Jessie Callahan still in Trauma One?
I-I'm curious because she died an hour ago.
Her husband wouldn't go up to the O.R. until she passed
so I unhooked her leads and pronounced her.
Good God.
What happens when he gets back down from surgery
and finds out his wife is still alive?
I'll tell him it was a miracle.
Need a doctor over here.
This isn't funny, Luka.
You unhooked the monitors of a critically injured woman.
That's hardly in the best interests of your patient.
She wasn't my patient, he was.
David Scott, nine years old, altered after a fall
from the top bunk of a bunk bed.
Neighbor was baby-sitting, heard a crash and called 911.
G.C.S. 235.
The real one will be bigger.
I hope so.
Oh, thank you.
Have you tried these?
They're like perfect little salty things.
Don't fill up on those.
With any luck, we might get out of here
early enough to get some real food.
How much money are they trying to raise?
58, I think.
I know we're throwing in ten.
Thousand?
Million.
Right.
So, I guess that means you get great seats forever?
Gamma will.
What do you do with $58 million?
You get architectural significance.
I mean, what's the point to building a cultural edifice
if you're not going to prove your civic superiority?
Well, that's a lot of civic superiority.
Hey, you know, McNulty's clinic's not too far from here.
What do you think he would do with 58 million bucks?
Hot hors d'oeuvres in his waiting room.
Hello, John.
Hello, Gamma.
Hi, Steve.
I'm Millicent Carter, John's grandmother.
Hi, uh, Abby Lockhart.
Gamma, you've met Abby before.
Oh, I'm sorry.
So many people in John's life.
Don't you look beautiful?
What exactly are canapés?
I mean, are they different from... appetizers?
I'm not sure, dear.
There's a foundation board meeting
on Thursday, John.
Can you come? No, thank you.
I'd appreciate it.
We're electing new officers.
Oh, well... I always thought that was a sort of
"whoever's in the bathroom gets elected president"
kind of thing.
I'm stepping down.
I'd like you to take your father's place as treasurer.
How did Dad get off so easy?
I've asked your father to take my place as president.
Don't you think you're getting
a bit long in the tooth for the disaffected youth
role, John?
Gamma, thank you, but no, thank you.
I already have a day job.
Ow!
David, can you open your eyes?
Ow!
Looks like a Colles' fracture.
Excuse me, I'm trying to assess his mental status.
It's a response to painful stimuli.
David, do you know where you are?
( moaning )
All right, let's get a head C.T.
Lots of old bruises.
Active kid-- hockey, maybe?
We should do a long bone survey.
First we have to rule out intercranial bleed.
You guys seen Pratt?
Mrs. Callahan's potassium's 3.2.
Okay, add 20 of K.C.L.
to her next liter.
She's a D.N.R.
If she arrests, we'll let her go.
Until then, we treat her.
She's dead, Kerry.
( knock at door )
Oh, great, just what I need.
This is a decision her husband should be making.
He's in surgery.
If you had told him the truth
he could have given us clear instructions on his wife's care.
Now we have to decide.
Give her the "K."
What can I do for you, Robert?
So, I'm finished for the day
and I come downstairs to say
good night and godspeed, and lo and behold
who should I find still sitting on his ass
in the middle of the E.R.?
We're still waiting on a few tests for the...
Alderman? Right, that's right.
Five hours later.
Did I or did I not
He didn't want a private room.
You should have given him one anyway.
He should have had two doctors and five nurses
hovering over him every minute.
"Can I get you anything, Alderman?
A little more ice for your knee, Alderman?"
Yeah, we only have five nurses...
I don't give a damn.
Whatever he needs, whatever he wants
you do it and you do it now.
That was a little rude.
Stay out of it.
Excuse me, if I could have your attention, please.
So was that.
With 200 fewer seats
much larger rehearsal hall and dressing rooms
world-class...
My grandmother doesn't want me to be the treasurer of the family foundation.
She wants me to quit working.
She's old.
She's probably looking for you to take on some of her load.
Embrace my familial responsibilities.
Join the family business.
Which is... what, exactly?
It's this.
It's giving away money, it's cutting ribbons
it's waving to the common man.
It's Prince Charles without the castle.
I don't know about no castle.
I've seen your family's house.
Abby, I know that you mean well
but don't try to tell me
what to do with my life, please?
It is a great pleasure for me to introduce...
Okay.
John Carter.
( applause )
C.T.'s ready, and he's waking up.
Where's my dad?
We called him.
How did you get hurt, David?
I fell off the top bunk.
Okay, we're going to take care of you.
This is Chuny, and she's taking you up
to get a few more tests, okay?
Will you find my dad?
We've already called him, honey.
He should be here any minute.
Dr. Kovac, the kid's X rays are back.
Finally.
I thought Tuesday nights were not busy, eh?
Who told you that?
Oh, damn it.
What?
Is D.C.F.S. still around?
Excuse me, um, they told me my son was back here.
Uh, David Scott.
An ambulance brought him in just a few minutes ago.
He fell out of his bed.
Mr. Scott?
Yeah.
Where is he? Is he okay?
Your son has a broken wrist, and he hit his head.
( sighing )
He gets hurt all the time.
More since his mom left.
His exam showed some old injuries.
Yeah, well, he doesn't pay attention.
The injuries are suspicious.
What?
Are you suggesting that I hurt my own son?
Do you?
No. No, of course not.
We're giving her all the right antibiotics
but her sepsis is very advanced.
So, her chances...?
I'm afraid they're not very good.
I, I just need to determine
what is the best living situation
for your brother and sister.
Yeah.
Do you think living with you
is the best thing for them?
Uh, probably not.
So, I should find someplace else for them to stay?
Wait a minute.
You're not trying to keep them together?
Is this coming from you?
I think Doug agrees that foster care
is the best option for his brother and sister right now.
Doug, do you know what foster care is like?
Most likely they won't even be able to stay together.
We do our best to keep siblings together.
But that doesn't always happen, right?
We do our best.
Do you know what that means, hmm?
That means that they're going to get split up.
Their mom's dying, and they're going to be separated.
Living with strangers-- is that what you want?
Hey, Doug, Doug.
No, she's right!
Listen, your mom might die.
You need to stay together.
They love you, man.
( bitter laugh )
Right. Right, the dumb stoner
who makes them laugh.
You care about them; that's all that matters.
Hey, I can't take care of two kids.
You'd be surprised at what you can do.
No.
Hey, trust me; I know.
You just need to step up.
Hey, you never should have called me, all right?
My mom's right.
They're all right.
Make them wrong.
I can't, all right?
Bright to Williams, right?
You have the new label?
Specimen tube was mislabeled.
Happens. We don't want the paperwork gods to strike us dead.
We just need
a Dr. Hancock.
That's it? That's it.
I think Shaw's is open late
if you still want to get something to eat.
No, I'm not hungry.
Not hungry or pissed at me?
Look, I'm sorry
but I don't think you have any right
to lecture me about my family.
Was that an apology?
I don't owe you an apology.
Look, you want me to end up like my father--
at Gamma's beck and call handing out checks
so that the Art Institute can have another De Kooning
or the symphony can have travertine
instead of tile in its bathrooms?
Get involved with the foundation
and change the priorities.
Give the money to health care, education, needle exchange--
I don't know, anything you feel passionate about.
I feel passionate about what I'm doing, okay?
I feel passionate about working at County.
Who says you can't do both?
( rueful chuckle ): I do.
Okay, look, you were born really, really rich.
So what?
It's nothing to be ashamed of.
I'm not ashamed of who I am.
No? You drive a Jeep.
You wear a cheap watch.
You rent a two-bedroom apartment.
What do you want me to do, drive a BMW?
No. I don't care.
I couldn't care less, but you care a lot.
You want everybody to think
that you're just like them, and you're not.
You just... signed a check for $10 million in there.
You didn't even blink.
I write a check for over $100, I get a stomach ache.
I give something more important than money.
I give my time, and I do it every day
to real people, and it makes a difference.
And I think that's great.
I really, really do.
But money makes a difference, too.
You know where my money comes from?
Do you know where the money
for the Carter Symphony Hall comes from?
My great- grandfather
made a killing during the Depression
cornering the coal market.
In the winter of 1933, a lot of children froze to death
and my family made out like bandits.
That was 70 years ago, Carter.
You can't give the money back now.
Why not help give it to people who really need it?
There are still lots of kids
freezing to death every winter, Carter.
How's the knee?
Sore.
Well, the swelling's down.
Looks like we can get you started home.
Ah, almost 11:00?
Should be safe.
Local news usually packs up and goes home
if they miss the 10:00.
I'll go get the car.
All right, your thigh will probably be a little sore
from the penicillin shot.
How do we stand on the medical records issue?
It's been handled.
Good, good.
Thank you for your discretion.
I'm glad I could help.
Bright is discharged, Jerry.
The alderman?
Did we ever get his labs back?
They were negative.
You're kidding.
That lesion was right out of Netter's.
We should run it again.
It's fine.
He could have untreated syphilis.
He's fine; let it go.
MAN: Don't touch me!
Yeah, almost midnight.
Let the shouting begin.
He's scared. He needs me with him.
This is you, right?
You better calm down.
No, I'm okay.
But this is crazy.
I have never hurt my son.
What the hell was that about?
A father abusing his son.
Where's Social Services?
They were busy.
So, you called the police?
The kid has multiple old fractures.
Did you even talk to the child?
Of course I did; he was scared.
Hey, you got the blue cast.
That's my favorite.
Is my dad coming back?
Well, he had to talk to some people.
You get along pretty well with your dad?
Better since Mom left.
He says we're like Starsky and Hutch.
That's an old TV show we watch on Nick at Nite.
That sounds nice.
Yeah.
You've been hurt a lot in the last few months.
I don't pay enough attention.
Did you really fall out of bed today, David?
I...
I jumped.
Is that the truth, David?
It's okay.
You can tell me.
Hello?
MAN: We're closed.
Dr. McNulty?
If you're sick, go to County.
Dr. McNulty, we met the other day.
I'm Dr. Carter.
You left before your tests came back.
Your blood sugar was 435.
Your diabetes is way out of control.
I take my Orinase.
Orinase? They still make that?
It works fine for me.
Not according to your tests.
There are newer, better drugs.
Yeah. Thanks.
Good-bye.
Listen, you're not going to be able
to help anybody down here if you're in a coma or dead.
Actos, six-month supply.
Hey, hey, hey.
You steal those from County?
There are laws against that.
( sighing )
You got to watch your sugar, too.
Sure.
Don't get your tux dirty on the way out.
Looks like you could use
some new equipment around here.
Nah, nah-nah-nah.
You're not doing that.
You could get yourself a cardiac monitor.
Chemistry analyzer.
12-lead.
Anything else you might need.
What's this, white liberal guilt?
Probably.
Lots of guilt.
No, thanks.
I'm not here to make you feel better.
There must be something I can do.
Yeah. You can sweep.
Hey, Malik, did I.C.U. come for my pneumonia yet?
Yeah, she went up a couple of minutes ago.
D.C.F.S. is taking the kids up to say good-bye.
She's still alive, right?
Yeah. You came back.
I never really left.
You know, she said
I was the biggest mistake of her life.
I don't want
to let them down...
you know, but I don't know if I can do it.
You just do the best that you can.
That will be enough.
Come on.
I'll take you up to see them.
Go ahead.
Thanks.
He came back, huh?
Yeah.
Hey, uh, I was out of line before.
Whatever. I'm an adult, I can handle it.
You should worry about those two kids.
Hey, Pratt, phone call.
( sighing )
Hello, Dr. Pratt.
Hey, Mrs. Knightly.
What...?
Oh, man; when?
Okay.
Jerry, I'm off in 15.
I'll come in early and make it up in the morning.
Was that Pratt leaving again?
Uh, yeah, he had to go early.
Go where?
Didn't say.
Well, guess what? I want to go, too.
Maybe I should just leave.
What do you think?
Just leave because I feel like it.
Your child abuser was the case of a boy
wanting to spend more time with his father.
Who, the Scott kid?
Yes, the kid hurts himself
so Dad will stay home from work
and watch TV with him.
Luka, did you page me for a post-op seroma?
Yeah, in Exam Four.
Your Mr. Callahan's finally in recovery.
Send your patients up to the O.R.
a little bit more promptly in future, all right?
Next time, get D.C.F.S. down here
before you call the cops.
Tom's out of surgery.
He's going to be okay.
You can let go now.
Pratt left again.
Man, when I was an intern, it was a full-time job.
Yeah, it still is.
( groaning ): I just want to go home
and get into bed.
What do you think the odds are
that Antonio Banderas will be there waiting for me?
Oh, I almost forgot.
Here. I know it's a little early
but I was in Fields buying a gift for my niece
and I saw the infant stuff.
I pass those little clothes
and I just go into a trance state.
I have to buy something.
Susan...
Those little onesies and jumpers--
they have complete control over me.
And the little shoes.
I didn't know if it was a boy or a girl
so, I got it in green, like a neutral color
but if you hate it, I have the gift receipt.
I'm not pregnant anymore.
I miscarried.
Oh, uh, God.
Kerry, I'm so sorry.
The embryonic loss rate after implantation
is about 30% in I.V.F.
It isn't rare.
Thank you for the thought.
Sure.
And when you see Pratt
why don't you remind him this is a full-time job?
Good night.
They brought him in
on a 10-29-- possible stolen car.
The car was clean, but they found a shotgun with a clipped barrel.
And the other boys have criminal paper
but your brother's clear.
He was hanging next to the wrong car at the wrong time.
This is against, like, 15 regs, so make it fast.
Thanks.
Hey, if I ever get shot
I want to end up at County.
You guys always take care of us.
Thank you.
Don't be mad.
Don't be mad, G, please.
It wasn't my fault.
It was Dukey's car.
He's the one that had the gun.
What were you doing with Dukey and those boys?
Didn't I tell you?
I was just telling them about the job you had got for me
and when I was telling them, that's when the cops they came.
Okay, okay, listen to me.
Do not talk to anybody in here--
not the police, no one.
Not until I get you a lawyer.
Tell Mr. Keegan I won't be late next time.
Yeah.
Was he mad?
Tell him I promise.
Leon, you didn't show up.
You probably lost that job.
( sobbing ): No, G. No.
I-I, I don't want
to stay in here, G.
Come on, please?
Can we just go home?
Listen, the judge sets bail in the morning.
Then I can take you home.
In the morning?! Doc, you got to go.
( sobbing ): G, I can't spend the night here!
I don't even know these people.
First thing in the morning, okay?
Doc... ( sobbing )
First thing. G, don't leave me!
G, don't do that, G!
G, come on! G! G!!!
Don't leave me here!
Come on! G! G!
