Prieviously on ER.
I'm fine.
Even so, I've scheduled a meeting with Dr. Myers.
It's mandatory.
Wow.
It was my great-grandmother's.
LEWIS: You're going to propose?
That's it? You bought out
this whole place just for that?
I found a sore on his penis.
I think it's syphilis.
Any way we can keep it out of my medical record?
No, that is not the point.
You might say 2.4 up front,
but you're going to lose 20,000 primary care visits a year...
MAN: Thank you, Dr. Weaver.
For a potential loss of over $10 million.
MAN: We have to make tough choices this fiscal year...
WEAVER: Tough, yes, short-sighted, no.
MAN: Is there a motion to vote?
Excuse me, Mr. Chairman. I'm not finished.
I think we understand the issue.
Lack of primary care leaves thousands...
MAN: And your argument.
These are human beings, not statistics,
and we are abandoning an entire community.
We get it.
Thank you.
Now, is there a motion to vote in open session?
Mr. Chairman...
Motion.
Second.
All right, all those in favor of closing the Erie Street Clinic.
Those opposed to the closing?
The nays have it.
15-minute recess.
( bangs gavel )
BRIGHT: Nice work, Kerry.
Is it always this close?
You have the gift of persuasion.
Well, pugnacity is more like it.
And an understanding of what motivates people,
and that's the secret to being a good politician.
I'm out of my league there.
Nonsense, it wouldn't surprise me
if you were Surgeon General someday.
Kristy?
Meet the future Surgeon General
and savior of the Erie Street Clinic.
Hello, Doctor.
He's kidding.
He never kids.
Ah, Kerry, you have another minute?
Ah, sure.
Parks and Rec has been pushed to 11:00
and Bamberger called again
about the Gay Marriage Amendment.
Tell him I'm sympathetic,
but it will never pass, and I'm not going to torpedo the bill.
Maybe we should get you on that one.
Might actually stand a chance.
What do you mean?
You're a problem-solver, Kerry.
A pragmatist.
I can't tell you how much I appreciate that.
Thank you.
That's why I hate to implore you for another personal favor,
but, oh, I frankly don't know what else to do.
You were very considerate
in treating my off-the-record condition.
Did the lesion not heal?
No, it did, but... I'm in a relationship with someone,
someone who works for me.
I'm single, we're in love,
but workplace affairs, well, I don't need the attention.
And uh, she's symptomatic?
I was hoping you could provide treatment
with the same level of discretion.
You should send her to any free clinic.
They're all confidential.
Just a simple shot of penicillin, right?
Treatment without generating a medical record is malpractice.
But you've done it before.
And I shouldn't have.
Okay, okay, I think I understand.
I'm sorry, I mean, you know, I, I, I could lose my license.
Don't be sorry.
You're a woman of principle.
How can I not respect that?
Forget I asked.
And congratulations again.
You did some real good today, Kerry.
Thank you.
Of course, there are no guarantees
for next year's budget at your hospital.
What?
There's an afternoon vote on eliminating emergency services.
At County General?
You mean closing the ER?
I need you, Kerry.
Is your jalopy still in the shop?
It's a Jeep.
Oh, a Jeep.
A Jeep.
You hardly touched your breakfast.
Yeah, I don't like to eat much before a shift.
All that blood and guts, you know?
Don't remind me.
I had a feeling
there was some agenda this morning,
but you've been very mysterious.
Just wanted to check in, see how you were.
And I wanted to give this back to you for the time being.
She said no?
I didn't ask.
Did something happen?
No, just felt kinda rushed.
What did she do?
Nothing.
Doesn't even know.
I don't think she knows.
Maybe she knows. I don't know.
I'm sorry, Johnny.
I thought you'd be relieved.
That you're unhappy?
I got the impression that you never really... cared for her.
( sighs )
I've spent so many years
trying to get you to do what I think is best for you.
You're past having me badger you about your choices.
This is yours.
Give it or don't, to whomever you choose.
Why? Oh, I'm thinking Emergency Medicine.
Here? Better than Iraq.
Hey, that is not it.
Don't you still owe four years?
Well, I can roll the time to after my residency.
Afraid to fight, all right.
Hey, anytime, any place, old man.
I can smell fear a mile away.
Answer the phone, Frank.
ER.
You know, the holiday is called Saint Patrick's Day,
not Saint Patrick's week.
You got something against the Irish?
The giant shamrock in triage started drinking 72 hours ago...
Excuse me, I'm looking for Dr. Weaver.
Frank? Oh, she'll be back in a few minutes.
Have a seat over there.
Why do they always ask me?
Do I look like customer service lady?
He's cute. He's a zygote.
Any more blind dates? Never again.
But we're going to Las Vegas tonight.
Who's we?
Me and Chen. And 50 other county employees.
So, how's it going with you?
Rule out MI, waiting on a second triponin.
No, I meant in general.
Any, uh, news?
No.
Did you need that?
Um... oh, I thought it was a different patient.
So, how are you and Carter?
Good, I guess.
Kind of.
He's been acting a little weird.
Well, it's been rough for the both of you lately.
Yeah, I think we're getting back to normal, though.
Dr. Lewis, he's seizing again.
Another four of lorazepam and load a gram of dilantin.
Abby, clear CT on this one.
Blown pupil?
Sub-conj hemorrhage.
No ID. Too young for a driver's license, no purse.
This the assault?
LOC in Union Station, probably a street kid.
Not with those boots.
Expensive jacket, too. Maybe she shoplifts.
She came in with that girl?
No, different run.
Dr. Kovac? Chest is clear, belly's soft.
Looks like isolated head and facial trauma.
What happened?
Let's get a C-spine, chest, and pelvis.
Dr. Kovac? You got this?
Yep. Trauma panel. Urine icon. Dip a UA.
I'm sorry, I forgot.
Three times.
That's three missed appointments.
Yeah, I, I have a bad memory.
Look, your department required psychotherapy,
but I have to report to mine.
I don't want to be a heavy.
In fact, I want to help you.
Prepare for disappointment.
I have extended office hours tonight.
I'm free from 7:00 to 8:00. Can you make that?
I really don't see the point.
You don't have to see the point.
Just show up.
Just show up?
That's all I've been doing: showing up.
Time goes by faster at work.
Pulse ox 99.
DTR's two-plus at the knee.
Gold card. "Joanna Banks." Is that her?
Shift work. Treat-and-street a few lost souls.
I doubt it.
You're with them when they're most vulnerable.
Is that bile?
That's 17 Jello shots.
All right, let's prep for lavage.
When they're naked, weak, hurt...
you touch them, look at their bodies.
See them more closely
than their families, their lovers,
but it's mechanical.
You know, temporary.
You fix them up or you watch them die.
Either way, it ends, and you... move on.
No next time, no strings, no real connections.
Maybe that's why I stay.
You waiting on incoming?
What?
Did you sign up for incoming?
Coffee.
Cigarette break?
Do you want some?
What?
Coffee?
No, thanks.
You're not turning into a health nut on me, huh?
No. Waiting for an old lady that fell of her treadmill.
Okay.
CORDAY: Do you remember what happened?
Can I call your parents?
Um, I don't live at home.
Where do you live?
Molly, I can't help you unless you talk to me.
Uh... they call it a, a boot camp
for kids who can't get along with their parents.
So they discipline you.
Does this look like discipline?
A camp counselor did this to you?
I heard they raped a girl.
Okay.
Haleh...
perhaps Molly should be speaking with a police officer.
I'm sure your mother would like to know that you're here.
That you're safe.
Who do you think sent me there in the first place?
ABBY: Any family?
She said she has a husband, Charles.
WOMAN: And what else did I say about him?
That he's useless.
Exactly. Forget him.
Listen, you chowderhead, it's a stolen card.
How am I supposed to know her mother's maiden name?
Hey, John, what are you doing boarding four ICU players
and eight med-surg admissions?
Susan's driving. Talk to her.
Dr. Weaver? What?
Keith Mitchell. I have an appointment to see you.
Yeah, we don't make appointments in the ER.
Report your complaint to the triagers.
I believe special arrangements were made by Alderman Bright.
Jonathan has nothing but wonderful things to say about you.
How long have you been in his office?
Ah, I started junior year, spring quarter,
so about two years.
Now, I get grad school credit
and on-the-job training.
He's a great mentor, very generous with his time.
Oh, uh, this goes in the buttocks.
I'm surprised that you waited so long to be treated.
I didn't notice the sore. Jonathan did.
When?
Two nights ago. I was so embarrassed.
I just hope I didn't give it to him.
He didn't have it?
Ah, no.
I was pretty crazy in my college days.
I mean, we're completely monogamous now,
but I have to say he was really cool about it.
Most people wouldn't be so understanding.
All done.
We all have our past, right?
MAN: I told you not to work out so much.
So I can sit around and watch the soaps all day?
Any other symptoms, Mrs. Sanbery?
Yes, my hair is falling out.
But I blame that on him.
She just kidding.
The hell I am.
Have you checked the fingernails?
Yeah, I'm getting to that.
What?
These marks, these lines? What marks?
These are called Meese lines.
What kind of work did you do?
Supervisor at a wood processing plant.
Did they use arsenic?
They tested us for it all the time.
That can't be it.
Okay, let's get Mrs. Sanbery's blood and urine reports from OSHA.
I will be right back.
Take him with you.
MAN: Ruthy, just relax.
Wonders of marital bliss, huh?
I don't know who's worse.
Her for being such a pain in the ass,
or him for being so pathetic.
Cuts both ways, I guess.
Hey, my bike girl trauma may have a diminished foot pulse.
Check Dopplers. I'll be there in a minute.
Um, Mrs. Banks.
Yes?
I'm Dr. Corday.
I'm the surgeon treating your daughter.
She'll need surgery?
No, no...
I'm surprised the camp actually called you.
Why wouldn't they?
Well, they assaulted your daughter.
Is that what she told you?
She ran off on the second day.
They didn't touch her.
Somebody did.
With Molly, there's all kinds of explanations.
What makes you certain it's not the camp?
MRS. BANKS: Because she says it is.
Trashing my house with a baseball bat.
Shoplifting.
Drinking, drug use.
Unwanted pregnancy.
Do I need to go on?
( pager beeping )
I need to call my office.
Maybe you can talk to her when you're finished.
I haven't been able to talk to her in three years.
WEAVER: Actually threw you across the room?
In a bar fight, not a tossing.
Big difference.
Congratulations, Kerry.
Whatever you're doing down at City Hall seems to be working.
Well, it was a close vote.
But without a single cut.
What? The hospital budget.
We were vulnerable to a 20% cut,
but it sailed through committee less than an hour ago.
MAN: They say he drove out the snakes.
Who?
Saint Patrick.
Well, I'd like to see you and Robert in my office at 5:00.
Is there a problem?
Just a little administrative housekeeping.
We should burn through it quickly.
Dr. Weaver, Dr. Lewis needs you.
What kid?
That kid.
He was looking for you, waiting in chairs.
A paramedic brought him in.
125 of solumedrol,
50 of benadryl.
Stand by with an epi drip.
Hey, Kerry, do you know this kid?
What happened?
Passed out at Doc Magoo's. Tight wheezes and hives,
barely any breath sounds.
You don't happen to know
if he has any food allergies, do you?
No, I don't.
He was looking for you.
Sats are dropping, 93. Pulse: 120.
Cords are too edematous. 20 of etomidate,
100 of sux.
Prep a crike tray.
Fiber-optic with a 7-0 tube.
Okay, one more look.
You're wasting time.
Kerry, you need to let the drugs work.
He needs intubation on the next attempt.
So you do know him.
He could be allergic to anything.
An insect bite or have a carcinoid.
He's got an ID from City Hall.
Okay, do a jaw thrust and keep a good seal when you bag him.
You know, I did get some papers from Health and Human Services.
This man maybe dropped them off.
Okay, suction and light source on high.
Let's go.
This is an emergency.
Listen, you tell him that one of his staffers
is in the ER with a severe allergic reaction.
Tell him to call me as soon as he can.
You were right. He does work at City Hall.
Mm, Alderman Bright's office?
Yeah, how did you know?
Well, there's no insect bite,
but there's a chancre on his penis.
Kerry...
That's a bit of a leap, don't you think?
The Alderman walked out of here
with untreated syphilis.
We don't know that it was untreated.
And now one of his young staffers comes back...
All right, we certainly don't know
that the Alderman is in the habit
of sexual harassment, much less gay.
The kid is in anaphylactic shock.
Either it's a sudden food allergy or drug.
My guess is penicillin.
Not necessarily.
I mean, it, it could be
idiopathic histamine release or vasculitis...
He's triggering the vent.
Any spontaneous eye opening?
Not yet.
Okay, call immunology for skin testing.
Have them include penicillin
and get me as soon as he wakes up.
What's his F.I. O2?
Fifty percent.
Sounds like upper airway secretions.
I think he's just a little wheezy.
Why don't you get a suction catheter.
He might have a mucus plug we need to clear out.
He's satting at 98%...
I want to optimize his oxygenation.
Just get it.
Keith?
Keith?
Can you hear me?
Keith.
Keith, there's a tube in your throat
to help you breathe.
You had a severe allergic reaction,
probably to the penicillin,
but everything is okay now, all right?
We'll take out the tube soon, you'll be able to speak
and the other doctors will have some questions for you.
They've examined you, so they know you have syphilis
and they'll be able to determine an allergy to penicillin.
But Jonathan cannot have sent you here.
To me.
You know what that means.
We have to protect him.
We can't give anyone reason to speculate,
or they might even target Jonathan
as the source of the infection.
Listen carefully, Keith.
People have been known to borrow prescriptions
from friends without ever seeing a doctor.
They think they know what they have,
and how to treat it,
so they take care of it on their own.
Do you understand?
Good.
Dr. Carter. Dealership called.
You need brake pads. It'll be ready at 5:00.
Can you get rabies from fish?
No.
You're sure?
I'm pretty sure.
Well, what do you make of this?
Big-ass pike bit me
when I was trying to get it off the line.
Looks infected.
That's it?
Call me if you start growing gills.
Doctor.
OSHA results.
The arsenic levels in Mrs. Sanbery's urine samples
for the past three years have been undetectable.
And today's results?
Over 200 mikes per liter.
( whistles )
Maybe she got down about being home.
Suicide attempt?
I don't know.
Happens to some retirees.
Either that, or someone's trying to kill her.
Find out if she's been depressed.
Take it from there.
Okay.
What's that?
What?
On your back.
It's the patch.
For... birth control?
No, for smoking.
You quit smoking?
Four days ago, yes, thanks for noticing.
Thanks for sharing.
Last week I had to bring
a throat cancer patient outside
so she could smoke through her trach hole
and I decided this has got to stop.
Really?
Uh, there's some bronchospasm.
Add a unit dose of atrovent to his next treatment.
I think he's waking up.
Should I call Lewis?
It's her patient.
MOLLY: Get her out of here!
Get her out! Get her out of here!
CORDAY: Lie back or you'll hurt yourself.
I told you not to call her.
Get out, you bitch!
Molly, you need to talk to your mother.
About locking me up again? About getting me raped?
Do you need pysch?
She doesn't give a crap about me.
You told me we were going on a camping trip, you lying slut!
Okay, two of Ativan.
Make it four. I could use a good buzz.
Now, you listen to me!
I want you to settle down right now!
Get her out of here.
I'll ask your mother to leave if you'll stop struggling.
Molly, the reason
I put you in that program is because I care about you.
Liar!
Okay, okay, hard restraints.
Oh, God. Liar!
Where's the Ativan?
Liar! Liar!
Liar! Liar!
From the time she was two years old
she's been acting like this.
I actually thought that she would get over it.
Okay, sit right here.
And then keep pressure on that.
I know.
They shocked four times for v fib.
Hold compressions.
Asystole.
Hate crime.
Forget it.
Gray matter and brain stem failure.
Call it.
Time of death: 13:43.
HARMS: Some jerk shot him three times
because he wouldn't get off the bus.
Said it was only for Americans.
Morales is en route with the shooter.
Okay, Keith,
we have a breathing treatment for you to work on.
( coughs )
Okay, here you go.
Deep breaths, in and out.
Pulse ox 99.
Good.
You had a severe allergic reaction to something.
Is there anything you've eaten
that you know you're allergic to?
Any new medications?
Penicillin.
Why are you taking penicillin?
Syphilis.
My ex-girlfriend called and told me she had an outbreak,
and I better take care of it.
Did you know you're allergic to penicillin?
No.
Did the doctor
who gave it to you ask?
I didn't see the doctor.
My ex told me that's what they gave her.
I had a friend
who had some left over from a strep throat.
( speaking Russian )
We're still looking for a Russian translator.
When they cry, the eardrum turns red
and you can't rule out an infection.
Kovac, eye trauma girl's losing visual acuity.
She may need decompression.
I'll be right there.
( speaking Russian )
Dr. Kovac,
I was wondering if you'd write a letter of recommendation
for my Dean's file.
I can't do that.
What?
Sorry.
Did you give him the message?
Luka, wait.
Corday needs help with a canthotomy.
Hold on.
Tell him that I really need to talk to him. It's important.
Well, you have him call me back.
You're blowing off your required therapy?
No.
We had an agreement.
I never agreed to anything.
Well, you came back here, didn't you?
I told you it was mandatory, didn't I?
Excuse me, Luka.
Hey, I don't need to see a shrink.
What's wrong?
BP's down to 80.
Might have vagalled with the ABG.
Something's wrong with my stomach.
Get his head down and squeeze in two liters.
Belly's rigid.
Where's his last chest film?
Why does it hurt so much?
Tachy at 120.
Oh, God.
Free air under the diaphragm.
What does that mean?
You have a perforation in your stomach or intestine.
From the penicillin?
No. Hang 100 Gent, 500 of Flagyl.
Pressure's down to 60.
Keith?
Keith, how you doing? Keith?
How hard were you bagging him?
The cords were swollen shut.
Which is why you don't hyperventilate.
Kerry, don't blame this on her.
Get Corday in here.
20 of famotidine IV piggyback.
Sometimes small perforations can heal spontaneously.
Now, Abby.
O2 15 liters by mask.
Set me up for a central line.
Get me some betadine.
MOLLY: Can't see.
Why can't I see?
CORDAY: Hold still.
Dr. Corday, Dr. Weaver needs a consult.
Retro-bulbar hematoma.
It's compressing the optic nerve.
Am I going blind?
Will someone tell me what's wrong?
You can't see because
there's blood collecting behind your eye.
We have to drain it.
How? A tiny incision.
Dr. Corday? You have to give me a minute.
You're going to cut into my eyeball?
Just the skin on the side.
No, please, I don't want you guys to do this.
The longer we wait, the greater the risk of blindness.
Please don't do this, please.
I really don't want you to cut my eye.
Molly, we have no choice.
Mom? Mom?
1% with epi.
I'm here.
KOVAC: Sometimes you see it in their eyes.
Mom...
They're trusting what you're saying.
You're the doctor. You know best.
But I don't.
I guess.
And lie.
Say the same things to different people
over and over again until I can hardly
make the words come out of my mouth anymore.
It's really hard not to be disgusted...
with yourself, with the system, everyone you work with.
Even with the people you're supposed to help.
All done.
Dr. Corday, we have a gastric rupture.
Can you suture?
Yeah, I got it.
How many fingers?
Infuser is primed.
I'm in. Hook me up.
CORDAY: He has a history of peptic ulcer disease?
Overinflation from bag mask ventilation.
He could have had an underlying lesion.
Fluid's in.
Pressure's still not coming up.
CORDAY: Dopamine at ten mikes.
Tell the OR we're on our way up.
Why was he being bagged?
LEWIS: Anaphylaxis.
CORDAY: Gram of Cefoxitin, cover anaerobes.
No, he's allergic to penicillin.
Any family?
Not that I could see. Kerry?
Sinus tach on monitor.
Kerry.
What?
Any family?
I don't know. Ask Frank.
CORDAY: He's had steroids?
So how long am I in the hospital?
A few days.
You can go home
as long as there's no re-bleeding.
Home, yeah, right. My mom would rather I go blind.
She was just here, holding your hand.
Yeah, holding my hand for ten minutes
doesn't fix ten years.
Ten years of what?
Of hating me.
She hates me.
That's not what I saw.
Whatever. I hate her, too.
What I saw was a scared little girl
crying for her mother.
And her mother came.
She's never let me come home.
Ask her.
I can't.
Getting beat up on the street is better?
Would you?
What?
Ask her.
CORDAY: The field's dry.
He's septic.
BJERKE: Dopamine's up to 20 mikes.
How much blood loss?
Insignificant.
What's the last crit?
Thirty-six.
Run of six. 100 of lidocaine,
starting a drip at two per minute.
He needs crystalloid.
Squeeze in two units of saline, and hang Levophed.
V tach!
Crash cart!
Charge to 200.
No pulse. Start compressions.
Amp of epi.
We're charged.
Clear.
No change.
Charge to 300.
Epi's on board.
Charged again.
Clear.
PERRY: V fib.
CORDAY: Damn it.
360. He's a kid. He should respond.
Satinsky. Vasopressin 40 units IV.
Mix up a pronestyl drip.
He was probably going to blow up the bus.
There's blood in the belly.
He's tachy at 120.
Damn terrorists everywhere you look.
He was Sikh. They're committed to non-violence.
Yeah? Why's he wearing a towel on his head?
Maybe he just got out of the shower,
which is where you should be.
Blunt trauma. Still hypotensive
after a chest tube and two units.
Looks like an intra- abdominal bleed.
Probably splenic lac
with fractured ribs on the left.
Fluid in Morrison's. Call the OR, book a room.
Pressure's down 50 systolic.
Let's put him in Trendelenburg.
Okay, 100% O2 by mask.
And squeeze in two units of O-neg.
Let's go.
I'll take him up myself.
Dr. Romano.
Grab the drug box.
Dr. Romano, your arm.
Damn it!
( sighs )
I'm fine.
Let's just... let's go. Let's roll.
It's all my own fault.
I should have never married him.
You get one shot, maybe, at being truly happy.
I had it with Henry Booth
when I was 20... and I blew it.
Okay, well, I'm going to come up and check on you
after your chelation therapy.
Till death do they part.
Maybe they deserve each other.
Hey, do you want to get some dinner tonight?
Uh... I can't, not tonight.
PABLO: Abby, I need to pee.
Okay, I'll be right there, Pablo.
I don't think I can hold it that long. I'm coming.
I was kind of hoping that we could get together.
I can't. I have a thing.
What thing?
I'm meeting someone.
Who?
My A.A. sponsor.
When did this happen?
I just decided maybe it was time to say hello.
KOVAC: Hey, Gallant?
Where's Mrs. Banks?
Who?
You took care of her facial lac.
What, she's not in Sutures?
Nope.
Listen, I'm, uh, thinking of applying for the match.
In emergency medicine.
Bad idea.
Yeah, well, the letter wasn't for my rotation.
It was for my residency application.
I know.
( woman yelling in Russian )
KOVAC: He bit the balloon.
GALLANT: You think he aspirated?
He looks cyanotic.
Bag him and get a pulse ox.
( woman speaking Russian )
( whimpers )
It's tough to ventilate.
It's blocking his airway.
Pedes intubation tray and a MacGill.
Pulse ox is 81.
( woman speaking frantically in Russian )
KOVAC: I'm good at what I do.
I have certain skills, certain abilities.
They came naturally to me.
You know, perfect fit.
Can you see anything?
It's not about seeing.
Others would struggle to get through the day,
and I wanted more.
I might have something.
More urgency, more purpose.
( baby crying )
GALLANT: Stats are coming up.
( crying continues )
( speaking Russian )
The medicine was exciting, powerful.
Alive.
Today we saved a teenager's sight,
I saved a child's life...
I didn't feel it.
Didn't feel anything.
Was he stopping at the ER?
They said he was coming straight up.
Sorry, Kerry, I hope I didn't keep you waiting. For what?
I got tied up with a parathyroidectomy.
Is Robert here?
Our 5:00.
Right, just, uh, give me a minute.
BRIGHT: Kerry, what happened?
I've been trying to reach you.
I was stuck at an EPA site with the mayor.
I've been calling and paging you and calling. Calm down.
This is why we have medical records and nurses' notes.
Is there a place we...?
This is why we take a history before we administer drugs.
Privately, please.
Do you know that he died?
Keith died.
He went into anaphylactic shock
and his airway closed.
ROMANO: Alderman.
What brings you here?
Uh, I'm checking on a staff member. Uh-huh.
Well, congratulations on the budget.
First year they haven't tried to close us down.
Dr. Weaver did an excellent job
of articulating your needs.
Yeah, she's our own little articulator.
Where are you going, Kerry? Don't we have this meeting?
( quietly ): Just give me a second.
You okay?
More trouble with the arm?
Uh, not worse than getting it severed in the first place.
I'm glad to hear it. Stay well.
Yeah, you too.
His airway closed,
but they had to bag him anyway,
which caused his stomach to overinflate and tear.
In here.
But they intubated him anyway.
But then that overinflated his stomach,
and then there was a tear in his stomach
that caused septic shock.
But then his blood pressure dropped
and they couldn't resuscitate him.
Slow down. Slow down.
I thought he was getting a shot of penicillin.
We did give him a shot of penicillin.
That's what caused the anaphylaxis.
Oh, my God, what did I do? Okay, okay.
Unexpected things like this happen in medicine sometimes.
"Unexpected things."
I didn't ask him if he was allergic.
We always ask. But we always have a chart
and the chart reminds us
that we're treating the patient correctly.
Yes, you could have asked. It wouldn't have prevented it.
I could have given him something else.
Or better yet, nothing. Nothing at all.
I told him it would be a shot of penicillin
even before I approached you.
He didn't tell me he was allergic. He didn't know.
This would have happened anyway, however he got treated.
( knocking )
They're waiting for you in the conference.
Anspaugh needs to scrub in.
Have them start without me.
BRIGHT: All right.
Um, there's already no record of the shot.
It's too late for that. Um...
We could tell the truth.
No one else knows?
Not yet.
Keith didn't say anything about me?
For God's sake.
Oh, my God, he's dead.
I know, I know... Jonathan, he's dead.
It hurts me more than you know.
Hurts you? That's crap.
You let that poor kid believe
he gave you the syphilis.
Don't tell me I don't care.
I care.
I care.
But I do need to know what people know
self-servingly, yes.
I have to protect myself, but I also have to protect you.
And I have to protect this hospital
and a dozen other county programs.
What about protecting your staff?
What about protecting your lover?
Kerry... this is not your fault.
You understand?
It's not your fault.
But if you confess to something like it was,
people will treat you like it was.
And then everybody loses.
Did he say anything about me?
Don't worry.
He lied for you.
He loved you.
( knocking ) They're starting.
And I killed him trying to hide that for you.
Yes, you won't want to be late for that meeting.
But I will need you later for a press conference.
He was one of my staff.
Good-bye, Jonathan.
Congratulations, Kerry.
ROMANO: Hold on.
I never let rehab compromise my work schedule.
We both know administration is not your strong suit.
Should I come back later?
No, Kerry, this involves you.
How long you been planning this?
I've asked Robert to consider sharing
the Chief of Staff position with you.
I'd rather cut off my good arm.
I'm sorry you feel that way, Robert.
I thought this was a solution that served everyone.
Well, you were wrong.
It's a gift, Robert.
I suggest you take it.
Take it right up the ass.
Fine.
Congratulations, Kerry.
You've just become Chief of Staff.
No disruption of the vasculature.
No, there wouldn't be with the mechanism of injury.
What's next?
Let's see, I could cut it while slicing a bagel
and not realize it till I pass out from blood loss.
Robert.
Or maybe I could set the damn thing on fire.
( sighing )
You need to be patient.
Yes, so everyone keeps telling me.
Although none of us actually believe
I'm even going to partially recover,
do we?
Believe in the laws of karma, Elizabeth?
Eastern philosophy,
the influence of past actions on your future life.
I know what it is.
So, I can be a jerk.
So what?
I've always been honest.
Brutally honest.
Bruised some egos, hurt some feelings,
maybe, uh, provoked a few tears, but, uh...
honesty's a hell of a lot more than most people can claim.
I don't deserve this.
Hey, what time is your thing?
Uh, she's probably waiting for me right now.
Did you get your car fixed?
Yeah. One of these days, I'm going to get one that works.
So...
You know, right?
Know what?
That night at the restaurant.
I had a ring-- you knew that, right?
I figured if, if you wanted to talk about it, you would have.
I didn't go through with it because in that moment,
it just felt...
It didn't feel right, and I don't know why,
and I wish I did know why,
but I think the fact that I didn't do it
means that maybe there's something that isn't working.
I get it.
It's okay.
I got to go.
You get it?
Well, that's good.
Maybe you can explain it to me,
because I don't get it.
I know that I show up for work,
and you act like a completely changed person,
and I think that's great, if that's real.
The patch, the sponsor...
Real?
For real. For you. Or is this something
that's going to get thrown out the window
the next time something bad happens,
'cause if you're trying to prove something to me,
like some kind of quick fix...
I didn't do it for you.
I woke up sick of myself, okay?
And if you're sick of me, and, and just all of it,
I don't blame you.
I'm not sick of you.
How do you hear that?
Because all I ever do is disappoint you.
I feel like all I'm ever going to do
is disappoint you.
I don't know why... Stop, stop!
Stop with this whole routine--
this whole fatalistic black cloud,
nothing-good-is-ever- going-to-happen routine.
It's not a routine. What do I have to say?
What do I have to do to get through to you?
She needs a stable environment.
She is the one that's unstable.
Yeah, I wonder why.
Luka...
She's your daughter.
I've got this now, thank you.
Do you even give a damn?
Thank you.
Does he think that this is the first time
I've ever had to make this kind of decision with Molly?
I wish to God it was, but it's not.
Well, if she wants to come home...
Now. She's scared, she got hurt,
but what happens when we get there,
and it starts all over again?
You try harder.
I have-- a thousand times.
Maybe I am a bad mother, but I can't do it anymore.
Enjoy her when she's this age.
She's not old enough to hate you.
I was, uh, I was trying to calm the baby--
you know, with the glove, the little...
Don't worry about it.
Yeah, but he could have died.
Yup, but he didn't.
I think you're one of the best
medical students that's come through here
in a long time.
Well, the place will be lucky to have you.
A letter from me wouldn't mean much.
They only tolerate me.
Know I can burn through a shift.
Tomorrow I'll get up and do it again.
WOMAN: Have you thought
about taking some time off?
Yeah, yeah.
Maybe moving home-- I don't know.
There's a cartoon I once saw in a magazine.
A little man is sitting in a room
with two doors.
One door says "Do not enter,"
and the other door says "Do not exit."
So, um... he just sits there...
holding his hat.
We only have 15 minutes left.
Did you want to keep talking...
or do you want to get to it?
One dispo, two admits, and I am out of here.
Are you ready?
Yeah, but, uh, I wasn't going to change.
Hey, this way I go straight to the casino.
Where you can sing backup for Tony Orlando.
Who?
Never mind.
I'll meet you outside.
Okay, I'll get a cab. Okay.
Excuse me, miss, can you tell me
how to get to the cafeteria?
Uh, I'm sorry. I don't work here.
Oh.
BRIGHT: All of us at City Hall
are saddened by the loss of Keith Mitchell.
He was a bright and vibrant young man,
who had a promising future in public service.
He devoted himself to bring dignity and opportunity
to the underserved members of our community.
Even though his death was sudden unexpected and heartbreaking.
His spirit will live on through his contributions to social programs
and through the thousands of lives he touched.
All our thoughts and prayers
go out to Keith's family, to his many friends
and to all those affected by this unavoidable tragedy.
