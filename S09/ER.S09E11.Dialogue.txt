Previously on ER:
I can see his heartbeat.
Are you hoping for a boy?
I don't care.
Are you, uh, taking over now?
Yeah.
Yeah, look, I feel much better.
I don't really think I need anything
so I'm just going to tough it out.
Stick around until we are sure.
We'll get to you soon, okay?
How long was he waiting?
I'm not sure.
Luka thought he had the flu.
There was no indication of leukemia.
He presented with a simple fever.
Do you even care that that kid is lying out there
as good as dead?
Ready?
Yeah.
ANSPAUGH: Good afternoon, everyone.
Welcome to another fun-filled Morbidity and Mortality.
All right, medical record number 549274.
R.K. was a previously healthy 19-year-old male
who presented with fever, myalgias
and a temperature of 102.4.
CBC revealed a white blood count of 85,000
with 60% blasts, consistent with acute myelogenous leukemia.
The attending physician?
Dr. Kovac.
Need some help?
Nope, I got it.
You need to stay out of this room for a few days--
no paint fumes, okay?
Are you nesting?
I'm painting a room.
( chuckles ): Nesting.
Don't you have to go to work?
Chicago's toughest female fire fighter
braves burning buildings and dirty diapers.
Get out of here!
Hey!
I hope you don't treat the baby like that.
( laughter )
You drew bloods
but didn't send them for two hours.
We were swamped, and the young man looked like he had the flu.
I told her
we can't do big workups on every kid with the flu.
Something all doctors say at one time or another.
The intubation problem-- Dr. Lewis.
Because of the patient's thrombocytopenia
there was hemorrhage
in the hypopharynx; we attempted...
But could you see the cords, Dr. Kovac?
No.
Dr. Kovac felt he'd performed
an endotracheal intubation.
"Felt"?
He listened for breath sounds.
Did he use an End Tidal CO2 detector to verify?
When I walked into the trauma room...
I made a series of critical errors
including depriving the patient of oxygen.
I refused to let Dr. Lewis take over
and proceeded to put the shiley in the pre-tracheal space.
About the only thing I didn't do
was put a plastic bag over the guy's head
and hit him with a brick.
ANSPAUGH: We're not trying to assign guilt.
In a teaching hospital
we learn from complicated cases and their outcomes.
I had two hours' sleep.
I was hungover.
I should have admitted I couldn't work, but I didn't.
I was sloppy and arrogant; Abby warned me
the boy was sick
and I ignored her.
So, fire me, take my license, shoot me, whatever
but let's just not pretend there's anything to learn here.
I... I killed him.
The patient isn't dead.
Did anyone ever bother to verify
that there really are medical schools in Croatia?
Anyone?
Don't let Romano get to you-- it only encourages him.
They were more than fair.
I appreciate you standing up for me.
I told the truth.
You tried to cover for me-- you didn't have to.
It could have been any one of us.
Time to get back to work.
( sighs )
You think I still work here?
Yeah, and your shift started 20 minutes ago.
You better check with Weaver.
She just asked for you.
28-year-old Chip Mealy, insomnia times three days.
He called 911 for insomnia?
Big red taxi.
Sorry.
Also complains of obsessive thoughts.
Thanks.
What's up, Chip? Can't sleep?
I took like, five of those P.M. things-- nothing.
Can you give me something stronger?
Five over-the-counter sleeping pills?
Were you trying to hurt yourself?
No. I was trying to sleep.
You stopped sleeping three days ago-- something happen?
Problem with my girlfriend.
Ah, okay.
Sit tight, and we'll get someone to talk to you.
Can you just give me a pill?
No, you have to talk to a psychiatrist first
drugs second.
Hey, Chuny, can you call Psych for Mr. Mealy?
Sure. Thanks.
Chuny... did you get a beta HCG on Mrs. Wilkes?
No.
Why not?
( chuckles ): Because Mrs. Wilkes has a penis.
( alarm beeps )
Excuse me, come back here.
Oh, it's just my cell phone.
That's all right.
I'm just going to take a quick look.
Look, I'm Dr. Pratt.
Told you it's my cell phone.
Now, I have patients to attend to.
Let me look inside the backpack.
No, you don't need to do that.
Look, you're new here, right?
Well, doctors just get to go through.
Okay? It's not okay!
Did you hear what I said?!
Don't touch me! Hey! Hey, hey, hey!
Knock it off. It's okay. He's a doctor.
He set off the metal detector, all right?
Okay. What's the deal?
Look...
I was going to give it to a real cop.
I found it outside behind a garbage can
on my way inside.
I figured somebody must've stashed it coming in here
and planned on picking it up later, after they left.
You have a license for this?
I told you, I found it.
Well, I'm not going to leave it outside.
Sir, you're carrying a concealed, unlicensed weapon.
I'm going to have to call the Chicago P.D.
WOMAN: Got a drive-by out here. Need a doc.
Look, keep the damn gun, okay?
Hey, where's he going? Whoa, whoa, hey.
He's not going anywhere, he works here.
You got the gun; just get his name and information
leave it at that.
Ayudenos, por favor-- ayudenos.
No, no, don't move him. Que paso?
El se cayo de un arbol con la cerucha electrica en sus manos.
Airway's good. What's his name?
I don't now. I just hired them to cut down a dead tree.
What happened?
He was on a branch starting his chainsaw and he slipped.
He fell about 20 feet onto my roof.
And you just drove him in?
Why didn't you call 911?
I thought this would be faster.
Pulse is 90.
Let's get a C-collar and a backboard.
( mumbling weakly )
Todo esta bien.
Mr. Gilman complains of chest pain and shortness of breath
during sex with his wife.
Sex with his wife?
B.P. 130/82.
How old is he? 93.
One, two...
Koko?!
Dr. Kovac, could you give us a hand?
Ready?
Yeah. Go.
Koko?
She's on her way, Mr. Gilman... his wife.
Start a nitroglycerin drip; 20 mikes per minute.
Gallant.
Passing notes in class, Gallant?
Aw, it's from Harkins. She's going home today.
I've been helping her keep up with her assigned reading.
You still need me?
No.
Oh--
but could you check a post- intubation film in the ICU?
Patient's name?
Exposed bone
multiple abrasions to scalp and face.
I asked them if they knew what they were doing. ( gasping )
Do you speak Spanish?
No.
( screams )
Oh, my God, this is bad.
I have to go call my husband.
Pelvis is stable but very tender at the A.S.I.S.
Probably a fracture.
Dr. Pratt, these guys
keep insisting that we come get you.
Prep the chest and open
a 32 French. I understand
you blew off Officer Robbins, Dr. Pratt.
Later. Can't you see I'm busy?
Jerry, page ortho and surgery, and keep the militia out?
Get someone in here who speaks more Spanish than we do.
I need to speak with him.
You need to get out of here.
Okay, guys. Come on, let's go.
( moaning )
It's not what you think.
( man crying )
Chip?
Chip, it can't be that bad.
Yeah, it is.
Nobody's come to talk to you yet?
No. I just want to go to sleep.
Okay, okay. I'll see what's keeping them.
There should be a straight line from the main...
Whoa, whoa, where are you going?
What are you doing?
I never know what they mean when they say "square face."
Obviously, it's not true mathematically
but I think your face is quadrate enough
to be called square.
Sorry.
She's one of my Mathletes.
Anastasia, you're going to have to go over there
and sit with the rest of the team.
"Mathlete"?
Yeah, she's on the math team.
They compete in math tournaments.
Ah, yeah. We used to call them "geeks."
What's she on?
Tox screen hasn't come back yet.
How many cubic inches in the E.R.?
Is, uh, my face square?
Hi. I'm looking for a portable chest film on Moriguchi.
Dr. Weaver coming back up?
She's a little busy.
You should pull the tube back two centimeters.
Just write the order.
How's Kendrick doing? Who?
Teenager; presented with flu
but it was leukemia.
They think he needs
dialysis now.
Mrs. Kendrick? I'm Dr. Kovac.
I treated Rick when he first came to the E.R.
I've wanted to meet you.
( sighs )
I'm so sorry about your son.
He was such a funny kid.
He'd have been a good man.
Did he know about the leukemia?
No. By the time the tests came back, he was unconscious.
Was he afraid?
I don't think so.
As he was going under with the medicine
he, he made a joke.
He smiled and told Laura
she could sell her engagement ring if she needed the money.
That's Rick.
A little humor to get him through the day.
Dr. Kovac?
Excuse me.
Sure.
What are you doing?
Your own private M & M with the kid's mother?
She wanted to know how her son died.
One word: peacefully. Leave it at that.
She deserves to know that...
What?
What, the truth?
The truth is, you killed her son.
You going to tell her that?
The word you're looking for is "No." Come here.
Look, you want to flagellate yourself
in front of your colleagues, that's one thing
but you admit guilt to this woman, and who suffers, huh?
Huh? Not you.
What is she going to do, take your car?
Her lawyer slaps the county
and this hospital with a multi-million dollar lawsuit.
Our premiums skyrocket
and where's that money come from?
Cutbacks in personnel and essential equipment.
Affecting whom? The patients.
So... you control your emotions
or you will harm more patients than just this one.
All right, I'll tell you what.
You're off for the rest of the day.
I'm fine.
Go home. Oh-- and if I see you
with this patient's family again, you're fired.
Look, I know you're on the edge.
Not sleeping makes you feel crazy.
I know how that is, but Psych's backed up.
We can't give you any meds
until someone's seen you.
It's a liability thing
because you took pills earlier.
I know it wasn't a suicide attempt, but...
( crying ): Oh, God.
We'll get you something to help you sleep soon.
Everyone will hate me.
Why?
Why will everyone hate you?
Did you do something?
To your girlfriend?
No.
What?
What happened?
( breathing deeply )
She walked in on me.
With someone else, another woman?
No.
I don't think she realized.
Another man?
He's only ten.
Who?
Her son.
You were...
Did you do something to him?
No.
I was going to, but...
I would have, but she walked in.
I don't want to be like this.
I don't know if I could have stopped myself.
What happened?
Lost the pulse.
Still v-tach.
Charging to 300.
Bag him on 100%, push an amp of Epi.
Clear.
Got a rhythm.
Good femoral pulse.
Welcome back, Mr. Gilman.
His wife here?
Not here yet.
Maybe we should
check on her.
Make sure she survived their sexual encounter.
Dr. Weaver, your coat.
You brushed against some blood.
Get a pressure.
Keep him on lido, two migs per minute.
PRATT: Did he have any experience cutting down trees?
Are they fresh off the boat or what?
He's only been here about two weeks
but his uncle, Jose
has been in the U.S. for about three years.
Is there any family we can call for Jose?
¿Donde esta la familia de Jose?
San Felipe, Nicaragua.
We...
You're illegal. No problemo.
Problema.
Tell him anything that he needs
he can get done here, no charge.
( Chuny speaking Spanish )
Hi, Dr. Lewis again.
Listen, I know you're really backed up
but I have a patient Dr. DeRaad needs to see immediately.
No, don't put me on hold.
Hey, what are you doing?
Jerry.
Oh, that's my board.
Anastasia, no.
You've erased all our patients.
Can I write on the board, too?
Timmy, sit back down.
Why did you do this?
Ergo, God.
Ergo, Ritalin.
Your blood test says you're on Ritalin.
You took it for the math competition?
These numbers, discovered in different cultures
in different centuries, all add to zero.
Proving the universe is perfect.
Proving the existence
of God.
Hey, I can't even prove I paid my gas bill.
Jerry, just... get the charts and put all the names back up.
Make her do it.
Alphabetical, geographical or chronological?
Alphabetical's good.
Hey, do we have any wound care sheets?
So, you buying me lunch today?
No.
Hey, it's your turn.
Dr. Pratt?
What does appy stand for?
Appendicitis.
Is now a good time?
Sure.
Where'd you find the gun?
Like I told them...
...but he's unstable.
I'll walk him up myself.
Don't hang...
Chip...
Where'd he go?
Who? Your weeper?
He was just here a minute ago.
Oh, damn it.
( door opening )
Uh, excuse me.
I need the SonoSite.
I can't find the heartbeat.
Here, let me try.
How many weeks?
Fourteen. I think it...
Try a different angle.
I'm sorry.
Try again.
LOCKHART: It's not there.
Are you bleeding?
Are you bleeding?
A little.
I thought I was just spotting.
Do you want me to call your OB?
No, I think it's better if it happens naturally.
Can you get me some scrubs?
Dr. Weaver, you should go home.
Just, um, bring me some scrubs when you get a chance.
Hello, um, they brought my husband in.
Daniel Gilman.
( clipboard fumbling )
Uh, um... yeah, the 93-year-old?
Is he all right?
I'll take you to him.
Thank you.
You guys are pathetic.
What? What?
You stare any harder
her ass is going to burst into flames.
I'd put that fire out.
Stop, drop and roll.
He has a dilated cardiomyopathy.
We're going to treat it very aggressively
but the prognosis is not good.
He could have a fatal arrhythmia at any time.
Oh, Danny.
( speaking softly )
Excuse me?
When can I bang her?
What did he say?
Uh, he wants to know when he might be able to...
( clearing throat )
...have sex.
We're trying to have a baby.
Uh-huh...
Uh, when you can walk up two flights of stairs
without getting winded...
...go for it.
Okay?
( knocking at door )
NURSE: Dr. Weaver?
Yeah?
Uh, Security needs to talk to you.
I'll be right there.
Wow.
Hey, that's great.
It's my own variation of Buckminster Fuller's
geodesic dome design.
Anastasia, I told you to wait in your chair.
Sorry.
No, it's no problem.
This is, this is very cool.
Oh, um, they took Jose up to radiology
to embolize the pelvic bleeders.
Bueno.
What are you doing?
Hi. Just getting a cup of coffee.
Well, while you were in here
playing with your Lincoln logs
Security called me about Pratt
smuggling a loaded weapon...
Yeah, that was a misunderstanding.
It's an automatic suspension.
He found the gun in the bushes.
I was there when he turned it in.
You know what, the interns are
your responsibility, Carter.
All right, I know, I know.
I'm taking care of it.
It's, um, it's taken care of.
PRATT: Hey, hey!
What are you doing?!
Move!
You can't just leave him.
You didn't even pay him.
Get out of my way.
Lady, damn it, stop this car.
What do you want from me? I don't even know these men.
Stop this car!
Stop it! Hey, Pratt!
You see what I'm dealing with?
Hey, hey!
Stupid bitch!
What the hell are you doing?
What?
What?
Your patients know where she lives.
Just report her to the police.
Yeah, like they give a damn.
Like you do?
Look, you come in constantly late
you're leaving whenever
you feel like it, you're hot-dogging patients
you never follow orders and now you're
throwing rocks and bringing guns to work.
Hey, I explained about that gun.
I've seen your type before, Pratt.
No, you haven't.
You don't know anything about me.
I know what I see.
Oh, yeah? What is that?
Someone throwing their career away.
One, two, three.
Oh.
ID says Rosemary Bell, 18.
Why is she in restraints?
She was flailing and incoherent.
Witness reported she collapsed
and cracked her head.
LOC one minute.
CBC, lytes, BUN and creatinine.
Foley with dip and icon.
Pulse 122, BP's 86 systolic.
She looks kind of familiar.
I think maybe Dr. Lewis has treated her before.
Airway intact. Normocephalic.
Rosemary
follow the light.
Sats 98.
Rosemary, can you understand me?
She's deaf.
Remove the restraints.
Do you want me to go get Dr. Lewis?
Dr. Weaver?
No, thanks, Abby.
I've got this.
Um, where does it hurt?
Yeah, your head. Wait, wait, wait.
Slow down, slow down, slow down.
Your head, yes.
And your back?
Your... here?
Your kidneys?
Okay.
Burns when you pee.
What's her temperature?
103.2.
She passed out because she's septic.
Can you read lips?
Good.
We're going to take care of you, okay?
No. I don't want a lady doctor.
Jim!
Uh, it's nothing personal.
I'm sure you're very competent.
I'm just old-fashioned.
Huh. We call it sexist. Hmm.
What about Junior here?
Carter, would you like to take care
of Mr. McNulty?
In a minute.
Oh, forget it. I'm out of here.
No. Your leg's bleeding.
Let's take care of that first, okay?
You don't deserve
to call yourselves physicians.
Let him go.
Oh, Dr. McNulty, wait.
You people should be ashamed.
You've perfected a medical system
that breaks the spirit, humiliates the body
and enrages the mind.
John! Yeah, yeah.
Hey. Thank you.
You're a doctor?
I got a stethoscope older than you.
Some kids broke into our clinic for drugs.
I hid, but Mr. Former Marine decided
to take them on.
They're lucky
my sciatica was acting up
or they'd both be in traction.
They hit him on the head
with a baseball bat.
Uh, more a bunt than a full swing.
He fell on broken glass and was unconscious
for several minutes.
I was assessing my wounds.
Okay, okay, then you may be seriously hurt.
Negative Romberg.
No pronator drift.
Blunt head trauma, prolonged LOC.
Ugh...
You need a head CT. For what?
To rule out any brain injury.
I just told you, I don't have any.
Well, then, what's it going to hurt to check?
Oh, please, Jim, just get the CT.
Ten bucks says it's negative.
You're on.
Abby, this is Dr. McNulty
formally of Curtain Two.
He needs a head CT, CBC, chem seven, urinalysis.
Hey, I didn't agree to all that. Okay.
And when's the last time you had a tetanus shot?
October.
1949.
Okay, well, you might need another one.
I'll be with you in a moment.
Do you have to pee in a cup?
Yes, he does.
Okay, start peeing, count to three
pee a little bit in the cup.
Put the lid on, and then you're done.
Then, wash my hands, right?
You got it.
I'll wait for you right here.
Okay.
Did you dispo your tree trimmer without my okay?
I signed off to Chen.
I was the physician of record.
What's this?
Drunk bumsicle with a head lac.
I'm not throwing my career away.
Uh-huh.
Did you close the galea ?
Yeah. It wasn't my gun.
I was going to throw it in the river
after my shift ended.
Why didn't you do it on the way in?
I was late.
LEWIS: Titrate five of MS and get films on that ankle.
Abby, can you give me a hand with this?
Sure, in a minute.
You haven't seen my insomniac, have you?
He just went in there. Oh, thank God.
Something wrong?
No. I just thought he skipped.
What are you doing out here?
Waiting for a urine sample from a kid.
There's a kid in there?
Yeah. Oh, my God.
What? What's wrong?
What's the matter?
Chip. Chip Mealy?
JIMMY: Hey, I'm in here.
Unlock the door. What are you doing?
Are you all right?
Yeah. I got some on my hand.
That's okay. Let me take it.
Did anybody... ?
Did you see anybody else in here?
No.
Okay, go outside.
Do you want me to call Security?
No. Are you sure he came in here?
Chip?
Chip?
( crying ) Chip.
Did you do anything to him?
No.
But I wanted to.
( sobbing )
( alarms sound )
HALEH: Pressure's dropping.
Dr. Weaver, are you okay?
She's down at 80 systolic.
Give her another liter.
Amp and gent are both finished.
Okay.
( sighs )
You have a bladder infection that's spread to your kidneys.
Give her two grams
of cefotaxime.
If she doesn't perk up, we'll add dopamine.
Are you sexually active?
Well, how many partners?
And how long has it burned when you pee?
Two weeks.
Why haven't you told anyone?
Do you live with your parents?
And you don't want them to know that you're having sex?
All right.
Your parents don't need to know
but we do need to tell...
( pained sigh )
We need to tell them that you're sick.
For
at least six hours
and if the antibiotics don't work fast, it may be overnight.
It's okay, it's okay.
Haleh, take her to CT.
This could be more
than simple Pyelo. You all right?
Yeah. I'll talk to you when you get back.
Dr. Weaver, can you look at a possible erythema nodosum?
Uh, get Carter.
I think he's busy.
Then find another attending.
( sighs )
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
You can't do that in here.
Will you stop?
Don't stop!
Get off of him now. No!
For crying out loud, he just had a heart attack.
Oh, relax.
He needs his Viagra anyway.
Not while he's on nitro.
I want my Viagra!
Only if you want to die with an erection.
Are you out of your mind?
He needs to recuperate.
I was just trying to make him feel better.
Look, Mrs. Gilman, he is in critical condition.
WOMAN: What did you do to him?
My father did not give her power of attorney.
Any procedures have to be okayed by me.
These are Mr. Gilman's kids.
Bob, he is really sick.
I know.
I know, honey.
Are you treating him?
I-I'm one of the...
I want this slut of here now.
DeRAAD: I have a room full
of patients and no beds.
He'll have to get help as an outpatient.
What's wrong with his forehead?
He cut the word "evil" into his skin
to scare people away.
It's not a suicide attempt, and he hasn't hurt anyone.
Fine. Let's toss him your son.
Abby.
What? This guy needs to be kept away from children.
You can't rehabilitate child molesters.
He hasn't molested anyone.
He needs medication.
He needs to be in a regular program.
I can't commit people for thoughts.
I can't.
If this guy walks out of here
he's going to attack a child.
This is our chance to intervene
maybe save this guy, protect his future victims.
He's clearly a threat to others.
He has to say it.
If he articulates a plan, I'll put him on a hold.
He won't.
He's too frightened.
All right.
I'll talk to him again.
Their parents and the principal will meet us at the school.
Hmm. How far is Olney?
Five hours.
Uh, I think they'll sleep all the way.
( phone ringing ) Mathletes.
Oh, I take it you were never on the math team.
Oh, no. I was on a real team.
I think we called it, uh, football.
You were a jock. Ooh.
Better to be a jock than a nerd.
Are you insinuating that I'm a nerd?
Yeah, but you're a really hot nerd.
( laughs )
Phone call, Pratt.
All right.
Where's Weaver?
I need some help with this old guy's family.
Koko and Captain Viagra.
It's common knowledge that the crazier the woman
the better the sex, so just keep your head down
and try not to get stabbed in the neck.
( laughs ) Can you call Legal?
I need some help down here now.
Hello.
Yeah. No, I can't come...
Wait. Just wait right there, all right?
Just calm down, okay? I'm on my way.
You just stay right there. Jerry.
Hey, everything all right?
No, I have to leave.
Cover for me.
Wait. What? Not again.
For how long? Pratt!
( pained sigh )
Hi.
( sighs )
How long have you been cramping?
About an hour.
How much bleeding?
( sighs )
Four pads.
Okay, we need to get you upstairs.
Do you want me to call Sandy?
She's at work.
She'd want to be with you.
I can't.
I don't want to check in upstairs.
I-I don't... want it all over the hospital.
I think you need a D&C right away.
No. No, just...
page me if the OB resident comes down
for another consult.
I'm calling Maynard.
Hey, have you seen Kerry?
Yeah. She's on a break.
Where? What do you need?
I need Kerry.
Hey, what are you... ?
What are you doing?
You can't suture yourself.
I have patients waiting for me
back at my clinic.
Where did you get these supplies?
The nurse set them out for you.
45 minutes ago.
Nice eversion.
Still, can't let you do it.
GALLANT: Hey, Dr. Carter.
I can't find Dr. Weaver
and Mrs. Gilman has a special request.
My attorney's on her way over here right now.
Mattie, he wants to do it.
So do I. What?
GALLANT: Koko wants to collect semen
from her husband who is 93 and just had an MI.
Oh, he was trying to give me a baby.
Please don't debase my father any further.
He's senile.
He is not senile. He's horny.
GALLANT: Uh, Mr. Gilman
has agreed to, uh...
( clears throat )
electroejactulation.
Come again?
I'm an electroejaculation technician.
Your parents must be very proud.
I have to ejaculate him before he dies.
Otherwise, I have to do a seminal vesicle harvest.
It's much more complicated.
We want to make sure that he doesn't die.
KOKO: Well, we can still get it now.
Oh, it was always about the money
wasn't it, Koko?
If she doesn't get pregnant before he dies
she doesn't inherit anything.
Inherit? Seven million, roughly.
My husband signed a release.
I know my rights.
I want his semen.
Okay, well, what exactly is it that's, um, involved?
A rectal probe is inserted
which causes contraction
of the vas deferens seminal vesicle
and the prostate.
Called a "reflex ejaculation."
Okay, good.
Excuse me.
( clears throat )
Did you call Legal?
Oh, they're, uh...
They're sending somebody.
CHEN: Carter!
Three-story fall through skylight.
Good luck, Gallant.
How should I handle this?
Gently.
Full trauma panel, Foley and NG.
He's going to need a central line.
Decreased breath sounds on both sides.
Bilateral chest tubes. Squeeze in two of O-neg.
Type and cross for four.
He's got a dozen
deep lacerations. Bunch of pumpers.
We're going to have to clamp off
or he's going to keep leaking.
We need another doctor in here. Where's Weaver?
I don't know. Romano sent Kovac home.
Pressure's dropping.
Sats down to 82.
Okay, get Pratt.
CHEN: He left.
What?
He had an emergency again.
( laughs )
( alarms )
( crying )
Leon! Where are you, man? What... ?
( crying )
What happened to you?
Did you pass out, huh?
No, they kicked me.
They stabbed me.
They stomped on my hand.
Did you pass out, huh?
I'm dying, G.
Who did this to you? Dukey and them?
Yeah.
They wanted the gun.
They wanted to kill me.
Shh. Okay, come on, you have to be quiet.
I have to listen, all right?
They wanted it, and I didn't have it.
And I got scared.
And they got so mad at me.
Okay, okay. It was Dukey's gun, right?
And they stabbed you?
Where did they stab you, huh?
In the ass.
In the ass, G. They stabbed me.
All right, come on, come on.
We got to go to the hospital.
Come on, get up. No, no, no, no.
Where's the gun, G?
Don't worry about it.
Come on. We have to go to the hospital.
Oh, they're going to kill both of us.
Nobody's going to kill us, Leon.
They're going to kill both of us.
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
Where are we?
Don't even bother gloving up.
Time of death, 1844.
Sorry. I came as soon as I heard.
It's not your fault.
Carter, labs on your cranky old doctor.
McNulty? Thank you.
But he's M.I.A.
He's diabetic.
Get him on the phone.
He needs to come back.
He probably doesn't even know he's sick.
I tried, but I keep getting a machine.
Well, tell him his blood sugar's 435
and get him back here immediately.
And page Dr. Pratt-- 911.
I'm going to have you on the I.V.
for about another half hour.
Everything's fine.
Kerry, you should really think about...
Pelvic rest, return with abdominal pain
fever or increased bleeding.
Methedrine point two milligrams p.o. Q.I.D.
I know what to do.
I was going to say you should take some time off.
Come see me in three days.
Can I get you anything?
Mm-mmm.
Do you want me to try and call Sandy at work?
Abby?
I can give you a ride home in about an hour.
Thanks.
We were lucky to capture
that retrograde ejaculation as well.
Lucky. We're moving your husband to C.C.U.
Oh, Mattie and Bob are with him.
I have to go.
I ovulated this morning.
Let's go, we're killing spermatozoa.
Did he just say "spermatozoa"?
That man has an electroejaculator.
Electroejaculator?
Does that come with a costume?
Nope, an extension cord.
Oh, the mighty Gilman pulled through.
An inspiration to us all.
Gallant, Pratt for you.
Abby, have you ever heard of an electroejaculator?
You just like saying that word.
No. I had an instant ejaculator once.
Tommy Reynolds-- tenth grade.
Poor kid never could make it out of his jeans.
Ixnay on the jaculator-ay.
Hey, has anybody seen Pratt?
Uh, Gallant's on the phone with him.
No, look, I don't feel comfortable doing that.
I want to talk to him.
Dr. Carter wants to talk to you.
Where the hell are you?
Pratt...?
What's going on, Gallant?
I'm only going to ask you once.
( agonized yelling )
( pounding on door )
Lay on your stomach.
Lay on your stomach.
It hurts all over, G!
Gallant, what took you so damn long?
I can see I clearly got through to you
earlier today.
Running a little clinic out of the apartment?
Come on, man.
Who's hurt?
It's my brother, Leon.
LEON: Who are you?
G...?
Don't worry; he's a doctor, too.
He looks like he should be in the hospital.
LEON ( sobbing ): Not me; I hurt there.
Calm down, calm down.
We're not going anywhere.
Just calm down. ( groaning )
Listen, we're staying right here.
Either you're going to help or you're not.
This is... not smart, Pratt.
Everything in my life
is not smart, Carter.
How long ago did you get hurt?
PRATT: Three hours ago, but he's okay.
Gunshot?
Stab wound.
Also fractured fourth and fifth metacarpals.
He's got broken ribs
a bloody nose, but no septal hematoma.
Listen to me.
Um... I'm good.
I got this.
I mean, you can go now.
All I needed was a suture kit.
Why don't you want to go to the hospital?
You don't want the assault reported?
They going to kill us.
PRATT: Nobody's going to kill us.
Let it go.
Why did you get beat up?
I didn't have the gun when they asked for it.
We got to get it back, G.
They want it!
Holding the gun for someone else, huh?
My friends.
( yelling )
Some friends.
( Leon groaning )
I'm a danger to myself and others.
If you went home, what would you do?
I don't know.
Chip, you have to tell him exactly what you would do.
Stop coaching him.
Where are you going?
I have patients.
Chip, listen to me right now.
If you don't tell the truth
we can't help you.
This is your last chance.
I'm picking up my ex- girlfriend's son from school...
and having sex with him in my car
behind the baseball field... as soon as I leave here.
( sobbing )
Okay, I'll make room for him.
( crying )
How are you feeling?
Good. Did you call your parents?
They're going to worry about you.
What did she say?
Uh, "They'll worry about me more
if they know I have a boyfriend."
What?
She doesn't want to disappoint them
more than she already has by being deaf.
No, you can't go home.
You have to stay here
tonight.
No calls.
Why was I a patient?
You saw me.
( sighing )
I was...
( soft, stifled sobs )
( anguished sobbing )
Leon, he's your brother?
No.
Well, yeah... kind of.
He came to live with me and my mom
when he was nine.
I was six then.
I idolized him.
Then when I was 15, my mom died of liver cancer
and Leon took care of me.
Made sure I went to school.
So, when I was in college
one day he got into a fight in a bar in Detroit.
Believe me, this is one tough son of a bitch.
I'm trying to tell you, I mean, he survived
a nine-millimeter bullet to the brain.
But in turn
his I.Q. dropped about 40 points.
Do you have any help?
No. I've been doing it on my own for years.
I'm good at that.
Well, we work as a team.
We cover for each other.
We lean on each other.
The job's too big to do solo.
But if you can't get that...
maybe you should be a surgeon.
Or a superhero, or something else
that doesn't require trusting people.
I've never been big on trust.
You know what that turns into?
Nobody trusts you either.
Look, self-sufficiency is a good thing
but it's not the only thing.
Asking for help when you need it...
that doesn't make you weak.
Um, maybe I should go inside now.
All right.
