Previously on ER:
CARTER: I want to help you.
You want to fix me?
No, I want it to work.
Yeah, well, I'm not broken.
I'm Glass Half-Full, I'm Silver Lining Girl
I'm an optimist.
Um... I guess I do
get a little blue sometimes.
CARTER: Gallant, what did I just tell you about Stella?
I still need to rule out ..., don't I?
Yes. Do it.
Get her out of here.
Screen her before she presents with something else.
She's going to suck him dry.
Yes, she is.
Time of death: 7:36 A.M.
Oh, your fish coded?
Yup, third time this week.
Every afternoon I restock the little pond here
and every morning, it's like the Exxon Valdez blew through.
Why don't you get somebody else to do this for you?
No, I'm committed now.
Committed fish killer.
Don't, don't, don't, don't...
Thank you.
Been meaning to cut down on my caffeine.
How come I have to wait out here now?
Uh, so you won't kill us.
I never even touched you.
Whose idea was this, anyway?
Hospital Beautification Committee.
Years to get a decent security system.
Two weeks to get an aquarium.
Yeah, metal detectors, bulletproof glass.
We'll all be much safer.
Gang go out again last night?
It's not a gang; it's a club.
Not another stage-diving incident, I hope.
First rule of girls' club
is you don't talk about girls' club.
You're not going to tell me
what you did? The usual.
Crank calls, pillow fights, lesbian experimentation.
They're going live in a minute.
We need your outlet.
What channel is it on?
Four, and you guys are going to keep it down
once we're rolling, right?
Nothing new on the board, huh?
It's been three hours since we had a real patient.
Five hours since the last ambulance run.
What's that all about?
Mission General reopened.
Oh, don't sound so depressed.
I'm waiting on some action.
When I was in school
we ate dried eel and bitter almond.
Uh, I think I'll live with the headache.
CARTER: Eel?
Yeah, for Susan's hangover.
Ah. Kudzu.
PRATT: What?
Asian root; you make a tea with it.
Hair of the dog that bit you.
Yeah, it feels like a pack of dogs
and they all had a Mexican tag.
Thank you for getting me home.
I'm so sorry about your shoes.
Wow, sounds like some party.
They're starting.
MAN: Okay, folks, a little quiet.
We're coming
to you from the ambulance bay
of County General Hospital.
( everybody laughing )
We've asked Dr. Kerry to demonstrate
how easy it can be to get your flu shot.
SUZY: Tell us, Dr. Kerry, any risks associated with this?
Yes. You may experience some mild flu-like symptoms
muscle ache, low fever
but it's really a very safe prophylactic measure.
Now, a week or more of misery is a lot worse
than one little shot, isn't it, Dr. K?
Yes, and that's why we recommend
flu shots for the elderly, those with chronic illnesses
and anyone taking care of or exposed to sick people.
Wow, that was like butter.
So... what's the other one for?
Tell me she didn't forget to switch needles.
She forgot to switch needles.
Pretty nice setup you got here.
Ought to keep the riffraff out.
So, how did you manage to score
opening day triage duty?
You know, I'm thinking some nice doctor
put in a good word for you.
Mmm, I hate triage.
Nothing to do, Pratt?
I'm orienting Lola.
Mona.
Melanie Shepherd?
Yes.
Take you in now.
Mommy, Mommy...
I'll be back in a minute, hon.
He can come if you want.
No, we'll wait here.
Bobby, come over here.
Where's Mommy going?
Stop whining and sit down.
When can we go home?
I want to go home.
What, are you a baby, huh?
Is this what big boys do?
( whimpering )
Hey, shut up!
( whimpering )
Mommy's not going to get any better
if you don't knock it off.
Excuse me, sir, do you need anything?
No, not anymore, thanks.
( whimpering ): I want Mommy.
I want Mommy.
Hey, hey.
If you do not shut up...!
Sir, look, I don't mean to interrupt you...
Then don't, okay, pal?
You're real helpful now.
Where were you three hours ago when we got here?
( crying )
Stop it.
I said stop it.
Are you a baby? Huh?
See you almost earned yourself
a badge there, Mikey.
Excuse me?
I'm guessing Eagle Scout.
Look, I didn't want to make it any worse than it was.
Well, did you make it any better?
At least I tried.
Karate-- really?
but I want something a little more aggressive.
Oh, so, you like it rough, huh?
A gun to the head brings out the fighter in a girl.
Oh, so, now you're showing off.
Gallant, your girlfriend's asking for you.
Girlfriend?
Stella Willits, 45
frequent flyer, going on 60, with a borderline personality.
Yes, that sounds about right.
Asking for Michael Gallant, M.D.
I've had to see her four times in the last week.
Well, you're doing an excellent job.
Get her exam going.
I'll be there in a minute.
The tests are just a precaution.
They should take about an hour.
And then I'll know if she infected me with anything.
Don't be such a jerk.
She used to date a bisexual.
He wasn't a bisexual.
He was just open-minded.
Great, I'll, uh, be back when the results are in.
You wanted to do the freaking medical spot.
Shut up, Leland.
You shut up! No, you shut up.
No, you shut up! Shut up!
Is anyone aware that according to this
there aren't enough nurses on duty
to reach the maximum patient- to-nurse ratios?
LEWIS: I'll take a look at it.
And there's not even an MICN scheduled for Friday.
Randi, get Haleh on the phone.
She's off today.
I don't care. She's the Nurse Manager.
Nope. She resigned in September.
Well, have they appointed a replacement?
Yeah. She resigned last week.
Why wasn't I informed of this?
Because you haven't been around that much.
Dr. Weaver
your makeup looked great.
Abby.
Could you come by my office later?
Sure. Dr. Romano's office?
1:30. Why?
Let's make it 2:00.
GALLANT: Breathe in deep.
( breathing deeply )
Good. Again.
( breathing deeply )
I gave up cholesterol, Michael, after our little talk.
You'll thank me later.
I'll thank you now.
CARTER: Find anything?
Some chest pain
reproducible by palpation.
Hey, you know Howdy Doody?
You look like Howdy Doody.
Thanks.
I hate Howdy Doody.
Sorry to hear that, Miss Willits.
Call me Stella.
It means "star," you know.
Listen, what I'm concerned about is her dyspnea on exertion.
My what?
Uh, it's your shortness of breath.
Congestive heart failure?
Or her lungs are dry.
It could be symptomatic ischemia.
Flat T waves in her lateral leads.
Yeah, but I'd still recommend O2, aspirin
nitropaste, and a cards consult.
She should go upstairs for monitoring.
I think that might be
a little premature.
Why don't we send off some enzymes?
Get her old chart
take a look at her previous 12 lead.
If the changes are acute?
Have Cardiology come down.
So
you going to run some tests now?
Yes, ma'am.
Can I go out and grab a smoke first
How long have you been retired, Thomas?
I ain't retired. I'm not.
Oh.
A nurse's work is never done.
Thank you.
How's the hangover?
Oh, I'm going with aspirin
and caffeine.
Ow! Sorry.
Yeah.
Abby said it was a good time.
Don't worry, she hasn't cheated on you
since that stripper named Thor.
I can be concerned, right?
Don't be. He was wearing an American flag thong.
No, I mean about her drinking.
Did I bring my lunch?
We'll get you something.
I'm the one who barfed.
Yeah, but she's the alcoholic.
It's not easy to stay in the program
when you're out bar hopping.
Uh, "the program"?
Yeah, I thought you knew.
Would you take Mr. Evans upstairs to CT?
She doesn't drink that much.
I never even thought about it.
What's "not that much"?
Well, if you're worried, you should talk to her.
Carter, films are back on your patella fracture.
What's wrong?
Nothing. The same one?
Oh, what's the best way to rule out PE--
a spiral CT or a VQ scan?
( chuckling )
Okay, I'm only going to say this once.
I hate surprise parties.
Carter assumed I was in the loop.
What loop?
The drinking loop.
Oh...
He's concerned... which I think is very sweet.
I'm, I-I didn't want you to feel weird about it.
It's none of my business.
And I just wanted us to have a good time.
I understand.
It's not like I'm, I'm...
It's between you and Carter.
I'm sorry he got you into it.
No, it was an accident.
He thought I knew.
Yeah. Well, it's, it's not like it's a big secret, either. It's...
( clattering )
( sighing softly )
Kerry.
Susan.
Abby.
You don't think she could be... No chance.
That's what it looked like. Weaver?
The straightest gay woman since Janet Reno?
I don't think so. Yeah, you're right.
She was probably just practicing
her flu shot technique.
Yeah, she could use the practice.
My turn now?
Not yet.
When is my turn?
Later.
I was here before.
Go back to your seat, Phil.
( sighs )
We should have left him in Triage.
The other patients were complaining.
Abby--
the junkie in Four fell out of bed and lost his IV.
Okay, I'll be right there.
Listen...
it's just not something I talk about much.
We're friends, Abby.
If you want to talk, you know where I am.
And if not, that's okay, too.
Thank you.
So, did you get some meat loaf
this trip, Miss Willis?
I'm a vegan now.
Good for you.
It's a simple case of costochondritis.
Look, I think the DOE could be
her anginal equivalent.
Or it could be simply be
that the only exercise the old bird gets
is lifting a match to her cigarettes.
Send her home on Naprosyn. Do you still work here?
Last time I checked.
Shouldn't we be concerned with the progressive dyspnea?
When you become an actual doctor, Mr. Gallant
then you can make the diagnosis.
Just thought you might want to monitor her in cardiology.
You know, I don't know why your student
calls me in for a consult
and then refuses to accept my advice.
He's just trying to be thorough.
She's had ten unnecessary admissions for rule-out MI
in the last two years alone
and she has always had flat T-waves.
Next time, check the records.
I did. Ah--
then you know I already cathed her.
So much for thoroughness.
Did you check the chart?
No, there is no record of a cath in there.
I looked at volumes eight and nine, everything since 2000.
Maybe he cathed her before that.
Well, a lot could have changed since then.
Well, if he won't admit her, there's not much we can do about it.
Dr. Carter, can we keep her for observation?
No, we cannot; we don't have any beds.
We've got ten patients waiting.
She needs to be on a monitor.
Do you have a minute?
Yeah, I can give you two.
The best we can do is park her in the hall
until a bed opens up--
until her Treponin comes back from the lab.
I talked to Susan.
Hey, Abby, 11-year-old girl with possible UTI.
Okay, I'm coming.
HARMS: A little help, folks?
Unidentified Latino found seizing at a phone booth.
Head atraumatic.
Pulse ox 99, glucose 110, GCS five on scene.
Dude's post-ictal
but he's got a good DBI. DBI?
Dirt Ball Index. Big dog, lots of tattoos.
Oh, so he's going to be all right
'cause he's got tattoos?
Good guys die, bad dogs walk.
This one looks like he's going to be okay.
He's got a little abrasion to his chin.
No prison tats; too bad, they count double.
He's military.
Sats 98, BP 110/76.
MAN: I don't know if I'm supposed to.
Slow down. Sorry about that.
It's all right, Thomas, it's all right.
Now, how about that signature?
Margaret usually signed.
Yes, well, she can't right now
that's why I need you to do it.
Dr. Corday, she's waking up.
Oh, okay.
Thomas, I want you to stay right here for a moment, okay?
Third unit going in.
Have them hold the FFP until we're upstairs.
Margaret... Margaret
I'm Dr. Corday. You were in an accident.
Is Thomas okay?
Yes, he's fine
but you've suffered a splenic laceration
and your husband feels unable to sign the consent
for your surgery.
Operation? I can't.
There is some risk involved, but it needs to be done.
I can't stay in bed so long.
He couldn't cope without me.
I'm sure he'll make do.
He's has Alzheimer's.
Well, you shouldn't be incapacitated very long
but you need to sign this so we can help you.
Please.
Can't we just wait and see?
Margaret... splenic fractures can form clots
that may hold for awhile, but if the clot breaks
you might bleed to death before we can fix it.
Meds are in.
P.E.R.R.
What?
Pupils equal, round, and reactive. ( chuckles )
Airway's good.
Gato, you okay, man?
We've given him some medication
to prevent him from having seizures.
So, has he been sick recently?
We were out late last night going hard
but he seemed fine.
We just got back on leave.
He hasn't even seen his girl yet.
Nothing involved besides alcohol, right?
Coke, Ecstasy?
Just beer and bourbon.
No liberty stunts, right?
How's that?
He shows signs
of toxicity; you guys
didn't play any pranks on him, did you?
Roofies, Quaaludes?
Hey, he's our buddy, all right?
Look, easy, Sergeant; we just need to be sure.
We wouldn't do that. Okay.
You guys can wait in the hall.
Gallant
send off a Dilantin level in 15 minutes.
Got it.
( coughs )
So, you guys are rangers?
75th Regiment, Special Forces Group.
Where are they taking him?
He needs a CT to check for any sign of a tumor
or intercranial bleeding.
So, you guys see any action?
Nothing to talk about.
I did a summer duty down at Fort Houston a few months back.
You Army?
Yeah, Medical Corps.
Why are you here?
I'm finishing med school.
( scoffs ): Must be rough.
We spent the last three months jumping out of Blackhawks
on the Pakistani border.
Hey, let us know when our buddy's back.
It burns when she pees
she's achy and sick to her stomach.
Low-grade fever.
I think it's from the trip.
On vacation?
No, just a weekend away.
We're supposed to go to the Shadd Aquarium.
Has she had any UTIs before?
Yeah, a bunch.
It usually clears up with antibiotics.
Her doctor gave us some Bactrim
but I left it in Milwaukee.
Okay, let's dip a urine.
I don't want a catheter, okay?
You're the boss.
So, what kind of accent is that?
What accent?
Come on, where are you from?
Um, I don't think you've heard of it.
Place called "Idaho."
( chuckles )
Well, that explains it.
You like potatoes?
Who doesn't? Mom...
I'm hungry.
Oh, okay. Let me, uh... go get you a sandwich.
Here you go, Abby.
Why are you giving me this?
Next Friday, I need it off.
Oh. Well, I'd like a month in the Bahamas.
I'll settle for a long weekend at my cousin's.
Jerry, are the labs back on my UTI girl?
No. But look-- I made origami.
It's a swan.
No, it's not.
I think it is.
Then we should hang it on the refrigerator
next to your report card.
Thanks, Mom, you're the best.
Hello.
We are waiting for your labs.
I got bored in there, there's too many sick people.
Mmm. Where's your mom?
She went to the cafeteria.
To get food?
That's not a good idea.
We were supposed to do all this fun stuff today.
I wanted to see the aquarium.
The aquarium?
Really?
Well, you should have said so in the first place.
Hey, Abby, open room?
Try Exam Two.
How was his CT?
It was all clear.
Hey, what's going on, Stella?
Nicotine fits are a bitch.
Hey, look, we're checking on a bed for you, okay?
How about a decent cup of coffee?
How's he doing?
There's no sign of a tumor; that's good.
What's up with his mouth?
We gave him a charcoal slurry to soak up any drugs
that might be in his GI tract.
Look, I already told you guys...
Look, there's something toxic
in your buddy's system, okay?
We're just trying to fix him up.
Hey.
How you feeling, bro?
( breathing weakly )
Perk?
Hey, man.
Who's that?
It's Sammo.
Hey, is-is Elena here?
No, we called her, she wasn't home.
Where are we? I'm Dr. Gallant.
Felix, you're in County Hospital.
Hey, my eyes... are my eyes open?
Shut up, fool.
No, I can't see you.
Cut it out.
No, I can't see anything!
Okay, okay, hold still.
Okay, uh, bring me a scope, page Optho, find Carter.
Not quite the Shadd Aquarium
but it's the best we got.
You could be overfeeding them.
Do you think the water smells weird?
Or someone else could be.
Or maybe it's just our funny way of warning people
they're entering the house of death.
Are you really a good nurse?
( sighs )
I'm technically proficient
despite certain attitude issues.
Well, then maybe I should have stayed in Milwaukee.
Is that where your dad is?
He moved away.
My parents are getting divorced.
Sorry.
It sucks big-time.
Mmm.
Well, you know, you get to double up on presents, right?
Christmas, and your birthday.
I guess.
Then there's always the fun
of playing one against the other.
Well, actually, I did that before, anyway.
Now I just live with my mom.
You know, moms can be cool.
I grew up with just a mom.
And it was good?
Yes.
Have you seen Phil?
No.
Her labs aren't back?
Not yet.
Whatever she says about pet care
disregard.
Yeah, I kind of got that idea.
Thanks.
Hey, Ken
where do you keep the oral contrast?
What, did you lose a drunk again?
Try the hall.
Oh... uh...
( clears throat ): ...excuse me.
( sighs )
I, uh, misplaced an x-ray.
Did you find it?
I've checked everywhere.
Boy, I keeping walking through the wrong doors today.
Luka and UTI mom?
Yeah. Is this kind of thing
normal in Croatia?
Oh, yeah.
They call it alternative medicine.
( laughs )
I'm not supposed to laugh.
It's a patient's mother.
Where did you find them?
In the storage closet in radiology.
That's so strange.
Neuro's so much more cozy.
Is that what you two were like?
No. We stuck to beds mostly.
Too bad.
I think you should talk to him.
Me? Forget it. You know him better.
You walked in on him.
I'm not the sex police.
Do we have the labs back on Hernandez?
Optho can't give a good assessment
until we've identified the cause of vision loss.
Here you go.
What's his blood alcohol level?
None detected.
I'm going for coffee.
Does anybody want anything?
Uh-uh.
No, I'm good. Thanks.
No methanol or ethanol in his system.
What about tricyclics? Tox screen's negative.
Well, I did think of something else.
There's an antimalarial used in the service.
Quinine.
Yeah. Something he might
have access to, and it wouldn't
be detectable in a tox screen.
He'd have to take a lot of quinine
to get that sick.
I know.
You want me to talk to him?
No.
Why don't you let Gallant handle it?
Mm.
Give it your best shot, Mikey.
( chuckling )
You may actually come see Milwaukee sometime.
Yeah, I hear they have good beer.
( chuckling )
You're very informed
about U.S. regional consumables.
Excuse me, Dr. Kovac?
Yeah.
Um, I'll be back when her labs are in.
Yeah, okay.
Can we discharge this patient?
They've been here for over four hours.
Yeah, we're still waiting on a chem seven.
I saw the chart. It looks like a simple UTI.
I'm concerned about vesicoureteral reflux.
Luka, come on.
What?
Well, let's clear this patient
as soon as possible.
Her workup is not finished.
Well, her mother's is.
And unless you have unusual stamina
there's no further reason to keep them here.
The girl's at risk for renal insufficiency.
( sighs )
Okay, what I'm trying to say is
that when you're waiting on a patient's results
it's not necessary for you to boff
that patient's mother in the storage closet.
Oh.
Get the labs back.
Write a scrip.
Dispo the girl.
Chemistries on your little girl.
Is she a renal patient?
Oh.
She is now.
Did my girl call back?
Not yet.
I guess she won't then.
How's your vision?
I'm starting to see shapes.
You get my peepers going, I'll be fine.
So, you were in the Philippines, right?
Before Pakistan, yeah.
You ever hear of quinine?
What about it?
The service gives it out
to prevent malaria.
So?
It also induces blindness
when ingested in large quantities.
Maybe they gave me too much overseas.
This would have been something you ingested
in the last 12 hours, Felix.
Maybe because you found out something
when you got home.
Like about your girl maybe.
You don't know anything about me.
Look, I know that when you're in combat
home is the only thing that keeps you going.
Okay, you want everything to be the same
when you get back.
Are you a shrink or a doctor?
Only it's not, and it's like what's the point?
Felix, man, to make you better
I got to know what made you sick.
When you're in country
it's easy to forget that life keeps going.
Sometimes without you.
Elena?
She waited for me a long time.
I guess she got tired of waiting.
Just fix me up, okay?
Just fix it.
All right.
We'll get you some bicarbonate to, uh...
( clears throat )
...eliminate the toxins.
And I'll, uh, get somebody down here to talk to you.
I'm Special Forces.
This gets out, I'm through.
Look, Felix, I'm-I'm concerned about getting you healthy.
It was a split second.
Please.
Okay. Um...
( clears throat )
If I can put you in touch with a clinic...
I'll do the counseling, I promise.
Look, I'll follow it up, Felix.
You won't have to.
I'll be okay this time.
Hey, have they croaked yet?
Your fish?
Honey.
I'm much better with human patients.
You must not be a Pisces.
Okay, just for that
you're getting meat loaf for lunch today.
JANET: Oh, we were wondering where you went.
Marlene's blood tests
are back.
They show a high creatinine level consistent
with chronic renal failure
and we need to send her for an ultrasound.
But I thought you said it didn't look like anything.
No. It's still not clear.
That's why we need to image the kidneys
and bladder. A renal ultrasound is fast.
It's very easy, and it'll help us
figure out what the problem is.
But I thought it was just an infection.
That's what we were hoping for.
And...
it's completely painless
so you don't have to be afraid of anything.
Well, that's as long as I'm not a fish.
( laughing ): That's right.
Ready to go for a spin?
It's okay, Mom. They're just going
to take some pictures. Okay.
You better call Dad. All right.
Hey, can you pop a wheelie again?
Sure, if you'll hold on tight. Okay.
Should I be scared?
It won't make it any easier.
It's going to be like a ride, right?
Kind of.
I bet you say that to all the kids.
( laughs )
Can I have some Brevital in two?
Sure.
Dislocated elbow?
Mm-hmm.
How long you on for?
I have to stick around for the shift change.
I can hang around.
How does, uh...
a couple of burgers, some shakes
and maybe see if you get lucky sound?
I haven't had an offer that good
since the eighth grade.
Yeah, but I'm treating.
13-year-old girls never treat.
In boarding school they do.
Well, make me a counter-offer.
Are you, uh...
out of Brevital?
Only Versed.
Plus 200 of Fent.
We going to talk about this?
Carter?
I got a patient waiting.
Okay, is this, uh, "backing off"
because if I get to choose, I prefer "butting in."
Yeah, I think I took care of that this morning.
Who? I think I blew your cover.
I don't care about that. Then what?
I just want us to be clear, that's all.
Well, I think it's pretty clear.
My time sheet.
Why are you giving me that?
You're the Nurse Manager, right?
No, I'm not.
Oh, uh, guess again. Memo from Weaver.
What?
Weren't you supposed to see her today?
Yeah, I kind of dodged that.
Oh, funny how that happens.
I had rounds.
You kids fighting?
Shut up, Jerry.
You should talk to her.
What? I'm just
trying to help navigate love's wavy waters.
What do you people have against paper?
Hey, Jerry, what's the guard there for?
Uh, psych hold.
What? Why?
The guy's suicidal.
They're moving him up to a locked ward.
Do you have his chart?
Yeah, it's right here.
Where's Pratt?
Try Curtain two.
I'll be right back, Mr. Geary.
Don't throw up just yet.
Do you know where Dr. Pratt is?
Uh, Exam one with the Valium OD.
PRATT: ABG results?
MALIK: Yeah, it's on the clipboard.
You re-did the Hernandez chart?
Get RT to drop to 80%
and check her gas in an hour.
Because you marked it accidental.
So what?
So?
Nobody takes that many pills
without meaning to off themselves.
Look, that was not your call to make.
What's your problem, brother man?
I'm trying to watch your back.
You know, I have a lot of brothers.
I don't need another one.
Don't need a malpractice suit, either.
Why are you always riding me?
You need to learn when to stick up for yourself.
( scoffs )
I told Kayson what I thought.
You didn't make him hear you.
Look, okay, you know what?
I do things
the way I do things, okay?
You and me-- we're different.
No, no, no. We're not that different.
We're both trying to fit in here.
The only difference is that I'm doing it
by being a man.
Hey, Gallant, Stella's crashing.
Come on, Stella.
Watch it. Hey, help me get her up.
Watch it, watch it!
One, two, three.
( grunting )
GALLANT: Come on, Stella, wake up.
Gal's looking a little white.
Abby go get a crash cart.
Shouldn't we move her to a room?
Get a cart. Start compressions.
GALLANT: Come on, Stella, wake up.
Wake up.
What was her diagnosis? Unstable angina.
Shouldn't she have been on a monitor?
CARTER: Gallant, take the paddles.
Pardon me. Excuse me. V-fib.
Charging to 200. Clear.
LOCKHART: No change.
300.
Clear.
Jerry, page Kayson.
Okay, should we push epi?
You really want to do this here?
CARTER: Can you start a line? Carter.
Uh, all right, yeah, let's move her.
Go, go, go, go, go!
Come on, man.
Come on, man, we got to roll.
Out of the way, everybody.
Watch it, watch it.
Lidocaine's on board.
Second bolus of 50 going in.
Still V-fib. 360 again.
LOCKHART: Charged. Clear.
Resume compressions.
Hang a gram of Pronestyl?
You should push it. He's right.
Decreased breath sounds on the left.
You put the tube in
too far.
22 centimeters at the lips.
It's in the right mainstem.
I just put the balloon past the cords.
Pull it back to 20.
That might pull it out.
Just do it. Ah, the girl who cried wolf.
PRATT: V-fib arrest.
How long she been down?
CARTER: 12 minutes. Charge to 360.
Charged and ready.
Clear.
Dermabond looks good.
That's nice.
CT?
Negative.
Negative? Is that okay?
You're fine, Thomas
but we had to remove Margaret's spleen.
She has some liver damage.
It caused a lot of bleeding
and for a while
her blood pressure was very low.
Hmm. Oh, that's not good.
No. We had to put her on a breathing machine.
A ventilator.
We're not sure when she'll be able to come off it.
Oh, dear.
Would you like to go and see her?
I can take you up.
See who?
Margaret, your wife.
My wife couldn't come today.
Yes, Thomas.
She's upstairs.
Margaret.
Margaret? Margaret who?
Thomas, do you remember why you're here?
Oh, I remember.
I remember everything.
GALLANT: Charge to 360.
LOCKHART: Good to go. Clear.
( zap and flatline alarms )
Asystole. Okay.
It's been 39 minutes.
360 again.
360!
It's done.
Call it.
Time of death, 16:57.
Is there any family we need to talk to?
Uh... nobody.
She didn't have nobody.
Frequent flyer with atypical presentation.
99 times out of 100
nothing happens to this patient.
You go with the odds.
If you like to gamble.
Sometimes there's nothing else you can do.
You'll learn that soon enough.
Progressive symptoms of, uh, dyspnea
suggesting cardiac ischemia.
Gallant.
I let you miss the signs.
She was a batty
self-medicating hypochondriac.
Who you did not feel like dealing with.
Let it go now.
If she had been admitted
we could have picked up the V tach.
We could have gotten her back with early cardioversion.
If you felt that strongly
about it, maybe you should
have spoken up. He tried to.
Is anyone to talking to you?
Dr. Kayson, with all due respect
you're the Chief of Cardiology.
Gallant is a fourth year medical student.
Exactly, and I offered him my expertise and guidance.
And what did it get me?
What did it get her?
Nothing!
She is dead!
Easy, son.
I am not your son.
Pratt, take him for a walk.
Come on, let's go.
All right.
PRATT: You said everything.
Are you training doctors or pit bulls?
You're pissed off, that's okay.
He's upset with her loss. Maybe you should
have put her on a monitor.
Maybe you should have paid
a little bit more attention.
Patient care is all about taking calculated risks.
Go and fight the man?
I thought it was about
taking care of the patient.
Let it go, and learn from it.
GALLANT: Get up off me. I'm on your side.
It's really something
the way you guys stick together down here.
Mikey, listen, what you did in there--
that was a man.
That's what being a man is.
Come here, listen to me.
Guys, come on. CARTER: Let's all calm down.
Oh.
Do not call me Mikey.
Lucky I know how to take a punch.
So that's what you were doing on the floor.
Hey, how's that feel?
You should see the other guy.
Maybe I should go talk to him.
I'd wait a bit on that.
WEAVER: Susan, can you get the nursing schedules together
for Abby to work on.
I was hall monitor for a day in fifth grade
and they fired me for selling passes to the other kids.
Well, I'm sure you've matured since.
Not that much, really.
It's my understanding that the position comes with a raise.
It's not the money.
If it was about the money why would I be working here?
Look, the Director of Nursing is on board with my recommendation.
The job is yours, like it or not.
"Like it or not"?
I don't care to argue about it.
Okay, how much?
Excuse me?
How much is the raise?
I'll get back to you.
LEWIS: Kerry.
Romano sent this.
What'd it say?
"Your 15 minutes is up."
( chuckling )
Hey, Pratt wants you to hit him on the other side of his face
kind of even it out.
You know, she had a daughter who died in a car crash
and she's been alone since then.
You know, Kayson knows what happened in here today.
Yeah, he was right, I backed down.
That's not how I saw it.
Well, I always back down.
We're supposed to be saving people's lives
and sometimes it just seems like
we end up fighting each other.
I mean, I should...
I should have fought for her.
I could have tried harder with Kayson, too.
Nah, she was my patient.
You know, she trusted me.
And she'd be alive now
if I wasn't so scared of being wrong.
Everybody gets scared.
Not Pratt.
( chuckles )
Sure he does.
Why do you think he acts so cocky all the time?
Everybody that comes in here does
but you learn to work through it.
And when does that happen?
As soon as you've killed a patient.
Well, I just did.
No, you didn't.
Maybe you won't have to.
Don't stay in here for too long.
Marlene's ultrasound came back positive
for bilateral renal scarring.
Are her kidneys shot?
I don't know.
She definitely needs surgery.
All those UTIs back in Milwaukee
and nobody ever caught it?
( sighs )
Yeah.
Somebody should have.
VCUG first?
Let's start her on Gentamycin.
And the moral of the story is...
Never sleep with a patient's mother.
At least not until the labs are back.
Oh...
You know, a little girl's sick.
Next to that, nothing much matters.
Yeah.
Janet? Yeah?
Can I speak to you?
Hey, Chuni, can you do me a favor and mix me a bag of Gent?
Sure, what room?
I'll take it there if you just get me started.
All right. Thanks.
Hey.
Hey.
I thought you were on till 7:00.
Deb's covering the shift change.
I'll call you later.
Okay, hey.
I'm not really sure what we're not talking about.
Can't this wait until we're both off duty?
Who's angry at who?
I'm not angry at you.
Okay, and I never lied to you.
Well, then I guess I must have talked myself into something.
Well let's figure it out.
No, I agreed not to rescue you
or help you or fix you
so I'm just going to shut up
and wait for the car wreck.
Wait a minute. What is that supposed to mean?
Come on, Abby, we both know where this is going.
No, I don't.
And, you know, everything would have been fine
if you had just come to me...
in the first place.
Well, then I'm the overprotective boyfriend.
ABBY: You know, I'm not drinking to get drunk.
I'm hardly drinking at all.
Good night.
Okay, wait.
Do you want to know how much I've been drinking?
Last night I had two beers.
Wednesday I had a cosmo.
Last week I had nothing.
The week before that
I had a beer and a pink drink.
I don't know what it was.
You're keeping very close track.
Yeah, because it's under control.
Well... I just don't understand
why you'd want to go back to that?
I was drinking last year, you knew that.
Well, it was a little different then.
Yeah, now it's not about being scared and alone.
It's still drinking.
Look, look, wait.
I used to drink because I was miserable.
I was in a lousy marriage
and a life I didn't want, and now I'm happy.
With you, things are good.
And being able to have a casual drink with my friends
just makes me feel like I'm past the bad part.
Okay.
You know, maybe...
maybe I just have a little bit more faith in me than you do.
Oh, is that how you translate my concern--
as not having faith?
I don't know.
Yeah.
Carter.
Forget it, let's not do this.
All right, look, I'm a pro at walking away.
I've done it one million times
and I'm asking you, please, don't do this.
Stay here and talk to me.
CHEN: Uh, what about the girl in one?
LOCKHART: Alisha Murphy, she's off the vent.
And the guy in two?
He's still puking up his shrimp platter.
Oh, uh, mm.
KOVAC: A transplant would only be a last resort.
I should, um...
I should call my husband.
There's a phone right there.
I'm sorry.
Could I have some privacy, please?
Yeah, sure.
Hello there.
If you want to know what I want for my last meal
the answer's pizza.
Well, your kidney is sick.
We're going to give you some medicine
to help stop the infection
then the doctors are going to figure out
exactly what they need to do to make it better.
How did I get like this?
It's a genetic condition, probably.
From my parents?
A combination of their DNA.
Maybe that's why.
They had a fight one night and my dad left.
They never told me why, they just gave up.
Well, I'm sure it seemed that way.
I think they made a mistake.
Maybe the reason I'm sick is so I can bring them back together.
I'm going to give you some medicine...
in your vein.
Might sting a little bit.
I'm not scared.
I really think this could fix everything.
Glad to see Romano hasn't lost his sense of humor.
I've made Abby the new nurse manager.
Yeah, I heard.
I'd like you to let me know if she's not satisfying
the responsibilities of the position.
Okay.
I'd also like you to make sure
that there are at least two MICN's
and no more than three LVN's on duty
on any given shift.
Kerry, is everything okay?
Look, I made a small mistake on a television program.
I wish everyone would just get over it.
That's not what I meant.
In the ladies' room?
Yeah?
You dropped a syringe.
What? No.
Kerry, I know what I saw.
I'm taking hormones.
Good night.
Good night.
Pratt, Jing Mei.
Mm, night.
Watch out for the paparazzi, Dr. K.
Hey, Gallant, I understand that
you were involved in an altercation today.
Uh, yes, ma'am.
You hit another doctor?
Yeah, Dr. Pratt.
Oh.
Well, in that case I'll overlook it.
Night, Dr. Chen.
Take it easy, Iron Mike.
Hey.
Gallant.
Hey.
Hey, look.
I'm sorry about Hernandez.
Well, you should have stayed out of it.
Well, you were going from the gut, which I respect
but for once, I was the one thinking clearly.
So he went up to Psych?
I'll check on him before I leave.
How's your face?
Ah, don't even sweat it.
I know it wasn't really me.
You were punching Kayson.
Uh, actually, no, it was you.
Hey.
Next time I hit back.
Yeah. Tell Leon I said hey.
Ah, all right.
Daddy's back and it's chow time.
Come on. Come on.
Come on, come get some.
You should have your keys already out.
You never know who might be lurking.
Look, the drinking...
The drinking is the drinking; you know where I stand on that.
It's just how far are we going to go
if we keep hiding from each other?
I won't hide anymore.
( train passing )
Look, I didn't mean to leave like that.
It just seemed kind of complicated
and I wanted a little time
to figure out where we were.
Here we are.
