Previously on ER:
You two know each other.
Gordana's here to observe
a correctional congenital heart repair
on a young boy from Croatia.
Eric... where are you?
I have to go get him.
Why?
I mean, Eric's been gone for weeks.
What's one more day?
He's off his meds, and if I don't go now,
he might disappear again.
John, you really need to take this call.
He's in V-tach.
WEAVER: It's your grandmother.
I'm sorry.
( sobbing )
GALLANT: Okay, cough for me.
( coughs )
How much longer?
Chuny, can you call Psych for this guy?
Already did.
A moth flew in my ear.
I'm trying to lure it out.
HORVAT: Is Dr. Kovac here?
What the hell would you do?
Try Trauma One.
KOVAC: V-fib,
charge again.
Hey.
Charged.
Okay, clear.
360 again.
Charged.
Clear.
Time of death: 9:37.
MAN: Sorry to trouble you with this today.
CARTER: That's all right. I understand.
These are complicated issues.
They certainly are.
I wanted to give you time to think about things,
and... look over the papers
before the will is officially read.
Mm-hmm. I'll make sure to.
Cal.
Well, I didn't realize you were here, Jack.
Well, I flew in three days ago.
I telephoned you in New York.
Did you get my message?
That's Eleanor's apartment now.
Oh.
I just... wanted to express my condolences.
Well, I'll, uh, see you both at the service.
I appreciate the visit.
Bye.
Is red not somber enough?
No, you look fine.
She liked men to wear red ties.
That's very Republican of her.
I think that's blue now.
I didn't realize, uh, estate lawyers made house calls.
The Foundation Board
has called an emergency meeting for next week.
He just wanted me to be prepared.
Prepared for what?
Gamma stipulated it in her will that I be put in charge.
She appointed me President.
I see.
Well, I think that would be a good thing.
( chuckles )
For me or the Foundation?
Both.
It should be you, Dad.
Well, I guess that's not what she wanted.
Well, I think she figured I'm in Chicago,
it'd be easier for me.
She put you in charge of the family fortune,
and left me with a little bachelor's trust fund.
I don't think it was a question of geography.
I've also tried to stay as involved as I could.
John, who are you kidding?
Want me to tell you the truth?
She was disappointed in you as a son, as a father...
She didn't think you were up to it.
You could sugar-coat it a little.
It's an opportunity for you.
Not one that I wanted.
Now I'm stuck having to run the damn thing...
or walk away.
Looks like she managed to screw us both.
Almost time. Are we waiting on Abby?
She's meeting us at the cemetery.
That's good.
You look like a hooker.
( crashing )
Eric!
What are you doing?
I broke into your apartment.
I'm home.
I can see that now.
What happened to you?
I got into a fight with a guy in the lunch room.
He took the last Jell-O cup.
God.
What? He cut the line.
You're a mess.
Yeah, I had to jump through a window
and scoot through some bushes.
It's a voluntary program.
You can leave whenever you want.
Where's the fun in that?
You're not taking your meds.
I have, I swear.
I just lowered the dosages a bit.
How?
By cheeking them.
They had me on too much. It was a real downer.
Okay, so a few hours after our conversation,
you pick a fight with another patient...
Client. They call us clients.
...and then skip out on the whole thing.
Yeah, I think maybe we could find a better situation,
you know, like in Maui.
You should've called me.
Give me that.
( sighs )
Why didn't you call me?
I don't know.
I really don't.
Maybe I should just go.
No, sit down, sit down, sit down.
I could use a drink, I know that.
Is your apartment spinning?
You feel that? ¿Le duele?
Dejalo. ¿Tiene otro médico?
Tu eres un hombre malo.
I'm working for la migra.
No quiero que el toque mijo.
She says you're a bad man
and she doesn't want you touching her son.
Oh, get an abdominal scan with contrast
to rule out appendicitis,
and tell Evita here I can prescribe a good ESL class.
Rayos Equis.
23-year-old minor leaguer.
Sinkable episode after wind sprints.
Tu eres un jerk.
She says you're a jerk.
Yeah, got that.
Parietal hematoma on the left.
BP 104/58. Pulse 120.
He got dizzy, so I walk him
to the dugout, he must've hit his head
on the steps when he passed out.
CBC, chem panel, UA, EKG, lateral C-spine and head CT.
ROMANO: No Battles.
Has he had incidents like this before?
This guy's a stallion.
He went from instructional league
to Triple A in a single season.
That's impressive. Chest is clear.
Belly's benign.
He was on his way to be called up to the show.
What show?
Ignore him. He's fine.
Shoot the neck film and get him to CT.
Uh, you good here?
Yeah, sure, I'll use my foot
to put on the BP cuff.
That boy has gotten worse.
What boy?
Onta, the Croatian kid.
I thought it was all set up at Mercy?
It needs to happen sooner.
No, no, no.
We have enough trouble taking care of our own uninsured.
He's dying, Kerry.
His mother smuggled him onto a plane.
I-I need you to try again, please.
Look, even if they donate
medical supplies and facilities...
I know, the rest would be for me to take care of.
The cardiothoracic team, nurses, transport...
I'll do it.
Don't count on anything.
Jaycee said she'd do it on one condition--
she needs two weeks off in June
that the surgical N.M. denied her twice already.
I-I can't control vacation schedules.
Hey, everything's on negotiation.
I thought nurses were supposed to be angels of mercy.
Even mercy has a price.
Jerry, can you track this flight for me?
Mm-hmm. Air Flugelros?
Yeah, it has a sick kid on it.
They don't have hospitals in Germany?
And get Dr. DeFord on the phone. I'll take it in here.
Checking out of Loser's Lounge?
Try not to kill anyone, Lurch.
We'll do our best.
CT's back on the ball player in Two.
Negative-- looks like a concussion.
Except his 12-lead EKG shows a corrected QT at a level of .49.
Long QT syndrome? I doubt it.
He's just a young athlete who's trying to...
Yeah, I know, "Baseball
been berry berry good" to him.
Let's check a family history, just to be sure.
Okay.
You know what? I'll do it myself.
I thought you were going home.
Well, you know me. I live for this place.
She used to tell me how much it meant
to have you in her life.
She was lucky to have you looking after her.
Oh, I was the lucky one.
This is Gammy's good friend, Vivian.
Hello.
Are you a relation?
I'm her son.
I'm so pleased to meet you.
Thanks for coming. This way, please.
They're almost ready to start, Dr. Carter.
Let's wait another five minutes.
Abby not here yet?
Yeah, I sent a car for her, but...
I guess she's running late.
MAN: So what do you do for that?
Well, surgeons can insert an ICD.
It's an implantable cardioverter defibrillator,
and that can shock your heart back into a normal rhythm.
He doesn't drink enough water.
He was probably just dehydrated.
If I get one of those things, an ICD,
what then?
Well, then you'll be on beta blockers and rest
for about six months, after which we can
gradually increase your level of strenuous activity.
Six months?
No, we can't stop playing for...
Lucia, please. Por favor.
A guy with a heart condition who gets dropped out
for a whole season,
what team will ever take a chance on you then?
With long QT, there's a risk of cardiac arrest and sudden death.
You don't understand.
I'm about to get my shot.
Tuesday night
at Wrigley Field.
Our whole life has been waiting for this.
All right, well, we can treat this less aggressively,
but just for the moment.
Dr. Lewis, you have a minute?
Yeah. Thank you, doctor.
I'm expecting box seats.
Do you want a cards consult for the ICD?
Nah, just give IV fluids
and a stress test later in the day.
I thought you were recommending...
I had an ER overreaction kick in.
I worked through it.
All right.
( yawning )
* Wake up, Little Susie, wake up *
* I promised your mama I'd have you home by 10:00... *
Have the paperwork for us
to look over.
What paperwork?
You know, the end of the affair.
Oh, right.
Jerry, get me the surgical nurse manager back on the phone.
You ever think about
getting a personal assistant?
Susan, drunk in Three's waiting on his banana bag.
And you, I need to talk to you.
I'll be back in a minute.
Okay.
What are you doing tonight?
Take it easy, cowboy, I'm a married man.
Thanks.
( Road Runner cartoon plays )
O God, whose mercies cannot be numbered,
accept our prayers on behalf of your servant Millicent
and grant her an entrance into the land of light and joy
in the fellowship of your saints.
Tears have been my meat
day and night.
While they daily say to me,
"Where now is your God?"
Now when I think about these things
I pour out my heart by myself
for I went with the multitude
and brought them into the house of God.
Why are you so full of heaviness, O my soul?
And why are you so disquieted within me?
Just as the deer
longs for the water brooks,
so longs my soul after you, O Lord.
What are you doing?
There was a minibar in there.
You know how vodka goes through me.
Get back in the car.
I'm trying to make this work, Abby.
You just got to give me
a little more room here.
I swear to God, if you do not get back in this car this minute
I will get a gun and I will shoot you dead.
Wow.
You learn that approach in nursing school?
Get in the car.
ERIC: Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Then stop chasing me.
Eric...
Hey, John, what's up?
Why are you so disquieted within me?
Put your trust in God...
JACK: You need to calm down, son.
Sorry about your grandmother.
It's tough to lose somebody.
Why don't we go...
This is quite a send-off.
She must have been very loved.
Or very rich.
Eric...
Sorry.
I don't feel so good.
Brought your brother.
It's not exactly my bowl of rice, Kovac.
Besides, I've got a date.
Hot little brunette in radiology.
Oh, you'll be disappointed.
Hey, listen, all you'd have to do is be there
as a support surgeon.
Uh, some dying kid's desperate mom stuck him
aboard a plane, huh?
You know, that's almost enough to pluck at my heartstrings,
which I might add, are notoriously unpluckable.
I'll really be disappointed.
Trust me.
Will Corday be scrubbing in?
Says here under the Illinois
Marital Dissolution Act,
"A marriage can be invalidated
for only one of the following reasons."
Okay, keep going.
Uh, fraud. Did you ever fake anything?
No. You?
No. I'm just a screamer.
Uh, "Unacknowledged prior marriage?"
Right, like either of us is a bigamist.
I have an uncle who's a Mormon.
Next.
Uh... "Under the age of legal consent."
Don't I wish.
Don't I wish.
"Lack capacity to acquiesce
"to the use of drugs, alcohol,
or some mind-altering controlled substance."
I think we have a winner.
Which one of us was trashed?
Split the difference.
Okay, you know,
let me be the gentleman this one last time.
Oh, I don't recall any precedent for that.
Okay, so you're going to have to sign these,
and I'll take them into Family Court.
Here. Okay.
All right. Don't kick my ass.
Just, uh, initial paragraph two and sign page three.
Done... and done.
All right, there we go.
Unknotting the bonds of love?
Yeah, something like that.
Or impetuous lust.
Maybe something in between.
Jennifer Rosen, 43. See you later?
Yeah. Call me when we're divorced.
Picked her up at home.
She was a neighbor's Botox party last night.
Botox party?
Your day will come.
She's having trouble swallowing.
I'm sorry, Luka. I just can't.
I'm getting DeFord Steen from Rush
to do the Tet repair, but I still need a County
support team.
It's just too far afield for me.
Come on. I'll do anything.
I'll-I'll mow your lawn.
I'll-I'll baby-sit Ella.
Over my dead body.
And this guy's, too,
if you don't tie off that bleeder.
Suction from above.
Three-O proline on a needle driver.
Look, Luka,
I appreciate your commitment.
I really do, but don't you think
this is all just a little bit...
rash?
It's the only chance this boy has.
Is Dr. Dorset part of this team?
Uh...
is-is that a problem?
Yes.
Okay, no, no. Fine.
F-Fine. I'll do it.
He's calmer now.
I gave him some Depakote.
How much?
The whole bottle.
I was stuck.
I-I...
He couldn't be left alone,
and I really wanted to be here with you,
and I thought he would just wait in the car,
and I'm really sorry, John.
I'm going to drop him off at the hospital,
and then I'll come by the house, okay?
What for?
Because he agreed to be evaluated,
maybe go into a locked ward.
No, I mean, why come by the house?
I know...
what happened was terrible.
Unforgivable, really, but...
my brother is sick, and he's struggling.
I'm just trying to help him survive.
I know.
So go do that.
Didn't your doctor tell you
that Botox is not FDA-approved
for neck wrinkles?
They say botulism is beautiful.
Yeah, until you need an NG feeding tube.
A what?
It's an internal catheter
which goes from your nose to your stomach.
Now, you'll have to use that
to feed yourself about four cans of solution a day.
Will I lose weight?
GSW times three en route.
That's not the point.
How long till they get here?
Now.
Gallant, let's take her in suture.
Pratt, two kids coming in.
GSW to the right hand, chest and arm.
My babies.
Where... where are my babies?
They are right behind us.
Turner Mitchell, single GSW to the upper abdomen.
Where does it hurt, Turner?
Where the bullet went in.
Nine-year-old girl.
Multiple abrasions to the head and neck.
Denies LOC.
I'm okay. Help my kids first.
They're being taken care of, Mrs. Mitchell.
BP's 100/74 after two liters.
...over 64.
But he's tachy at 120.
Hold him steady.
I can't find any GSW.
Me, either.
My back hurts, my neck.
What's your name, pretty girl?
Noelle.
Well, Merry Christmas, Noelle.
We're going to fix you right up.
One, two... Three.
BP's 90 systolic.
Single small-caliber wound in the right lateral chest.
We were watching Bugs Bunny.
The window started... Exit wound.
smashing and then... Okay, hang another liter.
Betadine the right chest. Nothing.
Good, Gallant. Keep going.
My-my stuff'll
come around for-for a second time.
Is there a husband we can call? No, he's gone.
It's just-just me now. Okay.
Ma'am I'm going to numb you up, okay?
What about my kids? I'll go check on them.
Prep and anesthetize.
I'll be back for the chest tube.
BP's down to 64/48.
Sterile gloves and a seven French triple lumen.
Gallant's going to need the SonoSite when you're done.
Take it.
Dr. Kovac, there's a telephone call for you.
They say it's important.
Take a message.
Let's prep a six-O ET tube and a two mac.
80 of SUX and ten of etomidate.
It's that airplane that you asked me to track.
Okay, ask them what the problem is.
Uh, hey, uh, what's the problem?
Okay, wire's in.
Needle back.
Is this the Unifo kid?
Yeah. Sounds like a Tet spell.
He's saying bad breathing and "Blau."
Okay, hold out the phone.
Okay, catheter is in.
Hook up the infuser.
Morphine from the medicine...
Pressure's only up to 70.
Luka, go ahead. I got it.
Okay.
Take it outside.
DPL kit for Pratt? Over there.
What?
Says he's doing DPL on the girl.
My pager's going mad.
Oh, start up here.
I got to go see what the hell he is up to.
NG tube and a Foley.
What's his first Hemacue? 12.8.
Talk to me, Pratt.
She's persistently hypotensive and bradycardic
with warm, dry skin and good CAP refill.
Spinal shock.
Or complete transection.
Hi, sweetie.
Can you squeeze my hand?
Shrug your shoulders?
I can't feel anything.
Okay. Don't worry.
We're going to take good care of you.
She has no motor or sensory below C5.
Where's the GSW?
There isn't any.
Her mom pulled a bookcase down
to protect her.
Oh, must have caused a spinal cord injury.
Like, I said, she needs a DPL.
Do a SonoSite, and wait for Corday.
Start the steroids?
Uh... yeah.
900 milligrams of Solumedrol,
then 5.4 per hour.
( screams )
It is an unfortunate situation,
but if Mercy is committed to doing the surgery,
then they should follow through.
That's not going to happen.
And our facilities provide the best--
perhaps the only-- last-minute option.
I'm sorry to interrupt, but I need an answer.
It's hard enough
to keep pace with our own problems, Dr. Kovac.
If it were a wealthy businessman in need of an artificial heart,
we'll find the reason to do it.
Artificial heart implantation
is a cutting-edge surgery
that has benefits to medical science,
as well as the patient. I know all that.
You don't have to tell me.
We're talking about one sick boy here...
Uniform and Tet Repair, while important, are more...
who we have the ability to save, but not the will to do it!
( sighs )
And after all the talk, we won't save this boy
for only one reason: because we don't want to.
It's more complicated than that, Luka.
Yeah, you're right.
There's also the money.
( door closes )
I didn't know Gamma had The Collected Oscar Wilde
in first edition.
Oh.
There was a story about him late in his life
she... loved to tell.
I can't really remember.
He was on his deathbed drinking champagne,
and a friend of his asked him what he was doing,
and he said, "Isn't it obvious?
I'm dying beyond my means."
She was a society lady
with the heart of Stonewall Jackson.
I didn't mean what I said before.
Oh, it is what it is, John.
We can't pretend it was anything else.
Not much of a party, huh?
Not much of a funeral.
It was certainly memorable.
More like embarrassing.
So, Abby's not here.
I was just having a hard time mingling.
Sharing duck canapés and cosmos
with a bunch of people that I don't really know.
You don't need to stay if you don't want.
It's all right.
I'm sorry, Dad.
I'm really sorry.
I feel like I blew it.
Well, you didn't.
Neither did Abby.
Let it go, son.
Just let it go.
They're ready for her up in CT.
So, you're on Harper, huh?
I live on Williams about six blocks east.
I don't know any doctors in our neighborhood.
So, what do you want to be?
A fashion designer.
Oh, that's good, but with a smile like that,
you should think about becoming a model.
Stuff like that never happens.
Oh, sure it does.
I've seen it happen.
I'll come find you later, okay?
We'll bring you back as soon as the CT's done.
I still can't move anything.
Why can't I move?
We're going to figure that out.
Dr. Romano, did you forget something?
Yeah, I did.
Denzel, I need my Ancef,
Exam Two, pronto.
IM or IV?
What's it matter to you?
Nurses always give antibiotics.
And I've got to push this girl through CT.
Well, let her do that.
You come with me now.
Come on. I haven't got all day.
Romano's got a new bitch, huh?
Malik, hook me up with a portable defibrillator
and a drug box.
Is somebody going on a run?
I'm not sure why you'd want
an Affirmative Action imbecile
fixing you up,
but if you're trying to humiliate me...
Zip it.
You've demonstrated
a certain amount of integrity.
Now, it won't last long if you keep working here,
but for the time being, it suits my purposes.
I'd prefer to keep this between us.
How did that happen?
It's not important.
There's some tissue that's devitalized.
It'll probably need debridement.
Look, I don't know much about burns,
but I'd say you're going to need
a little bit more than debridement.
Just do it.
Just do it?
Some of this is circumferential.
The vessels under the eschar look charred.
I don't even know if I can take care of an injury that severe.
All right, then.
I'll get Corday.
No, get Lewis.
She's the least annoying of the bunch down here.
Look, Dr. Romano,
you need a surgeon to examine that.
I am a surgeon.
Hey, Jerry, have you seen
Abby?
Ah, she's off today.
I thought you were, too.
Jerry, tell Malik to let me know
when the postical postal worker in Four wakes up.
Postical... I don't think I can even say that.
Carter, I thought you went to the funeral.
Yeah, if you can call it that.
Excuse me.
Curtis Mitchell.
They say my family's here.
Uh, yeah, I'll take you to them.
You going to be here a while?
Did they tell you what happened?
Yeah, they told me.
Your mom was lucky.
A bullet passed through her chest,
but we were able to reinflate her lung.
What about Turner?
Shot to the abdomen, but he's stable.
And my little sister?
Uh, no bullet wounds-- that's good,
but a bookcase fell on her, so there's some paralysis,
which we're hoping is temporary,
but we won't know more until we get back her CT.
Hey, Mama.
How are the kids?
Did you see them?
No, not yet.
Are you all right?
I was trying to protect her.
It's not your fault.
I-I pulled the bookcase down on top of her.
Did you see who did this?
Mama, did you see who did this?
Don't do anything, Curtis.
You hear me?
Don't you do anything.
Have them send type-
specific to the OR.
That's my brother.
Cefoxitin's on board.
Turner? Second unit's in.
That's my brother.
What's going on?
We're taking him to the OR.
He needs exploratory surgery.
He's bleeding internally.
Can you make it stop?
We think a bullet ripped into his spleen.
We may need to remove it.
Turner, you all right?
We got to get him upstairs.
You stay strong, little man, okay?
Stay strong, little man.
Boy, the standard of care really does suck here.
Miss Perez?
He's got a swing like a young Ted Williams.
That's what everybody says anyway.
Sounds like a natural.
I just...
We can't give up on that.
You don't have to explain it to me.
Robert.
Shall we, uh, step inside?
Gallant told me what happened.
So much for his integrity.
He was concerned.
( sighing )
May I?
It may be a little worse than I thought initially.
Normally, in order to determine
full assessment for escharotomy...
We need to determine pain in...
which we cannot do in this case,
because I'm the guy with the piece of driftwood hanging off his shoulder.
There are other ways to determine
if the procedure is called for.
No, no escarotomy.
Some of these are full-thickness burns.
If the blood supply to the hand is compromised...
No, as long as I can feel a good radial pulse,
I am not going to let the surgical "B" Team
start hacking away at me.
It's possible the arm could become eschemic.
In which case, it's already too late to save it.
I know. I get it. I understand.
Capice.
You should see Corday.
I don't want to see Corday.
At least get a Plastics assessment.
Will you do that, Robert?
Hi, it's Abby.
Leave me a message after the beep. Thanks.
Hey, I thought you were going to be here with Eric.
Dr. Carter. I was trying to catch you.
Dr. Carter.
I guess there was a change of plan.
( whistling )
And I'm going to hang up now,
because you're standing right in front of me.
Where's Eric?
Upstairs with Myers.
Are you okay?
Look, I'm really sorry.
I feel like such a terrible person.
Yeah, well, it's been a bad time all around.
CURTIS: Hey...!
I'm going to wipe them out!
Look, I swear I would kill them!
I would do them all, and I'll take this whole
damn world with me, man!
You going to be cool...
I'll take them with me!
...or you want to be in custody?
I'm cool, all right?!
I'm cool, man.
Okay, I'll get a suture kit.
Sit.
I'm going to come back later.
Good.
Ain't you a doctor?
Just a hobby, really.
What's that, Black Pharaohs?
No, man, Righteous Lords.
How long you been into that?
I'm not anymore.
I used to run with them a while before.
I stopped, man. Ah!
Outgrew it?
My mama begged me.
I got a job bagging groceries.
Okay, this will sting a little.
They were after me.
Who was? The Dis...
( yelling )
The Disciples, man. Uh-uh-uh...
They think they own my 'hood.
Probably think I was an easy target
ever since I left my crew.
So, now Turner, Noelle and Mama, they paying for it?
Luka, the board's answer was no.
Oh, this is for something else.
However, I convinced them to agree
that if a boy with no other options
shows up at County General's doors
in need of an emergency... repair,
well, he wouldn't be turned away.
Hypothetically?
And completely off the record.
Kerry, thank you.
( woman speaking German )
Ladies and gentlemen, please remain seated.
You are Dr. Kovac?
Yeah.
Base line cyanosis.
...breather at six liters.
That the X ray the lady doc was talking about?
Come on, talk to me, man.
She has no return of her reflexes.
She's having difficulty breathing.
That could indicate paralysis.
Will she walk?
If the swelling goes down,
we can put her on a regimen of physical therapy.
Will she walk?
I don't know.
Hey, there, baby girl.
Curtis. Mom's okay.
Yeah, I know.
We didn't do anything.
Why did they shoot at us?
I'm going to go home,
and I'm going to get things fixed up.
You just stay here and get better, okay?
Neural ICU's ready to take her.
When can I visit?
It's open 24 hours.
Am I going to have to stay here?
For a while, yeah.
I can't go home with you tonight?
No, not tonight, baby girl, not tonight.
But these folks going to take care of you.
You try to get some sleep, all right?
The car is outside.
Are you back? Yeah.
Too bad it's like this, though, man.
Where you going, Curtis?
Like I said, fix things.
Yo, they shot up Jamal's crib, too.
That's not the way to get it done.
You did a good thing for your mom.
Don't undo it now.
The Disciples undid it
when they shot up my family.
Your family needs you.
Yo, Doc...
Hey, Curtis.
Hey, Curtis.
You just didn't do that, right?
All right, what am I supposed
to tell that little girl upstairs
when you don't show up?
You tell her I'm a warrior.
You tell her that.
( engine starting )
Sats are falling!
Can't get a good angle!
PVCs, we've got to bag him!
No, will have to wait!
He's going to go into arrest!
Let me give it a shot!
I don't think it's possible!
We do it all the time!
Here,
bag for me!
You've got to get low,
like you're having sex in a Volkswagen,
you know what I mean?
He's about to go into V-tach!
Don't miss!
You're a real motivator!
Did anyone ever tell you that?
CORDAY: Are the bypass tech and machine ready?
On their way. Where can I plug in?
Uh, you are? The echocardiologist.
Kovac promised me Cubs tickets.
Dr. Corday.
What a pleasant surprise.
Oh, I didn't realize
that Kovac had recruited you.
He's a persuasive man.
They're three minutes out.
( hangs up phone )
( helicopter approaching )
( speaking Croatian )
Are they ready?
Standing by in the OR.
Okay.
Let's roll.
Be careful of the tube.
Bradying down, looks like 65.
KOVAC: Half mig of atropine.
Let's keep moving.
No, he might arrest.
Eagle Scout, Doc.
Stats are off the chart, low.
No pulse.
Okay, starting CPR.
You want epi?
.5 escalating doses.
Okay, pushing it.
...doesn't work.
Nothing works.
I just want his heart to beat.
I got a pulse.
Okay. Go! Go! Go! Go!
Pressure's only 60 on maximum dopamine.
He needs suctioning.
Where's the CD Team?
They're on their way in.
You intubated?
Yeah, he's in pulmonary edema.
CORDAY: All right, let's get started. Here we go.
Is he stable enough for general
anesthesia? I'll scrub in.
KOVAC: Okay, let's prep the chest.
It's all right, Luka.
We have it. Porcine pulmonary
valve and Dacron conduit.
Let's get a look at his coronary
anatomy. All set.
It's been a pretty good gig
being married to you, all in all.
No complaints.
If you ever need a letter of recommendation.
My resume speaks for itself.
Is that split move you do, is that a special skill?
( laughing )
Ah, so...
I guess we'll be running into each other.
You know, just because we're splitting up
doesn't mean, you know, we have to end it.
Makes sense to me.
I hear divorcees have the best sex.
We're technically annulled, not divorced.
Work with me here. I will.
I got a roommate.
That's okay.
I know a bench in Lincoln Park.
SURGEON: Are we ready for bypass?
SURGEON 2: Ready.
Run up the pump starting at... 9:37.
There'll be some outrage at the top
but we'll handle that.
So, he's doing well?
Yeah, stable on bypass.
... pericardium.
SURGEON: Pump prime gradient less than ten.
CORDAY: Low dose epi at 0.5 started.
Pressure's up to 120/70.
I thought if I could save him, it would make me feel...
I don't know, like, uh... maybe I was a doctor again.
Hey, does this look like a pubic ramus fracture to you?
No.
Avulsion of the ischial tuberosity.
Abby's on her way down.
Dr. Romano, how's it going?
How's what going?
Nothing.
Back to work.
NURSE: Gallant.
I'm putting Mrs. Mitchell in One.
I'll be back from Ortho in a minute.
What's the chest tube output like?
Less than 50cc's an hour. Normal sats.
Mrs. Mitchell, how are you feeling?
Is Curtis here?
He had to go out for a little while.
He said he'd come back later for a visit.
You're a doctor. You dress so nice.
Yeah, I had a funeral.
Somebody close to you?
Yes, ma'am.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Must be hard.
Uh, Turner's doing better.
He's out of surgery and Noelle is up
in the neuro ICU.
You can see her tomorrow.
W-Will you wake me up when Curtis comes back?
I'll make sure that the doctor knows.
He's a good boy, my Curtis.
How did Kovac get you on board?
Well, he asked.
Ah. That was easy.
So, what do you want to do now?
Because, look, normally, tonight,
I would just be sitting at home
watching Trading Places.
But fortunately for you, it's ladies night.
( giggling )
Yeah, you're right. My daughter's waiting.
I see, well, have I mentioned
how much I love kids?
My car's just up the street. You want a ride?
Which way are you going?
Uh... whichever way you point me towards.
I'm... really sorry, uh...
I-I just can't tonight.
Um... can I take a rain check?
Nice evening for a stroll.
Lizzie.
How'd it go with Plastics?
What did Gallant do,
post it on the bulletin board?
No, Plastics consulted me.
They knew that I'd examined your other infection.
Well, he wants to admit me for wound care,
daily debridements, and, uh, pulse monitoring.
And in about a week, do skin grafts
on the dorsum and the volar aspect.
Well, that seems reasonable.
Does it?
I was making tea.
I put the pot on.
I, uh, got distracted.
My sling got caught on the burner and, uh...
my arm was on fire...
and I didn't realize it until I saw the flames.
It's ridiculous.
Unfortunately, things like that can happen
during sensory recovery.
Yeah, but I'm not recovering.
I'll never get the feeling back.
Robert, listen to me.
Just because you're discouraged
don't do anything that might cause a delay.
It's just going to keep going like this.
You can't afford to have another infection. It's over.
Compartment syndrome, vascular insufficiency...
Lizzie, you're not hearing me. It's over.
It's time for me to cut my losses.
Robert...
No, we both know I'll be better off without it.
You as much as said so.
No, what I said was amputation
was always a possibility down the line,
but I-I don't think...
I'm very, very glad we had this chat.
Will you, uh, check the OR schedule to set it up?
As soon as possible.
I just want to be rid of the damn thing.
Hey.
Hey.
Have you seen Carter?
Uh, he was here before.
Everything okay?
Hey, I heard about the boy.
Congratulations.
Thanks.
Okay, see you tomorrow.
Actually, uh, you won't see me for a while.
I'm going to the Congo.
What?
The Alliance de Medicine Internacionale.
I'm off tomorrow
and then I'm going to West Africa.
I didn't realize that was so soon.
Take care of yourself.
I mean it.
Yeah.
Hold down the fort.
She's in the lounge.
Who?
You're not going to play that, are you?
PARAMEDIC: GSW to the chest and back.
PRATT: No LOC, but he's altered.
Who's attending?
Uh... Chen's in three with hot MI.
So, who's going to take this?
Pratt needs an attending.
You're an attending.
PARAMEDIC: BP 90/66 after a liter.
Hey!
Hey, where's Curtis?
I don't know, man. I don't know.
Was anybody with him? A bunch of them down.
A couple pronounced on the scene.
PRATT: Tachy at 130.
MAN: I can't breathe.
PRATT: Lost the pulse.
CARTER: All right,
start compressions. Let's go.
No pressure, no pulse.
All right, stop CPR.
I'm in, you bag. Thoracotomy tray.
Carter, I'm here.
Betadine and ten blade next.
Jing-Mei's got it.
Come on, Pratt! Don't just stand there.
Do a central line.
This is my patient. I got it.
CHUNY: Still no pulse.
Carter, it's okay. You don't have to do this.
All right, give me
the ten blade. John, let them take it.
CHEN: Fifth intercostal space
all the way to the mid-axillary line.
ABBY: Okay, why don't we just get out of here?
You know I came in to find you, right?
I shouldn't have come in here.
I shouldn't have come.
It's okay. Things are going to get better.
Can you do me a favor? Yeah.
Can you leave me alone?
What?
I need some time.
Can you just go?
Okay.
( sobbing )
