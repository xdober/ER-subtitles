Previously on ER:
Ah!
It's over.
It's time for me to cut my losses.
That's my brother.
A bullet ripped his spleen.
Stay strong, little man, okay?
Where you going, Curtis?
Like I said, fix things.
Now you see why I want to get the hell out of this place.
Well, it's not all bad.
You know what I mean.
You know, you can get a job at Northwestern, too.
You won't see me for awhile.
I'm going to the Congo,
West Africa.
L'Alliance de MÃ©decine Internationale.
I thought you said you weren't going.
Yeah, I'm not.
WOMAN: Dr. Carter?
Dr. Carter?
( slurred ): Start dopamine at ten mikes,
and mix up levophed.
Dr. Carter, you left a note
to wake you if you weren't up by 7:00.
Do you want some breakfast?
No. No, thanks.
I'll just get something there.
( groaning softly )
Dr. Carter?
I'm up.
( clearing throat )
I'm up.
Mmm.
Hey, you're late.
Two minutes.
Late is late.
57-year-old cirrhosis, vomit and blood,
G.I. lab can scope him at 9:00.
Can I get a bagel first?
I haven't had breakfast yet, either.
You mean dinner.
Yeah, whatever.
16-year-old gangbanger, GSW to the belly.
O.R. should be grabbing him any minute.
You mean like now?
Then there's the 14-year-old banger
GSW to the upper leg.
Pulse deficit, in line for angiogram.
Same shooter?
I stopped keeping track.
DVT in Six; on heparin.
Since midnight?
There's no tele beds.
This gang war's got every department backed up.
Where's Jimmy Carter when you need him?
Bus full of Texans with food poisoning
all puking hash browns. Good morning.
Yeah, for you, maybe.
Apparently, I'm a vampire.
Oh, wow, you got it so rough.
Three night shifts in a row.
I been doing graveyard two weeks straight.
I did my residency, thank you.
They're insisting on being discharged
by 2:16 so they can see the stupid eclipse.
I thought vampires liked eclipses.
Ah, the moon blocks out the sun-- big deal.
I've got a billboard outside my apartment
does the same thing.
Catch you tonight, Elvira.
Hey, I thought this was it for you.
Almost. One more night slumming here with you cats.
Then I'm heading it uptown.
You're late.
You can tell time.
So can Dr. Carter.
Yeah? So, what's he going to do, fire me?
Did you catch the eclipse?
What?
The solar eclipse.
A celestial phenomenon
that occurs only once every 18 years,
11 and a third days.
No, I slept through that.
You slept through it?
I had to sleep sometime.
You couldn't wake up for ten minutes?
So, big deal--
the moon blocks out the sun.
I've got a billboard outside my apartment
that does the same thing.
You don't look so good.
12-year-old near-drowning in Four.
Intubated and comatose, no purposeful movements.
Waiting on PICU.
Hey, what's with all the Buddhists?
They're here for the nun.
What, so now we got some religious turf war?
Buddhist nun.
Transpo's backed up taking her to the morgue.
She's dead.
Reincarnated; a cycle of karma...
Six-year-old gone respiratory arrest
from cyanide toxicity.
Acidosis is resolved with induced methemglobinemia.
Also waiting on PICU.
How does a six-year-old ingest cyanide?
CARTER: That is the family of a fatal M.I.
They want to go in and see their father
after he gets cleaned up.
You okay?
DVT in Six is waiting on coags.
Hold on; I gave you DVT this morning.
The guy's been in there over 20 hours?
So, take care of him.
All right, see you.
Nice knowing you.
I start at Northwestern next week.
Tonight's it for me.
That's right. Um...
Good luck, Greg.
Yeah, you, too.
Do you realize
how much ambulance traffic
we get through here a day?
I can't go around?
It's equipment or a huge pile of concrete.
Hey, park the damn thing sideways...!
What is this?
Weaver's moving triage.
Something about four more beds.
Oh, good-- so the patients can wait lying down?
I don't ask.
I thought you were on vacation.
Tomorrow.
Martha's Vineyard? Nope.
32-year-old woman struck by a cab.
The Cape?
Rio de Janeiro.
Ooh-la-la-- string bikinis.
With my father. Low velocity.
She ran right into traffic.
There were others; not just me.
Any head trauma?
Proximal tibia on the right.
Could all be supratentorial.
They were forcing us.
They wanted everyone to go together.
Are you taking any medications?
It's all ending today; today's the last day.
Can you tell us your name?
2:16 P.M.-- the end of the world.
Oh, great-- and I have to work.
I'm always working when the world ends.
I can't swallow, man.
Belly's soft.
Let's type and cross for four.
Blood bank's almost empty.
The Red Cross doesn't restock until 9:00.
Okay, first crit's 30.
Let's stick with saline for now.
Decreased on the right.
32 French.
Why can't I swallow?
Am I dying?
Not if we can help it,
but if you guys keep shooting at each other,
we're going to run out of blood.
I didn't shoot nobody.
Dr. Carter, I think
you should take a look at this woman.
Been here half an hour.
I got half a dozen patients.
You're going to have to be more specific, Gallant.
Buddhist nun, end-stage breast cancer.
Vomiting pain meds. Exam Two.
Does this guy need to go up?
Wouldn't have anywhere for him even if he did. Ten blade.
Portable chest, full trauma panel.
NELSON: Yo, where you going?
You have a collapsed lung, Nelson.
Dr. Corday is going to re-inflate it for you,
and we'll keep an eye on you down here,
so, try not to bleed too much.
Hey, are you my doctor?
Not at the moment. Well, when?
I've been waiting almost an hour!
Have you come to rescue us?
I'm swamped with these physical improvements.
You'll have to take point down here.
Did you fire Romano? No. Medical leave.
What, his arm?
I can't really discuss it.
Carter, you know if CT's back up yet?
I didn't know it was down.
I thought she had a benign abdomen.
Well, now she's unresponsive.
Should have had a tox screen.
She may be coming down from speed or hallucinogens.
She's nuts, right? Out of it?
So, I don't have to check out her story?
What, the end of the world part?
No, the part about men trying to kill her.
Yeah, I would look into that.
Hey, I got chronic pancreatitis.
It's flaring, and I'm puking my pain pills.
Let me guess; you need a shot of Demerol.
If you say so. Just do it fast.
Mastectomy, radiation, chemo.
Recurred with a pathologic fracture.
Does she have an oncologist?
The surgeon's in Japan.
MAN: I need it now!
GSW en route,
ten minutes out.
All right, come find me.
Hello. I'm Dr. Carter.
Kito Shunko.
And this is the Venerable Zuin-an.
I'm sorry, Sister Zui...?
Zuin-an.
Are you comfortable with me doing a physical examination?
( speaking Japanese )
( quivering moan )
Yes. Okay.
When was her last chemo?
Three months ago,
but it wasn't working anymore.
I shouldn't have even brought her here.
But she's in terrible pain
and hasn't had anything to drink in two days.
Well, she'll feel much better with some intravenous fluids,
some antinausea and pain medication.
( speaking Japanese )
So much sadness.
PRATT: Whoa.
Somebody overcooked their burger.
It's arson-- definitely arson.
LEWIS: Could be electrical.
The place wasn't exactly a model of code compliance.
I've been brown-bagging it since they closed.
And now the cafeteria has a monopoly.
Was anybody in there?
CFD did a sweep.
Oh, well, I guess we're closed now.
Oh, we never close.
Yeah, neither did Doc Magoo's,
and look what happened.
I wouldn't deprive you of your last shift.
Oh, come on.
Declare internal disaster so that we can all go home.
No, you're an internal disaster.
That's an external disaster.
( chuckling )
Hey, Abby, got any marshmallows?
Mr. Mednick, you need to be on a monitor.
No, what I need is some fresh air.
And put out the cigarette.
I'm almost done.
Put out the cigarette!
You have a bleeding ulcer.
I know what I have, sweetheart.
Okay, that's fine.
Smoke the whole pack.
I'll be inside.
Come and find me when you start vomiting blood.
Hey, Abby, Doc Magoo's is on fire.
Yeah, I can see that.
Single GSW to the...
( explosion )
Now can we go home?
Lizzie. Come to take the "before" pictures?
Shouldn't you be in pre-op?
Yeah, well, some man-hating bovine
threw me out here
when an elective lab nissen started circling the drain.
Hand me that, will you?
What, the chart? No, the black marker.
Poor bastard came in
trying to cure aggravated belching.
His wife's probably down in the coffee shop
waiting for him to wake up.
Do me a favor?
Write "not this one, idiot" on my arm.
Oh, like it doesn't happen.
I'll be lucky to get out of there
without both my legs being amputated.
I should have you come in with me
to stand guard over these gargoyles.
You can if you want to, you know--
if you're bored or curious.
I'm covering the E.R.
Well, they need you more than I do.
But I'll scrub in if I can.
You forgot "idiot."
I'll be there, Robert.
Yeah, well, just in case you're not-- "idiot."
( sighing )
You think I'm doing the right thing?
It doesn't matter what I think.
Well, that's a position
I would usually advocate, but...
now I'm asking.
You're doing the right thing.
Yeah.
There's something in my eye--
maybe some metal.
Yeah, don't touch it.
Why, what's it look like?
C.B.C., chem panel, chest and carboxyhemaglobin.
Satting at 97.
Can someone check my daughter's ventilator? It keeps beeping.
I'll send a nurse.
How bad am I burned?
Mainly second degree, but the blast threw you.
I want to ultrasound your belly.
Will they do another EEG?
I'll check the chart.
SonoSite and a Wood's lamp.
Damn tank blew my mask right off.
You waiting for somebody?
My-my husband.
You can check with the clerk at the front desk.
No, he died.
He had a heart attack.
Oh. You need someone to take you to him?
No. He was here.
They took him.
We just... wanted to stay here a minute.
Pratt, Susan needs your help with a central line.
Hold on; is there another room open?
Exam One, maybe.
No, it's all right.
We'll leave.
B.P. 122/78, pulse 114.
TKO the saline.
Come on, Paul.
Dr. Pratt, my gang kid's hypotensive.
I need the SonoSite and an extra pair of hands.
WOMAN: Come on, Paul.
Paul, now.
Can I install alcaine?
Yeah, titrate eight of MS.
And keep his systolic over 100.
Is the lung up?
GSW to the right shoulder.
Good breath sounds to the apex.
Can you feel it when I touch you here?
BOY: I'm good, I told you.
WRIGHT: Pulse ox 98 on two liters.
Okay, let's get a pocket Doppler.
C.B.C. type and screen.
What is that?
GSW to the belly last week.
We took out his spleen.
And you're out running again?
They killed my brother
and crippled my sister.
Here? We took care of them here?
It didn't help much, huh?
Was Curtis your brother?
What, you were his doctor?
Dr. Carter-- a pediatric drowning, full arrest.
WRIGHT: A sinus tach on the scope. 110.
How are his pulses?
Okay, let's follow serial crits,
and then come find me with his films.
12-year-old girl.
Dad was taking her on a tour boat.
Fell into the water when he wasn't looking.
You'll have to relax and let the doctor do his job.
How long was she in there?
Don't know.
Search and rescue found her facedown.
Hold compressions. PEA. Not perfusing.
Compression can put her into V-fib
if she's too cold.
Let's do a rectal temp.
How long since the last epi?
Six minutes.
Push another point five.
Heated, humidified O2, warm saline, bear hugger.
Core temp is 86.5.
Good enough; resume compressions.
Still no pulse.
Mig of atropine.
How long has she been down?
About 45 minutes.
Okay.
Let's go with
NG and bladder irrigation.
When?
Five minutes.
We deep suctioned her,
and she started triggering the vent.
I thought she was decerebrate.
She was.
Wean her down to 50%.
ABG at 15, check another set of lytes.
Temperature? 97.1.
That's good, right?
What's her name?
Heather.
Heather, can you hear me?
If you can hear me, squeeze my hand.
I've got a pulse.
It's faint, but it's a pulse.
Let's try for pressure.
Rate's up to 72.
All right, suction catheter.
Whoa. Pulmonary edema?
Or river water.
Okay, ectopy on the monitor.
Heart's irritable.
Let's set vent temp to 42.
Four of peep.
Pupils are fixed and dilated.
Just follow the light with your eyes. Good.
Very good.
You're doing great, honey.
B.P.'s steady, 110 over 72.
Sats are 93.
I bet you want that tube out, don't you?
Okay, when I say "now," you take a deep breath,
and you blow as hard as you can, okay?
All right, deep breath.
LOCKHART: Ready with five of albuterol.
And now.
Clear. ( coughing )
No change.
All right, 300.
Stand by with 50 of lidocaine.
Second bolus of 25 in five. Clear.
HALEH: Sinus tach.
Strong pulse.
Heather. Come on, Heather,
wake up, open your eyes!
She's posturing.
GCS 131.
PRATT: Non-rebreather mask, 100% high flow.
Daddy. Yes, honey?
Try not to talk. Cough all that stuff up.
Another chest, and repeat the ABG.
Dad?
Mr. Marks?
Yes. Is she going to be okay?
Your daughter was brought in in cardiac arrest.
She wasn't breathing on her own.
Your daughter's awake.
She's breathing on her own.
She's on a ventilator,
but we don't know how long she was in the water,
and her lungs show signs of damage.
Her lungs are recovering, and she's oxygenating well.
It's possible that her brain may have been deprived of oxygen
for a long time.
Oh, God.
Oh, my God.
Her neurologic exam is back to normal.
You saved her.
I-I saw you save her.
Yeah, we got her heartbeat back,
but you need to know
that 30% of all near- drownings die,
and another 30 suffer permanent brain damage.
We're just going to have to wait and see.
( quivering exhale )
She's going to be just fine.
Thank you.
( chuckling ): You're welcome.
All right.
Yeah, go ahead, go in and see her.
( chuckling )
The just keep getting younger, don't they?
Is neuro-vascular intact?
Completely, but I'd observe for an expanding hematoma.
You could at least take his staples out.
Or we could implant a zipper--
make it easier for all concerned.
WYATT: Hello! Still waiting!
Well, you're making progress, you got a bed.
Yeah, still in pain.
Malik, I need the EEG.
Neurology's backed up.
Who isn't?
( clears throat )
Is she feeling more comfortable?
Yes, thank you. She's sleeping.
The dehydration has resolved.
Her vitals look better.
She says it won't be long.
She might be right.
If there's anybody who would want to say good-bye...
They're coming from the temple.
She has a gift.
She can see inside of people.
She saw inside of me.
She was imprisoned for demonstrating for human rights
in North Korea.
And I was imprisoned for... well, for other things.
She saved me.
I took it on myself to serve her purpose,
but now as I watch her embrace her death and rebirth,
I truly understand:
only through our own acceptance
do we realize our purpose.
Is it scabies?
Impetigo. It's a bacterial infection.
What if it spreads? Gets into his brain?
We'll treat it with antibiotics.
He must have gotten that from his friends,
because he did not get that in my house.
Don't touch your face!
I fell.
Is that how you hurt your wrist, too?
Yeah.
How did you get to the hospital?
My boyfriend.
Was he there when you fell?
WOMAN: Ow! Not so hard! Geez.
It's gallstones, Anna.
No. I don't have gallstones.
Fatty foods bring out the pain.
I didn't even eat dinner. I just had some pie.
How much pie?
You know-- a pie.
You a smoker,
Mr. Dressler? A little.
Drink alcohol? Yeah. Beer, mostly.
Exercise? Well, I was starting to get back into shape.
I was doing one of my wife's exercise videos,
and, uh... I feel a lot better now.
I wasn't sure if it was the chicken wings
I had last night, or a heart attack.
Let's hope it was the wings.
How long is this going to stay on?
About four to six weeks.
I have finals in a month.
Well, you can still study with a cast on.
Not exams. State finals-- cheerleading.
Well, you might have to give those pom-poms a rest.
I'll give you compazine for the nausea.
You can keep the meds down.
No. My doctor tried that before.
It doesn't work.
Then why does he prescribe Percocet?
That's what I'm asking you.
Demerol works. 150 milligrams.
Whew, big dose!
It's a big pain.
Okay, one shot, one time, and then that's it.
I'm flagging your chart.
You're going to have to see a pain specialist.
Good idea.
Haleh, 125 of Demerol for Mister...
Dean. John Dean.
Haldeman. Bob Haldeman.
I'm serious, Mr. Haldeman.
One shot of Demerol, and that's it.
The ER is not a place to manager chronic pain.
As soon as my chiropractor
gets back in town, I'll get adjusted.
Good, 'cause I'm flagging your chart.
Abby, flag his chart.
Yes, sir. Oh, and Mr. Johnson made a biscuit.
A "biscuit"? He took a dump in a gurney.
Aw, that's beautiful.
Hey, Jerry, what's the County
to Northwestern biscuit ratio?
It's got to be eight to one.
Oh, odds are in my favor, baby.
Banger number 17's rolling up.
Excuse me, the nurse told me to down here...
Yeah, yeah. Sit right there. We'll get to you.
The old paint factory on Hudson was probably the worst.
Hot as hell, and the smoke...
Couldn't see your hand in front of your face.
Isn't the fire outside, boys? It's out.
Really? Then shouldn't you be rolling up your hoses
and heading back to the station?
Feeding that little spotted dog?
Polishing your poles?
Are you cranky or flirting? What?
"Polish your poles"?
GSW times two to the left chest.
Pressure's 100 palp, we scooped and ran.
Shot in the shoulder, too?
No, that's an old one. Old one?
Mom... call my Mom.
We will. Let's get you inside first.
Steri-strips on the belly.
Oh, God. He's a baby.
Yeah, that knows how to take a bullet.
What's your name? Turner.
Does it hurt here?
( whimpering ): Yeah. Oh...
How about here?
CARTER: You want me to call your mom?
You don't want to talk to your mom?
She'll kick my ass.
Well, maybe that's what you need.
Look, man, she don't understand.
I don't understand.
Look, they dropped my brother.
That's all there is.
No, that is not all there is.
You're what, 13 years old?
There's a lot more than that.
Not where I live.
You're not one of those guys.
Not yet.
You don't have to be.
Well, somebody's gotta take care of business.
Your business is your mother and your sister.
Who's going to take care of business
when you get killed?
We need the room now! In a minute.
Cops found a mass suicide on Folton.
Two more behind us.
C-spine, chest, pelvis, lumbar spine series, and right tib-fib.
Why did you jump out a third story window?
I was about to take it, but then they started forcing me.
Bone culture, gram of ancef, 100 of gent.
( groaning ) Hang on, Turner.
My feet-- why can't I feel my feet?
Don't worry, we're going to take care of that.
Sats are down to 87.
Up him to 15 liters. We'll need x-ray for portable chest.
Will somebody please call my mom?
No problem. Just hold on.
Here...
write down her number.
All right, set her for narcan and charcoal.
What did they take?
Drank some kind of poisoned Kool-Aid.
Throwing PVC's.
Okay, stop. Pull the ambu bag.
What? Pull it.
On-scene survivor said
they were meeting the eclipse.
Oh, Lord. It's almond smell. Cyanide.
Gallant, it's cyanide!
We need the antidote kits, now!
Pulse ox is 99. She's seizing!
It's all right. It doesn't matter.
Her cells can't use the oxygen.
ST elevation on the monitor.
All right, four of Ativan.
It's lactic acidosis of the heart.
We need amyl nitrate perles down the ET tube and bag.
Sodium nitrate to follow.
Ten cc's I.V. push over 4 minutes.
Chest tube on the left,
type and cross for six, and notify the O.R.
We need the room.
Pupils mid-dilated and nonreactive.
Okay, move him into the hall and get the Tonopen.

Chart still in the racks. AMA.

Okay, is this your mom's phone number?
Turner?
Turner?! I need a BP. He's crashing.
He can't count fingers.
It might be traumatic glaucoma.
Timoptic and pilocarpine drops after a gram of Mannitol.
All right, repeat ABG, lytes,
lactate, methemglobin, and cyanide level.
ST segments are down.
First troponin is elevated on Dressler.
Who? Chest pain. in Exam Four.
Call the O.R. and tell anesthesia
he made need a Greenfield.
Page cards. Inch of nitropaste,
aspirin, five of metroprolol.
You might want to check for acidosis.
I'm more concerned about fat embolus.
Spontaneous eye opening.
Sorry, sir. You'll have to catch the next eclipse.
Lost the pulse. Crank it.
1500 in the Thoraseal.
( groans ): Suction to me.
No tamponade. Looks like the pulmonary vein.
( grunts ): Starting internal compressions.
Hilum's clamped.
Pratt-- penetrating abdominal trauma, no pressure.
Carter-- two more OD's
with one apneic.
Get Weaver down here. We need more docs.
Aw, man, what happened?
Oh, God.
Found bleeding with multiple stab wounds.
Mom's next door.
They were found hugging each other.
Is she breathing? Agonal.
All right, pediatric intubation tray.
Five and a half ET tube...
Pre-op labs and four units O-Neg,
and get surgery down here.
Strong pulse. They must not've given her enough.
Must be a couple of units on the clothes alone.
There was blood all over the scene.
Starting compression, ragged incision.
What'd they use? A meat cleaver?
Pratt, she's open all the way down to the bladder.
Oh, God, who would do this to their kid?
There were ten kids.
This is the only one we found that had a chance.
That looks like a pregnant uterus.
Where's the baby? What baby?
Oh, God. What?
Somebody ripped it out of her.
Okay, I'm in. Take over.
Call RT, have them send down a pediatric vent.
Hemocue's 5.1.
Retinal arteries and veins are bright red.
O-Neg wide open. Feels open to the spine.
Consistent with cyanide.
Like a C-Section. Check ephemerol with compressions.
Pharmacy only had one more cyanide kit.
What? Dammit.
Hospital only stocks three of them.
Lap and pressure.
All right, we need more kits.
You need to deliver the uterus.
Call Mercy, call Lakeside, call... Yeah. Right.
Will they get here in time?
If packing doesn't work,
just clamp it off.
Bradying down.
Okay, okay, side-biting clamp.
Give whatever we got to the daughter.
Mom's pressure's going down to 80.
Nitrate popper for each,
then the daughter gets 30 cc's of sodium nitrate.
Maybe the girl can wait.
Give the mother whatever we got left.
That's a Fallopian tube.
That's an ineffective dose.
Uterine artery runs at the inferior margin?
She needs 10 cc's.
Right? Yeah. Clamp it, now!
Carter... I know!
I got it...
I think I got it.
All right. Stop compressions.
I have a little pulse. Okay.
Okay, trauma kit, open a cut-down tray,

Keep her hemoglobin level under 40%.
And come back with her films.

Hey. Hi, Sweetie...
TURNER: How's that, huh?!
How's that?! How's that?!

Come on, Turner. Still in fib.

Chest tube and intubation tray!
No, wait, Turner-- you're bleeding.
Security!
( equipment clattering )
Good pulse with compressions.
Epi's had time to circulate.
Heart's filling well.
Checking the monitor. Start a second
line of saline, wide open,
and prep the left chest.
Turner!
( monitor flat-lining )
( sighs )
PRATT: Time of death, 00:28.
KLINE: You didn't call him back?
BJERKE: I'm sure, after four weeks?
You don't know that.
Maybe his grandfather died, or something.
There are phones in funeral homes.
Can get you a little Valium
to take the edge off.
Dr. Romano?
What?
Would you like some Valium?
Help you relax.
I don't want to relax.
So you're not going to call him back? No way.
I thought you were crazy about him. I am.
Make sure I have some number eight Biogels.
How are we doing, Dr. Romano?
Never better.
SHIRLEY: Can you scootch over for us?
KLINE: Tank him up with a liter.
Who's that scrubbing in?
Uh, Dr. Starkman, third year.
No. No way. No residents.
Geez, was this table in a freezer?
I know. It can get a little cold.
KLINE: I'll be doing the procedure, Robert.
Once you're out, we'll make
a circumferential cut around the...
Yeah, I know the routine.
Let's just get on with it.
Okay. Set up a pre-op Doppler,
sterile Stryker set.
Where's Corday? I thought she was scrubbing in.
KLINE: What for?
She was with an E.R. patient.
You want me to page her? No. No.
KLINE: All right, mix up a gram of Ancef.
Uh, you may want to put that on the other hand.
Oh... sorry.
BJERKE: Count backwards from ten, Dr. Romano.
Ten...
nine...
( weakly ): eight...
PRATT: Hold still.
MARQUEZ: Tonopen's twenty?
Two drops of iodipine and pred forte.
I'm losing my sight?
Maybe partly?
Between the burn and traumatic glaucoma
but only in the one eye.
What's her pressure?
90/60.
And she's waking up.
You need depth perception
to be a firefighter.
We're not even sure yet.
Where's O.B.?
Coburn came down, took a quick look and went to scrub.
Mia, you were stabbed.
We stabilized you but in order for us to save your uterus
you're going to have to go into surgery.
ABBY: Last crit was 19.
Pratt?
Pratt?
We don't know.
CARTER: Can you tell me
on a scale of one to ten how bad the pain is?
How high? Eight.
No, it's nine.
Sorry to tell you this, Mr. Dressler,
but it looks like you're having a heart attack.
Oh, God. We need to take you upstairs
and unblock the vessel with a balloon catheter.
HALEH: Dr. Carter?
Your dad's on line three.
Okay, thank you.
Do you want us to call your wife?
No, my wife took the kids to Lincoln Park
to watch the eclipse.
( grunting ): I left a message for her at home.
Okay, not to worry.
They're going to take you right up.
Integrelin bolus then 15 migs per hour.
Where's that girl's EEG?
Tech took it up.
Well, then get neurology on it!
Hello.
Hey, Dad.
How are you? Where are you?
John, what the hell happened?
Sorry, what? Where did he get hold of a scalpel?
Too many patients, not enough staff
and not enough medicine.
Which is why you prioritize
based on severity of illness. Oh, no.
Really?
Well, can't we just postpone for a couple of days?
Hey... I'll just stay in Chicago.
This woman has a fatal arrhythmia...
I'm on the phone, Kerry!
I'm sorry.
No, it's just one of those...
Okay.
Yeah, we can reschedule.
( hangs up phone )
Fatal arrhythmia.
That's what happens when you chug too much cyanide.
And are undertreated.
The daughter was less critical.
And could've died.
The girl didn't have a choice.
Waiting room rack is over 30.
I'll take lead for the rest of the shift.
Good.
Hey, you're bleeding.
What?
Your back.
Hey, Malik, can you draw up HIV-hepatitis serologies
on the stabbed gangbanger.
Already to him down to morgue.
Have pathology do it.
Oh, yeah, Cath Lab said they can take this guy in 30.
No, now.
He's losing heart muscle.
Push half a dose of TNK.
It's just going to be one more minute, Mr. Dressler.
Doc... I've got a really bad feeling here.
Ah, don't worry.
We're going to take care of you.
No, no. Do me a favor.
I need a... piece of paper and a pen.
I want to write a note to my kids
just in case I, uh...
I mean, you know, in case they get here and I'm...
Yeah, absolutely.
But we have a really good chance
of reversing...
Dr. Carter, we need you!
Is he under?
KLINE: Well, I hope so.
I'm disarticulating at the elbow.
Way up there on the bovie.
He was asking for you.
I was detained with an unstable pulseless tib-fib.
Well, you're here now.
Two large bore IVs.
Trauma labs, four of O-neg.
Kerry, what are you doing?
Ten-foot fall from scaffolding.
Rebar through the right chest.
Well, C-collar, backboard and a gurney.
Let's get him into... Trauma.
No, can't. Rebar's stuck in a concrete block.
Must be 500 pounds.
MAN: Can't we just pull him off there?
No, he'll bleed to death.
Rebar's compressing the torn vessels.
All right, call the fire department.
Have them bring extrication gear.
Go inside, get a portable monitor and an E cylinder.
WRIGHT: Up there?
Yeah, and get a hemocue.
( strained ): You can't take it out?
We'll do that in the operating room.
Do you feel any numbness or weakness in your legs?
No, not really?
Decreased on the right
but no JVD or tracheal shift.
Look.
What?
JERRY: Dr. Pratt.
Some guy wants to talk to the doctor
who treated that pregnant stab victim.
Take a message.
Are you okay? Sir?
Huh? Oh.
Just get a little winded sometimes.
You ought to get that thing fixed.
What's your name?
Ray. Ray Jamison.
Mr. Jamison, you have any chest pain?
More like palpitations. Comes and goes.
I've been to a couple clinics,
but they keep saying nothing's wrong.
You don't have a doctor?
Medicare kicks in next year.
Ever have an EKG?
Normal, they said.
But my ticker was on good behavior at the time.
JERRY: Dr. Pratt, I really think
you should take this.
He knows something about the assault.
And don't eat those. I can get you something
that at least looks like food.
You don't need to do that.
No, I'm your doctor now.
Thanks.
This is Dr. Pratt.
Yeah, who's this?
Yeah, she's alive, why?
What?
CARTER: Hemocue is 9.4.
WEAVER: Titrate four of MS.
Where's the O-neg?!
Right here.
Do we need an airbag?
Pretty tight.
How much can we raise him?
Oh, maybe an inch or two.
What's his pressure?
It's up to a hundred.
GALLANT: Dr. Carter.
Exam Two's drowning in pulmonary edema.
Who?
The Buddhist nun.
I got it. Go.
In the alley?
The north side.
Why didn't he just bring it in?
'Cause he freaked out.
His wife came home with a baby
and said she gave birth while he was at work.
He saw the news and put it together. Here.
PRATT: Grab a BOA kit.
ABBY: Susan, set up for a neonatal resuscitation.
Where?
Is that for pain?
She's in pain again.
No, this is for the fluid in her lungs.
I can give her morphine,
but it will suppress her breathing even more.
( chanting )
( Pratt groans )
Where?
I don't know. He just said in the alley.
( gasping )
No breath sound on the right.
WEAVER: It's a massive hemothorax.
He needs a chest tube tray.
Inflate.
( man cries out )
CORDAY: I'll retract the supinator, you divide.
KLINE: Mosquito.
Radial nerve.
Bone saw.
( saw buzzing )
Four of morphine on board.
( monks chanting softly )
I better check BP.
No.
No more BPs.
Find anything?
No.
Are you sure this wasn't a prank?
Wait, wait, shh! Listen.
There must be three liters in there.
Grab a sterile base, and the biggest one we got.
Tachy at 140, barely has a pulse.
Hang another two.
Doc, get rid of the O2.
Make it fast.
Clamping the tube.
( clamp clicking ) Go!
( saw buzzing )
KLINE: Ring cut through the periosteum.
You want the final honors?
No.
( saw buzzing )
( raspy breathing )
( monks chanting softly )
ABBY: Why didn't he put him
where we could see him?
He didn't want it to get run over.
Find him?
No.
( saw buzzing )
Slide the backboard up here. Hurry up.
CHEN: Pulse ox is down to 83.
Get ready to put the O2 back on.
He's free. ( sawing stops )
Roll him! ( man groaning )
KLINE: Through the cortex.
Arm's free.
Rasp back.
Don't want a bone spur.
Take a little more periosteum.
3-0 vicryl.
( raspy breathing )
( sharp inhalation )
( breathing stops )
Hey, over here!
( softly ): Hey.
There we go.
I got ya.
Hey there, little guy.
( Lewis chuckling )
Can you hear me? Hello?
Yeah, barely.
What's going on?
One of our doctors was hurt yesterday,
had to be evacuated to Burundi.
Hurt? How?
We're expecting a fourth,
but they're having trouble with her visa.
Luka, you got to speak up.
Can your contact
at the State Department push her visa through?
What contact?
I thought you knew someone there.
My family had a friend that was ambassador to Uruguay, but...
Call him.
I don't know him.
Can't the Alliance fix it?
( woman speaking French )
Not enough.
( speaking French )
Okay, I'll be right there.
What?
We're trying to travel to Matenda,
but the main road is blocked.
There's a cholera epidemic in the refugee population
and we can't even get them rehydration solution.
You want someone to come and pitch in for a couple weeks?
What?
I've already had my shots, my visa.
I thought you changed your mind.
Yeah, but, you know, if you're stretched.
( speaking French )
Okay, I got to go.
Can you come now?
Yeah, okay.
Get on a plane.
Charge to 360. Hello?
When did he arrest? Now.
Clear.
Is that my MI?
Dressler. V-fib.
MALIK: Bigeminy flipped into V-tach
when we started rolling.
We never made the elevator.
How many times was he shocked?
Third one coming up.
Amp of epi, I'll intubate.
What the hell's he still doing down here?
I told you Cath Lab said 30 minutes.
Clear!
All right, prep 100 of lidocaine.
LOCKHART: He's a little tachy at 165.
Slight flow murmur.
Fontanelle's soft, but sunken.
He's definitely dry.
He's full term.
Mom's in post-op.
Hemodynamically stable, and they saved her uterus.
How is he?
Heel stick a glucose,
but I think we have
a healthy baby.
He's a screamer.
Wouldn't you be?
Literally ripped from
your mother's womb by some lunatic.
Hell of a way to come into the world.
Yeah, but life only gets better after that.
I'll bolus 20 per kilo
I'll do it.
What?
If accu-check is less than 50,
then I need to push D-25.
Whatever you say, doctor.
Asystole.
Give me the pacing pads.
Let's push three more of epi.
GALLANT: Resume CPR.
Family's here.
The, uh, the letter.
What?
The pen and paper.
Did you give him a pen and paper?
No.
Why not?
What?
He asked for a pen and some paper
to write a letter to his kids.
He didn't ask me.
There it is.
It's just a sub-Q bleeder.
Clamp that off.
You want cautery?
No, I'll use the silver nitrate sticks.
Don't contaminate the field.
Robert?
Bovie that bleeder.
Pick-ups.
Robert, it's Elizabeth.
Lizzie...
She's one hell of a surgeon.
So beautiful.
Done.
That was just a small EBL,
but we can order a post-op CBC
just to be safe.
You're taking good care of me.
I'm trying, yes.
I love you, Elizabeth.
You need to get some rest.
Let's put a fresh pressure dressing on
and I'll check it later.
PRATT: Hey, you have a visitor.
Is that...?
It's your baby.
You had a boy.
Is he okay?
He's great.
Active.
Likes to play hide-and-seek.
My baby.
You want to hold him?
Yeah.
Come on, little guy.
I got you, I got you.
Still asystole.
He's had two of atropine?
Oh, yeah.
All right, increase the pulse duration to 20 milliseconds.
Dr. Carter.
How long we been going?
62 minutes.
All right, stop.
You can stop.
Mrs. Dressler, I'm Dr. Carter.
Your husband came in with chest pain.
He was having a heart attack.
He's dead?
We were just about to move him up to the cath lab
to unblock the main artery when he went into cardiac arrest.
And I couldn't get him back.
Did he know?
Did he know what was happening?
Yeah, he wanted me...
to, um, tell you that he loved--
loves you all very much.
Hypertensive encephalopathy on nipride.
Let me guess. No ICU beds.
The gang war continues.
Dyspareunia waiting on
gram stain and wet mount.
Dyspareunia's better than no pareunia.
And we have Mr. Jamison here,
who's back in normal sinus
after yours truly picked up atrial flutter.
I though heart monitors did that.
No more Chihuahua?
It's a miracle, what did you do?
I just flipped the circuit breaker back on.
But now that we know what it is,
you can be treated with a simple prescription.
I come see you at your office?
This is my office.
Or was.
What?
I just work in the hospital.
Well that's too bad.
You're a fine doctor.
Thank you.
See you, sweetness.
Call you later.
Congratulations, Greg.
You survived the County experience.
Oh, no, not just survived it.
I whooped its ass.
Hey.
Hey.
Did you see the eclipse?
Yeah.
Sort of.
Pretty freaky, huh?
Yeah, I guess.
You have a rough shift?
Yeah, there was this guy, this MI.
Asked me for a pen and some paper
to write a note to his kids and...
Couldn't save him, but I could have...
What?
Nothing.
Nothing's right here.
Hey.
I haven't seen you in a week.
That's it?
Luka called me...
looking for you.
He was under the impression I might know where you were.
You're going, right?
To Africa.
It's not Rio, but it's not here.
WEAVER: Are you supposed to be in there?
It's a First Aid kit.
Damn near the only thing that survived.
How was your last shift?
Lots of excitement.
Well, if you're ever bored, God knows we need the staff.
Yeah.
HALEH: Dr. Pratt!
You forgot to give Jamison his "didge" prescription.
Jing-Mei can do it.
.25 or .125?
No, lower dose.
Next available appointment at the cardiology clinic
is in four months, that's okay?
( sighs )
Just let me write it.
After care instructions, too.
Return to the ER in a week for a "didge" level.
Tell him to call Dr. Pratt, make sure I'm on duty first.
I thought you were going to Northwestern.
Ah, guess I'm more of a Southside doc.
You staying here?
What the hell.
This place kind of grows on you.
