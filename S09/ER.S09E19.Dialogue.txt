Previously on ER...
A woman I went to med school with
has a patient who's very sick-- a young boy...
And the surgical team
that performed it in Croatia has disbanded since then.
( screaming ) What?
We got a guy in here, says he's your husband.
We wanted burgers,
so we took a cab to this drive-through--
Turns out to be a mini-chapel.
So I spoke to an attorney.
Uh, yeah, me, too.
He said annulling the marriage should be fairly easy.
That's what my guy said.
Any word on Eric?
I don't expect any.
It's like a bear hibernating.
Any patient here over six hours
is a failure of your management skills, not mine.
Treat, turf, or dispo.
( grunts )
( cheering )
( whimpering )
Okay, okay, okay.
Okay... okay.
Okay, okay.
Okay, come on, come...
Please, please, please.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Okay.
LEWIS: Clear.
Got a rhythm.
Sinus tach. LEWIS: Got a pulse.
Trying for pressure.
Good breath sounds.
Satting at 91.
Put him on 100% non-rebreather.
Pupils...
four millimeters and reactive.
B.P. is 90 palp.
All right, he's back, whoever he is.
Hey. Hey.
What's Kerry doing down here?
Romano damage control.
Are you making a lab run, Malik?
It ain't my lunch. Thank you.
What do you got there?
That is my NGO pack
from L'Alliance de Medicine Internationale.
I thought you said you weren't going?
Yeah, I'm not.
Well, why did they send it to you?
I guess they were hoping
that I'm going to change my mind.
My shots are good for a year.
You didn't sign anything, did you?
No. It's a volunteer organization.
They can't draft you.
Luka is still going to the Congo.
I know. He doesn't listen to me, either.
So, with Weaver back down here,
does that mean that Romano is history?
He moved his office out of Exam One,
but that could just be
because the urine smell is burning his eyes.
Oh, she's probably just working a couple shifts
for appearance's sake, just to keep people
from freaking out or killing him.
We tried that. ROMANO: Carter!
They just keep putting him back together.
Dr. John Carter, meet your new med students.
My students?
Yeah. You are Chief Resident, aren't you?
Yes. And this is still a teaching hospital, is it not?
Yes, but...
Good, then start teaching.
Don't worry. He's a lot smarter than he looks.
Dr. Carter's been with us for what, four years now?
Nine.
Ah, well, hopefully, you'll all be, uh, quicker studies.
Watch your backs!
Hey, you want this, Carter?
George Zito, complaining of eight
out of ten chest pain.
That was 20 minutes ago. Now it's a five.
Yeah, a cigarette would've done the same thing.
You ever have a heart attack before, Mr. Zito?
You mean, besides this one?
Pulse is 92. B.P. is, uh, 155/100.
All right, Trauma One.
Carter, Air Rescue's bringing in an MVA
ten minutes out.
Yeah, and my dance card is full.
I'll get Lewis.
So, who can tell me the risk factors
for coronary artery disease?
Chopper's bringing a trauma in.
We're going to need a second line for lidocaine.
Is it Unit 27, the helicopter?
I don't know. Why?
Chuck flies with the 27.
Oh, right, Chuck.
Yeah, I know, it's weird,
but there's something about him.
He makes me feel good.
Not that way.
Well, that way, too.
You know what I mean.
Uh, his name's James Shaw.
He's on Mellaril, per Dr. Kazanjian.
Mellaril?
An anti-psychotic.
James, how many Mellaril did you take?
They're all gone. I need some more.
If you take too many pills, your heart can stop.
The pills scramble the signal.
It keeps them from finding me.
Keeps who from finding you?
They know my neural pattern.
No, nobody's going to find you here, James.
They monitor the 40 hertz range.
Abby. Yeah.
Your brother's on the phone.
What?!
Eric.
( whimpering )
Uh, okay, I-I'll be right there.
You can tell because it tastes like metal.
Is your brother okay? I don't know.
I haven't heard from him in two months.
Okay, I have to leave before they scan this place.
James, listen to me.
James, they can't scan you in here, okay,
because radiology is upstairs,
and the floors and the walls are lined
with lead.
Okay, my name's Abby.
I'm going to help you.
Okay.
Okay.
Give him five more of Haldol.
Use restraints if you have to.
Call his PMD, and let him know he's here.
( sighing )
Can you watch him?
I have to take a phone call.
What line?
Hmm?
What line's my brother on?
Oh, he, uh, he said he'd call back in an hour.
Call back from where?
I don't know.
Well, did he sound... in trouble?
Did he sound like he was all right?
I don't know.
He said he'd call back in an hour.
Are you the only person in this hospital
that doesn't know about my crazy family?
What?
Can you just please come and find me when he calls back?
I don't care where I am.
Drag me out of a stall if you have to.
Yeah, can I?
Abby, could you help me over here, please?
Sure, one second.
Hey, Mom, it's me.
( sighs )
Uh, Eric called, and I was wondering
if you'd heard from him.
Can you call me at work? Thanks.
All right, I got a guy who came in complaining
of a severe sore throat.
I want to send off a culture and a CBC.
Okay.
This is Andrew.
Hi, Andrew.
ROMANO: What is this guy still doing here?
I'm still working him up.
Yeah, wrong. Hold this.
Take these-- they're for you.
I'm already seeing eight.
Well, now you're seeing 12, and I'm going
to give you four more every 15 minutes, so I suggest
you start turfing people,
beginning with sore throat boy here.
He has a low-grade fever and adenopathy.
You know, if I wanted a nurse's opinion...
well, I don't know what I'd do,
because, quite frankly, it's never happened.
Say "Ahh."
Ahh.
Yeah, he's got no exudates.
Write him a scrip for erythro,
and get him out of this bed.
He's in a lot of pain.
Yeah, that is why they call it a sore throat.
Viral pharyngitis will go away on its own.
If it's viral,
why would you give him antibiotics?
You've kept him here two hours.
Call it a consolation prize.
Hi. I'm Rocket Romano.
I'm the head of the ER.
Uh, you look a little lost.
Dr. Horvat. You're a doctor?
Surgeon. I'm visiting from Croatia.
Ah, what a coincidence.
I'm also a visiting surgeon.
Can I buy you a cup of coffee or something?
Um... Hey.
You've been here long? No.
You two know each other.
We went to the same medical school.
No doubt.
Gordana is here to observe a correction
of a congenital heart repair on a young boy from Croatia.
You don't want to get too close to this one.
Why not? Let's just say
it's not a good idea.
What a beautiful language.
Dr. Kovac, I don't want
to keep you from your patients,
and by the looks of the board,
it looks like you're running a little behind, so...
It's a pleasure meeting you.
He seems nice enough.
He's a prince.
It's good to see you.
It's good to see you, too, Luka.
You look great.
You, too.
I wish I could have set up your surgery here.
I toured Mercy's facilities,
it's a very modern hospital with all-new equipment.
Maybe it's just as well then.
That's not what I meant.
It's okay, this place is falling apart.
No money, no staff, it's perfect for me.
Luka! 26-year-old
passenger in a rollover MVA.
Okay, Trauma Two.
Do you want to see what American ER docs do?
I guess so.
He was initially awake with a GCS of 13,
but he had a prolonged extraction,
and we tubed him for LOC.
Susan, this is Gordana, a surgeon from back home.
Hi. Did he talk before he crashed?
Headache, belly pain?
No. He was just pretty much
cursing me out till he crumped.
Do you want me to call a social worker down on this?
She may not be mother of the year,
but I don't sense that she'd hurt the child.
The baby's sick, and the mother's evasive.
It could be Munchausen's by proxy.
Let's just get our test back.
Hey, is this a spot check, or are you slumming?
Here, help me put this on.
I'm still working shifts.
Wow, the perks down here never stop, do they?
What are you doing, Robert?
Observation and evaluation.
Oh, you mean belittling and bullying?
Gloves, too.
You want both?
( alarms )
Somebody page neurosurgery.
I thought I could smell blood.
No sats.
It's the Marilyn Manson manicure.
What's that mean? The nail polish keeps the oxygen
saturation probe from working.
Abby, when you get a chance, grab some acetone,
and get a good nail on him.
ROMANO: Crepitus around the sternum.
You going to be up there all day?
Just till I secure the airway.
I saw it go in.
No offense. I check all the paramedic tubes.
Yeah, since you guys miss 50% of the time.
Quiet, I can't hear any breath sounds.
Bag him again.
Pressure's dropping 70 systolic.
I need a first crit. Tube is through the cords.
I told you. ( alarm )
Did we get a blood line on him?
You want to do it? No, thanks.
Did anyone page Corday? She's still next door.
Does she need a personal invite?
Triple lumen kit and size eight sterile gloves.
Pain is non-reproducible.
First it's here, now it's here, here.
That's not my fault? Is there a problem?
Mrs. Reynolds had a subjective fever last night.
Which magically resolved,
along with her abdominal pain, after passing gas.
You're going to charge my insurance company 50 grand
to tell me I needed to fart?
Her belly is definitely tender.
There could be a pusatile mass.
So admit her to service and work her up. Sorry.
Elizabeth!
Hey!
Hey!
Don't you "Hey" me.
If you want to get a CT scan and re-consult me, fine.
Or you can send her home
and bring her back for a re-check,
but I refuse to admit her
just so that you can clear ER beds
in 30 minutes.
Dr. Corday, can you take a look at this patient?
( huffs )
Let me guess-- infectious gangrene from a paper cut?
LEWIS: I can't get a flash. ( whiny mimicking )
B.P. 66 systolic.
He's hypotensive. His vasculature is collapsed.
LEWIS: He probably has an intraabdominal hemorrhage.
Tubed in the field for LOC but had belly pain.
Another liter up.
Ah, this clotted again.
What's your excuse
for not taking this one up, Lizzie?
No exposed bowel?
Give it a rest, Robert.
He's got intraperitoneal fluid.
All bleeding eventually stops.
You can probably leave this one here, too.
KOVAC: O-silk and op site. Hook up the infuser.
This isn't working. We only have so many rooms.
I'm going to do a cut down.
( alarm )
He's slowing down. Pulse is 72.
He's going to need a box if
you guys don't pull it together.
Sats are 80.
Run in the blood,
and get a post-line chest.
ROMANO: All right, enough
Did you even listen to his lungs? Yes!
He's not moving much air in this,
other one's worse. Tension pneumo on the right.
Decreased on the right with tracheal shift.
Chest tube tray?
Left lung's still up. It's not from your line.
Probably the intubation.
We don't know that.
They should have heard it
in the helicopter and needled it.
Betadine. Even if they did, and I'm not--
saying they did-- you can't hear anything
in those choppers.
Knife.
Abby, watch
what you're doing.
I didn't drop it.
You did.
Could you step outside,
please? Thank you.
KOVAC: She's just observing.
Well, I have enough people in here just observing.
If you think you can do it all yourself,
Susan, we can all step out.
LEWIS: Might go faster.
Might go a lot faster
if he came in properly intubated.
I'm glad to see your morale boosting
and leadership skills are rubbing off.
How do you say "Bite my big one" in Croatian?
He's bradying down, if anybody's interested.
CARTER: Take a deep breath for me.
Is there any pain with that?
No.
Is that Blumberg's sign?
No, Murphy's sign for chololithiasis.
Do you think he has diverticulitis? No.
But the pain's in the left lower quadrant.
He's too young.
What about a kidney stone?
It causes a lot more pain.
Ulcerative colitis?
Gives you bloody diarrhea.
With the previous appy,
should you worry about intestinal obstruction?
Maybe, but there's no vomiting.
What about a femoral hernia? No mass.
Don't you have a question?
We get a lunch break?
Are you going to do a rectal?
Eventually.
I've never done a rectal.
What about ultrasounding the belly?
Okay, you and you are shortness of breath.
You and you,
take vertigo.
And last but not least, knee pain.
Watch each other do an H&P,
discuss the case with your partner,
present back to me.
Should we start...?
Da, da, da, da, no more questions.
Thanks, they were giving me a headache.
Me, too. Hey, Pratt.
I got something for you.
I'm seeing too many patients already.
Not a patient.
Gallant, I got something for you, too.
What's this?
You forget what today is?
What? Payday?
Ooh, match day.
Good luck, gentlemen.
I thought you matched here already.
No, man, I was just doing a one-year transitional.
I got County.
Oh, man, I'm sorry about that.
Oh, no, man, I asked for County.
Why?
Congratulations, Gallant.
Glad you're going to be with us.
Come on, come on.
Talk to me, baby, talk to me, talk to me.
( laughing )
I got Northwestern, baby.
I'm going uptown.
( laughing )
What's this?
LOL with phlebitis in Exam Four.
Do you know how many patients I'm juggling?
Not enough if you have time for dancing in the hall.
( sighs )
How much out the right tube?
Nearly 600 cc's.
B.P.'s up to 92/66.
Let's hope his brain survived the lack of perfusion.
Can you tell me where curtain two is?
You just passed it.
Oh, nurse, could I ask you a question?
In a minute.
Did my brother call back?
I thought he disappeared.
Where's Jerry?
On his break.
E.R. Hold, please.
That him?
No.
Could you tell Dr. Kovac I'm leaving?
He should be back in a minute.
We just sent that trauma upstairs.
And I'm Abby, by the way.
Dr. Horvat.
Hi. Hi.
You know Luka from Croatia?
We're old friends.
We went to school together.
He was what you call a character back then.
Luka?
Oh, yes. Always playing practical jokes
on the other students
and our professors.
Really?
You could always tell when Luka was in the building
because you'd hear him laughing.
You know that laugh of his. It's contagious.
He doesn't really laugh much at work.
He seems like he's changed.
He's been through a lot, I guess.
Still, I thought I'd find him
married to some American supermodel
with three children and a dog.
His wife, Danijela, would have wanted that.
LEWIS: Abby, page Psych again.
They got to see this guy. Okay.
Excuse me.
He's getting restless.
Give him some more Haldol. Okay.
Do I need to apologize to her?
No, she seems pretty cool.
Then I'll apologize to you.
Sorry, I didn't mean to turn into a bitch
in that trauma room.
No, don't worry about it.
I was a little unfocused.
Did you talk to your brother?
No. He said he was going to call back, but he didn't.
Guys never call when you want them to.
Hey, did air rescue leave yet?
What am I, air traffic control now?
Why don't you use the helicopter check system?
What's that?
Go up on the roof and check.
If the helicopter isn't there, they left.
Frank, are you taking anything for your cholesterol?
No. Good.
Hey, can you call Dr. Meyers in Psych
and tell him I'm sending a psychotic patient up to his office
if he doesn't come down here and assess this guy.
( heavy breathing )
How you doing, James?
Oh, um, okay... I um...
I need to go now, 'cause I...
um, 'cause I can feel the pulses.
They're trying to use the microwaves
to penetrate my synaptic code.
Okay, James, you need to relax, all right?
Okay.
I'm going to give you some medicine to help you do that.
Okay.
Okay. Okay...
( grunting )
( yells )
No! Wait! No! Wait!
( groaning loudly )
Okay, stop it.
James...
look at me.
James, James, you know I'm not trying to hurt you.
( heavy breathing )
I'm keeping you safe.
That's what I do.
Abby, your brother's on line one.
Oh, yeah, thanks.
( breathing slows )
Eric?
Where are you?
Are you okay?
Well, what's going on? I...
Yes, he's here.
We caught him.
We have no other choice.
He's not cooperating.
He knows things. We have to proceed
with the surgical interrogation.
Okay, are you on your meds?
Well, why didn't you go to a hospital?
Okay, okay.
Well, what's the phone number
of the... of the booth y-you're using?
Stop talking to them!
I won't let you...
( loud mumbling )
( fire alarm blares )
( James screaming )
( screaming continues )
Frank, call security and cancel the fire alarm.
( James screaming )
James!
Look out, look out, look out.
( alarm continues blaring )
Hey, just hang out, I'll be right back.
When are they going to stop this?
Well, usually it doesn't take more than
four or five hours.
( snickers )
You think I'm kidding?
Now you see why I want to get the hell out of this place.
Well, it's not all bad.
You know what I mean.
You know, you can get a job at Northwestern, too.
I left County once, but I came back.
Something about this place just gets in your blood.
Uh. ( chuckles ) It's probably the asbestos.
( chuckles )
So, you want to help me celebrate later or what?
What do you have in mind?
Hey, Dr. Chen, she spiked a fever.
Oh, am I... am I interrupting something?
Yeah. No.
Listen, Mona Reynolds,
she dropped her pressure in the CT scan,
and her temp's 39.6.
Find me later?
Her white count's 22.
She's in a lot of pain.
I paged Romano.
How are we doing, Mrs. Reynolds?
( groaning ): My gut's gonna bust!
Let me guess, she ruptured her intraperitoneal pus.
GALLANT: Pressure's 86/60.
We're going to need another liter. She's septic.
Yeah, courtesy of Dr. Corday.
( groaning ): Oh, my gut's killing me!
Yes, it will if we don't fix it.
( gags )
( coughs )
A simple please and thank you would have sufficed.
Okay, let's grab a two-gram dose of cefoxitin.
A gram of P.R. Tylenol
and four of M.S.
Should I page Dr. Corday?
Screw that. If she can't diagnose a subphrenic abscess,
she sure as hell can't fix one.
You know, you should get a clean dressing.
Just grab me a 4x4.
Whoa. Ulcer looks necrotic.
You need to get that
debrided.
If I were you two, I would concentrate on my patient.
She has a history of peptic ulcer disease,
perforation two years ago,
chronic subclinical fevers, weight loss, cough--
it's classic.
We still have to page Corday to book an O.R.
Forget it.
She's already septic.
Open drainage could kill her. We'll have to this
under ultrasound.
Set her up in Trauma Two.
( coughs )
Short of breath, history of CHF,
noncompliant with meds and diet.
Wet crackles on exam.
Orders?
CBC, chem panel, 40 of lasix,
chest X ray and EKG.
Great.
Good. Next.
Positional Vertigo with positive berene test.
How's the cerebellar function?
FNF, HTS, and R.A.M. all normal.
Ma'am, can you go like this?
Good.
Hep lock, five of Compazine, five of Valium. Next.
Knee pain. History of rheumatoid arthritis.
No trauma or calf tenderness.
We're thinking ruptured baker cyst.
Dr. Carter, telephone call.
Okay, just a sec.
What did you order?
Ultrasound.
MALIK: Hey, Carter, your old guy
just coded.
All right, 600 ibuprofen.
Jerry, take a message.
Uh, I'm sorry, he's with a patient.
Can I take a message?
Uh, just a second.
Dr. Weaver, can you take this telephone call for Dr. Carter?
He's running a code.
They say it's urgent.
Yeah, this is Kerry Weaver, Dr. Carter's supervisor.
What's the problem?
Turn up the suction. He's throwing PVCs.
Increase crichoid pressure. You want Lidocaine?
Not just yet.
I got it, I'm in. Bag him.
Carter, you got a phone call. I'll take this.
I'm okay. I got this. Sats are coming up.
John, you really need to take this call.
He's in V-tach.
All right, charge to 200.
It's your grandmother. Good pulse with compressions.
John...
Charge.
Uh, okay, clear.
Still in V-tach.
What did I say? 200?
Charge to 300, and give me an amp of epi.
I'm sorry.
Is she dead?
I'm sorry.
Charge.
Clear.
Still in fib. 360.
How long do you keep trying?
CARTER: And clear.
Another amp of epi.
It's been 25 minutes.
Does anyone survive after this long?
Hold compressions.
Fine v fib.
Resume compressions. Charge again to 360.
What else can you try?
Procainamide-- one gram,
30 migs per minute.
Is that okay with lidocaine
and amiodarone? Clear.
What's the most times you've ever shocked somebody?
Still no change. 360 one more time.
But I thought if you don't get them back
after three shocks, you never will.
And clear.
Well, I guess you heard wrong.
Sinus tach.
Good carotid pulse.
Let's finish the pronestyl load
and start a drip at five per minute.
Pupils are fixed and dilated.
Is he ever going to wake up?
Well, let's just wait and see.
ABG on 100%. AC 14.
Tidal volume of 700.
Abby, I told you not to call DCFS
on the baby Miles case.
I didn't.
I called a social worker.
Mom looked like she could use some help.
Yeah, and Adele called DCFS.
Hey, did you find him?
Who? No.
She lost a psych patient.
I was in the process of restraining him
when he bolted.
Wait, did you call Security?
He had already left the building.
Frank, could you get me an address on this phone number?
Is this patient a threat?
I don't know. Where is this?
It's a phone booth.
Chuck.
Are you leaving?
Yeah. How's the patient?
He went upstairs.
Hopefully he's not brain dead
from the prolonged hypotension.
It was a good intubation, Sooze.
You saw it.
One, call me Susan,
and two, his lung was down.
Look, do you know how hard it is
to hear anything on that chopper, with the rotors
and the vibration in the headphones?
I do know, but...
Look, that lung was up when I transported him.
He had a tension pneumo.
You should have caught it.
You didn't.
I stood up for you.
What the hell's that supposed to mean?
I don't need you standing up for me.
What, you felt like you had to
because I'm a nurse and you're a doctor?
No, that is not it.
Well, maybe a little.
I know how they bag
on the EMTs.
( laughing softly )
What is so funny?
Nothing. We just...
We bag on doctors all the time.
( chuckling )
You're protecting me.
Oh, you're too much, Dr. Lewis.
Chuck.
Yeah?
Chuck.
Susan.
Charles. Susan.
There's a dead body in here.
I don't mind.
( laughs ): It's gross.
It's disrespectful.
It's wrong.
Um, sorry, I-I was looking for Carter.
Um, he was just here, wasn't he?
Yeah.
Yeah, but, um, he left.
Okay.
Was that a dead body in there?
American doctors can be very unprofessional.
Kovac, uh, you ever drain
an intraperitoneal abscess?
That's a surgical procedure. I'm talking to her.
You're a surgeon?
Yes.
Good, come with me, now, now.
I got a septic patient
moments away from full-blown badness.
I need you to help me put a catheter
in a pocket of pus under ultrasonic guidance.
Think you can do that?
Perhaps, but... Good.
Pressure's better.
110/72 after the second liter.
What's her temp? Still 39.
Cefoxitin running in.
Good. I need you to sign this.
( crying ): What is it?
It's a consent for the procedure.
What happens if I don't?
You'll probably die.
I don't think I should do this.
It'll be okay. I'll help you.
What are they saying?
Pillow talk.
The kidney stone in Two is pain free.
You can send him home with vicodin and a strainer.
Uh, Eleanor Carter.
It might be under Eleanor Ferguson.
Mrs. Drummond can have ten of compazine.
She can come back tomorrow if the pain persists.
Okay. What about the kid in, uh, Curtain Three?
Dr. Lewis can take care of everybody else.
Okay. Hey, you all right?
Yeah, I'll be all right.
Thanks, Malik. Yeah.
Uh, can you check again for me?
Hello? Hello?
Pressure's steady. 100 systolic.
Has anybody seen Abby?
No, sorry.
Finder needle.
Try not to perforate the diaphragm.
CARTER: What are you doing?
What does it look like?
A lawsuit.
Advancing.
No aspiration.
You're doing good.
Sorry to hear about your grandmother, Carter.
Thank you. Um, I need to go home.
Susan's going to cover for me.
How old was she?
78.
We should all be so lucky.
Okay, there's pus. Now pull out more. Good. Wire.
Uh, fine, go ahead.
A couple more Croatians,
I could clean house around here.
Trocar and pigtail.
Be right back.
Pull the needle out, and put the Trocar
right over the wire.
Hey, Carter.
Do you know anyone in the State Department?
Um, why?
Uh, my friend Gordana
is trying to get a little boy into this country
for an operation, but there is some sort of a problem.
Luka, I'm really sorry.
I can't help you with this right now.
Jerry, have you seen Abby?
Nope.
Can you find her for me?
Sure.
Hey, Dad, it's me.
No, I didn't get ahold of Mom.
Yeah, are you sure
that you're going to make the 5:30 flight?
Okay, well, no, I'll just leave right from here
to come to the airport to pick you up.
Okay.
( sniffles ): No, I'm good.
Yeah, I know. Bye.
I've been looking for you.
Hey, I've been looking for you.
Carter. Got a 26-year-old with stridor
in severe respiratory distress.
I can't tube him.
His epiglottis is the size of my fist.
All right, nothing's open.
Put him in Three.
Pre-Op labs, blood cultures times two,
soft tissue lateral of the neck, three grams of Unasyn.
Pulse ox is down to 85.
He's barely moving any air.
I saw this guy today for a sore throat.
Romano told me to turf him.
CARTER: One, two, three.
We need a surgical airway.
You ever do a crike before?
No.
Well, you're about to.
Prep and drape the neck.
Abby, can you open a Melker kit?
What comes next?
Find the cricho- thyroid space.
Do it.
Can you leave right after this?
Yeah. I'm ready to go right now.
Angle the needle at 45 degrees.
Good, 'cause I really
don't want to do this alone.
Do what?
CARTER: Aspirate air.
It's all the arrangements--
just everything that has to be taken care of.
Guidewire next.
What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?
Where were you going?
To get Eric.
What?
Needle out. 11 blade.
Yeah, he called from a truck stop
outside of Des Moines.
Just enough to pass the introducer.
Okay.
When did this happen?
This afternoon.
Oh, and I need you to write me a scrip for Depakote
and Zyprexa. ( huffs )
Introducer... out.
Okay, bag him.
Sats are coming up.
Nice work, Pratt.
What's wrong?
My grandmother died today.
Just didn't wake up from her nap.
Oh, Carter, I'm so sorry.
No one told me.
Hey, I got it.
Let's get out of here.
Yeah, she called me, like, three days...
She was on some new committee.
She wanted me to hear somebody speak
about a wetlands learning center.
She knew I hated that stuff.
I think she just wanted to see me.
Well, you spent more time with her than anybody.
( sighs ): She called again last night,
and I saw her number on the caller ID,
and I just... I didn't pick it up.
Well, she lived a very full and happy life,
and you were a big part of that.
She wasn't sick, she wasn't in pain.
she was in her own bed.
That's not a bad way to go.
And I'll be back tonight.
The flight's only an hour.
Do you have to go?
I mean, my dad's flying in.
I got to do all the funeral arrangements.
I just... I have to go get him.
Why? I mean, Eric's been gone for weeks.
What's one more day?
He's off his meds,
and if I don't go now, he might disappear again.
I'll be back tonight.
John... Go.
Go find your brother.
My grandmother will still be dead
when you get back.
Well, what should I tell Dr. Corday?
That she's welcome, and that the least she can do
is admit this patient to surgical ICU.
Good God, it's the Stepford children.
Where's your handler?
Dr. Carter said
you'd be shepherding us for the rest of the shift.
Oh, well, isn't he generous with my life. Come on.
Wean him down to 50% and check a gas in an hour.
Dr. Pratt, how would you like to present some cases
to the future of medicine?
No, thanks. It was not a request.
Okay, everyone, listen up.
This is what happens when your chief forces you
to clear beds at the cost of proper examination.
Even a sore throat can result in a near mortality.
Now, this particular patient came in
complaining of odynophagia.
WOMAN: It hurts to swallow.
I checked this guy's throat.
( laughs ): See, posterior pharynx looks benign...
but when pain is out of proportion to exam,
one must then visualize the epiglottis,
either with a lateral X ray of the neck
or by looking down the throat with a fiber-optic scope
or a right-angled mirror.
I can't help it if the guy's a wimp.
Epiglottitis is a pediatric illness, junior.
Maybe back in the day,
but we tend to see it in adults now more and more...
if one takes the time to look for it.
I had to crike this guy.
Well, good for you.
Don't ever do this.
Get out, now. Let's go. Move. Move now, move!
What's the matter with you?
Get out of here!
Congratulations, smart ass.
You just bought yourself a month of midnights.
Good. I love the nightlife.
Where's your friend?
Dr. Horvat left.
I heard Romano had her doing surgery in the Trauma Room.
She drained an abscess. It wasn't a big deal.
Unless there are complications.
Uh, look,
I think you may have gotten the wrong impression
today in Exam Four,
when you were looking for Carter.
You mean, with the flight nurse?
Chuck, and technically, we're married.
Oh, so it's technically okay
to boff your husband in the hospital?
We weren't boffing. We were talking.
( laughing ): Good night, Susan.
It's still not the same as a patient's mother.
Hey, at least I used an empty room.
Oh.
Uh, thank you.
What are you still doing here?
I'm, uh, picking up my dad at the airport before I go home.
Good. Do you remember any genetic disorders
that cause a buildup of ethylene glycol?
Not off-hand,
but if it's not in Harrison's, it probably doesn't exist.
I mean, there are hundreds of rare ailments
that fall under glycogen storage diseases,
amino acid disorders of metabolism...
You could try a MEDLINE search for substances
that would give you a false positive for ethylene glycol.
You might get lucky.
You went, uh, pretty long and hard on that guy earlier.
Yeah, I figured it was the least I could do.
He was dying.
If you need to take a couple days...
I'm not on till Saturday.
Good night.
Okay, make a three-centimeter incision
in the fifth intercostal space, mid-axillary line.
What are you doing? I am teaching.
All right, all right, harder, honey--
you got to give it all you got. Stop.
Aim for the ispilateral nipple at a 45-degree angle
while you keep aspirating.
Somebody broke his ribs doing CPR.
Now he needs chest tubes and volume for hypotension.
It could have bagged his spleen too.
Then do an ultrasound.
Look, you coded him for 35 minutes, Carter.
He's brain dead.
He'll probably arrest in the next four hours,
and he's got no next of kin.
We might as well get the maximum student benefit out of him.
You're in. Unhook and run in 500 cc's. No, I said stop.
I'm about to cannulate... Get out of here.
Everybody, get out. Hey.
What the hell's the matter with you?
Look, you need to go home.
You need to get the hell out of here right now.
( clattering )
Hey.
I didn't think you'd come.
( sighs )
I wasn't sure you'd be here.
What's going on?
Oh, been traveling, uh, you know...
here, there... visiting old friends,
just, uh, trying to reconnect,
and, uh... keep in touch.
Not with me.
Not with Maggie.
You know that guy?
No, do you?
Does he look familiar to you?
He's been looking at me like he knows me.
No.
They all have been.
I don't know.
Did you notice that when you walked in?
This is a weird place, isn't it?
Yeah.
I'm glad you came.
I got turned around.
I don't know this area very well.
This is a strange part of the country.
You about ready to get out of here?
I need to pay for my coffee.
Okay.
I don't have any money.
Don't tell me your HMO doesn't cover
somebody to do that for you.
Eh, you know what they say--
you want something done right...
Is that why you thought
you could perform a surgical procedure in the ER?
It worked, didn't it?
Well, she's on dopamine and still febrile.
The good news is,
we haven't had to intubate... yet.
She could have died.
I still haven't ruled that out.
It was a good call, Robert.
Unfortunately, the drainage was incomplete.
There were loculations that you couldn't reach,
which means I'll have to do an open laparotomy.
It's a damn shame that you didn't catch it the first time.
Subphrenic abscess is a surgical disease.
They don't see it much down here.
Robert, I would have caught it if you'd let me,
and she'd be cooling down on Zosyn before surgery.
Now she's more of a mess than if you'd done nothing.
Did that hurt?
Nah, but I wish it had.
How long has it been like this?
A few days.
More than a few, I'd guess.
I'm going to pack the cavity with Iodiform gauze.
Is Gunn following this?
Yeah, Gunn, plastics, ortho, hand, and ID.
Hyperbarics want me to try them next.
And what's after that-- witchcraft, magnets?
( laughs ): I'll try anything at this point.
You know, at some point, maybe...
What?
It's nothing.
Say it.
At the point when the wound becomes life-threatening,
because of gangrene or sepsis...
it may be in the patient's best interest
to consider a definitive surgical cure.
We're not giving up.
Tell Ante, to be strong, he's going to be better soon.
I promise.
( sighs )
Any luck?
Every phone call leads to another dead end.
No one can tell you anything.
I can try talking to Doctor Anspaugh.
He may be able to help
( sighs )
What?
You.
Luka Kovac.
ER doctor, living in Chicago
You've made quite a life for yourself.
It's along way from that little room
you shared with Stipe and Tomo.
( laughs )
You could barely stand up in there.
I know. I have scars from hitting my head in that place.
You don't go back much?
You must be very busy.
Not as busy as a surgeon.
Everybody's busy in America.
Life is busy here, not like back home.
You don't miss it?
Sometimes I miss the ocean.
The people...
Driving up the coast on a summer day.
Do you remember that time
we drove to Vukovar after the finals?
You hit that goat.
( laughs )
Oh, my God, that was horrible.
It was hilarious.
You and Tomo jumped out and tried to revive him.
I was doing CPR, but Stipe refused to do mouth-to-mouth.
And Tomo wanted to put in a chest tube.
( laughs )
That poor goat.
I think that was the first patient you ever lost.
( laughs )
Hey, John, it's me.
Um, I'm at a motel room at the airport,
because we missed our plane...
and I'm sorry,
but I'm trying to get us on the first flight out tomorrow,
and I'll try to call you later.
Bye.
Better?
Better.
Thanks for the clothes.
You can thank Carter. They're his.
He also sent this.
What is it?
Depakote.
This is my life now, isn't it?
It's up to you.
We all thought you were dead, you know.
Except for Mom, of course.
She refused to believe it.
She know you were coming?
Couldn't get in touch with her.
For all I know, she's missing, too.
( laughs )
It's not funny.
I know.
It's a little funny.
So, what happens now?
We go home.
Well, what about me?
I don't want to live like this.
Can't keep doing this to you...
to me...
You have to get into a program.
Will you help me?
Don't I always?
Dr. Carter.
It's okay.
Where's your father?
He took a later flight.
He's going to be landing in a couple hours.
Did my mother call?
No. I'm sorry.
Dr. Emerson was here earlier.
He said you can call him at home tonight, if you'd like.
And Mr. Garrit called from the funeral home.
He apologized for the delay.
They didn't come yet?
He should be here any minute.
Can I get you something to eat?
No, thank you.
Tea, perhaps? No, I'm fine, thanks.
Dr. Carter...
she was a wonderful woman.
Yes, she was.
( sniffles )
( sobbing )
