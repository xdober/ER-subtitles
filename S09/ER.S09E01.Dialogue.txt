Previously on E.R.:
I think I got two cases of smallpox.
We need to lock this place down.
We stood out.
Where?
Central Africa.
Tell the C.D.C. we have our first casualty.
Am I next?
Deb, Carter's right.
You're quarantined to Exam 4.
You always have to be right.
And you have to be quarantined.
Ah, it's not my breath I'm worried about holding.
This is my E.R.
Not anymore. Sorry, Doctor.
I'm afraid the two of you have to remain
in this quarantine area.
We're going to be okay.

D'accord, d'accord.

Allez on-y vas.
( speaking French )
Bon chance.
BOY: Shauri numu! Shauri numu!
Gutes isolat, verstarkung ist komplett.
Vergleichen sic beschrankung fragment.
Lange polymorphie mit bekannten viren.
We know ring vaccination works.
Homeland wants us to consider city-wide.
And ten people die unnecessarily.
Take a look at this!
"Unnecessarily" is debatable.
Look at this! I don't want to debate it.
It should be a public health decision.
It is. We picked this up from a missionary hospital
300 miles east of Mbandaka;
present in the Simian population
as well as 18 children.
When?
WOMAN: 36 hours ago.
Same mutation?
Jody...
get me Chicago.
CARTER: You think we can get them
to move a TV in here?
I think you should catch up on your reading.
CARTER: I don't read after midnight.
There.
That's a wolf.
That looks like a wolf, doesn't it?
A wolf with leprosy maybe.
I don't think that you're appreciating
the degree of difficulty, even without this rash.
What?
Kidding. Just kidding.
This-this doesn't look good.
Maybe we're getting early parole.
You feeling okay?
What is it?
We need to evacuate.
The E.R.?
The entire hospital.
Everyone but you.
( Big Ben chiming ) ( London traffic sounds )
MAN: Mr. Harold Drummond was in his usual state of good health
until Tuesday evening
when he began to experience pinching in his chest.
The pain seemed to intensify throughout the day
as Mr. Drummond worked in his pet shop.
After an early dinner of pork cutlets
mashed potatoes and a couple of pints
he retired to his living room to do some reading
at which point the pain...
What, we have to guess which book?
Yes, Dr. Corday?
Did you treat Mr. Drummond?
No.
Are you certain?
Because I distinctly heard your voice.
I'm sorry.
Indeed. Well, why don't we jump ahead
and hear your presentation
since you seem unable to contain yourself.
Uh, I'm s.... that's not necessary.
( nervous chuckle )
Right.
Mr. McKay came into the E.R., complaining...
We don't have "E.R.s" in England, Dr. Corday.
Excuse me.
He presented to "Casualty," complaining...
Is Mr. McKay the African bushman?
I beg your pardon?
Your patient.
He's the young black pygmy, is he?
About this high?
He's an accountant from Manchester.
Specifics, Ms. Corday.
God is in the details.
Mr. McKay is
a 63-year-old Caucasian male
who was... Man.
What?
I believe the noun for which you are searching is "man."
"Male" is an adjective.
I have a male Springer Spaniel.
His name is Barkley, and though I love him dearly
I would never think of bringing him to hospital.
But please continue.
Most of us speak a smattering of American.
( chuckling )
MAN: Where are you taking me?
WEAVER: Mercy Hospital.
Why?
Because we're closing this facility.
Damn those HMOs.
How many more can you take?
We're full.
Then get it out of here.
Call Mercy, let them know transport's on the way
and I need another dozen rigs for O.B.
Is Colin on there?
No. Only ambulatory patients.
Then where is he?
Yeah, I don't think they've brought him out yet.
They said everybody's being evacuated.
And he will be. You just have to be patient.
Lily, can you can help find her boyfriend?
Do I have to?
MVA, broken pelvis.
And I thought we were getting rid of these news helicopters.
They are!
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Stella's one of the last ones.
Zadro, you going to Mercy?
No, no, Lakeshore.
Got one more for you.
Where are am I supposed to put her, on my lap?
Sounds good to me, lucky pants.
How you doing out here?
Good. Third and fourth floors are empty.
I.C.U. and O.R. should be cleared in the next ten minutes.
We did a good job today.
I mean, given the situation, it could have been a disaster
but I think everyone did really well.
You kicked ass.
Ow.
Hold still.
How come you keep doing that?
It's the way the vaccine is administered.
Yeah, you learned, what, ten minutes ago?
What are you doing?
I didn't get a wristband.
They won't let me out.
You need to be vaccinated first.
I did. No, you didn't.
Hey, I'll come back tomorrow
and have a nurse do it, all right?
Sir, everyone has to be vaccinated
before they can leave.
Hey, I'm not getting stabbed a hundred times
by some smallpox needle if it ain't even smallpox.
It's 15 little pricks, 15
so shut up, get the damn shot, and go home.
Yeah, well, tell me what it is.
I'll get a shot for that.
Are you deaf? We don't know what it is.
But this vaccine is the closest thing we've got.
So, if you don't want Dr. Gallant to help you
I can arrange for the army sergeant to come in.
Make sure you don't touch that.
Where are they taking them?
Upstairs. Respiratory isolation.
And why do we have to stay in this petri dish?
Prolonged exposure.
Whatever that means.
Did you find out for how long?
The virus is an unknown player.
You said Monkey Pox.
A variant of Monkey Pox. That's the problem.
How long?
Two weeks.
No. No, no, no, no. no. No.
They promised a public health nurse
on duty, around the clock.
Why two weeks?
What aren't they telling us?
I don't know. I think they're just being extra cautious.
I'm sorry about all this.
Me, too.
Thank you.
( coughing )
Could you make any more noise, Stan?
I can't help it.
( wracking coughs )
Well, at least cover your mouth.
You better knock it off, Stan
before you cough up a lung.
It's too late.
Have you ever been tested for T.B., Stan?
D.U.I., P.C.P. and H.I.V. but never T.B.
Great.
Pneumococcal pneumonia
can give you bloody sputum
fever and sweats.
Have you lost any weight lately, Stan?
I've always been pretty svelte
but I have had to tighten my belt a few notches lately.
Here, put this on.
No. No, thanks.
Do it!
Oh, you don't have to be so cranky.
I'm the one with the D.T.'s.
Whoa, what are you doing?
We might have to get him tested.
No, no, no, whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down, all right?
They're tripping out enough
and I don't need to be double quarantined.
He might have T.B.
And he might not.
Why don't we just take a sputum sample to the lab
do a gram stain and an A.F.B.?
Because we're not supposed to leave.
We're not contagious unless we get a rash.
No.
What's he still doing here?
I told you he can't go by ambulance.
That's why I got you a chopper.
Why didn't someone tell me that?
Probably already landed.
We have to get up top.
Colin, we're going to take you to the roof now
so we can put you on a helicopter.
I-I don't like to fly.
It's a short trip.
You don't understand. I really don't like to fly.
You don't have a choice.
I'm serious. You take me up there, I'll freak out.
It's not a plane.
It's an air rescue helicopter.
That's even worse. A helicopter can't glide.
Just take me back.
Listen, I have a bad feeling about this.
Take me back! Please!
Just take me back!
My son doesn't know. I'm leaving.
Well, we'll make sure to tell him.
Hold those elevator doors.
Dr. Romano, Saint Rafe's says
they can take one critical, not two.
That's too bad, 'cause I'm sending four.
Thank you.
I've never been in a Catholic hospital.
Well, you'll like the nuns. Nice calves.
They said they'll only accept one.
Tell Weaver we're clear.
Sign out all the Demerol and morphine.
To who?
Two.
Get the hell out of here. Hello. Who's this?
You like your job? You want to keep it?
Okay, then you tell your chief of staff...
You know who that is? Good for you.
You tell Jonesy that Robert Romano is sending over
four critical patients... Dr. Romano.
...all of whom I expect to be treated
like his own mother, without the inappropriate touching.
Tidal volume's down.
Probably just the morphine.
Hey! Hey!
Don't even think about it. That's my chopper.
They said they were sending a chopper for two patients.
Well, it looks like they lied.
Hey, no, I don't want to go on this helicopter!
Fine, fair enough.
He needs an I.C.U. bed.
So get him one!
He has bilateral pulmonary contusions
and they're starting to bruise!
And my boy Marty here is a 70-year-old diabetic
with gram negative sepsis from cholecystitis.
I'm only 68!
Hey, get that chopper out of our air space!
My patient's going to lose his airway.
So intubate him
and take him in your Viper.
He's not safe to transfer.
Arguing like this isn't helping either one of them.
Oh, you know, you're right. I'll tell you what, you can take
the chopper after I'm finished with him. Let's go.
Temp's 101.
All right. Ten grams of Tylenol
and piggyback the gentamicin.
No vascular clamps, but we have two kellys and a needle driver.
Oh, God.
Where's the arm? Do we have the arm?
I can't see anything.
Shut this thing down! PILOT: Not with you under it.
( gagging )
He's vomiting.
A 20-centimeter lac over the fifth rib, but no sub Q air.
Clamp! Which one first?
The biggest one.
Okay, one, two, three.
Tighter! Tighter!
Get your gurney out!
Come on, come on.
LEWIS: I can't see anything.
No, don't clamp it.
What?
KOVAC: Just do it!
He's lost half his volume.
Try for a BP on the good arm.
Okay, I got it.
I'm cold.
Do we have blood on the rig?
NURSE: Six units, type A.
KOVAC: We need a line.
No O-neg?
You asked for type specific.
Dr. Romano, what blood type are you?
( yelling ): What blood type are you?
PRATT: No red snappers.
CHEN: Could be an inadequate sample.
Sputum is loaded with gram positive diplococci.
Pneumococcus. Told you not to sweat it.
Wait-wait, what are you doing?
It's old-fashioned pneumonia.
I'm hungry. You hungry?
We're quarantined. Put your mask back on.
Come on, you can't eat with a mask on.
What do you say we raid the cafeteria?
Put your mask back on.
Starve a cold, feed a fever.
Pratt. Pratt!
That's my watch.
I need the bag.
Cycle the dynamap.
How's he satting?
Nothing on the monitor. Lungs are wet.
Damn it. We're loading him.
I ain't taking off till I check out that tail rotor.
LEWIS: He's looking pretty shocky.
He needs an OR now.
I don't know if she flies at all, much less flies safely.
Okay, call down for ground transport.
No, call another chopper.
Where are you going to land it?
Luka, he needs to get there by ambulance. We need ice.
NURSE: Belly's hard as a rock; labored resps.
Okay, send our guy downstairs.
Radio dispatch-- get an orthopedic
and a trauma surgeon up here.
You awake?
Yeah.
Monkey Pox sounds like a video game.
Or voodoo.
Or VD.
Lovely.
What, your back itch?
No.
You're scratching.
I am... It's probably just psychosomatic.
Want me to take a look? No, I'm fine.
Might be a rash.
Turn around.
Do you think someone did this on purpose?
Does it matter?
What do you mean?
I mean, viruses mutate.
That's what they do.
We're more likely to control bio-terrorism than Mother Nature.
Thanks, that makes me feel a lot better.
No rash.
Nice tattoo, though.
College. I was drunk.
Is that what I think it is?
I was going through a religious phase.
My chest hurts. I can't breathe.
Crank him to 15 liters. Don't worry, Colin. We'll get you downstairs.
What the hell's the matter with this thing?
Tachy at 115. Where's the helicopter?
Okay, load him first. We have to get off before you.
Wait. Pressure's dropping on 20 mikes of dopamine.
Over a hundred? Eighty-five.
Susan, we have to get him down.
Okay, don't hyperventilate, just assist.
Which is dopamine? On the syringe pump.
Tell Weaver ultrasound was clear
but he could have a slow leak.
We got to take everybody to the ambulance bay.
Pulse ox is 91.
Okay, get it. She might need help tubing this guy.
Health Department refused reentry.
Tell them Romano authorized it.
Who's Romano?
Are they coming back?
Uh, yeah.
Don't worry, Mr. Hersch
I'm right here with you.
I hope they remembered to call my son.
He'll worry about me.
What's his name?
Alan.
His mother wanted him to become a doctor.
I'm beginning to wish he had.
What's he do?
( alarm beeping )
So, how often does this happen here?
Only since you came along.
( laughing ): Oh, right-- the ying and the yang.
Excuse me?
The ying and the yang?
You know, something good happens, so something bad has to happen.
You are Chinese, right?
Yeah. I'm just trying to figure out what the good part is.
Oh, just say the word and I'll show it to you.
No, no, no, pick that up.
I made it.
You know, it's bad enough that you're not wearing your mask.
The hospital is abandoned!
Who are we going to contaminate?
( loud clattering )
Central line kit; two liters wide open. Where's the O-neg?
We don't keep it up here.
He's not perfusing. Set up the level one.
Pratt, blood. I need as much blood as you can get--
O-neg, packed cells and platelets-- now.
Blood bank is closed.
Open it.
What happened?
Chen, ice.
I need ice; lots of it.
Mr. Hersch?
Mr. Hersch?
Levophed, levophed...
Okay, where's the bag?
Where's the bag?
( frustrated groan )
Okay, Mr. Hersch, I'll be right back.
( panting )
Somebody! I need help!
( monitor beeping )
Oh, son of a bitch!
Come on.
Come on!
( grunting )
Damn it.
LUTZ: You can't open the operating room.
They're already in there.
Listen, Mercy and Lakeshore are maxed out. That's it.
Yeah, maxed out is relative.
I can't allow anyone else in.
Look, he's our chief of staff.
You're going to need to stop the replantation team by force.
Listen, dispatch says to remove everyone else to Riverview.
Where the hell is that? Indiana.
No, no.
Need a hand here.
What took you so long?
PILOT: Elevator doesn't open on the first floor.
NURSE: Sats are 89, but not correlating. Abdomen's tense.
Hey! Over here.
Colin, Colin, can you hear me?
Can I ride with him? I'm his fiancee.
Get her the hell away from me.
Sir, I'm going to need you to calm down.
She's not my fiancee, she's a freaking psycho.
Gallant. We're soul mates!
She ran me off the road into a bus.
I was upset, but I'm not now.
I'll...
I'll take care of you!
Hey... how bad is he? Romano?
Bad.
KOVAC: Retracting the deltoid. There's the median nerve.
Clean cut. That's good, right?
All right, where do you want it?
Squeeze in four units and get a hemacue.
Bradying down to 50.
One mig of atropine.
Break out the cart.
We're going to have to tube him soon.
I think I lost a pulse.
Either you did or you didn't.
Can't feel it.
Okay, CPR now.
Pratt, get that blood in.
PRATT: First two units are up.
One milligram epi, IV push, and FFP to follow.
Is anybody out there?
I need help in here. He's crashing.
Somebody!
( frustrated grunt )
Somebody!
Damn it.
( panting )
Okay, come on, come on.
Pick up.
Pick up.
COP: Out of the way. Out of the way!
WEAVER: Donald, get in there.
ANSPAUGH: Kerry Weaver, Dr. Joe Gunn.
GUNN: Nice to meet you.
He walked into the tail rotor. What the hell happened?
He barely has a pressure.
Is he in arrest?
Not yet.
This way. Wear your masks at all time.
Dr. Weaver! Dispatch relayed a call from elevator number four.
Dr. Lewis needs help with a crashing patient. She can't get him off.
Well, who's with her? No one!
Normal sinus.
Good pulse. How many units?
PRATT: Fourth almost in.
ANSPAUGH: Where are we?
Amputation at the distal humerus.
Dropped his crit to 18 prior to transfusion.
Arm's on ice. Everybody, put a mask on.
CHEN: Hemorrhagic shock resolved
with blood and epi. Pressure's 90.
I need to paralyze and intubate.
( groans softly )
Hold on. He's coming around.
ANSPAUGH: What do you think?
I don't know. Above the elbow's tough.
Yes or no?
Maybe.
Oh, God...
Robert...
can you hear me?
Oh, I'm at County.
( panting )
( heavy sigh )
( heavy sigh )
( water running )
( humming )
I don't think I can take another week.
Oh, yeah.
All right, up.
Feels like we're the last people
on the planet.
Yeah, well, if we were I'd, uh, move into
the best suite in the Ritz-Carlton. You?
Um... shopping spree.
Hmm.
How's it look?
Ooh, hot.
Really?
Toe or finger?
Toe.
Even the big one?
Yep.
Arm or leg?
Uh... leg.
You?
Definitely leg.
Deaf or blind?
Deaf.
Ha, ha!
Six, five.
Okay.
Would you rather lose both your arms
or your penis? ( grunts )
I don't know.
Well, you know
you could still do it if you had your equipment.
Yeah, it'd be tough to get chicks
without arms, though.
You know, I'll tell you the truth
I don't think I could date a chick that was missing pieces.
What if she had a really great personality?
What, and really big tits?
( laughing )
( both laughing )
What the hell is going on in here, Stan?
Hey, nice do.
Frames your face better.
Thanks.
Yeah.
Dr. Weaver.
How's he doing?
Could be better.
The ring and long fingers are a little dusky.
Is it normal postop erythema?
( muttering ): It better be.
Well, with the poor perfusion
I'm worried the antibiotics aren't penetrating.
He's not getting enough blood flow
to the hand.
Well, I can up his Dextran
but if I take him back to the O.R.
we decrease his chance of meaningful recovery.
And if not, he could lose the whole hand.
I'm thirsty.
Does he have a family?
I don't know.
Has anyone else visited?
No.
You know him.
What would he want?
Robert's aggressive.
I'm going to say the arm at all costs.
So I should operate?
Let him wake up from the narcotics and ask him.
Well, that could be tomorrow morning.
By then, it'll be too late.
Then you wait.
It's his decision, not mine.
You think they know?
Pratt's clueless.
Chen knows.
I don't think so.
Oh, no, she knows.
Why, did you tell her?
Where do you think I got the condoms?
( chuckles )
And you know, you were a little...
loud.
( chuckles )
Well, uh...
You're about a three.
You know, I always thought I was at least a four.
It's a nice pustule.
It's going to be a big scar, I know it.
You can get another tattoo.
That's true. I could get "Carter."
Yeah.
"Sucks."
Yeah, ha, ha.
CORDAY: When I was in Chicago
I'd often get homesick for London
and think about the things I missed.
Now you don't have to.
Yeah, now I think about Chicago.
Yes, I heard you had a run-in with the staff.
This time with a cardiologist?
He took one of my patients hostage.
He wanted to wait for an echo.
That's not unreasonable, is it?
Ooh, someone graffed on me.
It's a small hospital.
Small-minded's more like it.
And it's not America.
You may have to adjust your approach somewhat.
My approach is simply to do what's best for the patient
with a minimum amount
of arse licking.
Uh-oh, there's my cue.
What, you're not going to say hello?
Hello.
I'm really glad you're back, Elizabeth.
( chuckles )
You're late.
I'm sorry.
I had a bowel resection.
Oh, before lunch?
Lovely.
I washed my hands.
Do you think it's possible to die from boredom?
I don't think so.
What if your mind wandered off in a daydream
and you forgot to eat or drink for days?
Then you'd die of starvation
and dehydration.
Caused by boredom.
Hmm.
( sniffs ): You smell something?
That smells like heaven.
CHEN ( laughs ): Where did this come from?
I had a friend of mine
slip it through the window.
Ah, so that's contraband pizza.
Yeah, why, you want some?
Hell, yes.
Ten bucks a slice.
Help yourself.
You didn't get any beer, did you?
I got some sodas.
I take back everything I said about you, Pratt.
Really?
No, but thanks for the pizza.
No, but seriously
since you guys make, like, five times what I do
all donations are greatly appreciated.
Hey, I got some good news.
Adam's fever broke.
He's out of the woods. Ah!
Lovely, lovely. How about a toast?
To young Adam.
To young Adam.
And to us for surviving the plague.
Unless somebody develops a rash
in the next six hours.
Pestis Puerorum.
What?
The black death.
It started in China.
Infected Italian sailors
brought the disease back to Sicily in 1347.
In the end, 25 million people died.
How do you know that, Stan?
Renaissance Philosophy, 1D7.
You studied philosophy?
Taught it.
Yeah, right.
You were a teacher?
Yeah.
What happened?
Things.
Things happened.
Things always happen.
You know, you're sober now.
Not by choice.
Well, you know
you've been through the hard part.
We can get you into a program.
Get you some counseling.
I killed my daughter in a D.U.I.
There's no counseling for that.
Thanks for the pizza.
Well, um, I'm going to eat this in bed.
Mmm, sounds good to me.
Alone.
Good night. Good night.
So, you guys want to watch some TV?
No, thanks. Nah.
All right, pizza will be in the fridge.
Kind of sad, huh?
What's that?
The guy was a teacher.
Yeah, and he killed his daughter.
'Cause of alcohol.
It happens.
It doesn't have to.
What are you trying to say?
I just think it's sad.
Why can't you just tell me
what you're trying to say? You can talk to me.
You want me to talk to you? Yeah.
I want to help you.
But not because I'm a nice guy
or because I'm worried about you
but because I want to be with you.
You want to fix me.
Help you.
Fix me so I'm good enough.
No, I want it to work.
Yeah, well, I'm not broken.
Huh.
Ah, Ms. Corday.
I see you ordered that CT on Mr. McKay.
Yes. After 20 minutes of chatting
I came to the same conclusion.
CT confirmed dissection.
So, you're, uh, carrying on
all right, then, are you?
Carrying on.
Of course.
I suppose you can still grieve on the inside.
While I'm certain that's meant
as some kind of a criticism
I'm afraid I haven't got time to decipher it.
You're not in black dress.
Well, in fact, you're not in a dress at all.
Perhaps America has confused you in more ways than one.
Interesting.
Yes.
I thought I might suggest you reconsider that tie
as it makes you look like a boorish, virulent ponce.
But now I realize
that's simply your general disposition
so it would be out of place for me to comment.
Out of place, indeed.
Tragic, really
a woman out of place on two continents.
Congratulations.
Excuse me?
They sold your house.
10,000 more than the asking.
If you sign it, I'll fax it back for you.
( quietly ): Thank you.
I would like to read it myself, thank you.
What's wrong with your lunch today, Dr. Romano?
Your body needs nourishment to heal itself.
That's brilliant.
Teach you that in nursing school?
If you don't eat, I'm going to tell Dr. Gunn.
Oh.
Go ahead, tell Gunn.
I've seen his work.
your prosthetics department come fit me for a hook.
I'll see if I can find you something else.
Uh-huh.
( knock at door )
Kerry.
I wondered when you were going to visit me.
Well, I was here yesterday and the day before.
You were a little out of it.
Are you carpeting my office?
How are you feeling?
I've been better.
The surgery went well?
Oh, yeah. So they say.
But you know how surgeons lie.
You were lucky.
( laughs )
Lucky?!
Look, your people rallied around to save you
in a deserted hospital.
If it wasn't for Dr. Kovac, you'd...
I'd still have my arm.
You do still have your arm.
Do I?
Yes. It was a clean cut above...
I signed the third quarter income projections.
You know what?
We should evacuate the hospital
once every year for the money we're saving.
Robert...
Going to sleep now.
Apparently, I need my rest.
Identified the terminal ileum.
Bovie.
We call it electrocautery, Elizabeth.
Can I help you?
A solo hemicolectomy?
Not by design.
Your Professor Whitehead decided to be tardy.
Yes, I know.
He's apparently saving a motorist on the M1.
Asked me if I'd fill in.
But it seems you've already started.
Transverse incision.
Splendid.
It allows for a more localized approach.
Yes, and a bloody one.
Suction?
The field is clear.
Let's just take a look, shall we?
Elizabeth?
( sighs )
Be my guest.
Mm-hmm.
Oh.
Good separation around the Toldt.
The areolar tissue could use
better division, couldn't it? Metzenbaum.
May I continue now, please?
The more I see...
the better he'll do.
Well, if you merely wish
to peer around this gentleman's anatomy
why don't you crack open his skull while you're at it?
No. I'm interested
in completely excising this gentleman's cancer.
Thank you. Vascular clips.
Okay, then, he's all yours.
Retract the cecum medially.
Retraction.
Retraction.
Well, you heard him. Retraction.
Watch the pericolic gutter.
He's had a couple
of adhesions from an appendectomy.
Good morning, Frank.
Uh, welcome back, Dr. Weaver.
They waxed the floors.
Yeah. Nice, huh?
Takes smallpox for them to finally sanitize the place.
It wasn't smallpox, Frank.
Yeah. Mutated monkey scabs.
Whatever.
Other departments on line?
ICU and Surgery have been up
since midnight.
Peds, PICU, Labor and Delivery opened with us.
Everybody else starts at noon.
Dr. Pratt.
See ya.
Disease control clear you?
100%. Probed in every which way
you can think of.
I don't need to hear the details.
Did we get all our monitors back?
IMEDS, propacks, and portable vents.
Crash carts are stocked and ready.
Oh, I don't get it.
We're closed for two weeks
and they make us come back at 6:00 a.m.?
Well, it could have been midnight.
I'll catch you quacks later.
Oh, I see you're better.
I was never that bad.
Told you guys not to sweat it.
Dr. Pratt, Dr. Gallant called in sick.
I need you
to cover for him until 3:00.
What?
Well, you just said you felt good.
Yeah, I know, but come on, man.
Eh...
Kidding, Pratt.
Ha, ha, ha, ha. See you next week.
Dr. Weaver, can you sign this?
What is it?
My timecard.
Two straight weeks of overtime.
Do you think I'm kidding?
Dermatologically clear.
Afebrile.
Okay, you're free to go.
What? No psych consult?
We try not to inflict too much long-term damage.
Oh, well, she was borderline anyway.
Hey, can you tell us?
What?
If the virus was engineered or natural?
The system worked.
Everyone did their jobs.
Especially at the local level.
You're not going to tell us.
See you later, Deb.
Yeah, it was fun, Carter.
Let's get these beds made up
so we're not setting up as we go.
Chuny, are you triage?
Yes. On my way.
Hey, you survived.
Hi. You look tan.
I went to Barbados.
Sorry.
Barbados!
I had two weeks.
What else was I supposed to do?
Frank, what time is it?
5:59.
Okay.
We're open.
( phone ringing )
E.R.
They just get out themselves?
He has to leave the trach in for a few days
but he's off the vent.
They look better-- the parents.
Well, maybe they stopped blaming each other.
Weird.
What?
Stuck here two weeks, I don't want to go home.
Want to get some breakfast?
No.
You're not thinking of jumping?
No.
Not quite that desperate.
Can I join you?
It's your hospital.
Yes, it is, isn't it?
So, what's wrong with the surgical lounge?
Habit, I suppose.
At County, we often go up on the roof
when the place gets too much for us.
Oh, I'm glad everything there isn't perfect.
I was beginning to develop an inferiority complex.
Far from it.
Homesick then?
Yes, you do.
What?
Have a home.
Can't bring yourself to sell it, I understand.
I assume Mr. Cummins survived his hemicolectomy
without further incident.
We do seem to manage here from time to time.
So, you haven't developed vertigo yet
in your teenage years.
It reminds me of your tree-climbing days.
The head mistress couldn't get you out of that sycamore
to save her life.
I had to drive all the way down
to Tunberidge Wells.
( laughs )
A counselor was brought in.
Suggested some kind of rebellion.
Separation anxiety.
A cry for attention.
What have you.
Turned out you just liked climbing trees.
I knew that.
You were an unbridled spirit from the womb.
I don't know what to do.
I know, darling.
I know.
( sighs )
Here.
Let me. Oh, thank you.
Uh, this is the right train
for Heathrow, isn't it?
I hope so.
You off for holiday?
No. We're going home.
CONDUCTOR: Stand clear
of the doors, please.
This train is about to depart.
ANNOUNCER: The 7:59 train from Eeling and Broadway to Redding West
is now departing for Heathrow.
CARTER: Chaos theory.
LOCKHART: Chaos theory?
Yeah. A virus mutates in the Congo.
We evacuate an ER in Chicago.
Romano gets his arm cut off.
You lost me.
Seemingly random events, all part of a larger equation.
I'm hot.
You know, a butterfly flaps its wings in China
and creates a tornado halfway around the world.
Are you hot?
I'm just saying
that's there's an inherent unpredictability
about everything-- evolution, life.
Love, relationships.
So, what am I?
The butterfly or the tornado?
No, you're chaos in general.
Oh. Thanks.
No, I'm just saying, you're chaos to me.
The unknown.
I'm chaos to you.
You are hardly chaos, Carter.
I'm just saying that there's a risk
in anything that you do, right?
But don't you want to stack the odds
in your favor?
I mean, I'm drawn to you.
It's kind of that simple.
I've been... drawn to you
for two years, but
chaos always seems to rule, and I don't want it to rule.
I want to know where it's taking me.
You know what I mean?
Nope.
The tornado.
Definitely the tornado.
Are you coming in?
