Previously on E.R.:
The surgery went well.
So they say.
You were lucky.
( scoffs )
Is that what I think it is?
I was going through a religious phase.
It's not America.
You may have to adjust your approach somewhat.
Okay, then. He's all yours.
Watch the paracolyc gutter.
He's had a couple of adhesions
from an appendectomy.
We're going home.
( water running )
You realize you've been in there for 20 minutes?
You miss me, or am I wasting water?
Both.
How much longer are you going to be?
Your shift doesn't start for two hours.
Yeah, there's an 8:00 meeting near here.
You going to go?
I was thinking about it.
Hello?
Something wrong?
Carter?
What are you doing?
We really can't help you anymore, sir.
But I'm not a junkie.
This stuff just finds me, you know?
How convenient.
Hey, Frank, I need another room for Mr. Hudlin.
He says Exam Three is full of ectoplasm.
Did you cut yourself shaving?
What? Ooh, never mind.
Lipstick.
( laughs )
( coughing ): Dr. Carter.
Mrs. Breeland, you need to stay in bed.
Otherwise, we might be tempted
to put somebody else in it.
Okay, I think we're getting there.
Hardly-- board number two
is for the patients in the halls.
We have heat exhaustion
barbecue smoke inhalation and boils
all up for grabs.
I love my job.
No, you don't.
Why the hell are you dressed like that
if you can't prescribe nothin'?
Ah, the smell of fresh med students in the morning.
God, what is it about them?
They all seem so...
Gullible? Immature?
Vapid?
I was going to say sweet.
Bee sting in One is asking for you.
All right, just tell them to get started
on their orientation manuals.
I'll be with them as soon as I can.
Carter, MVA two minutes out.
But not to hold their breath.
Dr. Carter, so, there's a trauma coming in?
Yeah, why don't you take the bee sting in One
the wrist fracture in Four
and the burning rash in Two?
Care to give me a hand?
Why not? Help me!
Help me!
Hey, that's just been mopped, damn it!
You don't talk if you're having a real seizure.
Remember that for next time.
Think it's always this crazy here?
Probably.
They need to bring you back
to the V.A. hospital, sir.
I don't understand.
Your driver will explain.
You guys suck, you know that?
Don't bother, we don't have any beds.
So, what else is new?
No, I'm serious; try Mercy.
They're refusing patients, too.
Well, then try Rush.
We're completely filled.
Look, I've been bounced all over town with this old guy.
I'm running out of gas, and so is he.
If I don't get him into a bed
his UTI's turning into urosepsis.
MAN: I gotta make water!
Yo, doc!
You are one sadistic bitch, you know that?
Now, give me your middle finger.
I would if I could.
Any emergency meetings get scheduled?
Just one, about the spate of E.R. closures
in the area.
I've advised the board
that preliminary figures are on the increase
in our patient load by 34%.
Who'd you take to La Scala's?
Sorry?
Which board member's ass are you kissing?
Now the ring finger.
Robert, I simply compiled a report.
Nerve regeneration's a millimeter a week.
I am not kissing anyone's ass.
And it is not my dominant hand.
In fact, I only agreed to take on your responsibilities
out of necessity.
I'll be back in my office in two weeks
I hope you are.
( groaning )
Thought about upping your Vicodin?
Ibuprofen.
I want to stay clear-headed.
That's probably enough for today.
No, keep going.
Sorry, I have another patient.
Don't get too comfortable, Kerry.
WEAVER: Anything else?
Just your...
continued support!
Lizzie.
Elizabeth, how are you doing?
Fine.
Good.
Well, uh, we'll catch up downstairs.
I heard rumors.
All true, I'm afraid.
The one face I missed seeing in recovery.
I'm so sorry, Robert.
What, about my arm
or about not being there?
How are you healing?
Hurts like a son of a bitch.
You?
Any sensory function yet?
Nope. ( pager beeps )
It's a motorcycle accident.
I have to go, I'm sorry.
Dr. Corday, how was London?
Good.
Timed your trip right.
Missed the pox scare we had two months ago.
So I hear.
How's Ella?
Fine.
Is it nice to be back?
I'm off to the E.R., I'll let you know.
Okay, well, good luck.
WOMAN: Bite me, panty smellers!
Ma'am, you need to calm down.
Die, you scum-sucking perverts! Dr. Corday, hi.
We need some Haldol here!
You think that's necessary?
( screams ) Yes!
( screaming )
Dr. C., looking good. Thanks, Malik.
So, what's the GCS on this motorcycle trauma?
Sorry, I didn't do the run.
Oh.
Well, have um, the X-ray tech come down for portables.
You got it.
And hold the C.T. till we eyeball the patient.
Hey, welcome back.
Thanks.
So, do you know any of the specifics?
16-year-old girl, motorcycle versus utility pole
no helmet-- Carter's bringing her in.
What's a chick doing on a motorcycle?
What's anyone doing on a motorcycle?
Have the rapid infuser primed and ready.
Draw up 100 of Fent, four of Ativan.
Make sure the airway drugs are out of the box.
It's like you never left.
Yeah.
CARTER: Coming through here, please!
We're going to need some O-neg.
She got a rhythm?
PEA to agonal just before arrival.
Decreased breath sounds bilaterally.
Intubated for agonal reps-- didn't know you were back yet.
First day.
When'd she lose her pulse? Never had one.
Okay, everybody, on my count.
Ready, one, two--
Hold transfer and compressions.
Asystole.
Abdomen's distended.
Whoa.
Uh...
Uh, suction on high, I need a yankauer.
That's easily two liters.
CARTER: All right, amp of epi.
CORDAY: Don't bother.
Obvious C-spine fracture.
She's not even a good organ donor now.
Is there family here?
We're trying to locate them.
We can talk to them. No, it's fine.
Just let me know when they arrive.
Be easier for you.
MAN: I could pull the trigger right now if I wanted to
'cause it's all right here.
Welcome back, Elizabeth.
Do you have time for a consult?
As it turns out, yes.
What's he have, belly pain?
Well, only because he swallowed a handful of nitroglycerin.
No sudden moves unless you want me to blow!
Milo has right upper quadrant tenderness with rebound.
I'm a human time bomb.
He needs to be cleared medically
before we can move him upstairs.
I could go off at any minute.
He could get hypotensive.
Are you scared? I'd be scared.
No. Give him two liters of saline
and monitor him for a few hours.
Thank you. Gallant hasn't turfed
a case of psych all day.
You wanted the consult.
Dr. Lewis. Yeah?
We're to capacity, I take it?
Every bed, every day
since Mission Hospital closed.
I thought it was just St. Paul's.
Nope, and it doesn't help that Weaver's been gone so much.
She's gunning for Romano's job.
It keeps her very busy.
Dr. Lewis?
Mr. Sprooner, let me guess.
You're still itchy.
Yeah, but there's a...
You need to give drugs a chance to work
and quit scratching.
Okay, but I think the guy in the bed next to me
just stopped breathing.
Great. Malik, crash cart in Two. You got it.
Got a gang shoot-out here.
Couple of DOA's at the scene.
Another rig's coming in behind me.
He said they wouldn't shoot back.
Where was she hit? In the neck, good airway.
B.P.'s 100/76. Pulse is stable at 100.
Through and through?
Only saw one hole but it wasn't leaking air.
You need a hand? Possible S.C.I.
Where is he? Where's Ricky? What's her name?
Alma.
Just hang in there, Alma.
We're going to try and find him for you, okay?
Set up a cross table lateral of the neck.
Dr. Carter
still got these med students waiting on you.
Want me to jump on that?
Better idea; you talk to them.
So, newbies, huh?
Mm-hmm.
You don't want to work here.
CORDAY: Haleh
get that D.B. out of here.
And take it where?
Someplace else.
How much O2?
Five liters by nasal cannula.
Are you hurt anywhere else?
They shot him.
Oh, please, God, don't let him be hurt.
We're going to try and find out for you, Alma
but you got to try and help us, too.
Do you have pain anywhere else? I don't know.
( crying ): I... I can't tell.
How about your legs? No.
I can't feel them.
( crying )
Gallant, need a hand here.
We're talking smithereens here!
Have you ever seen smithereens?!
Listen, Haleh, I'm on psych rotation.
I really shouldn't be helping you, but...
Haleh, this is a dead body.
You ought to go to med school.
Can't take her to the morgue yet; waiting on family.
( grunts )
Why am I not exploding?
No movement below the umbilicus.
What's wrong with me?
Why can't I feel anything?
You might just have
some bruising to your spinal cord.
I need 30 migs per kilo
of methyprednisodlone I.V. bolus.
Where the hell's X-ray?
Behind you. Start with the chest.
( crying ): Please, I need Ricky.
Stay with us, Alma.
Entry wound left mid sternocliedomastoid
with a large hematoma.
There's blood behind the ear
as well.
It'd be nice to hear about that ultrasound.
Morrison's is dry.
The peridcolic gutters look good.
Bladder is, uh...
Shooting... Wait, wait!
She's pregnant.
What?
Looks like about 11 weeks.
Fetal heart rate is 140
baby appears healthy and intact.
I need Ricky.
( screaming and crying )
It's my arm, man! It hurts like a...
Do something already!
B.P.'s steady at 120
but he's been like this the whole time.
Ricky, you need to calm down!
Did you give him anything?
Maybe this'll help. He wouldn't hold still long enough.
Good breath sounds, full trauma panel
chest and A-P pelvis. He's a regular customer.
Through and through to the right triceps. ( screams )
You were lucky.
Yeah? You should see the other guy.
( laughs ) No fracture or deformity.
So, what, just go back and forth shooting each other
till all of you are dead?
An eye for an eye, man.
Yeah, meanwhile his girl gets shot.
They got Alma, too?
Yeah, she was hit in the neck
and it's pretty serious.
( screams )
Come on, dawg!
Let me go!
Calm down!
I've got to kill those bitches!
You already did!
( breathing heavily )
Repeat hamogram and update tetanus.
Keep your hand there and don't take it off
until you get upstairs.
Got it.
Dr. Corday, when you have a chance.
Be right there.
Make sure the blood bank sends type-specific
straight to the O.R.
Have the anesthesiologist call me with any questions.
Are you the one?
A neurosurgeon will perform the operation.
He'll be talking with you shortly.
Don't... I'm sorry?
Don't let me die.
WOMAN: You're one cold-hearted bitch
you know that?
I don't have any damn pity for you, whore.
I'm talking to you, piss face!
Don't you dare turn your back on me
you stuck up little ass-shaker!
Where the hell do you think you're going?!
Pardon me, darling. Thank you.
Doc, I'm going to miss the whole season here.
Keep your cup on, man.
I should have been off two hours ago.
You don't see me complaining.
What are you still doing here?
I can't leave till my patient gets a bed.
Them's the rules. Don't sound so upset about it.
Up to level 12.
Hey, turn that thing off. It disturbs the patients.
Frank, what'd I miss?
County HHS needs to talk to you.
Ditto, Human Resources.
Anything from Dr. Romano?
Oh, he called half an hour ago, and an hour before that.
Somebody from Dr. Rydell's office called
to confirm your appointment for, uh...
What the hell is this?
Why is Stella Willits still on the board?
I called to have her admitted to Psych hours ago.
I haven't had a chance to evaluate her yet.
Well, save yourself the trouble-- she's nuts.
She's a frequent flier with a history
of bogus medical complaints.
Yeah, well, with all due respect
I'd like to determine that myself.
The E.R. doesn't have the time or the manpower
to deal with hypochondriacs.
That's what your department's for.
Now, turf her, get her off my board.
Yeah, but it's part of my... I said get rid of her.
Stubborn, got to give you that.
How are those medical students coming along?
Oh, just fine. I gave them three volumes of Rosen to read.
Carter, Urology on two.
You think you can come up with something
a little bit more interactive?
Yeah, Sam Polivy's back with a ureteral stone.
P-O-L-I-V-Y.
Hey, Abby, are those labs back on Melinda Harrell?
Let me check.
Hi, I'm Erin Harkins... I'm on the phone.
Yeah, you're busy, we get that
but can we get an approximate time
that orientation will begin? Doctor?
Please don't tell me you're keeping med students waiting.
Check with Pratt.
I'm checking with you.
Intractable pain and hydronephrosis. Dr. Carter?
I cannot admit him to Eight West right now.
There are no beds.
I'm Dr. Weaver, chief of Emergency Medicine.
I will give you a brief tour of the Ambulance Bay
after which our chief resident will give you
his undivided attention, because, as you'll learn
it's his primary responsibility.
Come on.
I'm sorry, what was that you were just saying?
Demolition site accident downtown.
At least a dozen injuries.
What's the E.T.A.? Now.
I've got to call you back.
Paramedics can transport using standing field protocols...
We've got multiples.
Wait here. Who's on first?
The sick one. Frank Chambers, 40 years old.
Severe chest trauma when a pedestrian walkway fell on him.
What? Wrecking ball crane collapsed.
B.P. 80 systolic, but he's headed the wrong way.
Tachy 120. Denies L.O.C.
Crepitus on right side; we need to page surgery.
Mr. Chambers, can you talk?
It hurts too much.
He told me he thought his ribs were broken.
Who are you? His secretary.
Sustained only a facial lac and had chest pain at the scene
but refused treatment.
All right, you need to be examined.
After he's taken care of.
He's decreased on the left.
Let's hear it.
Been hearing it all the way from Michigan Avenue.
Ken Ambrose, 34. Obvious tib-fib fracture with dislocation.
F.D. had to lift a flower shop off his leg.
Not a shop, it's a kiosk.
Vitals normal, but tachy at 120 with a liter in.
Gave him ten of M.S.
( screaming ): Don't touch it! It hurts!
Okay, uh, just bear with us.
We'll give you something for that.
Oh, God, I see a light.
You're not dying, it's just your ankle.
Oh, God. Oh!
Watch where you're going!
You ran into me.
Haleh! Where's the trauma?
Throw a rock, honey.
Blunt chest in Two.
You look wonderful, by the way.
85 pounds and counting.
Good for you.
You cut your hair?
Mm-hmm.
B.P.'s falling, 70 systolic.
Keep squeezing that bag.
Where are we? Flail with crepitus, needs a tube at least.
Who has an angio cath? Right here.
How can I help?
Given that there's only one, I don't see how you can.
What is that?
It's a tube to help him breathe.
He has a collapsed lung, Tammy.
This will re-inflate it.
I need a thoracostomy tray.
Right, let's see how much air he's got in here.
Oh, God.
( hissing )
Is that any better, Mr. Chambers?
Sats 88.
He's not talking anymore. Why is he not talking?
Because he can't.
Let's Betadine the whole chest, just in case.
Do you need any help?
Ah, yes, with his wife. She's bleeding.
I'm not his wife. Then you shouldn't be in here.
Where's the rapid infuser?
Chuny, we need that blood.
All right. Let's get her on a monitor.
She refused treatment for chest pain at the scene.
Okay, I'm Dr. Kovac. Can you come with me?
No, somebody needs to be with him.
Okay, I'm in.
Hook me up.
Let us take care of him
and Dr. Kovac will take care of you.
Come, please.
( screaming ) Pratt, what are you doing down there?
Lewis, what are you doing up there?
This guy's got no D.P. pulse.
It's called a trauma assessment.
Lungs clear, chest tones normal.
Got the Doppler.
Give it to me.
Sweet Jesus.
Explains no pulse.
Let's get a C.B.C., chem seven, dip of urine
chest and pelvis X-rays.
Chen, give me your hands.
What are you doing?
Hold tight. Ken!
Huh? Have you ever been to Hawaii before?
Uh-uh.
Well, pretend you're there now.
Pratt!
( screaming )
( gasping )
I can't believe you.
I feel better.
I feel totally better.
I feel totally sick.
Why would you reduce an ankle with no pain meds?
No pulse is no blood is dead tissue.
In other words, I just saved your foot.
Thank you. You're wonderful.
Subclavian's in. Is that the film?
500cc's are out the chest tube.
He's holding his pressure.
No pneumothorax.
Looks like a widened mediastinum and a loss of the A-P window.
Hard to tell. Pulmonary contusion's pretty impressive.
One of us should go with him to C.T.
Not unless you're prepared to crack the chest.
He's got flail chest, pulmonary contusions and labile hypotension.
Which could also be caused from a splenic fracture.
Carter, I'd like an aortagram, better yet, a T.E.E.
The fact that he's still alive argues against aortic injury.
Page me with the result, okay?
Elizabeth, I really think there's more to discuss here.
Kerry, I'm a trauma surgeon.
Last time I checked, you weren't chief of staff.
Keep me apprised of his condition.
Okay, the last one.
Can I go see him now?
No. We have to make sure you didn't bruise your heart
or damage your lungs.
They're not doing anything.
Probably just waiting to go up to surgery.
I'm sure he's stable.
I told Mr. Chambers we were ten minutes late.
It's a trick I use to get him to meetings on time.
You don't call him by his first name?
He's kind of formal.
How long have you been working for him?
Two years.
Six days a week, ten hours a day.
I probably spend more time with him than his wife does.
They're really happy, though.
I mean, she's lucky to have him.
He's a good man.
You ready to irrigate?
Yeah.
Uh, put polysporin on the wound.
Where'd you get that one?
A low-life stuck me in the back with a switchblade.
An inch to the left and you would have lost
a kidney.
The guy who did it to me...
got snuffed with a sawed-off.
( laughs )
Dude was bite-size.
That's funny?
Whatever, bitch.
Hey, watch your mouth.
Are you almost done, man?
Why?
You in a hurry to go to jail?
We can check on Alma for you.
She's probably in recovery by now.
That means she's okay then.
No. She could wind up paralyzed.
Like all over, or just her legs?
They're not sure yet.
Wow, better if they just killed her, you know?
An hour ago, you were ready to get revenge.
Yeah, that was personal.
It was about my name, honor.
But paralyzed, that blows.
Just dress the wound with adaptic.
Hey, Luka.
Huh?
Piece of work, huh?
Yeah.
And she's pregnant.
Who?
The girl.
Says it's his baby.
You want to tell him?
No. Do you?
Not really.
Hi. I'm Michael Gallant from Psychiatry.
Stella Willits, from Ohio.
Nice shiner.
I understand you have quite a few medical complaints.
I'll need to ask you a few questions.
Knock yourself out, hon.
Do you have any recent weight gain?
I've been thinking about going on The Zone.
How about dry skin?
Like the Sahara.
Here, give me this.
( clears throat )
"Intolerance to cold?" Yes.
"Arthritis, sore muscles, constipation?"
Yes, yes and yes.
"Fatigue?" Well, I have been kind of low-energy lately.
You have some delayed relaxation from the deep tendon reflexes.
What about depression?
Me?
Yeah.
No.
I'm glass half-full; I'm a silver-lining girl.
I'm an optimist.
Listen, I'll be back to finish.
Um, I guess I do get a little blue sometimes.
WEAVER: Get this gurney out of the way.
If you haven't talked to anyone
you need to go back to the nurse in triage.
Jing-Mei, your food poisoning in Exam Four
has been here for 11 hours.
Waiting on a consult.
From who, the Naked Chef? The guy ate bad shrimp.
Hey, Dr. Weaver? Can I get something for my skin?
Yeah, sunblock.
Can I talk to you about Stella Willits?
Well, only if you're admitting her to Psych.
Yeah, she may have a reason for...
Just got word on Mr. Chambers-- aortic dissection.
I'm taking him up to surgery now
unless you have any objections.
Ah, no, but would it be possible
for us to speak in private first?
Of course. Dr. Weaver...
Later, Gallant. Yeah, but I need...
I wanted to talk to you
about what happened earlier.
Oh, for God's sake. Who left a cadaver in here?
Sasha's a bit of a bad penny, I'm afraid.
She keeps being moved around
while they try to locate her family.
I don't mind, if you don't mind.
I'm concerned that you might be taking on too much, too soon.
Particularly in the area of trauma.
Based on?
What I saw earlier--
a pronounced inability to work with others
a lack of professional respect.
You're joking, right?
Look, it's stressful, no question.
But copping an attitude with me and my staff
is-is not going to make the trauma go any easier.
Kerry, I saw a dissected aorta.
In fact, it only adds to the intense pressure
that we're all feeling.
Given my position
I didn't think it necessary to come and seek your approval.
We all have our sensitivities...
Quite frankly, if anyone has an attitude here, it's you.
...but we can't let them interfere...
No, it's you.
With your insistence on being kowtowed to
at every bloody opportunity.
( crying )
Oh, my God.
( sniffling )
( crying continuing )
Excuse me.
You have some milk? I'm thirsty.
His landlord found him in his apartment
crying, hyperventilating.
Apparently, his girlfriend left him.
Well, the correct term would be "Mommy."
What? Mommy.
Well, he appears to be an Abie.
You know, an adult baby.
It's-it's a fetish in which the baby is taken care of
in every way by a "mommy" or a "daddy."
You're familiar with this condition?
Well, it's not really a condition.
It's more like a form of relaxation.
Are you kidding me?
No. It says right here
get away from their stressful lives.
Mr. Dwyer, what do you do for a living?
Shoe sales.
See, and a foot fetish, too.
This is definitely an issue
for the Psych Department.
No offense.
No, no. I-I am not so sure about that.
Mr. Dwyer, when's the last time someone changed you?
This morning.
More than likely
he suffers from a diaper rash
which is a medical ailment
to be treated by the ER.
When are you done with this rotation?
Next week.
Remind me to give you some serious scut work.
FRANK: "To Dr. Pratt
"Thanks from a grateful patient.
Ken, the Kiosk Man."
Amazing.
Too bad this guy didn't run a hot dog stand.
I'm here for allergies
and these things are pushing me over the edge.
Can you get rid of them?
Yeah, or give them to someone a little more deserving.
Hey, hey, hey.
Who saved flower boy's foot
and moved more patients than anybody today?
Me, that's who.
And you know what?
You guys are going to miss me, too
'cause I'm out of here.
Bankers hours, Pratt? Only if they work doubles.
Hey, Carter, what's up with your boss?
Is it true
she was, uh, crying earlier?
Weaver?
Yeah. Bad breakup or something?
She's been pretty moody lately.
Lately?
HARKINS: I'm sorry, but I think
this man needs immediate attention!
You got to help my Pops. What happened?
They came in through the ambulance entrance way
and I saw right away that he was diaphoretic.
I'm not asking you.
We were playing ball
and he just grabbed his chest and sat down.
When did the pain start? About an hour ago.
I thought it would go away. You having pain anywhere else?
Come on. On a scale of one to ten, how's your pain?
40. How are you feeling?
Talk to the elephant on my chest.
It could be an acute MI. Excuse me, do you mind?
What are your names? I'm Pete and he's Derek.
What's up? Can you take Pete and Derek to the TV room?
One, Pratt. Okay, come on.
Excuse me, is there any way
that we can wait in the doctor's lounge?
As soon as you're a doctor.
Tombstones in two, three and "F."
Is it any better with the spray under your tongue?
No. W-what do you mean by "tombstones"?
It's a non-medical way
of describing the line tracings on your EKG
but it's not good news, Mr. Royston.
It looks like you're having a heart attack.
How about aspirin?
I already gave him 80.
Let's push five of metoprolol.
Titrate morphine. Start heparin and nitro drips.
Call cards and the cath lab.
Wait. What's going on?
What's he going to do?
You have a blocked heart vessel.
If we can open it up with a balloon
We just need your permission to do the procedure.
It's called "angioplasty."
If you can sign for me right there.
Cath lab will be ready for him in 30 minutes.
He's a hot MI. Yeah, they're finishing up a pacer.
While they're messing around
with an elective procedure
he's killing off heart cells.
We've got plenty of time to medicate...
( alarm rings ) V-Tach.
Like I said... Charge the paddles at 200.
No pulse. Starting compressions.
Abby, open an intubation tray.
Let's get cardiology in here.
And clear.
The doctors there will give you antibiotics.
Just make sure to get a wound check in two days.
Right.
So, he's good to go? Yup.
Later, I guess.
She's pregnant.
Who?
Your girlfriend.
I told you, man. She's not my girlfriend.
¿Tu entiendes, hermano?
Well, whoever she is to you, she's carrying your baby.
Why don't you care?
Why do you?
CARTER: 360 again.
Clear.
Still fib.
Is this my consults?
Mm-hmm. Acute inferior MI.
Refractory v-fib despite lidocaine and procainamide.
How about a TNK?
Sure as hell isn't going
to make it to the cath lab.
I've been pounding on his sternum for ten minutes.
He'll bleed out with thrombolytics.
Who's talking?
Pratt-- first year resident.
Then shut up.
CPR as a contraindication
to thrombolytics has
been debunked. It's a myth.
40 of tenecteplase.
IV push.
Charging to 360. And clear.
A boatload from Lake Michigan
just came in with alcohol poisoning.
Kids?
Worse. Parents.
The ten-year-old was the only one sober enough to dock.
Do you think it's too late
to go into Dermatology?
Excuse me, Doctor? Yes.
I had a message on my voice mail
that said my daughter was in a motorcycle accident.
Her name is Sasha-- Sasha Huffner.
Uh, yeah, yeah.
I'll, uh, check on her for you.
Thank you. Just wait right there.
Thank you very much.
( sighs )
Susan, did you order a urine tox screen on... ?
Check my orders. Elizabeth?
HALEH: Dr. Lewis, this guy with the ringworm...
Yeah, can you hang on a second? Elizabeth?
And an abdominal CT with contrast
and two grams of Cefotetan.
Can we talk?
I'm on my way to the OR
with a bowel obstruction if it can wait.
Sasha Huffner's father is here.
Your first patient.
The DOA.
Right, right.
Look, if you want, I can tell him for you.
Why would I want that? I don't know.
You're on your way to surgery.
It's kind of depressing.
What's his name?
Paul. He's staying...
I'll find him.
KAYSON: Hold compressions.
CARTER: Five v-fib.
Resuming compressions.
KAYSON: How long has it been?
LOCKHART: 42 minutes.
Okay, that's it.
Call it.
You can stop now.
Time of death is... 7:11.
( alarms sound )
KAYSON: Wife here?
She's on her way.
You should still wait.
Can't lie to him now.
You want to turn off that monitor?
Whoa! He's in V-tach.
What?
I can shock that.
They pronounced him.
Yeah, well, now he's got a good rhythm.
200. Clear.
Yeah, still V-tach. That's enough, Pratt.
Bag him. No.
Do it! No, he's dead.
300. Clear.
Oh, my God.
PRATT: Sinus tach.
I said bag him.
CARTER: We did everything that we could.
We had three doctors working on him
for over an hour.
We gave him medicine
and we shocked his heart
but it didn't do any good.
Why not?
Because his heart was very, very sick
and it was too sick to save.
I shouldn't have made him play ball.
I mean, he said he was tired.
No, no. It's not your fault.
It's not your fault.
Your dad had a problem that nobody knew about.
Not you, not your mom
and not even him.
In fact, you gave him the best possible chance
that he had by getting him to the hospital.
He can't be dead.
I'm sorry, Pete.
He is dead.
And it's very sad
and it's very unexpected.
And it's okay to cry.
It's just a sign of how much you loved your dad.
Do you guys want to see him?
You can say good-bye.
Yeah.
Okay.
You need to know
that your dad's going to have a lot of tubes attached to him
and it might be a little scary.
That's okay.
PRATT: Keep the lidocaine
at two milligrams per minute.
What are you doing?
I got him back.
What the hell's going on?
B.P.'s 90 palp. He's back.
He's alive?
He's not dead.
Daddy's alive!
Mr. Huffner?
Yes.
I'm Dr. Corday.
I'm a surgeon here at County
and I was your daughter's physician
this morning.
Did you operate on her?
I mean, is she all right?
I mean
where is she?
Can I see her?
I'm afraid your daughter died this morning.
She-she came in essentially DOA
with massive internal injuries
from a motorcycle accident.
My God.
Someone can take you to see the body.
We've kept it in the department for your benefit.
And, uh... afterwards
you can make arrangements with the morgue.
A nurse can give you information
about grief counseling.
She's my little baby.
Is she gone?
I'm sorry.
( crying )
KAYSON: Nobody walks out
of a hospital after 40 minutes of CPR.
CARTER: There was improvement.
From v-fib to v-tach.
KAYSON: Because he's either dead or should be dead
which means your resident is either cruel, stupid or both.
He saw a shockable rhythm
in the setting of thrombolytics.
It could have taken 30 minutes
for the TNK to open up the coronary artery.
Are you defending this?
He had to make a split-second decision
and he thought he was acting
in the best interest of his patient.
Well, he was wrong, and now we have a vegetable
with a pulse on our hands.
Well, our names are on the chart, not yours.
Dr. Pratt and I will take
full responsibility for any negative outcome.
Oh, you bet your ass you will.
Hey, um...
I just want to say thanks for backing me up like that.
A chief resident
and a cardiologist
with more than 25 years of experience
pronounce a man dead
and you decide to resurrect him.
Yes, but just like you say...
You think I defended you because I like you
or because I approve of the way
that you practice medicine?
You are my responsibility.
You are my job.
And I'm doing mine.
If you wanted to shock
you could have stat paged me overhead.
I could have been here in a second
and we could have discussed it.
Instead, you go off
without any regard for authority
or even the best interest of your patient.
Now, that's not true.
The guy's got kids, he's got a wife.
I was trying to save him...
You brought the man back
Pratt, because you felt like it.
Because you wanted to see if you could.
Why is he still sleeping?
He didn't get enough oxygen to the brain
so we have to wait and see if he wakes up.
You know, there's a chance he might not.
Why's that?
He's just taking a nap is all.
Pete, your dad's still pretty sick.
Yeah, but you saved his life.
Hey, you guys hungry?
Come on, let's go down to the cafeteria.
I'll get you something to eat.
All right?
My daddy doesn't like doctors
but I bet he'd like you.
You tired?
There's got to be a better word for it.
Enervated?
Asthenic? Atonic?
Pooped?
Bingo.
Does that mean you want to stay home tonight?
Not necessarily.
Anything in particular come to mind?
Shoot, keep working that spot
and I'll do whatever you want.
You know, I do need my sock drawer reorganized.
They told me my husband was back here.
He had a heart attack.
( clears throat )
Mrs. Royston?
Even though we got his heart beating again
the neurologic test showed
that there's a lack of basic brain function.
What that means is that...
I know what it means.
How long can he last like this?
Indefinitely.
Did your husband leave any instructions?
Did he ever express his wishes
about what should be done in a situation like this?
He's 42 years old.
Then I need to ask you if his heart stops beating again
do you want heroic measures taken to save his life
or do you want to sign a Do Not Resuscitate order?
Oh... God...
Is that the right thing to do?
I can't make that decision for you.
Is it the right thing to do?
Yes.
I want to thank you, Dr. Gallant.
There is no need, Mrs. Teasley, no need.
I just get... well, I don't know
panicky in public places.
Well, you know
that's why you need to keep taking your Klonopin.
I hope I wasn't too much trouble.
Oh, not at all. Not at all.
Gallant, you want to explain
why Stella's still here?
Yeah. I'm waiting on some lab work that I ordered.
Well, who said you could order labs?
No one, but I thought that...
You're here to assess her psychiatric problems
not to do a medical work-up.
Listen, I-I realize that, but I think she is really sick.
You looking for these?
What?
Oh, her TSH level is over 100.
Stella?
Well, she's hypothyroid which explains all of her symptoms:
depression, fatigue...
Yeah, but not the fact that she's a con artist
and a hypochondriac.
Until your rotation is over
you are not a member of this E.R.
You have to stop doing our work;
start doing the work of your current department.
Yes, ma'am.
But good catch. You off soon?
In a few minutes, yep.
Do me a favor.
Discharge Stella before you leave.
I feel like crap. I'm going home.
Yeah, we sent the, uh, labs out this morning.
Well, she's been here for 24 hours...
Something's wrong with my dad! Come on.
Hey, Pratt, will you get in here?
Mama, what's wrong?
Mrs. Royston, did you sign the DNR?
You got to help my dad.
He's in arrest.
Mrs. Royston, did you sign the DNR?
Okay.
What's a DNR?
Um... it-it means that your dad
is too sick for us to try to help him.
Why can't you?
Because he's already gone, baby.
No, he's not!
No, he's not.
He saved him.
He said he was going to be okay.
Derek, we tried.
Why are you letting him die?!
Baby, please...
You got to help!
Mama, tell them to do something, please.
( whispering ): Come on, come on.
( whimpering ): No...
Why are you doing this?
LOCKHART: Asystole.
Why?
( sobbing )
Daddy?
( both crying )
Rominger's not an appy.
You sure?
25 male, periumbilical to the right lower quadrant?
He's a poster boy.
Well, you can bring him back in 12 hours if you want.
Oh, uh, Dr. Lewis asked that you take a look
at the cholecystitis.
Page the next shift.
Do you want to take a call from Neuro?
Find out if it's urgent.
You forgot to sign off.
Oh.
So, uh, how are you feeling?
It's about the GSW you handled earlier--
Alma Salazar?
I'm fine.
You wanted to know her status.
What is it?
You going to tell me?
She's a quad.
( sighs wearily )
Hey.
Hi.
Shh.
Oh. You're not going to wake him up?
Nah.
Didn't you two come in together?
Yeah, I'm sure he can find his way home without me.
Do you need a lift then?
No, thanks.
Have a good night.
( hooting and cheering )
MAN: I can't believe that!
( joyful chattering and laughter )
Ah, man!
Why do you even try, son, why do you even try?
Yo, man, I don't know.
This is just crazy!
Man, they evacuating the whole spot?
Hey, yo. What's all this?
Pay-per-view.
Want some pizza?
Yo, Biz, let me talk to you for a minute.
Yo, I'm watching a movie, man.
Dawgs, if I got to come over there
I'm gonna smack fire at you!
Come here, man, let me talk to you for a minute!
Come on, man, hurry up!
Come here, man.
Damn, what's your problem?
I thought I told you don't come here again.
Stay away from him.
You understand that?
Yo, I'm saying, now you his mama, yo?
What...?
( shouting )
Yo, man, chill out.
You hear what I'm saying?
Why you tripping?
Don't play with me, man.
All right, that's it, party's over.
Everybody out!
Come on, man, get up. You two, get up.
All y'all.
Get up and get out.
Yo, my man, are you stupid?
Come here.
Come on, man, come on, come on, come on.
What you doing, G? Come on, get out.
Close the door behind you.
What's wrong, G?
Y'all, I'll holler at y'all later, all right?
Those are my friends, G.
Yeah? Well, this is my house.
It's mine, too.
Oh, yeah?
Oh, what, you pay rent?
Come on, watch out, man.
No. Does that mean I can't have no friends?
Just be quiet, I'm tired.
Man, you tired, all right.
Grouchy, too.
Leon...
you know those guys are just using you, right?
Hmm?
Yo, dawg, how do they blow up a whole town
like that without killing anybody?
They don't.
And if you shot the gun that close
he'd blow his eardrums out, too.
Oh, gee, it's just a movie, man.
You don't got to take it so seriously.
Hey, whatever.
But she's hot, though.
Most definitely.
( laughing )
You're right about that, G.
Yo, you still want some pizza?
( sighs )
( moans )
( coughs )
( clears throat )
Hey, sleeping beauty.
How long have I been in there?
Since before my shift started.
Is Abby here?
Nope, but she left you a Post-It.
And you still have a med student waiting for you.
( sputtering lips )
Hey.
( grunts )
Look, I'm sorry.
The day just kind of got away from me.
Why don't we try again tomorrow?
No. No, I don't think so. No.
I have been here for 16 hours.
I have been ignored and yelled at
and called honey and sweetie and bitch-- twice.
I don't smell good
and all I've had to eat is Gummy Bears and Diet Coke.
I'm not leaving until I get
what I came for.
This the Admit Area.
This is the center of the E.R. universe.
This is where you'll pick up your patients' charts
order labs, spend the bulk of your life
for the next three months...
Uh, how do you know who's next to be seen?
You check that chart rack right there.
We see people in the order they arrive
unless the triage nurse feels they're of high acuity
and then they get moved to the head of the line.
Do you get to suture?
If you're supervised by an attending, yes.
