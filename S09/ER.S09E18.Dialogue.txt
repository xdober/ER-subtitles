Previously on ER:
I'll take him up myself.
Dr. Romano, your arm.
Damn it!
I'm fine.
Let's just, let's go.
Let's roll.
We're going to Las Vegas tonight.
Are you ready?
I've asked Robert to consider
sharing the Chief of Staff position with you.
I'd rather cut off my good arm.
Fine. Congratulations, Kerry.
You've just become Chief of Staff.
That was a gift.
From a grateful patient?
Grateful girlfriend.
I have a few meetings with department heads later.
Otherwise, I would have waited.
Oh, yeah, of course.
I'll have all this sent to your home by week's end.
Dr. Weaver? Yeah.
Maintenance is here.
Send them in.
What happened to Brenda?
We had to let her go.
She seemed unwilling to make the transition.
Centered, right above the backs of the chairs,
and at museum level.
I always hated the Impressionists.
Look, it's a lateral move, Robert.
All that sugar-coating of the truth.
Believe me, it wasn't my idea.
Dr. Anspaugh thought
it might be a good interim step.
That's strange, because this little power play
smacks of a certain estrogen-based malice
I've grown all too familiar with
over the years.
You know... I really wish you'd try to appreciate the fact
that we're trying to do you a favor here.
What you're doing is bending me over
and driving it up the chocolate highway--
let's be honest.
You're a one-handed surgeon, Robert,
not to mention a human resources nightmare,
and a lousy administrator
who's burned more bridges than you've ever built.
You're lucky to have options at all.
Oh, you're suggesting I have some.
Yes, you do; you have three.
It's this, it's teaching or it's out.
Could I get your home address...?
Bite me, Nancy.
Dr. Romano, I have some billing give-backs from Anesthesiology.
Not my job.
Cardio Admin's on line one for you.
Take a message.
Well, what do I tell them?
That I don't work here anymore.
( door opens )
What are you doing?
I'm taking Mrs. Tucker to X ray.
That's what orderlies are for.
Park Granny and go help someone drain an abscess.
Yeah, but I got... You're a med student.
You're not doing scut, you're not doing squat.
Hey, Green Card, I want all your performance evals by day's end.
Why? I want something to read when I'm on the can.
Why do you think, Igor? You're on my hit list.
Who supplies the nurses' scrubs?
Allied.
Switch to Lindeman's.
They hug booty better.
What the hell are you looking at?
Oh, hey, hey, hey, everybody!
Great news-- pinata out in the parking lot.
Andale, andale.
They're here for one of their kids.
Yeah? Well, they need to stop having kids.
Clear them out or you're fired.
What?!
Let me rephrase that; you're fired.
You can't fire nurses.
I just did.
Hey, pituitary boy.
You talking to me?
Yeah, I lost my arm, not my olfactory nerve.
Sic Security on the bum taking a crap over there,
and get me a list of every staff member's salary,
including yours.
What was that all about?
Meet the new boss.
And get rid of this coffee machine in here!
You losers can pay for your own java!
Oh! At times like this,
I wish I practiced in Florida.
No, it's too humid.
Plus, you'd miss me.
Huh, well, I wouldn't miss the wind chill.
Hey, Dr. Chen, how many candles?
Hey, I said no cake.
Happy birthday, Jing-Mei.
Like you even knew.
Yes, I did. Uh-huh.
And I got you something.
Really? Mm-hmm.
And I figured if you weren't busy later,
I would take you over to the Grotto,
and maybe we'd get some champagne afterwards.
Ooh, you thought this through, didn't you?
Yes, indeed; why wouldn't I?
How you doing?
CDs, jewelry and personal accessories,
all at discount rates.
Uh, no, thanks.
Ladies love stuffed animals.
Five bucks for this little cutie.
Don't make me hurt you. Hey, hey, this is America.
If you can't sell crap on the street,
we're not a free society.
Bye. Come on, get out of my way.
Okay, I should be back by 6:00.
She woke up early.
So make sure she takes a nap, okay?
Okay. Hey, you like the sign I put up?
Yeah. It's, uh, sweet.
Okay, my darling, bye-bye.
Hey, kids love stuffed animals.
Five bucks for this little cutie.
No, thank you. Comes in pink.
You're scaring her.
I got dolls in here, too.
Go, go!
( screaming )
My foot! My foot!
Told Haleh she was fired.
Said it was a management tool.
Always fire someone the first day.
Lets them know who's boss.
He can call himself king as long as I get severance.
Hey, Abby, can you park Mrs. Strohm here in Exam One?
Uh, no. We lost another exam room.
( sighing )
Go park her in the hall.
Weaver never had an office.
Said he'd take the lounge if we're not careful.
And put our lockers where?
Triage?
Oh, that's great.
So, now our personal stuff can get stolen, too.
Too late.
Brand new leather gloves right out of my locker.
Real leather?
Yeah. Why?
Animals died to make them.
Right, and we should all wear canvas shoes.
Oh, God!
I could use a little help here.
CARTER: What happened?
Corday's nanny ran over his foot.
With her freakin' minivan. I'm crippled.
How did this become your problem?
Elizabeth decided that it was an E.R. case.
Yeah, it's typical.
We got any open beds?
ROMANO: Yeah, if he's a paying customer.
Otherwise, park him in the hall.
For anyone late for his or her shift,
be advised that I am now in charge
of this human cesspool.
Say good-bye to the warm fuzzies of the Weaver era,
and hello to the age of efficiency
and cost effectiveness.
Future tardiness will result in a docked paycheck
and/or letter to file.
And once you do get to work on time,
you will treat, you will street,
and you will do so as quickly as humanly possible.
Any questions? Didn't think so.
Medivac, two minutes out; auto versus ped.
Kovac and Carter,
and keep dispositions under 20 minutes.
Doctors Lewis, Chen and Pratt can focus on clearing the board,
and you can get me a breakfast burrito,
extra cheese, hold the salsa.
Please?
Get your love at home.
Should be interesting.
Romano in charge.
Seen any movies lately?
Nope.
Tried that sushi place at Navy Pier yet?
No.
It's good.
Long time now...
that you've been together.
Yeah, a year?
Almost.
That's nice.
Josh Rushing, 37.
Long way from County.
Busy day; we go where they tell us.
Scalp lac, multiple contusions.
Probable hit-and-run.
He's suffering from exposure.
He's been down a while. Homeless?
After a couple of days out,
everybody looks homeless.
Is Susan Lewis working today?
Yeah. Why?
Jack-knifed rig on the Dan Ryan
with an SUV trapped underneath.
Damn it, we got to go!
Okay, on my count-- one, two, three.
CBC, lytes, bun, creatinine,
and let's get an accu-check.
His wallet says he's an accountant from Indiana.
What's he doing walking the back roads of Illinois?
Got a clavicle deformity on the left.
Exercise? 18 in the right A.C. with a liter up.
Accu-check is 96.
Not in loafers.
Pretty isolated out that way.
Lucky they found him at all.
All right, what have we got?
A possible car versus pedestrian.
Vitals stable but unresponsive.
This is why I went to med school--
so I could practice veterinary medicine.
Sonosite.
Both lungs are up.
He doesn't need a chest tube.
I'll be the judge of that.
Not in the middle of a trauma. Who is it?
It's a collect person-to-person from Zagreb.
ROMANO: No blood in Morrison's...
Your dad?
No free fluid, no pericardial
...named Gordana. effusion, nothing.
Catch. May I?
Hello. Don't ever call this number again.
Why did you do that?
Hey, you want to chew the fat with the peasants back home,
dial Ten-Ten-Call the Third World.
Okay, c-spine, chest and pelvis to start.
KOVAC: He needs a rectal.
Oh, um, I took the liberty of checking the union manual.
You can't fire nurses.
They have their own administrative authority.
You have to lodge a complaint with the nurse manager.
Fine. Tell Hally, or whatever her name is,
that she can stay.
She already went home.
Uh, good, good, good.
Then have her come back,
but make sure she deducts for the time she was gone.
And give me bullet points
on who I can pink slip, and for what reasons.
There are six unions on the floor.
That's 12 volumes of material.
Fine, do yours last.
So, uh...
so, what's the story here?
Sammy got ahold of Dad's nail gun.
Who knew he'd use it as a weapon?
He's a seven-year-old boy. Everything's a weapon.
This the nail gun injury?
Yeah.
Well, Dr. Corday's got this now.
Apparently, Sammy didn't think it was loaded.
No. I knew.
Well, the puncture appears to have glanced off the rib.
You'll be fine.
D.T. and a gram of Ancef?
Yeah... and, uh,
a psych consult for the son, perhaps.
So, how's it going down here?
Want to hear something scary?
I miss Weaver.
Fresh pot.
Enjoy it while you can.
How you doing?
Very well, thanks.
New digs, new challenges, crappy coffee.
Interest you in a cup?
I'll pass.
Smart woman.
Look, I think it's awful, just to let you know.
A waste... really, of your... of your skills, your talents,
but, um, I'm sure it will be temporary.
Yeah.
Anything I can do to help?
( clattering )
You could shoot me now.
B.P. stable 120/78, and the tox screen's back.
No drugs or alcohol in his system, crit's 50.
Hemoconcentrated.
Neuro exam looks non-focal.
I don't know.
On his own, no car, out in the middle of nowhere.
You think he was robbed?
Still had his wallet with him.
Maybe he got dumped.
Maybe his wife knows.
He's wearing a wedding ring.
They're trying to track her down.
100 of thiamine, just in case.
Did you know about it?
What?
The Romano coup d'Ã©tat.
No idea.
Does it mean anything?
Yeah, we're screwed.
Dr. Weaver.
John, I have to
turn over a number of outstanding projects.
Resident's time study,
a Q/A of our portable ultrasound training.
I'd be really grateful if you'd see them through.
Sure.
Excellent.
So... how long is Romano going to be down here?
What makes you think it's not permanent?
Because whoever runs the department
has to have good communication and clinical skills.
He is, uh... he's an experienced physician.
His background is entirely surgical.
John, you have to be associate professor
before you can be considered for department head.
I don't want his job, Kerry.
I just don't want to have to do two of them.
All right.
Which one of you smartasses stole my crutch?
( speaking Croatian )
Do you have any plans for tonight?
Oh, me and this guy named TiVo.
We're going to curl up in front of the tube. You?
Nah.
Everything okay?
Woman I went to med school with
has a patient who's very sick.
Young boy.
Is he terminal?
Post shunt Tetrology with pulmonary atresia.
Oh. He's outgrowing the shunts.
He needs unifoc and complete repair.
That's a pretty specialized procedure.
( man groaning ) Yup, so special it can't be done there.
Nicky Broomer, fell while running.
Shoulder dislocation and probable rib fracture.
Vitals normal except for pulse of 120.
( screaming )
This guy's a runner?
He's a junkie.
He gets chased by the cops
on a regular basis.
He fell on the sidewalk, all right? It was wet.
Are you high now, Nicky?
No, and he's staying that way.
Mint condition. The entire lot.
The sky's the limit as far as mark up
and the whole shebang's yours for only 30 bucks.
Hey.
I thought you said you couldn't walk,
your foot hurt so bad.
I hopped.
I'm on the phone here.
Yeah, take two Tylenol every four hours
and get a real job.
Hey, it's at 3:00.
What?
Cake for Chen.
Oh, right, right.
So, Chuny, what do you think-- flowers or candy?
Ah, it's got to be something she can wear
or what's the point?
Okay, let's see who's losing the dispo race.
Why that would be... Dr. Pratt,
who will now be punished for his indolent ways.
Lower back pain in Two,
and an unknown intestinal disturbance in Four.
Chop, chop.
In second to last place we have Dr. Lewis.
Well that's to be expected from one who ovulates.
She gets the maggot infestation in Two
and then of course we have Mr. Gallant
who's doing Cadillac work ups on Yugo patients.
How are you, hun?
Don't tell me. Don't tell me.
Says right here, "My blood pressure is high."
Well, hell, so's mine.
But rather than go to a busy ER,
I stay home and take my prescribed medication.
Have you tried that at all?
She's also diabetic and her EKG...
Is entirely unnecessary.
Give he a sublingual Nifedipine
and send her to clinic.
Yeah, but that's not a...
Are you filling some sort of
special needs quota here, Mr. Gallant?
You need me to say it slowly in the language of your people?
( slurred ): Sublingual Nifedipine.
And when you're done with her,
pick up six more.
She's your patient, not your mother.
They're letting any bottom feeder
with a check into med school these days?
Actually, Gallant is one of our best med students.
Well that doesn't bode well
for the future of emergency medicine
but maybe by the time he gets his license
we'll all be dead.
Typical, as Chief Resident,
I assign the med students their cases.
Oh, when, every other Tuesday?
Any patient here over six hours
is a failure of your management skills, not mine.
Treat, turf, or dispo.
With all due respect,
you don't have a background in emergency medicine,
and quite frankly, it isn't all that simple.
Feast or famine?
Hey, you're back.
Yeah, another chopper beat us to the punch.
Is Susan around?
Yeah.
( screaming )
Okay, your screaming isn't making our job any easier.
This is hard for him.
Settle down, okay?
It hurts like a son of a bitch.
It's going to continue to hurt
unless we pull your arm out.
Radial pulse is still strong.
Oh, God, please help me!
Maybe you should just go ahead
and give him more of versed or Fent.
Yes! Yes!
We already did, he should be unconscious.
Then why is he still screaming?
I don't know.
His ribs are broken.
Yeah, that and he's going through withdrawal.
I can't take it, baby!
Hey, Susan.
What?!
I got a guy here who says he's your husband.
What's he look like?
Uh...
tall, dark hair, flight nurse.
Yeah, that's him.
( man continues screaming )
You were in Las Vegas for, like, two days.
And three nights.
We met on the plane on the way over there.
Hung out all weekend.
Were you sober at any point?
Sunday night, we wanted burgers
so we took a cab to this drive through.
Turns out to be a mini-chapel.
Ah, so you figured,
"What the hell, let's get married."
I know, it was impulsive.
Impulsive?
Okay, it was really, really stupid.
Susan...
I'm getting it annulled anyway.
I haven't seen him since the wedding night.
Well my flight left the next morning,
he stayed there for a week.
He could have married six other women by now.
Hey, do even remember his name at least?
Uh, Chuck...
Martin?
I think.
Good luck.
Hey, stranger.
Hey.
Look, Nifedipine is contraindicated.
I'm not bottoming out her pressure
and stroking this lady out.
Gallant, you are preaching to the choir.
He's the one that needs to be educated about this.
And he wants to hear that from a med student.
Look, obviously he needs...
Blah, blah, blah.
Go talk to him.
If there's a problem I'll take care of it.
Got a lot of people scared.
Not you.
Still need to pay my rent.
Come on, Romano's bark
is so much worse than his bite.
Easy for you to say.
You can walk away if you want to.
So, Susan got married, huh?
Can't call her indecisive.
Call her crazy.
When are you people going to do something?
Oh, God...
So I spoke to an attorney.
Yeah, me, too.
He said annulling the marriage should be fairly easy.
That's what my guy said.
I have to admit, I was a little worried.
Why?
Well, you know.
It was consummated.
Oh, yeah, right.
A few times, as I remember.
More than a few times.
The cabana?
Right, right.
Right, but since we never lived together,
I figure it shouldn't be a problem.
You say anything to anyone?
Like who? My mom?
She'd kick my ass if she knew I deprived her of a wedding.
Same with mine.
I kind of figured it wasn't anyone's business, you know?
Exactly.
And pretty tough to explain, too.
Please, who are you telling?
Kind of had to have been there.
Yeah, made sense at the time.
Guess you have to get back to work.
Nah.
Morales, you don't write, you don't call.
No time to radio.
24-year-old female, passed out at Marshall Field's.
No trauma, no seizure.
What? You were shopping?
We were registering.
Debra's pregnant.
Don't tell me, you were going to say that next.
LOCKHART: BP's 100/60.
Sats are good.
Do you remember falling, Debra?
I remember feeling weak, but I haven't been eating.
Okay.
Start a second line and put up another liter.
Morning sickness?
Oh, bad.
My first wife had three kids.
She never even burped.
Maybe I'm not cut out for this.
What have we got?
Debra Strickland,
pregnant syncope, 18 weeks.
Hi, Debra.
Any cramping or spotting?
No.
Okay, let's spin a crit,
check a glucose and dip a urine to start.
Ow!
That hurts?
Mm-hmm. And my belly.
It never did before.
How about when I do this?
Ow!
Yeah.
Abby, can you see if Linda Woo is still here?
I can check.
Finally get a surgical candidate?
Oh, God, I need an operation?
Not necessarily.
Stripe in Morrison's.
Yup.
And in the pericolic gutter.
Probably blood judging from her hypertension.
Put the probe back over the kidney.
It is.
That doesn't look like it.
It's not.
Surgery's here.
What do you have for me?
24-year-old,
18 week IUP with hypertension,
intraperitoneal fluid and a renal mass.
Obvious ex-lap
for tissue diagnosis and staging.
Who are you?
Dr. Robert Romano,
head of surgery less than a week ago.
Who the hell are you?
This is Dr. Woo.
She started yesterday.
Ma'am, do you have any medical problems or allergies?
Are you deaf?
Um, let me page Corday.
I'll do it.
BP is dropping, 86/62.
Any moron can see she needs
surgical intervention for hemostasis.
Take her up.
I'm sorry, what's your position here?
Your practical and intellectual superior
with over 20 years of surgical experience
versus the two years of ass wiping
you call residency.
Take her up.
Done.
He was diagnosed at birth,
but access to any kind of care has been limited at best.
He's been revised?
Twice.
The last time, five years ago
and the surgical team that performed it in Croatia
has disbanded since then.
And there's nothing else in Europe?
Nothing they can afford.
And County's pediatric
thoracic group does unifocalization all the time.
Free of charge.
Yes, but he's not a citizen.
Neither are we, but we are here.
Look, even if you get a surgical team
to donate services, who's going to pick up the hospital tab?
With some PR,
charitable contributions could cover it.
Yeah, but Kerry would still have to sign off on it.
Are you on good terms with her?
Uh, not really.
Well neither am I.
Look, leave it with me, I'll see what I can do.
Thanks.
Where's Dr. Woo?
She... left.
You need to teach your residents
to have thicker skin, Lizzie.
She only cried a little.
Pratt's consoling her.
Oh, dear.
Crit's 19, type and cross for eight
and transfer two as soon as we get them.
Right.
Interperotineal fluid and a mass.
And pregnant with profound hypertension.
My guess, renal cell CA.
Necrotic mass obscuring and deforming
the capsule of the left kidney.
Bleeding across the peritoneum,
more like metastases.
She'll definitely need surgery.
Hello.
I'd like a CT of the abdomen if I can
and have OB involved as well.
She's stable enough now.
Yeah, sure, why don't we get a third consult,
maybe ask the janitor what he thinks.
I'm down here less than a day,
already I'm starting to hate surgeons.
Is something wrong with the baby?
No.
The baby's quite healthy, actually.
GALLANT: Dr. Romano.
You have a minute?
Less than.
It's about my high blood pressure patient this morning.
I should have pointed it out to you,
but the use of sublingual Nifedipine
is no longer indicated because of a number
of case fatalities from stroke.
I never said Nifedipine, I said up her Metroprolol.
Works fine for hypertension.
No, actually you said Nifedipine and you said...
Okay, okay, listen, okay, Goofus.
I'm the doctor, you're not.
It seems to me that if it is your intention...
My intention is to serve out my time in this hell hole
without having Affirmative Action imbeciles like you
make me regret ever having gone into medicine.
Your minute's up.
Hey, where are my bullet points? Uh, right.
Well, obviously you can't fire medical students,
but failing them is a bad idea,
because then they just have to repeat the rotation.
I'd suggest a marginal pass.
All right, what else?
( Nicky groaning )
You can, however, fire care partners.
What the hell's a care partner?
I can't stand it. I'm in pain.
It's like a... non-union orderly.
Hey, you. What's your name?
Ah, I can't stand... I'm in pain...
Jim. Yeah, you pay union dues, Jim?
No. Good. You're fired.
I need something!
That is putting me on edge.
Yeah, well, it was a lot worse when his girlfriend was here.
Tell Lewis to gag him, sedate him, or kill him.
She's on break.
What? Is there some prerequisite for working here?
You have to be a know-nothing drag ass
who doesn't wear a watch?
I always suspected Weaver would kill her own mother
to get out of this dung heap, and now I know why.
Because apparently, only the Chief
of Emergency Medicine is concerned
with clearing the board.
You got to help me. Hands off, low life.
Oh, somebody... All right, you.
Where are your parents?
I don't have any.
They died in a car crash last year.
( moaning ) Bummer. So, what's your problem?
I need it bad, man.
I need something really bad.
Hey, Chuny, could you move him into Exam Four?
My pleasure. Come on.
Oh God, I need a push.
Wait. Just one more paragraph in the lab tech union manual.
Can you make sure
that I see all of Romano's patients
before anyone gets dispo'ed today?
Sure.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Doesn't mean you don't have to work with him.
Okay, where were we?
Um, I reached for the soap,
down I went, landed right on my... rump.
Well, that's not good.
Any loss of consciousness?
No, just loss of dignity.
I know, I know, I'm late, I'm late.
I had to move Nicky.
He was driving everybody crazy.
Oh, sorry, thank you.
And I sent up labs on your hyperemesis patient,
dispo'ed your "no longer itchy" rash guy.
Yikes, was I gone that long?
I'll tell you what.
If you take Sandra here, we'll call it even.
I got to go check on a patient up in CT.
Done.
Slip-and-fall in the shower, possible wrist fracture.
Congratulations.
On what?
Your newlywed status.
Ooh, lucky.
Excuse me.
Oh, I've probably been looking for Mr. Right
ten years longer than you, and still haven't found him.
( coughing )
Last time it happened, they kept me here.
( coughing )
You're done?
I think so.
What happened to your arm?
Are you physically incapable of keeping your mouth shut?
I mean, were you born that way or something?
None of your beeswax.
Breathe deep.
Hey. What do you do for soft asthma?
A couple of nebs and some prednisone?
You're asking a nurse?
Yeah, what you said,
only I take an adult dose now.
What he said I said.
Then discharge with follow-up.
Okay. That took all of eight minutes.
See people, it can be done.
What can be done?
Oh, BS-ing your way through a shift, I suppose.
Hey, listen, I didn't mean to be nosy before.
I was just making little talk.
Small talk.
Dr. Kovac,
your exposure guy is coming to.
Any word on Rushing's wife?
No, they're still trying to get hold of her.
Mr. Rushing?
Mr. Rushing, can you understand me?
Yeah.
Do you know what happened to you?
Car...
( labored breathing )
...crashed.
Your car?
( labored breathing )
Where are they?
Who?
My kids.
We were driving...
Walked to get help.
Oh, my God.
Go get the police.
His kids are still out there somewhere.
( shuddering )
( soft groan )
So, how long have you been married?
Um, two years.
Some people think the age difference is a problem,
but I can't keep up with him.
We're going to minimize the exposure
to protect the baby.
"Our little accident," Bill likes to call him.
Oh, you're having a boy?
Just a guess.
Will you be able to tell?
No, not with this.
Oh, good.
I want to be surprised.
Okay, you have to lay very still,
and there's an intercom in case you want to talk.
Okay.
CT Abdo/Pelvis with...
and without.
Fine cuts right through the kidney.
Debra, when we shoot
the rest of the dye in, you may continue
to feel kind of a warm tingling sensation.
Okay.
Well, there it is.
Some smaller masses in the abdominal cavity, too.
But, hey, I'm just the tech.
Hematoma and fluid from where the main tumor bled.
She's going to need a nephrectomy.
Yeah, like now.
Well, I guess Romano was right about one thing today.
DEBRA: Is it almost over?
What are their names?
S... Sally.
Tim.
Do you know how badly they were hurt?
It was dark.
( labored breathing )
I just remember crying...
LOCKHART: B.P.'s stable.
128/80.
Pulse is 106.
They were
so scared.
( crying )
LOCKHART: Luka...
Uh, another liter
of warm saline.
Do you recall where it happened?
Do you recall when it happened?
No.
( crying )
They're dead, aren't they?
LOCKHART: We're trying to find them.
OFFICER: I'm going to start calling some of this in.
Okay, this guy's approaching the six hour mark.
Is he stable?
Just finishing up a Heimlich.
Which is the cheesy ER way of dealing with a pneumothorax.
I did it so he could stay here
in case his family's found.
So turf him to medicine.
Let them hold hands and sing "Kumbaya" there.
His kids could be seriously hurt. That's right.
But he's not, so get him the hell out of my trauma room.
Look... What, what, what?
Is this mandatory therapy crap making you a little soft, Kovac?
Do us both a favor.
Stop seeing your shrink.
I don't believe in it, and frankly,
if you're that screwed up, quit.
Where the hell have you been?
Get back to work.
Hey, welcome back.
Right. X ray's backed up,
and she's complaining of a headache.
Let's get her to curtain area three
and give her some Tylenol.
You could probably use a lunch tray by now.
What I could use is a husband.
Does yours have a brother?
Oh, no. Damn!
Kippy, my man!
Foot still hurts like hell!
I should sue you clowns.
Yeah, yeah, look, I'm in a rush man.
What you got for the ladies?
Stuffed animals. No, man.
I need something that a lady can wear.
Ah...
I got some handmade jewelry,
some perfume...
tie-dyed T-shirt!
Uh-uh. Wait!
We got some new items in.
How much?
What's this doing here?
Uh, we always have cake when it's someone's birthday.
Woman pops a kid out,
what the hell difference does it make what day it is?
No more official or unofficial recognition
of birthdays.
Oh, you can't be serious.
Singing, blowing out candles, eating.
By the time it's all said and done,
everybody's had a half-hour break with pay.
It fosters community.
Yeah, and lethargy by the looks of things.
Sandra Haycox. What about her?
She has a broken wrist.
Cast her and cast her off.
She's complaining of a headache now.
Uh-uh. Tell her to take a number and get back in line.
One complaint per visit.
Hey, who ate my cake?
( girl screaming )
What happened?
Eight-year-old front passenger in a single-car MVA.
Seat belt, shoulder harness.
Air bag deployed.
Pretty hard from the looks of it. Facial abrasions.
May have a ruptured globe.
Why was she sitting in the front seat?
Ask Grandma.
The tumor outgrew it's blood supply,
then part of it died, ruptured and bled.
That's why you passed out.
It could rupture again at any moment,
so it's important that we remove it
and the kidney as soon as possible.
Well, what kind of a tumor is it?
We don't know.
And we won't know
until we get a pathology report.
Do you think it's cancer?
Let's take this one step at a time.
My mother died of cancer.
If that's what this is, I should know.
Debra...
I should know.
CORDAY: It appears likely
to be renal cell carcinoma, yes.
And, if it's as aggressive as it seems,
it's possible that you would require chemo
and radiation therapy following surgery.
CARTER: Unfortunately,
chemotherapy is unadvisable while pregnant.
You said it was aggressive.
Yes, but...
Take it out.
Take everything.
Are you saying you wish to terminate, as well?
Just... just do it all at once.
Typically, those procedures would be done separately.
CORDAY: If you had the surgery,
and then waited until after
the baby was born...
I want the chemo.
Honey... ( crying )
I want it now.
CARTER: We're going
to leave you alone to talk.
( crying )
Honey.
I guess she figures she can try again
if she beats the cancer.
In three week's time,
the fetus might be viable outside the womb.
She could fight it then.
She doesn't want to take that chance.
She's young. She's scared.
Yeah.
* La gallina busca el maize y el trigo *
pH is still over nine.
Pilar, how many fingers do I have?
No veo nada!
* Los pollitos dicen pio, pio, pio *
Do you think the blindness is temporary?
I've seen alkali keratitis go both ways,
but this doesn't look good.
How's Grandma?
Well, she needs an immobilizer for her knee.
Otherwise, she's fine.
What a difference height makes, huh?
Why would anybody put their kid in the front seat?
She begged me to.
She's my only grandchild.
I just wanted to make her happy.
Could you grab a couple of Morgan Lenses
from the eye exam room?
CHEN: Yeah, sure.
Okay, this isn't going down
as one of my better days.
That applies to all of us.
Wait a minute.
Why is it quiet all of a sudden?
( sighs )
Unbelievable!
It was too hard to watch.
So you went out and scored?
You weren't doing anything.
I had to.
You want Narcan?
Put him on a monitor.
At least someone's happy.
Of course, it would be pro bono.
Have you looked at our budget lately?
Every time we open our doors, we're working pro bono.
We're in a deep deficit, Elizabeth.
I could contact local cardiac surgeons
and specialists, ask them to donate their services.
Which would account for about 25%
of the total costs, and forget about Medicaid.
The boy's not even a U.S. citizen.
Well, that might be something
that would interest the media.
I mean, look at the-the separation
of the Guatemalan conjoined twins.
Well, somehow, I don't think
a Croatian kid needing a Tet Repair is going
to get the same draw.
Kerry, he's nine years old.
He'll die without it.
And we're just not able to help right now, I'm sorry.
( pager beeping )
Kerry, can I ask you something?
Are you as concerned
about Robert as I am?
Uh, more precisely...
his mental health.
He seems...
broken by this assignment.
He's a cockroach.
He'll refuse to evolve, and yet survive us all.
Talk to me about residents.
Um, you need beaucoup documentation,
but you have a more powerful weapon
in scheduling.
As long as they don't pull more
than 16 shifts a month,
or work more than three nights in a row,
you can book them for every weekend,
holiday, or playoff night you want.
That's good stuff. Thank you.
How come the delinquent hasn't been dispo'ed yet?
Uh... that wasn't on my list of things to do.
You didn't give Eddie enough prednisone
with his albuterol.
Let me get something straight.
You overrode my orders?
Yeah.
Before he can leave, he needs to be able to walk
and hold normal sats, which he can't do.
Uh-oh, you screwed up. No, I did not.
Maybe you haven't been listening.
There's a lot of basic medical treatments...
Because I believe I've made myself clear.
a surgeon wouldn't do every day,
and a lot of people here who can help you...
You don't question my judgment.
keep from making critical mistakes...
You do not override my orders...
that would result in serious injury...
and you sure as hell don't
get too comfortable here, Dr. Carter.
This is my ER now.
And it stands for one thing--
Everyone's Replaceable...
even you.
I need to know what to tell the guy.
That better be a local call. It's a police matter.
They haven't found the car yet?
We checked every road, bridge, and river
within five miles of where we found him.
Why not ten or 15?
There's no way he could've walked that far
with those injuries.
He was getting help for his children.
Man...
I'm already covering a lot of territory.
With search teams, with dogs?
It's 40 degrees out there.
Look, we're doing all we can.
Luka, where's Dr. Romano?
I don't know and I don't care.
Hey, Chuny, how's it going?
Don't even.
John.
Thought you were long gone.
Yeah, I just wanted to check
and see how Robert was doing.
As expected, he was abysmal.
He has no patient rapport,
severely stunted interpersonal skills,
and he's incredibly hostile.
Qualities consistent with most surgeons.
Kerry, the guy doesn't know what he's doing,
and he doesn't want to learn.
And he almost killed a patient today
by prescribing an antiquated treatment.
But obviously, you stopped him from doing so.
Yeah, but I can't stay on top of the guy 24-7.
I'm trying to shift him to a more administrative role.
What are you going to do, chain him to his desk?
Look, the ER may not be the best fit for Dr. Romano,
but it's all the man has.
Just make it work,
or better yet, work around him.
Okay.
Excuse me. I'm Diana Rushing.
I got a message saying my husband was brought here.
Yeah, Dr. Kovac; he treated your husband.
What is it? Rushing's wife.
I'll take you to him.
Is he okay? Been worried sick
the whole drive over here-- I'm from Indiana.
He's stable, but he's obviously very upset.
When did you see them last?
Josh left home four days ago. Who's "them"?
Your husband and your children. What children?
He said he was with them in the car when he crashed.
We don't have children.
Her caretaker says
she's been complaining of white discharge.
She have her period yet?
Says she's a real woman.
Mindy, hi, I'm Dr. Lewis. How are you feeling? Good.
We're going to do a test on your private parts, okay?
Set up for a pelvic.
It's probably a simple yeast infection.
Sandra? How's your headache.
Did the acetaminophen help?
Sandra... Sandra?
I need a crash cart.
I thought she came in with a broken wrist.
She did. What happened?
I don't know. Pulseless and apneic.
V-fib. Charging to 200.
And clear.
Unit number six, going up.
Tumor mass has invaded the renal artery wall
and sections of the vena cava.
You want me to call again?
They won't tell me anything I don't already know--
it's stage 4B by the size and the spread of it.
Let's take the kidney out.
INTERCOM: Dr. Corday, call on line one.
If it's Path, put it on speaker.
Pedicle clamp in place.
Metz to divide the vessels.
Dr. Corday?
Yes, Dr. Meechum, what are your findings?
Furhman Grad four
with sarcomatoid pattern and a high mitotic picture.
( sighs )
Sorry.
Thank you.
Done. Steel bowl.
That's bad, I take it.
Irresectable. We'd be doing her a favor if she bled to death.
Her chance of survival is less than 2% at this point.
Get her husband up here. I want to speak to him now.
Charge again to 360 and clear.
Asystole.
It's been 20 minutes.
Uh, try another amp of epi.
JOHN: And... clear.
ABBY: No pressure, no pulse.
JOHN: A headache, a fall, a blown pupil...
possibly jogged an aneurysm she already had.
ABBY: No way you could have known about it.
JOHN: No way she could have known about it.
Yeah, I'm sure she wasn't planning on dying today.
( sighs )
18:27.
Well, he's depressed.
That, combined with aspects of disassociative disorder
allowed him to create this weird, negative amnesia.
Was it a psychotic break?
Mm, not per se, but he definitely needs inpatient psych care.
When he talked about them, he made them sound so real.
Well, to him they are. Right now, anyway.
But they won't always be.
With the right meds, it'll all fade away.
Ow!
Cervical motion tenderness.
PID?
Yup.
Mindy, do you have a boyfriend?
Uh-huh.
You're pretty young to be having sex,
much less unprotected sex.
You need to tell him to use condoms.
What are those?
That's not a good sign.
Can you tell me his name
so we can make sure he gets checked?
He cleans floors.
He says he loves me.
400 of cefixime and a gram of azithro.
We're just going to help you get dressed, okay?
Oh, man.
You want me to call the facility?
Nah, call the police first.
It's official. This has been one of the worst days of my life.
Careful. Don't jinx yourself.
( sighs ): Ugh.
Good night, everyone.
Happy birthday, Dr. Chen. Oh, thanks.
Hey, my gloves.
What? Camel colored
with lambskin inside, are those mine?
No. No. Greg just gave them to me.
They were in my locker this morning.
Yeah, so what? I bought those out on the street.
You bought these on the street?
Yeah, from Kippy.
Oh, my God.
It's a long story.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, I mean...
( scoffs ): I can't believe you bought my birthday present on the street.
Yeah, but it was a good deal.
I mean, they're genuine leather.
If I were you, I'd put them under a Wood's lamp.
( chuckles ): Nice.
Hey. Hey.
What are you doing here?
Well, I know we're not supposed to see each other
until the lawyer's office,
but I figured if your day was half as bad as mine,
maybe you could use some company.
Well, eight-year-old blinded by an air bag,
woman keels over of an aneurysm,
junkie shooting up in the E.R.,
and a teenage Down's Syndrome girl with the clap.
Hmm. We had a family of four trapped in a burning vehicle,
only one kid survived; he's 18 months old.
You win.
What'd you get?
Oh, the, uh, burger and fries we never got.
Knit one, purl two?
You take much longer, you're going to be sewing scabs.
If I go faster, the edges don't evert well.
I love watching med students suture.
It reminds me how good I am.
Was.
What did you say?
He said "was."
Loose stools in Exam Four.
Knock yourself out.
We're almost there.
Skin stapler will be next.
Cut, please.
Pressure's steady at 110/68.
He's here.
Mr. Strickland...
( sighs ): ...I'm afraid we've discovered
a highly malignant and inoperable cancer.
Stapler ready. Your-your wife's chance of survival,
even with the most aggressive form of chemotherapy,
is extremely poor.
But not impossible?
The one sure thing is that she will survive long enough
to deliver your baby
if she doesn't seek treatment.
However, in order for that to happen,
you'd have to reverse her decision.
How close are we?
Almost closed.
She wants to live.
Mr. Strickland...
if you wish to overrule your wife's decision,
you're going to have to do it quickly.
The GYN team here is standing by to perform an abortion.
( gasping )
I want her to live.
Your wife is going to die.
She's going to fight this.
Do you understand this baby has a chance?
I ca... I can't.
I just can't.
Dr. Corday...
Dr. Corday.
Mr. Strickland.
Let's get her draped.
Start with the sterile spec.
( sighs )
Another?
Yeah.
And stop skimping on the peanuts.
ROMANO: Hey...
how about putting something on
for those of us in the room without hairy knuckles?
Something wrong with this show?
Yeah. It only appeals
to adults making less than 20 grand a year.
30 grand.
Oh. Car wash gave you a raise-- good for you.
I'm a copier tech.
Well, that explains the dirty fingernails,
but not why you enjoy watching half-naked chunky-trunks
pull tractors with their teeth-- must be some sort
of homo-erotic thing for you, I guess?
