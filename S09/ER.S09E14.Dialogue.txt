Previously on ER:
Hey! Where are you going?
Want to see a picture of my new girlfriend?
Sure.
What do you think?
It's a plane.
We were just allotted
$2.4 million dollars in new funding.
I just hope that we earned the allocation
based on our merit.
It's the least I could do.
Helen is complaining
of intermittent right side abdominal pain.
I think it's a tumor.
I doubt it.
I didn't realize you were back
on surgical rotation.
ROMANO: Nothing has changed.
I'm losing what little strength I had,
and sensory function is non-existent.
What do you want, Robert?
I want my arm back.
WOMAN: Oh, my God...
LOC on scene, but awake
when we got there with GCS of 13.
Calm down. We're going to take care of you.
Oh, God!
What we got? 17-year-old.
Auto versus multiple peds at a high school.
Open facial fracture, abdominal pain.
Sounds like she dumped a lung.
BP's 110/70.
Tachy after one liter. Name's Gayla Ray.
Break out the epistaxis tray, page trauma.
Gayla, do you have any medical problems
we need to know about?
LOCKHART: That's a "yes."
Is this the full arrest crush injury?
Pinned between the car and a wall.
Bunch of kids got nailed
on the front steps of their school.
Drunk driver?
Worse, 16-year-old got a driver's license.
Still no pulse. CHEN: Resume CPR.
You try and tube her in the field?
Twice, but she's way anterior.
Had to scoop and run.
ROMANO: Car versus pedestrian--
steel's going to win every time.
Chest full of sub-cue air. Thoracotomy?
Tube in every hole and pronounce. What?
And since Pratt went out of his way
to wear a tie this morning,
let's let him do chest, airway,
and needle the pericardium.
She's young, she might convert.
Yeah, and there might be a brand-new Hyundai
behind door #1, but more than likely
it's a jackass and 50 cases of elbow macaroni.
Vaseline gauze. I'll give you $200
if you've got a surgical candidate on that gurney.
ENT, ortho and general to start.
Okay, let's turn her.
I can't breathe...
Don't try and swallow, okay?
We'll get that blood out for you.
I'm scared.
ROMANO: Don't be.
Rocket Romano never lets anything happen
to pretty girls like you.
LOCKHART: Tachy at 120.
BP's 100, systolic.
Frazier tip suction for the nose.
Zygoma is mobile.
It looks like a LeFort three.
Does it hurt when I press here, Gayla?
Okay, we need to operate on your belly,
but don't worry, you're going to be fine.
You have a minute to speak privately?
I've got a girl losing blood by the pint,
but sure, let's have coffee and donuts.
Call Maser in the OR, tell her we got a hot e-lap.
You think a posterior bleed?
ROMANO: Place to start.
I left you a number of messages.
A gram of Cefotetan and make sure
the blood bank gets a clot this time.
Even sent a memo.
She stable enough for CT?
Tachycardic and hypotensive.
Let's get this little minx upstairs.
That's all right, I'll take her.
What do you think you're doing?
Based on your fine assessment and e-lap.
Call and have one of the surgical residents scrub in.
I already did that for Dr. Romano.
Despite the fact he has no OR privileges?
I'm a supervising attending.
Only on procedures you're capable
of performing yourself.
What are you saying? I can't scrub in?
I'm saying, read my memo.
Let's get this young lady
to the OR.
Oh, and congratulations, Kerry.
No one deserves it more.
If you can't vote, you shouldn't be able to drive.
I got my license the minute I turned 16.
Yeah, but you were never a teenager-teenager.
You're responsible.
I was a total idiot.
All I cared about was finding a boyfriend.
Hmm, nothing like now, right?
Do you think Carter can cover
the last hour of my shift?
He's leaving for Belize.
Ah, the scuba thing.
Mm-hmm. A week of fun in the sun.
Yeah, while you get stuck here in the rain.
Well, all of his diving buddies are nitrox-certified,
whatever that means, and I can barely snorkel, so...
Still.
What do you have, a date or something?
A friend of a friend set me up with some guy.
Blind date.
Just proves that some of us never really leave high school.
Sasha Melman,
16, bilateral femur fracture.
It's amazing she's not worse.
Book, shoes, blood everywhere.
It hurts so much!
Sasha, I'm Dr. Lewis.
Can you wiggle your toes for me?
I don't think I can.
Good popliteal pulses.
Okay, page ortho.
A gram of ancef and 300 of gent.
Are my friends okay?
Yes, we're helping them.
Helen Broznich, up and limping at the scene.
Vitals stable, no LOC, no chest or abdominal injuries.
Any ETOH or drugs on board?
She denies both, but she's agitated.
He's choking me.
This the driver?
Helen, I'm Dr. Weaver.
Where are you hurt?
Everywhere, all the time.
GALLANT: What's open?
Trauma two.
( alarms beeping )
Come on, damn it.
Still agonal.
Try isuprel, wide open.
What's going on?
You completed the PEA algorithms ten minutes ago.
She's young, we want to give her a little longer.
You gave her a lot longer.
Call it or I will.
Oh, sorry, I thought the room was clear.
Is she dead?
Gallant, get Helen to another room for now.
That's Terri. Is she dead?
Gallant?
I thought I hit the brakes.
11:29.
Hmm.
What do you figure this cost the taxpayers?
"Kerry, congrats to the best doc in Chicago.
Alderman Bright."
Think he's trying to get her to change teams or what?
My guess?
Or what.
Hmm.
You know, I could pick up a bottle
of this stuff for us tonight if you want.
That stuff is about 200 bucks a pop.
Well, I guess you're buying then.
( laughs )
Dispo'ed Mr. Pagini.
Waiting on a bed for Mrs. Golove.
Mary Galloway is up in CT.
And I'm off to the second largest barrier reef
in the world.
Bring Dramamine.
And repellent.
They got mosquitoes the size of eagles in Belize.
Not to mention pirates.
So, Deb?
Hmm? You and Pratt, huh?
Uh, yeah, I guess. You guess?
Well, we're not, you know, exclusive or anything.
ER? Oh, Hi, Maggie.
We're just kind of casually attached.
Here, hold, let me check.
Frank, did we hear anything from OB
about a bed for Kim Cohen?
No, but I've got your mom on line one.
Abby? Line one?
Yeah, I'm on my way out.
Could you take a message?
You mean another one?
Maggie called?
Twice. Why?
I don't know.
She wants to talk to me.
Make it up, be a family, whatever.
You're not interested in doing that?
No, not really.
If you're mad at your mom, you should tell her.
Don't just ignore her.
Okay, thanks.
I took a split shift so I could see you off.
My flight's not for hours.
I know.
Did you see the car coming?
Two-inch scalp lac, GCS 15, no LOC.
I was going to throw in a few 5-0 nylon
and send her home with a head sheet.
Did you hear the squeal of brakes?
Switch to prolene. FRANK: ER.
Blue stitches are easier to find for removal.
Any other minor injuries in the accident?
Uh, just the driver in curtain three.
Bad ankle.
Apparently, she lost control of her car.
Dr. Lewis, this one's got a clotted PICC line.
Can you take him?
Oh, yeah, sure. Just give me a couple of minutes. okay?
16-years-old with stable lateral malleolus fracture
and multiple abrasions.
Blood alcohol and tox screen?
First thing cops had me check.
Came back clean.
Head CT's negative, but...
She's concussed?
Well, it's hard to tell.
Hi. I'm Dr. Lewis.
I remember you.
Said she was here last week.
Got diagnosed with hepatitis.
Oh, yeah, right.
So, um, uh, Helen, what happened today?
Uh, there are these squirrels at my school.
I saw one in the road.
And you swerved?
Squirrels are rabies carriers.
So are raccoons.
Is my dad here yet?
Uh, we'll go check, okay?
Well, she's not jaundiced enough
for hepatic encephalopathy.
Yeah, she'd be altered, not just weird.
Dr. Lewis, your blind date called.
The restaurant you picked doesn't work for him.
Oh, for God's sake.
He wants you to call him and regroup.
Hey, you choose someplace exotic?
Yeah, a steak house.
( laughs )
So, Keener's thyroidectomy
will now be supervised by Dr. Corday.
Correct.
What about Jocelyn Gaine's Billroth Two?
Uh, push it if possible.
I'm buried in administrative backwash.
If not?
Anspaugh will take it.
Robert.
Kerry.
There's going to be a press conference in a few minutes.
I wouldn't miss it for the world.
Look, I know you wanted the position,
and I just wanted to check in and make sure
that you are feeling okay about this.
Well, how am I feeling?
Um... pretty damned grateful, actually.
I've got a good heart, a good soul,
and unlike our newly appointed liaison,
two good legs.
Dr. Weaver, we're ready for you.
Ask yourself what you did to deserve this, Kerry.
A lot of hard work, actually.
Yeah, and what your Alderman wants in return.
He doesn't want anything.
Not everyone's an opportunistic asshole like you.
Yeah.
So I'm told.
You still okay with me going?
Yeah, I said I was.
And you meant it?
What are you thinking?
Nothing.
Work?
Nope.
Your mom.
God, no.
Come on, tell me.
A song.
Oh, yeah? Mm-hmm.
Which one?
From the '70s.
It's goofy...
"Blinded by the Light?" No.
"Love Will Keep Us Together?" No.
What?
* Rubbing sticks and stones together *
* Makes the sparks ignite...
No.
* And the thought of something, something *
* It's getting so exciting
Are you done?
* Skyrockets in flight
* Afternoon delight
( laughter )
* Aaa.... No, no, please don't.
Please don't.
( laughs )
( phone rings )
You going to get that?
No.
ALDERMAN BRIGHT: It's an utterly thankless position.
No money, endless paperwork, countless meetings.
But it still remains a great honor.
Therefore, on behalf of the Board of Commissioners,
I am proud and privileged to name Dr. Kerry Weaver
as Medical Liaison to Cook County's
Public Health Care Administration.
( applause )
Thank you, Alderman.
I, uh, couldn't have accepted this position
without the continued support of my colleagues here at County.
FEMALE REPORTER: Dr. Weaver,
how are you qualified for this office?
You mean can a non-policy wonk do the job?
Uh, well, running a trauma center is perhaps
the ultimate training ground
for public health care,
and we are in a health care crisis.
This position allows me the opportunity
to apply practical solutions to problems
that have been dealt with
all too bureaucratically in the past.
Are there any other questions?
How will balancing two demanding jobs affect your home life?
It won't.
She's single. So am I.
And we make a handsome couple, don't you think?
( laughter )
Thank you.
Hey, I reached Helen Broznich's father.
No chicken either, huh?
I'll come back.
Really? They actually fry tofu.
Okay, well, I'll see you tonight at 7:00. Bye.
Your, uh, your date's a vegetarian?
No, a vegan, whatever the hell that means.
Nothing with a face.
No meat, no eggs, no dairy.
Oh.
Oh, you're the guy with the PICC line.
Sean.
MAN: Need a doc over here!
Oh, got to go. You want these?
Oh, I...
Wilma Rasmussen, 94 years old,
with fever and altered mental status, BP 85/60.
That's pretty low. Pneumonia?
WOMAN: No, she's had pneumonia before.
This is different.
Her daughter. She live you?
No, I live with her.
Hey, save some donnatol for me.
Cut it out.
What?
I just need two tabs.
Oh.
Sorry.
No, actually, I'm the one who should be apologizing.
I was out of line earlier.
This is work, and the last thing
you need to deal with is gossip.
I get that, and I respect it.
You do?
Yes, I'm the same way.
CHUNY: Hey, Pratt.
I have a patient waiting for you in curtain one.
I'll be right there.
So you two going to get engaged?
No, not even close.
I don't know about that.
Pratt's been acting all in love.
MAN: Dizzy, weak,
light-headed...
PRATT: Classic symptoms of a low blood count.
Tinnitus, palpitations...
Drove my wife nuts over it.
She divorced me because of it.
Trouble is, you don't look anemic.
Yeah, but in pernicious anemia,
symptoms may occur
even in the absence of a low hemoglobin.
Trust me on this, Doc.
If I don't get a shot soon,
it's going to get a lot worse.
You been taking B-12?
Up until two months ago.
I went to see my doc in '86
'cause I was feeling really run down.
My doc made the diagnosis.
Since then, I've been feeling real fit,
as long as I stay regular on it.
Bastard died on me a month ago.
My doctor. That's why I'm here.
For your B-12 fix?
Yeah, I take up to 100 micrograms IM a month,
but, you know, I think since it's been so long,
I should take half a milligram.
I'm way overdue.
I think I'll need to check out a few things
before we go prescribing anything.
Save yourself the trouble.
"Victims of pernicious anemia"?
You're looking at the president.
So what do you think it is this time?
Your mom has a kidney infection.
Does that explain why she's so groggy?
Possibly, but she also has
a number of other health problems.
Haleh, can you send this up for culture?
Hang 500 of Levaquin
and start her on dopamine at five mikes per kilo.
Well, that sounds serious.
At 94, everything's serious.
GIRL: Excuse me, our friends were brought here.
There was an accident at our school.
What are their names?
Terri, Sasha, and I think Janey,
and Lisa also got hurt too.
Can we see them? Are they okay?
Excuse me, we can only give
that sort of information out to relatives.
But they're like our best friends.
Have your parents call the school,
and they'll update you on everything that's happening.
Was it that bad?
Did they die?
Oh, God, we totally cut class today.
I can only give that information out to relatives.
Was she there?
Did she see this happen?
Hey, wait, wait, you can't go in there.
Helen, you have to tell us what happened.
Why are you asking me?
Who all got hurt?
You don't even know me.
Forget her. She's a freak.
Let's call my mom.
She friends with the principle.
They're popular.
You did good, kid.
Thank you.
I only wish I'd fallen off a stage two years ago.
Would have kept us from appointing
your god-awful predecessor.
Still having trouble with that?
Ah, Kennedy had chronic back pain
and ran the country.
The least I can do is tolerate a bum knee.
You know what, let me write you a prescription
for some more Vicodin.
That's all right.
Don't be ridiculous.
Why suffer if you don't have to.
Touch base later this week?
Look forward to it.
Uh, don't put your pen away.
I need another signature for a subdural.
So, uh, congratulations on your appointment, by the way.
Thank you.
So what is it, a county committee type thing?
Something like that.
Well, if you can get us two more nurses a shift,
I'm all for it.
Still no word from Dr. Kovac?
Nope.
And you tried calling him again?
Yes, ma'am.
Yeah, Luka, this is Kerry Weaver.
I'm down two attendings and up 40 patients.
If you don't get in here
and start working your scheduled shifts,
I'm going to call the INS,
tell them your green card's a fake
and have your ass deported.
You'll need longer arms
if you're planning on treating her from here.
Why haven't you cleared her yet?
She still needs a posterior splint.
Dr. Weaver? Hold on.
Look, we're buried here, Gallant...
Look, I realize that...
It's the Emergency Services Committee....
If you and your attending
can't handle a simple ankle fracture, I'll do it.
Now clear the bed.
Where do you want it?
In the lounge and I don't want to be disturbed.
What'd I miss?
Two more messages from your mother.
She says it's very important that you call.
Right.
Carter get off okay?
Yes, he did.
Mm, five Sigma Nu's loose in Belize...
Hope they brought a lot of bail money.
You know, I still have friends on the PD
who could run a background check on your date.
Already checked, no arrests.
Or he hasn't been caught yet.
Aren't you the optimistic one.
Hey, you don't have any plans tonight, do you?
Excuse me?
Carter's off with the boys, it'd be fun.
Dinner and drinks?
Oh, don't let her talk you
into being her chaperone.
How is it everyone knows I have a blind date?
You told them.
MAN: Got a lady outside, won't get out of my cab.
I need a doctor.
Where's she hurt?
I don't know. She ain't moving.
CHEN: You know her name?
DRIVER: Yeah, right.
Showed me her birth certificate
before I gave her a lift.
CHEN: Ma'am, ma'am, wake up.
She's been beaten up.
Come on, open your eyes for us.
LOCKHART: She's got a weak radial pulse
and there's blood on her hands.
Ma'am, ma'am, can you tell us what happened?
Oh, wow.
Oh... come on. Let's go. Let's go!
I'm not going to get paid, am I?
No hemotympanum.
Systolic's 120 after the first liter.
This may burn a little.
( groaning )
It's okay, I'm just numbing up your belly.
Do you know who did this to you?
Kids.
Kids?
Need to pick my kids up from school.
Can arrange to have them brought here,
but we need to know your name first.
Monica... Walker.
Monica, we have to figure out
if your going to need surgery.
Got to go...
No, no.
You have to talk to the police later.
No... can't do that.
Please...
LOCKHART: Somebody beat you pretty badly.
She owes me 11 bucks and change.
Check the bra for cash.
What?
She's a hooker, that's where they keep it.
Hey, get the hell out of here, now.
Out, out!
What have we got? What have we got?
Penetrating abdominal injury of uncertain depth.
And these are?
Three lab-coated tumors.
You're teaching?
This is a teaching hospital.
Good bowel sounds, normotensive.
Can you tell how long the knife was?
'Cause you sure as hell didn't get in on your IQ.
Help me retract here.
Only into the sub-Q,
but there could be an intraperitoneal component.
Deep fascia's intact.
Gram of ancef and update her tetanus.
So no surgery. That' right.
You boneheads in the ER
are going to have to work for a change.
Irrigate the wound, loose approximation,
and follow serial exams.
Let's go. That way, what way.
Whose signature do I get for the chart?
Excuse me?
For the official surgical consult?
I'm head of surgery and chief of staff.
That should do it.
That way.
Turn left.
I don't like to be touched.
Dr. Weaver's almost finished.
They'll hate me even more now.
Who will?
Everyone at my school.
Why, because of what happened?
Helen, what happened was tragic, but it was an accident.
It was rainy, and you lost control of your car.
Who was your attending on this?
Dr. Lewis.
Get her.
Helen, do you ever have any problems
with rigid muscles or jerkiness?
I can be a real spaz sometimes.
You shouldn't be so hard on yourself.
LEWIS: What is it, Kerry?
She has gold-colored deposits in the cornea.
I don't like to be touched.
Kayser-Fleischer rings.
They're pathognomonic for Wilson's disease, right?
What's that?
Your body may have an inability to excrete copper,
causing it to build up in the liver and the brain.
Really?
We'll need to run some tests to be sure,
but I'll be right back, okay?
WEAVER: She was here a week ago?
I treated her and released her.
Did Gallant do an eye exam?
Of course he did,
but Wilson's is a total zebra, especially to a med student.
Yeah, what's your excuse?
Well, the rings may not have been this prominent last week.
Okay, send off a serum ceruloplasmin
and find me when you get the results.
She's having trouble breathing.
Who? Your old lady.
Pulse ox down to 82 on five liters.
What's happening?
Respiratory rate's up to 30.
The fluid we gave your mom to raise her blood pressure
is going to her lungs.
Normally, we treat with lasix and nitroglycerin,
but those would lower her blood pressure even further.
Oh, God.
Sharon, I know you love your mother very much,
but you need to think about how aggressively
you want to handle this.
You don't understand.
I need her.
Of course you need her. No.
I need her Social Security checks.
CHEN: Another 4-0 nylon.
He was a regular.
Just went nuts on me.
May be time for a new profession.
Got to feed my kids.
How old are they?
Luke's seven, Christy's 12.
They know what you do?
No.
Don't need to.
I'm there when the leave for school,
there when they get back and I'm there
till they go to sleep at night.
Wait, you go out after they're in bed?
Look, I'm not a junkie,
and I don't have a pimp.
I just work enough to support my kids.
But they're home by themselves.
LOCKHART: That was fast.
MONICA: I don't want to talk to him.
Well, they have to document the assault.
I don't want to talk to the police.
She doesn't want to file a report.
You Abby Lockhart?
Yeah.
Officer Beechum, Chicago PD.
We were asked to come find you. Me?
Minneapolis PD has reported that a small aircraft
your brother Eric Wyzcenski was flying has disappeared.
Your mother asked us to notify you.
Apparently, she was unable to reach you by phone.
Okay.
Okay, what, what does that mean, "disappeared"?
Where was he?
Well, radar last picked him up over Lake Superior 11 hours ago.
You can call the FAA up there
for more information.
I'm sorry.
Okay, explain to me
how somebody just goes off radar.
What you are saying is you think he went down.
Right. What-what are the other possibilities?
Okay, did...
did you have any communications from him,
like a Mayday or whatever...
No.
Yes, I'm reachable here.
I thought he was an air traffic controller.
He always wanted to fly.
He just got his license.
Did you reach Carter?
I had him paged in Miami,
but I guess the flight already took off.
Does your mom know anything?
I haven't called her.
Do you think you should?
I think I'm stressed out enough as it is
without having to deal with her, too.
Yeah, you should go home.
Do people know?
About Eric? Some.
I'd rather they didn't.
You should still go home.
I'm going to stay.
Thanks.
Hold, please.
Radiology needs you to send Stewart back up-- film's bad.
Abby, guy from the school district dropped off
Monica Walker's kids.
Who?
The hooker with the slashed belly?
All right, okay.
Hi.
Okay, I'll take you to see your mom now.
Is my mom going to be okay?
Yeah, she is.
Did she get mugged again?
Thanks anyway.
Kids are here.
Go ahead, go right in.
Hey, guys! Oh, it's good to see you.
She denied everything.
Told the cops she fell through a window.
Probably tell her kids
the same thing.
You think it would be better
if she told them a john slashed her?
Are you all right?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Mr. Marshman?
Could you turn your hearing aid down, please?
Thank you.
What?
Labs back on your B-12 guy, Vitelli.
Hemoglobin's 14, hematocrit's 42.
Anything wrong?
Stan, my man, it's your lucky day.
You giving me my shot?
No. Your doctor never did a Schilling test on you, did he?
I knew it was unlikely,
given your age, your ethnicity.
My grandmother is from northern Europe.
Ninety percent of pernicious anemia patients have
the anti-parietal cell antibody.
And your blood test was negative for it.
So I'm in the ten percent without the antibody.
You have a normal cobalamin level.
Do you know what that is, Stanley?
Vitamin B-12.
And what causes pernicious anemia?
B-12 deficiency from lack of intrinsic factor.
You don't have the disease.
You never did.
I can stay home and take care of you.
Don't even think about missing school on my account.
He's only trying to get out of a math test anyway.
Am not, butthead.
My little brother's goofy.
Ignore him, that's what I do.
Were you talking to me?
They're good kids.
I do the best I can, you know.
I really do.
I-I-I don't think I'm going to be able to get home
as early as I thought.
How... well, how about a late supper?
Kerry? Labs are back on Helen Broznich.
Sandy, I'm going to have to call you back.
Is the father here?
Yeah, you want me to tell him?
Absolutely not.
Hello. I'm Dr. Weaver.
Walter Broznich.
This is all so terrible.
How, how are the other girls?
Uh, I'm not sure.
I shouldn't have let Helen drive in that damn rain.
She going to be okay?
Mr. Broznich, in addition to the injuries
that your daughter sustained in the accident,
we found that she has a rare disorder
called Wilson's disease.
I'm confused.
Last week you people said she had hepatitis.
She does, in the sense that her liver
is inflamed as a result of copper accumulation.
I have some in my brain, too.
Wilson's is a genetic condition
that can cause both psychiatric and motor disorders,
in particular, jerky movements.
It's usually not symptomatic until adolescence.
Is that why I hit the gas
and not the brakes?
That would be my suspicion, yeah.
It's curable?
It's manageable.
There's a Rick Kelly who's a wildlife artist.
Click on that other Web site.
You think it's the rock climber?
Oh, cute!
Especially with those tight shorts.
( laughs )
What are you doing?
Ah, Google-ing your blind date.
What? That's so rude.
If you want to know anything about him, just ask me.
Why? You've never even met him.
( gasps ): Wow.
( laughs )
Buns of steel, huh?
Are you sure this is him?
( chuckling )
What's so funny?
What?
Sorry about what's happening with your brother, Abby.
Hopefully, they'll find him safe and sound.
Well, I'd better get back to the phones.
Where'd you say that Bell's Palsy patient was?
Exam One. Here, I'll show you.
I wish you'd just go home.
Why? So people can talk more freely
about my tragic family?
That's not where it's coming from.
You know that. They're concerned.
Yeah, I know.
MAN: Oh, what we can do is interview the children,
get a better sense of their home life.
Yeah, and if she's got customers going home with her,
there could be endangerment as well.
Who, who's this?
Uh, Bruce Dorchester, social services.
I'm new. I don't think we've met.
So if your findings support removal,
will the children be kept together?
Uh, we'll make every effort, yeah.
Um, why, why are you doing this?
Abby, I know you mean well, but we're...
But what? They're good kids.
Their mother provides for them.
Yes, by actively prostituting herself.
She has been arrested twice.
Is she under arrest now?
She admits to leaving her minor children
home alone at night. Oh, come on!
That's neglect. Come on, we've seen much worse.
By law we have to report this.
Look, I shouldn't have to explain this to you.
You have to explain it to somebody. It's wrong.
This isn't your call. Is it yours?
You're a nurse, Abby.
You don't have the power to make
this kind of decision.
I think this sucks.
DORCHESTER: What is her problem?
LEWIS: She's using accessory muscles
to breathe now.
She talking at all?
Asked where her daughter was.
Where is she?
Bathroom, I think.
Go to 20 mikes of dopamine.
Mrs. Rasmussen?
I need to talk to you about your condition.
Yes.
Your lungs aren't working too well anymore.
Neither is your heart.
If it gets much worse,
we're going to have to intubate you.
No.
Your daughter has asked us
to do everything we can to save you.
But in situations like this,
often, the treatment is worse than the condition.
There's something you can sign
called a "do not resuscitate" order.
Plums.
What?
There are plums in the backyard.
They're so lovely.
Sweet.
Do you like plums?
( sighs )
I brought an umbrella just in case.
It is beautiful from up here, isn't it?
Yeah.
Listen, if, uh, if you need any help,
need me to make some calls, answer some questions, I...
Do you believe...
people can die instantly?
Sorry?
I don't know. I'm a nurse.
I don't know if I believe it happens instantly.
A second can seem like a lifetime.
Like when you hit the brakes to avoid hitting another car
it seems like it takes forever to stop.
But maybe, if you go nose-first into the water
at 200 miles an hour, it is instantaneous.
At least, I hope it is.
Why do you think he went nose-first?
I don't know.
I better get back to work.
So you say you're sick,
you're broke, you're unemployed and uninsured.
Yeah, sure, come on over.
Mr. Wilner is regular again, and I'm out of here.
What you getting into?
Uh, I think I'm going to stay, do some studying.
Missed a diagnosis today.
Happens to the best of us.
Hey, you get one of these?
Greetings from Baltimore?
Frank, Exam One's cleared.
Tell it to the next clerk. I'm history.
( phone rings ) Damn it. County.
Sounds like Leon's having a nice time, huh?
Oh, hi, Dr. Carter.
Guess he's adjusting okay.
Yeah, she's right here. Just a minute.
Yeah. Abby, Carter's on the line for you.
Uh, I'll take it in there.
Well, have a good night.
Yup, you, too.
Plan on it.
Hey, how you doing?
Stanley.
Thought you'd be out painting the town by now.
Huh, all my friends are too tired to go out.
You're kidding me, right?
They all have pernicious anemia.
Everything in my life was built around it.
Support groups, therapy,
committees...
So, what do I do now?
Well, you could try enjoying yourself.
How?
So your flight was all right, then?
Um... Eric's plane disappeared.
Went off radar or something.
They don't know.
Um, have you been in the water yet?
No, Carter, you don't have to do that. You...
Carter, he could show up in an hour.
I just want to wait and see what happens, okay?
Okay?
All right, I have to go.
I'll call you later.
( bangs phone )
( sniffles )
( sighs )
MARQUEZ: Night, Abby.
Good night.
Hope everything's okay.
Thanks.
Okay, I'm taking six more.
You might want to cut down on the caffeine.
Or give some to Connie.
Her shift started ten minutes ago.
You need something done?
A nipride drip in One.
I'll do it.
You rock.
Am I crazy, or have you been here since yesterday?
Well, there's no place like home.
Help! I think my mother's having a heart attack.
How's this?
It smells better anyway.
I don't know how you people stand all this crap!
Me, either.
You want some privacy?
I want to get the hell out of here.
All right, I'll see what I can do.
They still haven't found you a bed upstairs?
My dad went to find out about it.
Did anybody else die?
In the accident?
A couple of girls were seriously injured,
but they're in recovery now-- they should be okay.
So just Terri died?
Yeah.
Not Sasha?
No.
I don't know how that happened.
It was raining pretty hard.
Sasha was meaner.
Sorry?
They weren't very nice to me.
They were never very nice to me.
MAN: Come on, now...
( child screaming ): No! No!
Mommy, I'm sorry. Mommy!
No! No!
It's going to be all right.
Mommy, why are you letting them do this?
Come on, kids.
Just till I get better.
Everything will be all right. Mommy!
MAN: It's okay!
( screaming ) Everything's going to be all right.
Mommy, no!
I love you.
It's okay.
No! No!
Mommy!
She left them alone at night.
Yeah.
What happened?
She coded.
Shocked her twice, intubated her,
and she converted.
Guess this rules you out
as the second signature for her DNR.
It's what she wanted.
Right.
Kerry, I need to talk to you
about Helen Broznich.
Keep her systolic above 90,
and let's get her up to the MICU.
It may not be the disease.
What may not be?
What are you talking about?
Helen hated those girls, and from what I can tell,
they weren't too crazy about her either.
Well, teenagers torture each other in high school.
Believe me, I remember.
Yeah, but they get upset when they run over classmates.
Her flat affect could definitely be part of the Wilson's.
Kerry, just because she has a metabolic disorder
doesn't mean she didn't know what she was doing.
Are you implying that she hurt those girls on purpose?
She seems disappointed that more of them didn't die.
That's what I'm implying.
Dr. Weaver, the appy in Four is asking for you.
Excuse me.
And your blind date called
and said he'd just pick you up here.
Fine.
I have a brother that's single.
Clotted PICC line.
Maybe I missed my turn.
I got up and walked around for a while.
Uh, here's a tip:
never give up your place on the waiting list
in a county hospital.
Ah, that's no big deal.
Yeah, it's a huge deal. Come on.
No, really, it gave me a chance to, uh, people watch.
Well, that's putting a positive spin on it.
So, why do you have a PICC line?
Uh, stage three-C testicular cancer.
These two should be reviewed in surgical committee.
You got it.
I remember you.
Rocket.
How'd I do?
Very, very well.
'Cause you promised you'd take care of me, right?
Get some rest.
Send them to the Q.A. office?
Yes.
Mr. Dresden can transfer to 4 west,
and I am going home to soak my feet.
Donald, have a minute?
Dr. Romano, what can I do for you?
Well, I read your memo,
and I think your concerns are valid.
So, I'm willing to limit
my surgical supervision to fifth-year residents.
Keep going to physical therapy.
Wait, wait, look, hear me out.
They already have all the skills they need,
and I would just be there to comment and observe
as a... as a formality.
You have physical liabilities.
It'd be one or two cases a week,
during which I wouldn't have to lift a finger.
We simply cannot expose patients or the hospital
to unnecessary risks.
Look, look, look, look.
Just...
keep me on the schedule, even if it's in name only.
Dr. Romano...
Damn it, please don't make me beg.
Until your recovery has progressed further,
let's use your expertise to help our students.
They ready for us?
Almost.
I'd like to get a psychiatric consult
before admitting Helen to the medicine floor
for treatment.
Why?
Mr. Broznich, although the disease impacts the brain,
it-it doesn't necessarily explain all behavior.
What do you mean?
Your daughter has the ability to make decisions.
She goes to school,
she drives a car...
I don't understand.
I think you need to speak with the police again.
I'm a spastic.
You said that.
No, Helen, I didn't say that.
That's why I hit the gas and not the brakes.
I'll send the detective in here.
Wait.
It-it's not the disease?
That will have to be decided.
It was her?
I don't know.
She-she could have done this?
I don't know.
Okay, I'm going to inject
something called streptokinase into your port,
which should dissolve the clot and make your line functional.
Which is a good thing
because your white blood counts are almost nonexistent.
I had chemo ten days ago.
Your neutrophils are below 500,
making you susceptible
to life-threatening infection.
The ER's the last place you should be.
Really?
I kind of like it here.
Okay, now I know you're sick.
When you're done with this,
you need to go home, sit tight,
take your temperature
every four hours.
Anything above 100.4, and you get your butt back here.
Wouldn't it just be easier to stay?
Nope.
Hey.
You out of here?
Yeah.
Any word? Nothing.
Is Carter coming back?
No, I told him not to.
You don't have to be alone tonight
if you don't want to be.
I don't think so.
Call me if you need me.
I'll be fine.
Is that him?
Uh... yeah.
Have fun.
Hi.
( chuckles )
I'm Susan Lewis.
Rick Kelly.
So, you ready to go?
Uh, actually, I have to stick around with a patient.
Um, uh, a kid with testicular cancer.
I should have called you.
I drove in from Lincoln Park.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Okay, then, uh, should we reschedule?
Uh, probably not.
Really?
Well, you know, when you meet someone,
and you can tell if there's a connection or not?
Um, actually, I don't want to give up steak.
I'm sorry.
What happened to your date?
Oh, wasn't meant to be, I guess.
Let's get you a shot of neupogen.
( soft moaning )
Did you get new furniture?
Feels different in here.
( Pratt chuckling )
It's less crowded.
Ah, maybe that's it.
You miss him?
Sometimes.
I never lived with anyone, outside from my parents.
No?
No, they weren't around much.
I guess that's why sometimes I love my alone time.
( laughs )
Nah, not me.
I grew up around a whole bunch of cousins
and kids in the projects.
Hmm.
I like it loud.
The more the merrier.
You like kids?
Why do you ask?
I don't know.
You ever think about having them?
( laughs )
Okay, okay, you're not the maternal type.
No, no, I-I love kids.
Well, good. Me, too.
I, uh... I had one.
You have a kid?
I gave him up for adoption.
Why?
I don't know, it's complicated.
He's being raised by good people.
Aren't you good people?
I guess, um, I wasn't ready.
Well, I'm going to go take a shower.
All right?
Mom, are you there?
Look, I'm sorry I didn't call you back earlier,
uh, but I need to talk to you now.
Mom, if you're there, could you please pick up?
Okay, well, uh, maybe you're sleeping. Call me back, I should be home.
