Previously on ER:
Well, then, where's my brother?
They found his plane.
Intact. Intact.
Tied down in a field outside Sault Sainte Marie.
He's my son.
How can I wait?
Welcome to the outside of the disease.
I don't want Sean to suffer anymore.
I don't want to die.
Then you should fight... with everything you have.
What do you want? What do I want?
You to stop being so afraid.
Us to stop being so careful.
I want to marry you!
What?
Oh, I wish the sun would rise already.
This graveyard shift's going forever.
( sighing )
You okay?
Mm-hmm.
I love you too, Carter, but it's over.
I'm going to ask her tonight.
You're going to propose?
Actually, I already did, but... badly.
She said no?
She didn't say anything,
but I'm going to do it right.
Oh, wow.
That is a nice rock.
It was my great-grandmother's.
Wow.
My great-grandfather gave it to her
the day he left for the army.
You know, I don't think she'll mind
that it's second-hand.
Hey. You guys want something
from Magoo's? My treat.
No, thanks.
No, I'm all right.
Hey, Luka. Hey.
Did you dispo Mr. Lindsey?
Yeah, they took him up to cards.
Oh, well, he'll be all right.
He's bounced back before.
Actually, he died.
Oh.
Way to start the day, huh?
Yeah.
Can I buy you some breakfast?
What's that you're reading?
The workplace sensitivity manual.
Weaver wants me to learn it.
What, uh, what's "schmuck"?
( chuckling ): Schmuck?
It's one of the inappropriate words-- schmuck, "pootz..."
No, I think you mean "putz."
Putz... ( giggling )
Peckerwood-- is that a tree?
( laughing )
Hello? Anybody here?
Hello?
Oh, my God.
Gray matter.
No pulse.
We should get the police.
Oh, God.
GSW to the head.
Exit wound through the spine.
They're gone.
( low moan )
Trina? Oh, my God.
( low, trembling moan continues )
She's breathing.
Go get help.
Do you remember the Rileys?
You guys stayed with them
when you were about ten or so.
Uh... yeah.
They had a cabin up by Mount Lutsen.
Yeah. Eric used to call Sonia, um, "Gammy."
Grammy. Grammy.
Whatever. Mm-hmm.
Maybe he went there.
Maybe.
They were really good with you when...
things were bad.
They, they took you fishing, remember?
Yeah, in, uh, Grand Rapids.
In Grand Rapids.
I cut my finger, yeah, with a hook.
Oh, Eric caught this great big old smelly fish.
( chuckling ): He acted like he found gold, for God's sakes.
He'll be okay, Mom.
I know.
I should pack.
( phone ringing )
Is that John?
No.
It's work, but guess what?
He asked me to marry him.
Really?
Well, he didn't really mean it.
I mean, it was...
We were on the roof,
and it was freezing,
and there was a helicopter flying around,
and he was kind of... shouting it at me.
It's every girl's dream, right?
What did you say?
Nothing... really,
because, you know, he didn't mean it.
It just, it was just...
something that happened, I don't know.
Hey, it's Abby.
Uh, what?
Oh, my God.
Was anybody there?
No, from the ER.
Okay.
I'll be right in.
What's the matter?
Um, I have to go,
but come by the hospital later,
and I'll give you a ride to the bus station.
Okay.
Or you could stay a few more days.
No, I, I have to get back to work.
Be here waiting in case he shows up.
What if he shows up in Minnesota?
You're right.
Looks like we got multiple shooters on the loose.
She's dropping her sats.
Herrero, keep those people away from the building.
TRINA: Please...
Let me talk to her now in case she can't later.
WEAVER: Setting up for multiple traumas.
How many should we expect?
Only one.
Three were pronounced on the scene.
Luka, let me take this.
It's okay. I got it.
Officer, make sure these cars don't block that entrance.
Breathe for us, Trina.
Tracheal shift; hold up.
Her lung is down.
OLBES: Sats only 88.
Can you describe who did this?
Decreased on the right.
We're going to have to needle her.
You want me to do it?
No. 18-gauge.
How many of them were there?
You're going to get your ID
as soon as she's stable,
I promise.
She's not moving air. No pulse.
Try the other side.
No, no, pull the dressing off.
The dressing on the chest wound-- pull it off.
( inhaling )
KOVAC: Okay, pulse is stronger.
Good chest excursions.
All right, let's get her inside.
Luka?
I just need a minute.
Dr. Lewis.
The patron saint of lost causes.
GSW to head and chest.
Tension pneumo.
One's clear.
Hey, are you all right?
Yeah. I'm a little nauseous.
It takes me a couple days to get back up to terminal.
What's going on?
Oh, there was a shooting across the street.
Anybody you know?
No, but still.
Kind of scary when it happens so close.
Yeah.
So, I heard you're getting released today.
Well, my next round of chemotherapy
is in about two days,
so, thought I'd come by, say so long.
How's your mom doing?
You mean is she still pissed at you?
No, I didn't mean exactly that, but...
She's still pissed at you.
Good to know.
She's, uh, upstairs with the doc.
Does she know you're here?
Uh, I kind of snuck off.
I actually might need one of those
basins.
I think you need some IV compazine.
That sounds good.
All right, I'll go tell your mom you're here.
Will you watch him for a minute?
I'm not a child.
( yelling )
Yeah! I'm here!
Over here!
( yelling continues )
( grunting yell )
What you trying to do?
What you doing, man?
( yelling )
Back up, back up!
I'll punch you in the mouth!
It's all right! We got this!
I'm fine. Come on.
David, David,
let's go.
It's game point anyway.
Let's get these clowns out of here.
Play ball!
Let's do it.
( yelling )
( grunting )
It's a man's game.
What, you want to go?!
Forget about it!
We won. Let's get some breakfast.
Come on.
Next week.
Huh, that's what I thought.
Hey. Hi.
I, uh, thought you were on later.
Yeah, I heard what happened.
I thought we might need the help.
Actually, we only got the one.
Three went straight to the morgue.
Sorry I didn't get to come by last night.
That's okay. Maggie and I played Scrabble.
I got a 75-point word.
Really? "Cyanotic." She challenged it.
Of course.
REPORTER: ...found brutally murdered early this morning
inside of this establishment, Doc Magoo's,
a diner frequented by staff and visitors
of County General Hospital.
The crime was committed just prior to opening
as the staff was preparing for a day of serving
the usual sandwiches and sodas.
What got served instead was a cold-blooded robbery/homicide
in which four people were murdered, execution-style.
One of them's still alive.
...trying to identify any suspects...
Any word on Eric?
I didn't expect any.
It's like a bear hibernating.
He won't come out till spring.
Hey, what do you say we go out tonight?
Sushi. Just you and me.
Maggie can fend for herself.
I got to drive her to the bus station.
She's leaving? Yeah.
Is that a good thing?
I don't know.
It was kind of nice having a roommate.
Sushi? I hope you have a better plan than that.
It's all about misdirection.
I don't want to show my hand to her.
Mm, well, the two of you have had enough misdirection.
Trust me. Show your hand.
KOVAC: Move your toes, Trina.
( groaning ) Good.
O-Neg's here.
Put it right on the infuser.
( groans )
Trina, do you remember anything?
They started shooting.
They just started shooting.
Threading the catheter, wire back... ( moaning )
What did she say?
Hook me up. Ten blade.
Trina, how many of them were there?
Two... in an SUV.
I saw them drive up.
Another 50 of fent.
Knife bent. Curved Kelly.
I think I might have seen them getting away.
Anything more specific?
It was a 4x4, gold or tan, maybe. ( sobbing )
It looked pretty new.
Anything about the men?
Height, weight, what they were wearing?
It was far away.
Into the pleural space. Tube?
Chen?
Uh, opsite and polysporin. ( moaning )
Okay, tube's in. Let's hook up the thoraseal.
Any detail would help us.
SATs are back up, 91.
Were they Latinos, black guys?
( sighs ) I don't know. It happened so fast.
Let's page Corday.
Okay. Trina, you did really good.
Rest up now, okay?
For us to get to work here,
we need a real description.
Um... I saw one of them...
I think he was black.
MAN: Driver, get out nice and calm
and face the vehicle.
( sighs ): Welcome to the hood.
The vehicle... this is the vehicle.
Put your hands up on the roof.
Hey, man, take it easy.
License and registration's in the glove.
Hey, hey, what are we being stopped for?
Hey, easy! Put your hands up there.
Where'd you get the money for a ride like this?
We're both doctors at County.
Where you guys headed in such a hurry, huh?
Hey, look, man, y'all can't just....
Hey, Gallant, just be quiet.
I see you guys brought a lot of pals.
What's the deal?
Four people shot this morning in the diner...
Diner? What diner?
We were just at the Sedgewick Y in a pickup game. Call the gym.
Why don't you just search the car
and let us get the hell out of here?
( pager beeping )
See, that's my boss right now.
Somebody's very sick.
GALLANT: Look, we're late for our shift.
MAN: Dealers got shifts now, huh?
We are doctors, damn it!
Mitch! Relax, punk.
No, wait a minute. I can explain about that. On the ground, both of you.
I can explain! Okay, okay... You get on the ground right now
or I'll put a bullet in your damn head.
Cuff 'em.
( groaning )
( panting )
Belong to the Y?
Play ball there twice a week.
Who do you play with?
Look, I don't remember their names.
Some of then live up the street from Greg.
You show proof to the arresting officers?
Yeah, they took my ID.
I told the arresting officer
my ID was in the glove.
Ever hear of a place called Magoo's?
I work right across the street.
Yes, we work right across the street from it.
Did you ever own a firearm?
I already told you, no.
No, I've never owned a firearm.
Look, why are you hassling me?
Just call County.
Where did you say you were?
I told you where I was.
What kind of a doctor are you?
I'm a med... I'm a med student.
I'm a med student. What difference does that make?
What kind of doctor are you?
I told you what I am.
Look, we brought you in because you match the ID.
( sighs ): 'Cause I match the ID.
What? Young, black, and handsome?
That's... no, that's ridiculous.
I'll send them over immediately.
Jerry, do we have photo IDs down here?
Uh, yeah, bottom shelf.
Messenger up personnel face sheets for Pratt and Gallant
to area seven headquarters, Division and Grand.
Really? Why?
Just do it.
Susan, um, Sean Simmons
is being discharged to home hospice care.
Yeah, I know. The cancer's back.
And while he's here waiting in the medi-van,
the mother has asked that you keep your distance.
What?
She doesn't want you interacting with her son.
What does Sean say?
She's a grieving mother.
I think we need to respect her wishes.
Look, we should get their names or something.
Gallant....
Well, how else we going to be able
to file a complaint against them?
Why don't you just be quiet?
Story checked out at the Y.
County confirmed that you're employed there.
It's not like we didn't tell you guys that four hours ago.
You can pick up your stuff at the front desk.
Have a nice day.
Is her crit stable?
Holding at 29 with two units in.
Luka, if you want to take it easy for a while,
we can keep you out of the trauma rooms, assign you
to non-critical care cases.
If you need me anywhere, Kerry, you need me in here.
We all have times
where we could use a little less stress.
I'm fine.
There's nothing wrong with admitting that you need some help.
I don't.
Even so, I've scheduled a meeting
with Dr. Meyers up on 7.
It's a formality,
unless you want to make it something more,
but it's mandatory.
Senor Chavez, se olvido del ointment de su nieto.
You shouldn't have let 'em search the car.
No, that's what you do when you're innocent and in a rush.
I don't usually ride around with a bloody shirt in my car.
Hey, you guys hear what happened?
I thought none of our people got hurt.
Yeah, but Jing Mei was first on the scene.
She okay? A little freaked.
I don't get it, man.
I don't get how you can just roll over.
Yeah, but that's the way it works sometimes.
Yeah, if you let it.
So, what are you going to do, file a lawsuit?
That's one way to fight it.
There is no fighting it.
Gallant... You know, I don't buy that.
Carter wants the output on bed four
before he leaves, okay?
Thanks.
Listen, we could be perfect, you know, like Gandhi.
But as soon as the crap goes down,
we'll be the first ones laid out on the street
with a gun to our head.
Now, where way I grew up, you see it every day.
And if it happens to you enough,
you get the message:
"You are not equal.
"You are not a full citizen.
"You are first, last, and above all,
one thing, and one thing only: a suspect."
You sure you want to wait out here?
Yeah, there's too many sick people in there.
Thanks. You're welcome.
Hey, cold enough for you?
My mom went ahead to help set up stuff
for the home hospice team,
then she'll be coming to pick me up pretty soon.
I think you're doing the right thing, Sean.
I think it doesn't matter what you think.
( sighs )
I'm sorry.
I don't know why I'm so pissed at you.
I guess it all just feels
so much more real now.
I keep daydreaming about the stuff
that I wanted to do--
get really drunk at a college party...
go windsurfing...
get married and have kids, stupid stuff like that.
That's not stupid.
Even after I got really sick,
I kept talking myself
into believing that I had more time...
at least, enough to do some of those things.
Sean Simmons?
Uh, you know what. Hold on a second.
Sean, I can't get you into college,
and windsurfing's nuts.
You know what? Come on. Let's get out of here.
For real? We're just gonna...?
Yeah, come on. I mean, not unless
you have someplace else to go.
Look, I'm supposed to get him home.
Yeah, could you call his mom for us?
Tell her we went on a date.
( chuckling ): I'll have him back by curfew.
Maybe. Say maybe.
Hey. Abby, listen, I got a hold of Sonia Riley,
and I told her to call you here
if she hears from Eric.
Okay, I'll keep my eye open for messages....
Abby, can you get this banana bag to the guy over there?
My leg splint girl's screaming in Four.
Sure. I was thinking the Soupbox for lunch?
Oh, you're busy. We can just go to that place across the street.
That's not really a good idea.
Abby? Triage needs extra bodies.
They got 20 kids from Kelton Elementary school
with vomiting and diarrhea.
20? I'll be there in five minutes.
Abby, Abby, it's okay.
I can get to the bus station by myself.
No, I'll take you. I'll take you.
Mr. Levine, what's your problem?
Huh? I just got drunk at a Valentine's Day party.
Five days ago?
( laughs ): Yeah, it was a blowout.
Now, why did you take that out? It was easy.
...an altered mental status...
Abby, send off admit labs, two sets of blood cultures,
and grab an LP tray.
Uh, meningitis? Let's find out!
I'm sorry. It's okay.
I'll call you when I get home.
Okay.
Okay.
Bye.
Bye.
Nurses shortage, you know?
Oh...
( sobbing )
Working in the ER can be a very inconvenient job sometimes.
I'm sorry, John.
I just wanted Eric to come home so bad
so that I could be with my family just...
for a second.
Abby and I were getting along so well.
You should stay longer.
I know she would love it.
I'm sorry.
Thank you, John.
I can catch a cab out here, right?
Well, you know, I'm off in a couple minutes.
I'll drive you to the station.
Really? Yeah.
Dr. Kovac. Dr. Meyers.
Please.
So...
what brings you here?
Dr. Weaver.
She told me to come.
Well, why do you suppose she wanted us to meet?
You tell me.
Well, that's not quite how it works.
Hey, you're a doctor.
Someone comes to me with a problem
I tell them how to fix it, so...
Let's start with you telling me...
My problem?
What's on your mind?
My family died during the war in Croatia,
so I came to America.
I had a relationship with someone I cared about,
which I then ruined,
so I started to look for answers
in the wrong places, you know, like sex, drinking, living fast.
Killed a patient I should have saved
and then I almost killed a medical student
in a car crash.
So, woke up one morning
and everything I thought I had was gone.
Gone or broken.
So what do you have for that?
Well, Dr. Kovac, it's not something that I can really...
Yeah, that's what I thought.
I should get back to work.
Tell Weaver I showed up.
...complicating the commute this evening,
a high-speed chase is currently underway
snarling a two-mile stretch of the I-40.
Police are in pursuit of a tan SUV
suspected of being connected to the grisly murders
of three people early this morning
in a coffee shop off South Foundry.
Do they even consider the collateral damage
of a pursuit like that?
They're hoping they kill the guys.
Avoid all the wasted time and money of due process.
Not to mention they might have the wrong suspects.
Last time I checked, the police were still on our side.
What exactly is our side?
Tell her what happened.
They laid us out on the sidewalk,
they took us in and they interrogated us.
That's terrible.
Yeah, the real problem is is you guys are both guilty.
Guilty of what?
DWB: driving while black.
Just forget it.
The police play the odds, just like us.
They look for horses, not zebras.
Tell me you don't think that's the same thing.
Look, it's about percentages.
Last time I flew to London, they pulled two Arab men
out of the boarding line for a security check.
I hate to admit it:
it made me feel more secure.
You think they'd pull over
two Arabs driving through Highland Park?
No, because terrorist acts
in Highland Park aren't high on the list of concerns.
Oh, but violent crimes by African-Americans certainly is?
Like I said, we should drop it.
So you really believe racial profiling
is a legitimate law enforcement tool?
A lot of people do.
Hey.
Hey.
I don't know whose day's been worse-- yours or mine.
You okay?
Yeah. You?
Oh, I never thought I'd see something like that.
It's a lot different when they roll in on a gurney.
Hey, but you stepped up. That's all that counts.
I did my job.
At least we saved one of them.
So I heard she gave an ID.
Partial one. I filled in some details.
What? You saw the guys?
Mm, a glimpse as they drove off.
They were black, huh?
I think so.
You think so?
Well, it was quick, you know?
And I only saw one of them.
So that's why the cops
are picking up brothers all over town.
I told them what I saw.
What you saw or what you thought you saw?
I was trying to help, Gregg.
Can't you see you fed right into
what they always want to jump to?
Look, I'm really sorry for what happened to you,
but that's on the cops, not me.
It's all part of the same thing.
What are you talking about?
I don't know.
So, what? Now I'm a racist?
It's just hard not to feel that everybody is
when you're lying face down in the street
with a cop's foot to the back of your neck.
I've never seen it like this.
It's okay. There'll be a later bus.
( punk rock plays loudly )
( exclaiming )
( chuckling )
That's not your music. That's Abby's.
She always liked that noise.
I'm getting used to it.
( tapping on window )
There's an accident up ahead.
Sit tight. We'll keep you posted.
Uh-huh.
Thank you.
Thank you for this, John.
I know it's a huge inconvenience.
It's no problem.
I'm sorry for getting so upset.
I hate being so pathetic.
Just the idea of going home alone, waiting.
Eric'll turn up.
Yeah.
Yeah, but I worry.
About both of them.
Abby's good.
You know, we're both good.
You don't have to worry about that.
She told me...
She told me you might get married.
Is that what she said?
( chuckling )
No, she told me you proposed.
Oh, I know she's work.
It runs in the family, but she's so worth it.
Yeah.
Yeah, I spend 23 hours a day
wondering whether we're wrong for each other,
wondering whether
we've got the energy that we need
to get through everything that we seem to get into,
whether the baggage we both bring would sink a small ship,
but, um, in the 24th hour,
I realize I've been thinking about her for 23 hours
and... I come back to there's something about her
that I can't stay away from.
Something about her that makes me want to...
( chuckling ): love her.
Julia, my sister, read this story
about a little Japanese girl who had cancer
and she tried to make a thousand paper cranes
'cause she thought if she did
it would make her wish come true.
What was her wish?
To get better.
So how many paper cuts do you have?
A lot.
But my wish is kind of different.
What is it?
It's hard to explain.
Kiss pretty good for a dead kid, huh?
Not bad at all.
I think I should get home.
WOMAN: Cop wounded
in a multi-car collision.
BP: 124/68; pulse: 96. Good stats.
Jing-Mei, take him in.
I'll wait on the next.
Did you find the guy?
There was a pile-up. The guys opened fire.
We have a bunch of cops hurt.
Mitch Palnick, 41-year-old officer,
high-speed MVA, with passenger space intrusion.
Can't breathe.
Hey, nice to see you again.
WEAVER: You know him?
He wears Florsheims, rubber-soled.
Isn't that right?
Great.
PRATT: He's got a couple of fractured ribs...
We need a hand here, Gallant.
Ah! Set up for chest tube.
Pratt.
Trauma panel, type and cross four units.
Could have bagged the spleen.
Look, I'll, uh, I'll get the other one.
We need you here.
Just go. We'll be right there.
Now, Gallant!
It's cool.
It's not cool. Hurry the hell up!
Come on, man. Let's go.
Look, you've got two doctors. That's enough.
We've got a critical patient
who needs rapid assessment and prompt treatment.
What's the matter with you?
Forget what happened earlier and do your job.
I can't help that guy.
This is what we do, all right?
Now get your ass in there.
Come on. Come on.
John, it's beautiful.
Absolutely beautiful.
Oh.
Marriage can be a great thing.
Can be?
Yeah.
What the hell do I know?
Mine failed.
For many reasons.
You sure as hell don't want my advice.
But I would think that kind of commitment to somebody--
you have to be... ready for anything.
Or nothing.
You never know what's going to happen.
Or you do.
You mean the drinking?
I drank, I smoked when I was younger.
( sighs )
It took having a baby to make me stop.
Smoking, at least.
I always went back to the drinking.
Maybe Abby will be stronger.
Have you two talked about this?
About having kids?
Yeah.
I know that she worries
about passing on the disease.
Well, she and Richard never communicated,
ever, I don't think.
Really?
I think they loved each other at first,
but he had all these expectations
that she never realized.
He didn't understand her.
Well, I'm not walking into this blind.
No, no, no.
I don't think you are.
I just don't want...
Yes?
I...
I just don't want you to want to fix her.
Abby doesn't need to be fixed.
Or heal her or change her.
I love her.
I just don't want you to be waiting for her to change.
I'm not.
She's an amazing person.
I know who she is.
She's an amazing person with certain weaknesses,
and you'd be lucky to have her, even with those weaknesses.
But you have to love her,
even if she never changes anything.
( alarm beeping ) Pressure's only 85.
Put two units on the rapid infuser.
I don't want them.
WEAVER: Yeah, you don't get
to choose your doctors, Officer.
Just like we don't get to choose our patients.
No evidence of intra-abdominal bleeding.
12 lead.
Prepping the chest.
ST depression.
Could be ischemia from hypotension.
What about tamponade?
No. That gives you low voltage QRS.
We'll need to put a tube in your chest
to expand the lung.
Looks like a damn garden hose.
There'll be some burning with the local.
We were just doing our job, okay?
So, let us do ours.
WEAVER: Gallant, there's no
pericardial effusion.
Start the secondary survey.
MARQUEZ: Hemacue's 14.8.
Hold the transfusion.
No, no, no, no.
Prime the infuser.
Dr. Weaver, I don't think he needs a chest tube.
It takes time for your crit to drop.
Look, LV wall motion abnormality.
He's got a cardiac contusion.
That's not as bad, right?
GALLANT: Start dopamine at ten mics per kilo.
WEAVER: Go ahead.
X-ray's back.
I'll mix up some lido in case of ectopy.
I don't see a collapsed lung.
Send off cardiac enzymes q six hours.
Yosh?
Good call.
So, uh...
this must be a really scary part for you, huh?
What?
Well, all the white folks left.
Now, it's just you
and a couple of niggers with knives.
Sorry I'm late.
Traffic.
Why did you make me wait outside?
Surprise.
It's February in Chicago.
I know.
It makes you feel alive, doesn't it?
Oh.
The visiting nurse waited an hour,
and then she had to go.
It's my fault, Mrs. Simmons.
No, it's not. I wanted a hot dog.
Oh, Sean, you should see your room.
They brought one of those beds with the remotes.
No way.
I didn't mean to worry you.
I just wanted to make it easier for Sean.
Easier?
He wasn't ready to come home yet.
GIRL: Mom,
Sean wants to talk to you.
Well, he's home now.
Good night.
Um, Sean wants to know if she could
wait a minute, just...
So, you're Julia?
Yeah. You're Susan?
Yeah. I work at the hospital.
I know. Sean said
that you were the only doctor he ever met
who was like a friend.
And, um, that you were hot.
BP's up to 112/78 on dopamine.
He needs some more morphine.
Yeah. Push another four migs.
How you doing, Mitch?
Your partner has a mild elevation
of his cardiac enzymes,
indicating a bruised heart.
It's the equivalent of a small heart attack.
Do you smoke?
Yeah.
I heard it's bad for you.
Yeah, thanks for the advice.
You should be thanking this brother.
We profiled you as a collapsed lung,
but he kept an open mind.
Saved you from surgery that you don't need.
Yeah. You know what?
That's not going to cut it.
I think an apology is in order.
You think I'm going to apologize to you?
No. To him.
Hey, Pratt, forget about it.
I didn't do anything wrong.
There's nothing on your record.
You don't look like you're hurt.
You're here now.
Lucky for you.
And what exactly is your damage?
You know, there were three people
butchered right outside your own hospital.
We were doing what we were supposed to.
You need cops like me to catch animals like that.
"Sorry" would have been a whole lot easier.
Are you going to tell me what this is all about?
We both just deserve a break,
especially after a day like today.
Mm-hmm.
Feels more like a month.
But what's it really all about?
So, you think this is a keeper?
The restaurant?
Us?
You and me.
Are you okay?
I've, uh...
spent a long time looking for a relationship
that I thought... would stick.
Sometimes it was the wrong person.
Sometimes, I guess I wasn't ready.
Or in the, uh, right place, but...
I think I am now.
I really think I am now.
Are you?
John...
Because I really want this to stick.
Me, too.
I know that, uh, we've had a rough time,
and that there's still a lot of stuff
that we have to get through,
but I think we're doing okay.
You know, I think that we're...
( chuckles )
growing. We're...
changing.
Do you?
I don't know if people ever really change.
But I-I know what you mean.
You do?
I think I do.
Hmm, hmm.
Well, let's see what's for dessert.
That's it?
You bought out this whole place just for that?
That...
and the chocolate soufflé.
Hi.
Check this out.
( motor whirring )
Who knew it would be so much fun, huh?
Oh, here.
It's for you.
Open it later.
Sometimes,
if I think about what comes next, it helps.
Maybe afterwards I'll know.
I'll know what it's all about.
What it all means.
If it means anything.
You'll know before any of us.
That sucks.
Yeah.
It does.
I want you to know what you did for me, Susan.
It was mutual.
I want you to know...
I know, Sean.
I know.
How's Officer Palnick doing?
No cardiac ectopy on a lido drip.
Pulse ox 99 on two liters.
That was good what you did in there.
But never make me ask you twice again, okay?
Yes, ma'am.
A couple of cops got real hurt this morning
trying to bring in those guys that killed those people.
And that's why Mitch is here because
he won't let scum like that get away.
Still, maybe we overstepped this morning.
I think we did.
But, uh,
thanks for fixing up my partner.
They'll be moving him soon.
What was that about?
Almost sounded like an apology.
One love, Gallant.
Yup.
Later.
Better day tomorrow than we had today.
Luka, how did it go upstairs?
Great.
I feel a lot better.
Hey.
Hey.
It's so quiet now.
I mean, you'd hardly know anything happened there.
Yeah. Except for the police tape.
Yeah.
You did good today.
Probably saved that woman's life.
Well, at least there's that.
Headed to the El?
Uh, no.
Um, I forgot something inside.
Good night.
Yeah, good night.
You know, ever since I was a kid,
I've always acted like it doesn't bother me.
But you know something?
It bothers me.
At least they caught the guys.
Mmm.
Mmm.
Oh, let's get out of here.
( laughs )
Do you want tea?
Carter?
( phone rings )
Hello?
MAGGIE: Hello, Abby.
Mom? Are you there already?
No. No, I'm not.
We're delayed here in Tomah.
The roads are snowed in.
Tomah, Wisconsin?
Abby, I...
I know I was in the way, and I'm sorry.
I... I never want to be a burden.
Mom, you were not a burden.
I just wished Eric would have come back.
I know.
And we could have all been together
just for one little minute.
I love you both so much.
Sometimes I don't know what to do with it.
I love you, too.
I'll call you in a few days.
Okay. Call me tomorrow.
Okay, I will.
Get home safe.
Bye.
CARTER: Who was that?
Uh...
Maggie.
She wanted to thank you for the ride.
What kind of tea do you want?
Whatever you're having.
