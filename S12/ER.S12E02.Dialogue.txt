Previously on ER:
Don't go away mad, Jake. But do go away.
I don't want to have any more kids. I'm done.
You're responsible for every thing an intern does,
but you question history and they get testy.
Sounds like you had a great day.
You told me to step it up. Yeah, but it's not moving meat.
You're a resident now.
Your name is Charlie Pratt?
Chas? Who is it?
Is there a problem?
Are you Charlie?
Yeah, I'm Charlie.
Aw!
Is Alex still here? Uh, no, he just left, why?
You're up early.
Yep.
Everything okay? Ah, just couldn't sleep.
Uh, I've been thinking about...
( phone ringing )
Hello.
This is Sam.
Yes, I did.
Uh-huh.
When?
Okay, sure.
If I come in 20 minutes, will someone be there?
Great.
Okay, thank you.
Sorry. What were you saying?
My father's been bugging me to visit him.
I haven't been home in a long time and,
I have some vacation coming up,
so I was thinking about making a trip back to Croatia.
It would only be for a couple of weeks.
Might be good for us if we spent some time apart.
Alex and you can hang out and you know...
I already started looking for a new place.
A new place? For me and Alex.
You're moving out?
You just said it'd be good to spend time apart.
That's not what I meant. I was gonna tell you.
I just think that it's...
I need to think things out by myself.
Where you going now?
I'm gonna look at an apartment before work.
So what, that's it? We don't talk about this?
Never seemed to do us any good before.
Did he really?
God. You've gotta tell me later. Okay, I've got to go. Bye.
LOCKHART: Hey, wait!
Wait, wait, hey. Can you hold the doors?
Hey, can you hold the doors?
Thank you.
Hey.
Hi.
Good morning.
Well, maybe for you.
I was up writing a paper
on paint ball injuries for Morris.
Are they talking about us?
Can we help you?
We were just wondering where you got your shoes.
They look very comfortable.
They match your backpack.
Just ignore them.
They're on a bulimia high.
I don't understand what he said, he was like, oh...
Oh, my God.
Are you okay? My foot.
Can you stand on it? No.
Oh, call 911.
Should we check her out? No.
( groans )
Don't... touch me.
Try not to move. I'm a doctor. You may have broken your ankle.
If you're a doctor, I want a second opinion.
Dr. Lockhart, would you care to give a second opinion?
Sure. Your ankle may be broken and you're a bitch.
MORRIS: All three are a liability.
Look at them. Huddled together like a bunch of prairie dogs.
This is the best we have?
They should've made me chief.
And why's that?
For one, I would've been
a little pickier in choosing our residents.
What are you saying? Abby, Ray, Neela.
No brain, no courage, no heart. They is to see the wizard.
And who's the wizard, you?
That's why they pay me the big bucks.
Officer on deck.
Me. I'm the chief. Yeah, Chief Pain in the Ass.
Ha, ha. Abby, if only you were as talented as you are funny.
At least I'm funny.
If making jokes at the expense of those
with Native American heritage is humorous to you.
Yeah, I happen to be 1/16th Choktaw Indian.
Hey, Jake sent us a postcard from San Francisco.
Right on. How's he doing, Abby?
Great.
I think he really likes it there.
Yeah, well, not according to this.
KOVAC: Guys, you know our new interns?
Clemens, Munson and Babinski.
Abby, Neela and Ray. They'll show you the ropes.
I'm Dr. Morris, but everybody calls me chief, because...
Anyone? No? Well, I'm the chief resident.
You present to the residents, they present to Pratt and me.
And they present to the attending. That's a lot of presenting.
Dr. Kovac, do you have a patient in the cath lab? Yeah, why?
I think he might have died.
If you'll come to the board, I'll show you how I like things around here.
Applies to you three as well. I'm implementing some changes.
I'd like to stick an implement in his eye.
Pick a number one through ten. Why?
Neela? Seven.
Four.
Oh, so close. It was six.
Neela gets to choose between Munson and Babinski.
Babinski. Wait a minute.
TAGGART: Who's up?
Clemens, you're with me. I am?
I trust you, girl. Just don't let me down.
Claire Jansen, 24, unrestrained driver,
rear-ended at moderate velocity.
Term pregnancy, good vitals.
Definitely having contractions.
Fetal heart rate looks good-- 160.
Okay, any pain when I push?
Not now.
Hemocue is 14.1. Pretty normal.
I don't think you're bleeding internally.
I should hope not. I think my water broke.
Premature rupture of membranes. Is that bad?
No, but there's a good chance you could have your baby today.
Oh, I wanted to have another home birth.
Your second pregnancy?
Yeah. Zoe's two.
This one's a boy.
Want me to call your husband?
No, there's no such creature.
But you could call Toni Stillman.
She's my friend. She needs to be here.
Ray?
24-year-old G2P1, 39 weeks "prommed" after a TC.
Normal vitals and crit.
Ultrasound and send her up to OB for a sterile spec exam.
Do you have a minute?
Uh, no, not really.
I've got to get labs off, do a cathed UA,
assist Ray with a pelvic, and find an ultrasound.
Can you do some of this?
Me?
No, she can't.
Uh, sorry, Inez, this is Dr. Kovac.
I'm helping her get the lay of the land.
When you're finished? Sure. Might be a while.
Welcome to County, Inez. Thank you.
Sit tight, Claire, you're doing great.
We'll have you upstairs before you get comfortable.
I feel, it's gonna be several hours before I'm comfortable.
Okay, Clemens, what's next? A bimanual exam?
Not before the ultrasound. Why not?
Third trimester, you've got to rule out previa before the exam.
Most important thing in the ER, is if you don't get it, fake it.
There's no time to ask questions,
and patients don't wanna see you scratching your head.
So, in the meantime, could you get me some Nitrazine paper?
Come on, go, go.
Excuse me? Dr. Barnett wanted me to get some Nitrazine paper,
but I don't know what it is. You didn't ask?
He said if I didn't know something... Listen.
The number one rule of the ER is
if you don't know something, ask. Okay?
You're never gonna learn this stuff by yourself.
And that's why we're here. What do I do with the...?
Dr. Rasgotra, could you tell me how to use the Nitrazine paper?
Not until I finish suturing a very fidgety six-year-old.
You're an intern now, Clemens.
If you don't know something... I know, fake it.
What? No, of course not.
Well, I already asked. Look things up yourself.
When someone gives you the answer, you forget five minutes later.
Read it, and it sticks.
Your primary responsibility is to educate yourself.
No one else is going to do it for you. Thank you.
How's it going?
Fine.
Great.
Do you have any questions? No.
Terrific.
Uh, anything to present? I'll let you know.
Okay. Can I make a suggestion?
Unless your patient has situs inversus,
her heart should be on the left.
Tests came back on the girl in four?
Looks like she's going to need Amphotericin B.
Your intern picked up histoplasmosis?
Yeah, he just doesn't know it yet. How's he doing?
I don't think he likes me.
Everybody likes you. Not this guy.
He's acting like I killed his dog or something.
He's probably just nervous.
I don't think I'm gonna be great
at this teaching- the-interns thing.
You will. You did a great job with Jake.
Too bad he didn't match here. Yeah.
Dr. Pratt, can you get on the MICN?
Paramedics need you to pronounce a GSW in the field.
Sure.
Abby, got one.
Munson, we're up!
Unidentified kid, looks about ten,
found down in the food court at City Center Mall. Munson!
Still hypotensive after 500 cc's.
Mental status waxing and waning en route.
Hi, I'm Dr. Lockhart. Can you tell me your name?
( mumbling ) Is he alone?
With his buddies, but they split when we got there.
Sats only 92. What's your plan?
CBC, chem seven, tox screen?
And?
...head CT? And?
Try to find next of kin.
ABG, LFTs, oxygen, normal saline,
activated charcoal. Let's go.
Don't worry, you'll get the hang of it. I know.
PRATT: Okay, 57, I concur,
we can pronounce. What's the status on number two?
GSW to the chest, 110 palp. We've got IV, O2 and a nine-minute ETA.
All right, sounds good. We'll be waiting for you. County, clear.
Dr. Pratt. Yeah?
Guy out there says he knows you.
Which guy?
Sitting next to the old lady.
He a friend of yours?
Not really.
So you want me to bring him in or no? No. He can wait.
This is Dr. Pratt.
I'll need one of these two trauma rooms
in a few minutes. How are we doing?
I don't know about you, but I'm having contractions.
Nitrazine is positive.
TAGGART: Which means your water did break.
Follow it caudad.
Is everything okay?
Looks like a breech presentation.
Dr. Barnett, can I get your advice on something?
This doesn't feel any different from my last pregnancy.
The baby's been active.
You're doing good, Claire. The baby's heart rate is right on target.
Uh, Dr. Pratt?
Could you come and take a look at this, please?
Dr. Pratt.
What is it?
Well, it looks like you've delivered the feet.
But that's okay, right?
I had a friend who delivered breech and her baby was okay.
Page OB and get them down here right now.
Don't worry. We'll take good care of you and your baby.
Dr. Kovac, this is Toni Stillman.
She's here to check on Claire's condition. The pregnant MVA.
Somebody called and said she's had an accident. Yeah, she was uninjured.
Thank God. What about the baby? You're a family friend?
Claire's our gestational surrogate.
She's living with my husband and me for six weeks.
She's having your child?
Yes, she's implanted with our embryo.
So is our baby going to be okay?
I'm afraid I can't tell you that. Not without Claire's consent.
She's carrying my baby.
I'm sorry. I need the patient's consent.
We're best friends. She'll want to see me.
Sam, this is Toni Stillman. She's a friend of Claire's.
Oh, I spoke with you on the phone. I'm Sam.
Come on in, she's been asking for you.
Sam, how's she doing?
Pretty good.
Uh... When I get a chance, okay?
I was so worried about you. I'm fine.
You shouldn't be driving. I can take you anywhere you need to go.
It was just a tiny fender bender.
Sam, you have activated charcoal here? Yeah, bottom shelf.
There's a guy in the waiting room looking for you.
I know. Thanks, Malik.
( Claire gasps ) Claire? Claire, are you okay? What's happening?
Another contraction? What? She, she, she's in labor?
Yep. But, but are you gonna stop it?
Because she's not due for another week.
39 weeks. Junior here is ready to make an appearance.
His feet are already popping out. His feet? He's breech?
Are you gonna do a C-section? We're waiting on OB.
GSW's two minutes out, Dr. Pratt.
Come find me when they get here. You, you're with me.
Go ahead, I got it.
Have you ever been in a GSW trauma before?
I grew up in the Bronx. Dr. Pratt, can we present?
Not now. Got a trauma rolling in.
Okay, uh, what's next?
Uh, Exam Three, possible talar fracture.
And I should warn you, she already took my head off
for how long she's had to wait.
Oh, God. Could this day get any worse?
This is Drew Filmore. We've, uh, met.
Greg.
You figured me out, huh?
Five minutes after you left, I knew it was you. I can't talk now.
Looks like you're busy. I am.
What do you want?
I don't know.
What were you looking for when you came to find me?
I guess I just had to see for myself.
And now I have.
So how do we do this?
We don't. I'm sorry I bothered you.
I didn't know you were in Chicago. Heard you were still in Detroit.
Yeah, well, I'm not in Detroit anymore.
I can imagine what you think about me.
There's a lot of things you probably need me to explain.
No. I don't need anything from you.
I never have. I made a mistake that night.
So forget I came by. Don't come back anymore.
Hold on. I can understand you're mad, I can accept some of that.
Some of it?
You have a half brother and sister.
And they're your family, too.
Now family's important to you, huh?
Single GSW left chest during a carjacking.
Jocelyn's at U of I and Chas is a senior at South Geary.
BP 100 systolic. Decreased breath sounds on the left.
He's probably gonna get a scholarship from Loyola
if he wins the regional at tonight's swim meet.
Entry wound left parasternal. No exit.
All right, intubation tray, 32 French. Let's notify the OR.
I'm sorry I walked away.
Don't make the same mistake I made.
CT's good. No blood, no mass effect.
Barbecue's ready.
What? Charcoal's in.
Resps down to 14.
Shallow but clear. Another .5 of Narcan.
I'm sorry. Can you, can you, uh, repeat that?
Is that 140 or 114?
Uh-uh-uh-uh.
If you do that, we'll have to restrain you, okay?
Malik, get him two of Ativan.
Wait a minute. Are you sure?
I thought benzos could cloud the neurological picture?
Yeah, fine.
Soft restraints then.
Narcan's in.
Come on, talk to us, doctor.
White count's 12.3,
hemoglobin's 14, hematocrit is 34...
I gotta GSW. I need you outta here now.
Kid's ready to go up to PICU.
He's not. He's getting worse.
Head CT's fine, labs are normal,
from the ER standpoint, workup's done.
He could've infectious encephalitis. We should tap him.
They can do it upstairs. Sounds good. Let's go.
Put him in sutures until I can get PICU to pick him.
Need a hand? Not yet. I'll let you know.
Did I do something wrong in there?
No.
Am I not handling this patient correctly?
Nope.
Are you okay?
Sam's moving out.
Oh.
Why?
I've got a feeling it's a communication problem.
Well, if you're not sure...
it probably is.
Sorry.
Uh, if you want to talk about it... No, no.
If I wanted to talk about it,
Sam probably wouldn't be moving out.
Thanks, Luka.
I always thought it was my fault
that things didn't work out between us, but...
now I know it was you. ( laughs )
Hey, no problem.
She's gonna need a C-section.
I don't want surgery. My friend Julia had a breech.
It was probably a Frank Breech, which is butt...
COBURN: You've got a footling breech.
Cervix doesn't dilate, the baby's head can get stuck
and the umbilical cord will be compressed with contraction, jeopardizing the oxygen supply.
You need to do what's best for the baby.
What happens if I don't have the surgery?
Well, we allow the baby to be delivered up to the umbilicus
to give the cervix time to dilate,
and then use maneuvers to deliver the head and shoulders.
Then let's do that.
Uh, that's not a good idea.
With a footling breech, there's a 25% chance of major complications.
It's less than 2% with a C-section.
But that's a 75% chance that the baby will be born without any problems.
Okay, we can wait while the labor proceeds,
but if the baby's heart rate gets low,
you may still need a C-section.
I don't want surgery.
Um, I'll send somebody down
as soon as we have a room ready.
Can you please find Toni for me?
RAY: You know what? I'll get her.
Dr. Coburn? Are you really not going to consent for surgery?
Can't do it against her will.
What if there's trouble midway, and needs a rescue section?
I still can't do it. Are you kidding me?
What about the intended parents?
This is Toni's baby, isn't it?
She's the genetic mother and the intended mother,
but it's still Claire's body,
and she has the right to refuse surgery.
MALIK: Abby! What?
PICU on line three.
Hey, Abby, what's the status
on that kid running from the mall?
I'm hoping it's PICU to say they're ready. Why?
His buddies are asking about him.
Okay, don't let them leave.
Yeah, this is Abby... Dr. Lockhart.
Okay, great. We'll send him right up. Thanks.
Is he okay?
No, he's not okay.
Did he take something?
You guys... you need to tell me if he took something, okay?
I've got to go. Hey, hey, hey, hey! Chuny!
Wait a minute. Not so fast. Hold on. Hold it. Hold on.
Come here, come here. Let me go!
No, settle down. Here, sit down.
Your friend is very sick.
What's his name?
Liam.
And what did he take? Nothing.
No drugs? No.
Then why did you run when the paramedics showed up?
We were skipping school.
Has Liam been sick?
He hasn't been in school much. Why not?
His parents are getting divorced and he has to go back and forth.
That's why we ditched, to hang out.
Does he have any, any medical disorders?
Like what? Anything.
Mm... his family are vegetarians.
Was he acting different today?
Not really.
He was kind of bummed, maybe.
He ate two jumbo cheeseburgers.
Didn't you say he's vegetarian? Abby, he's getting worse.
What's this? The kid's backpack. Find out what's in it.
What's going on? He seems pretty unresponsive.
Check his gag reflex.
Liam. Liam. Whoa, hold it. Liam.
You've got to wake up, big guy, okay?
He moved his hand a little bit.
Barely has a gag. All right, this way.
Okay. You know the VITAMIN mnemonic?
Vitamins? Yes, for altered mental status.
"V" is for vascular, strokes or clots.
We ruled that out with CT.
"I" is for...
Infection.
What, this game's only for interns?
Infection-- no pneumonia.
Normal white count, urine's clean.
We're waiting on the cultures. "T." "T"?
Trauma. Or toxins. Utox is negative,
but that doesn't mean he didn't take something we can't test for.
What am I looking for? I don't know. Drugs, meds. Wait.
What? It's "M."
Sorry. Sorry.
Um, "M." The "M" in VITAMIN stands for...
Metabolic. This kid
could have a metabolic disease
that keeps him on a restricted diet.
What diet?
His buddy told me that he was a vegetarian.
What buddy? And then, today he had two cheeseburgers.
I'm lost. We need to get this guy upstairs, Abby.
No, what we need is an ammonia level. Get some ice.
Ammonia has to go to the lab cold. Run.
That's my Frappuccino!
They can do this upstairs, Abby.
Yeah, after they do their assessment, review labs,
and repeat X rays.
Meanwhile, his brain is being pickled
by whatever metabolite is growing in there.
Okay. Get that to the lab. Go.
Hang in there, Liam.
Good signal. Fetal heart rate 158.
That's still good, right.
For the time being.
But if your baby gets in trouble,
and is deprived of oxygen, every second counts.
But that's not happening.
BARNETT: Not yet.
You trying to scare me?
No, I'm just trying to prepare you for what might happen.
Listen, thousands of C-sections are performed
in this country every day. It's a simple procedure.
I want to have more kids of my own one day-- naturally.
And lots of women go on to have vaginal births after having Cesareans.
Excellent variability of the FHR.
Could I consent, but only as a last resort?
Only if the baby's in serious danger?
Absolutely. Sam has a consent form right here.
Okay, but only as a last resort.
You need to be made aware of the risks.
What sort of risks?
Sam.
Bleeding, infection, paralysis, stroke...
Sam!
These are minimal risks.
Can I speak with you outside, please?
I don't want this.
No, just, just think about it, okay?
Okay?
What the hell is going on in there?
She needs to be aware of the risks. It's called informed consent.
You made it sound like brain transplant. And you like a pedicure.
It is not your job to explain the procedures!
No, that's your job, and you're not doing it.
Look out! What's going on?
You tell me.
PRATT: How are we on the packed cells?
INEZ: Units 5 and 6 infusing.
BARNETT: What about Kovac?
I've got this.
What can I do? Nothing.
Internal paddles again. Charge to 30.
You're shocking asystole? It's fine V-fib.
Clear.
How long she's been down? Resuming compressions.
Greg... Hang another unit. Charge the paddles again.
Shouldn't we save blood for someone who's got a chance?
Proximal great vessel injury,
She's been down too long.
Now that you two are residents, you're experts?
If we restore her volume... It's time to call it.
Call it. BABINKSI: Me?
Call it.
Death at 14:40.
What's the survival rate in patients who reach this hospital
alive after a penetrating chest trauma?
When you two can answer that,
then you can start second guessing me.
You want to do something? Notify her next of kin.
MALIK: Abby, stats are down to 76.
Can't get a good seal. He needs a tube. Get a Miller two and a six-five.
Uh-oh. What? What's wrong?
What's going on?
Uh, hypoventilating at a rate of six.
Is this the mall kid?
Told you to send him to PICU hours ago.
Suction. Abby!
I wanted to check one thing.
Great, so you kept him down here long enough for him to crash.
Tube. I got some history that suggested further workup.
Which you should have given to the team upstairs.
I'm in.
Good chest rise.
ABBY: Equal breath sounds.
Ammonia's back. 214. You were right.
The kid has a metabolic disorder.
Some kind of protein intolerance. Okay, run to the pharmacy.
See if the sodium phenylbutyrate is ready.
Sodium what?
It's a nitrogen scavenger. It'll help bring down the ammonia
and reverse the encephalopathy.
Got it.
The kid's family are strict vegetarians.
But his friends told me today that he had two cheeseburgers,
because he was depressed. Because his parents are getting a divorce.
So it was probably some sort of fast-food rebellion,
only he can't handle the protein.
Any family members to confirm this?
Uh, Chuny's still trying to track them down.
Switch him to D10 half at 150 an hour?
You got it.
Luka, I've got a hot MI on its way.
Be right there.
Lower the ammonia, get him out of his catabolic tailspin,
he'll start to wake up, right?
...nice pickup.
Lockhart comes up big.
( ball bouncing )
You call that a jump shot?
Hey, Luka.
I hear your mom's looking at apartments.
Yeah.
Who knows, might be even close enough for you to walk to my place.
It's not. It's only a few blocks from here.
Oh.
You know, it's not my idea.
Back to work.
We're going to still go camping again on your birthday, right?
Yeah?
Absolutely.
BABINSKI: Dr. Rasgoata?
Rasgotra.
...Rasgotra.
Neela's fine. Miss Filmore's freaking out
about how long she's been waiting to have her ankle splinted.
Maybe you could help with this one.
How we doing, Drew?
I've been here for six hours.
Is there anybody here who knows what the hell they're doing?
Yeah. Yes.
Then what the hell are you waiting for?
I've got a national sales conference I'm supposed to be at.
I'm sorry you had to wait. Sometimes we lose track of time
when we're trying to save people's lives.
Is that sarcasm?
Because I don't need that. I'm a customer here.
And if I'm not happy with the service,
or the way I'm treated, I will go to your supervisors.
We have a contract.
I didn't agree to surgery.
You agreed to consent to all medically necessary procedures,
associated with the pregnancy.
What is going on?
This is my husband, Rob. Dr. Barnett...
Are you the OB? No. ER.
She needs a C-section and I have a legal document giving permission
BARNETT: Can we go out to discuss this?
You don't, it's a breach of contract, and you won't get paid.
I want to have the baby naturally.
I'll get a court order forcing her to.
I don't think you can. Watch me.
She's endangering our unborn child.
I am doing everything to convince her to get surgery.
But I can't force her. She's carrying our baby.
We've been trying to have kids for five years.
We spent a fortune at three tries at IVF
and every time, I miscarried.
We gave the last of my embryos to Claire.
I'm sorry, but we can't do it like this.
Let me go and talk to her again.
I'm still getting a court order.
Ray! She had a late decel.
How low? 108.
Let's get her to the OB.
You need to wait outside now.
We're taking her to labor and delivery.
How we doing, Claire?
Are you moving me?
Yep, we're going upstairs.
Inez, go hold an elevator.
Okay.
BARNETT: Your baby's heart rate dropped during the last contraction
which could mean a sign of cord compression.
The baby could be in trouble.
What's the heart rate now?
112.
That's still okay, though, right?
Claire?
We're doing okay.
15 liters by mask.
( Claire screaming )
You need to have a C-section, Claire, you know that.
I know you have to trust me. I know my own body.
We wanna go with her. No!
We wanna be there when our baby is born!
I don't want them to be there.
( screaming )
MARQUEZ: Dr. Pratt. This is Karen Simms.
You treated her mother.
GSW.
Oh, right, thanks, Chuny.
No one will tell me what happened.
What's GSW? Is that gastric something? Is she okay?
Uh, would you like to sit down?
Okay.
GSW stands for gunshot wound.
Your mother was shot during a robbery attempt.
She was shot?
Yes.
We gave her blood transfusions, emergency surgery,
everything we could to save her.
She's dead?
I'm afraid that her injuries were too severe.
I'm very sorry.
How did you find me?
We found your name in her address book.
Did she say anything?
She talked a little when she was brought in,
but she lost a lot of blood and lost consciousness
as we were trying to save her.
Would you like to see her?
It's too late.
We haven't spoken in a long time.
We had a falling out a while back.
We were both waiting for the other one
to give in and admit they were wrong.
I guess I win.
I need to push.
No, not yet. Just breathe. You're doing great.
Fetal heart rate is 120.
Where's pedes? On their way.
God, it wasn't as hard the first time.
Take a rest. Umbilicus past the perineum?
Yup. Good news, Claire. The baby's hips are out. You get to push next time.
Okay. I told you I could do this.
Sterile towel.
Some gentle traction can help us get to the axilla.
Okay, baby's heart rate's below 100.
97, 90, 85, 79.
We need to put her on 100% O2, non-rebreather.
What's wrong? Is he okay?
Your baby's heart rate is dangerously low.
Umbilical cord's getting compressed, he's not getting enough oxygen.
68.
It should rebound between contractions.
We could still do a Cesarean, Claire. No.
We can push him back in and in less than two minutes-- start surgery.
But he's almost out.
We don't know that. His head could be entrapped.
Okay, this is it. Big push, Claire.
The difference between two minutes and five minutes
of low oxygen is the difference between a normal and brain-damaged baby.
Dr. Barnett! Consent to the C-section.
I'm trying, I'm really trying!
Okay, the head's stuck. We're going to need to pull him out with forceps.
Okay, sling a towel under his body.
Hold him up right here.
WALDRON: 48 on the monitor.
MOOG: Open the intubation tray.
Okay, Claire, once more.
One big push!
Pretty cyanotic.
Clamp and scissors.
Okay, come on, baby.
Just give us one little cry.
He needs a little stimulation.
No respiratory effort. Bag him.
No femoral. Starting compressions.
Three and a half uncuffed.
Can you please tell Rod and Toni that he's out?
I'm in.
Epi point zero four by ET.
How is he?
He doesn't have a pulse
and he's not breathing.
So what does that tell you?
Okay, Doctor, that's it-- you're out of here.
I thought I could do it.
( sighing )
( cheering )
Hey, Chas!
Let's do this!
( cheering )
Come on!
Have you been in to see your baby?
they're still doing tests on him.
It's been over an hour.
It was a hard delivery.
What aren't they telling us?
Your son was deprived of oxygen during the birth.
Um... but... but he's going to be all right?
We'll know more in a few days.
There's a good chance that he suffered neurologic damage.
Well, did he or didn't he?
I think that he probably did.
( sobbing )
Come on, let's go.
Go where?
Home.
What about our son? I'm not leaving him.
The pediatrician will come see you and he'll have more answers.
You already gave us the answer.
We didn't pay to have a brain dead baby.
He's not brain dead. Rod...
He's not normal.
Which he would have been if you had done the C-section.
We were going to call him David, after Rod's father.
Toni, you still can.
ROD: Let's go.
Hey, Liam, how are you feeling?
Cruddy.
Well, your parents are on their way.
They were very worried about you.
Good.
I'll send them up to the PICU as soon as they get here.
You'll like it up there. They have video games.
My friend thinks you're a MILF.
Shut up. Ow!
Excuse me?
It's a mother I'd like to...
Ah, well, I'm not a mother.
I'm a doctor.
Guess that makes you a DILF.
Okay, see you later, Liam.
Stay on your diet, and wear your Medic Alert bracelet.
Am I supposed to pretend I didn't see that?
See what?
Okay.
Well, come on.
I don't hear from him and he sends the ER a postcard?
You practically chased him out of town with a torch.
Where's Pratt? LOCKHART: He left.
Must be nice working banker's hours.
Um, no... this is incomplete.
You didn't document the distal neurovascular exam.
Let me see...
10 millimeter kidney stone.
No, urology needs to see this guy prior to discharge.
This...
this looks good.
Just right down the CBC and Chem 20 results.
Lab slips are on the back.
Not good enough. You have to transcribe them to your H&P.
Since when?
There's a new sheriff in town, ladies.
All right, let's see if you can do better
than one for four, Lockhart.
Need me to sign off on some charts?
No.
You said you had stuff for me
to sign off on. That was Neela.
Aren't those your charts?
Could someone show me how to do a filiform and follower?
Where's Ray?
He never came back down from labor and delivery.
Probably stayed upstairs to hit on one of those OB nurses.
I'll show you how to do it.
How's his muscle tone?
Uh, it's not too good.
Is he overbreathing the vent?
No.
Hypoxic brain injury.
The chance for complete neurological recovery is slim.
Has his mother been in to see him?
No.
Claire doesn't consider him her child...
and the Stillmans don't want a ventilator baby.
There's nothing else you can do for him.
Little guy has had a rough day.
I don't think he should spend his first night all alone.
Hey, Chas.
I'll talk to you guys later.
All right.
Congratulations, man. You swam a good race.
Oh, yeah, yeah, thanks.
I'm Greg.
Yeah, I remember you.
Uh, you came to the house a few weeks ago.
Yeah.
So did your dad say anything about me?
No.
He didn't?
No, but I mean, he's right back here
with my mom and my sister if you...
No, no, that's cool. I, um, I actually just wanted to introduce myself to you.
Your father and my mother, uh...
I'm your half-brother.
( snorts )
Get outta here.
No, it's true.
I'm just surprised your dad didn't mention it to you.
I mean, I've heard family rumors and stuff, but...
Oh, wow, this is trippy.
Good to meet you, man.
You, too.
CHARLIE: Come on, Chas, I'm starving.
Hey.
Hey...
So you two've met.
Yeah.
Good.
Yeah, that's good.
We're going to get a bite to eat. Do you want to join us?
Uh, not tonight. I just, uh, wanted to introduce myself to Chas, you know.
I'm glad you did, too.
Yeah.
Okay, well, I've got to go.
Wait, Greg.
Uh, this is my wife, Evelyn,
and my daughter, Jocelyn.
This is Greg...
my son.
Nice to meet you, Greg.
Likewise.
Come join us.
Uh, I can't.
I got to get back to the hospital.
Maybe another time. It was nice meeting all of you.
It was nice meeting you, too, Greg.
Bye. Come on, Chas.
Hold up, Greg.
You know, this is hard.
For all of us.
So come on, man... give it a chance.
This is your family.
No, this is your family.
Sam?
Alex?
( sighs )
