Previously on ER:
I'm Dr. Pratt. Olivia Evans.
I should move out.
Why?
RASGOTRA: I think we both know why.
The cops brought in a friend a while ago
for a blood-alcohol level.
I drew my own blood, switched the tubes.
There's little doubt they'll suspend your license.
You're going on a vacation. What?
I was offering you the job. But you and Alex,
you're more than welcome to come live with me.
Excuse me?
Mm...
( footsteps descending )
Good morning, Samantha.
Hi!
Uh... I was just going to get Alex,
he'll sleep for a week if I let him.
My boys were the same way.
Not Kelly though.
I used to tease her about being part rooster.
Three must have been a handful.
Yeah, but kids are great, you know?
Especially when they're young--
they haven't turned on you yet. Right?
Your wife is beautiful.
No idea what she was doing with me.
Cancer.
Even towards the end, though, she was... something else.
I got meetings in the city all day.
I'll be back by 6:00.
I'm entertaining guests.
Yeah? You gonna sing for 'em? ( laughs )
No, no, just dinner for the board of directors
and their snooty wives.
Right, well, I should check your crit.
Yeah, no, we'll do it tonight.
I'm feeling fine. At least a urine sample.
Ah, listen, my pee right now is a lovely shade of salmon.
...the chelation's working. Like water colors in my toilet.
"An ounce of prevention..." Ah, listen, come on.
There is no cure for MDS.
You can stick me with your needles
after I'm done entertaining.
You know, you should use the car today.
That's okay, we can take the El. No, I insist.
How about Mrs. Harrison
whip you and Alex up some breakfast, huh?
It's the most important meal of the day. Hmm?
ABBY: Well, they raised Gallant,
and he turned out okay, they can't be that bad.
No, they're great, it's just they're strangers.
What're they doing in town? Family wedding.
Are you going to go? I wouldn't know a soul.
Besides, I'm pretty sure I'm more dirty-little-secret
than daughter-in-law.
Well, look who it is.
Back with commoners, are we?
Good Lord, what is that?
What? That smell.
It's really bad, it smells like... ass.
You do realize how close we are to the ER?
I think it's you, Morris.
That patient we just transferred
threw her colostomy bag at him.
Uh... I changed my clothes though!
Well, I would recommend a shower.
Oh... somebody's got a sugar daddy.
You jealous?
Hey, guys.
Morris?
Chemo boy pulled his central line,
he's bleeding all over curtain four.
All right, chop-chop, We earn our money down here.
I better go before Stinky gets mad.
Hey, uh....
I've been trading e-mails with Carter.
Really?
Did you tell him about us? No, no.
Uh, he needs help. In Sudan.
And he asked me if, uh...
if I would join him.
In Africa? I'd be back before the baby's born.
Oh, okay.
Okay. I mean, were you, um...
planning on talking to me about this? I am talking to you.
Look, if you don't want me to go...
You don't need my permission to go.
The people need help there.
In his camp alone,
there are over 60,000 IDP's being cared for
by just a handful of doctors and nurses.
They have problems with clean water... Yeah, I know, I know.
I know, believe me, between you and Carter, I know. I...
( sighs )
If this is something you feel like you have to do,
then you should do it.
OLIVIA: Greg?
( knocking )
All right, I'm coming, I'm coming, damn.
( knocking )
OLIVIA: Are you there?
Greg?
( knocking )
Hey, baby, what are you doing here? Are you all right?
( coughs )
Yeah. What time is it?
I was worried. I tried your cell phone.
I left a messages at the hospital.
Yeah, I'm... ( coughs )
I'm sick, I turned my phone off.
I-I tried you here, too.
What do you want me to do, I'm sick, you know?
Don't stress me out about it.
Can I come in? I'll make you some tea.
No, no, I'm cool, uh...
Look, now is not a good time.
But I will be
at work later. You-you... Okay.
We can talk then, okay? Olivia?
That's it right there. S600. Yup.
Sure is. JERRY: That's a $100,000 car.
It's probably more with the chauffeur.
Chauffeur? Get outta here.
You people are aware that
the Daimler-Benz company was a vital cog
in the Nazi war machine, right?
Hey... so who is he? Who's who?
Your new whale, Daddy Warbucks.
Spill it, you little gold digger.
Go kill another patient, Morris.
What, 97-year-old lung cancer guy?
Yeah, all my fault.
Doctor Rasgotra, phone call.
Hi, this is Dr. Rasgotra.
Oh, hi, you're here.
Yeah, I'll come and get you, it's easy to get lost.
Got a second? Not really, Michael's parents are here.
I haven't seen you around.
Yeah, I've been crazed.
Listen I wanted to... Is there something that you wanted...
Sorry. I'm sorry.
No, go ahead. Okay.
Um... I was just thinking about
this whole roomie situation thing,
I just wanted to make sure everything was cool.
Yeah, as far as I know, yeah. Okay.
So if we needed to work on anything...
No, no. You know...
I'm married now.
And I should be past sharing a bathroom with your mates
and your not-so-occasional one-night stand... stands.
You're right, I've been totally inconsiderate
when it comes to having people over. It's not just that.
I mean, clothes are everywhere, and dirty dishes... It's both of us.
I'm a mess, too. But you're not nearly as bad.
I've already started looking for a new place, Ray.
Oh.
Neela! Colonel Gallant!
BOTH: Oh...
COLONEL GALLANT: What did I tell you the last time?
Right. Dad.
Mom. Hello, Neela.
This is my colleague...
Oh. He was just here.
17-year-old, restrained driver.
Auto vs. parked SUV at high velocity.
He lost it taking a turn too fast.
why do they think they can get away?
You were chasing him? He was in a stolen car.
We found a girl he must have jacked.
How you doing, Deshawn? He's altered, BP 130 over 75,
pulse 110. What do we have?
Blunt head, good vitals, and a passenger coming behind.
Go ahead, I'll take this.
Jane Doe, found unresponsive in the back.
Multiple abrasions and contusions. Okay.
( loudly ): Hello? Can you hear me?
Neela, we might need a hand here. I'm, uh, I'm sorry.
I'll have someone show you to a seating area.
Actually, I wouldn't mind observing your S.O.P.
Oh, of course.
Oh, no, I'll leave the gore to old blood and guts there.
Uh, were can I get a coffee? The cafeteria, sixth floor.
Thanks.
Sinus tach on the scope.
Pupils four millimeters and reactive.
Abby this is Colonel Gallant, Michael's father.
Nice to meet you. Likewise.
You were a medic in Vietnam, weren't you?
1st Air Cavalry, '68 to '72.
Four tours. Wow.
All right, let's see what we've got here.
There is a systematic approach to the trauma patient
called ATLS: Advanced Trauma Life Support.
It ensures resuscitation and stabilization
in even the most critical of patients.
( groaning ) Trauma panel, c-spine, chest and pelvis.
Ah, Chicago's finest.
Dr. Morris, Chief Resident.
TAGGART: Settle down, Deshawn.
We're trying to help you, okay?
Guy must be on meth or something.
Deformity of the 5th metacarpal. Boxer's fracture.
He's a real fighter, huh? Took a swing at me.
Need me to check that out? I'm good.
Okay, liter of N.S., throw in a second I.V.
BP's good, 125 over 80. Pulse ox 99. Calm down, man.
Head CT and a tox screen.
Tenderness to the left mandible.
MORRIS: Add a jaw series.
Airway is patent. Is the trachea midline? Yes.
Any JVD? No.
Muffled heart tones? No.
Where are we, ladies? We're assessing the nine
most immediately life threatening injuries.
Inadequate airway protection, airway obstruction,
tension pneumothorax, flail chest with hypoxia,
I'm sure you're a big hit at surgical grand rounds.
Doctor Morris, this is Colonel Gallant.
Michael's father. Ah, it's a great honor to meet you, sir.
You in the service, Dr. Morris? Uh, no. Flat feet.
Guys, I don't think she's breathing. Pulse ox 88.
Ambu-bag, intubation tray, 20 of etomidate, 100 of sux.
Dr. Morris, if you'll please provide
inline stabilization of the neck. Sats are dropping.
RASGOTRA: Ah, it's hard to bag her.
Take a look, Neela.
I can't, she's completely clamped down.
Did you push the sux? Yeah.
Is that a good IV?
MALIK: It went right through.
She's completely spasmed shut.
I can't bag her. Okay, throw in two nasal trumpets.
Start a second line,
push another of 150 of sux from a different vial.
TAGGART: All right, we're taking you off this board,
and making you feel more comfortable, okay?
Lie still, you son of a bitch!
BARNETT: Let's get him on hard restraints.
Give him some morphine? I don't want him to stop breathing.
He's got a broken hand and a broken jaw,
he's in pain. Okay, I'll splint him.
He won't lay still. He will if you tape his head.
I don't know what he's on.
Could have a real head injury. Yeah. Hence the CT.
If it's normal, then he can spend the time
in a jail cell and sober up.
Okay, two of Versed.
( groaning )
Thought you said his airbag deployed.
Yeah.
Kind of hard to break your jaw on an airbag.
LOCKHART: 150 of sux going in the second IV.
MALIK: Got your flush.
She should be relaxing.
Damn, it's worse, her masseter's in spasm.
It's like a bloody vice. Okay, how about Valium?
It's too late. Abby, bag her.
RASGOTRA: I'll prep the neck. Crike tray.
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Maybe it's the sux.
What? Pavulon.
Six of Pavulon, right now!
Abby, if the sux isn't working, it's...
When I was a nurse, we had a patient in the OR for TOA,
who had the exact same response to sux--
her jaws were clamped shut. Betadine and a steri-drape.
Give the Pavulon a chance to work. Eleven blade.
Neela, do not cut!
Sats are down to 82.
MORRIS: Okay, we should get Kovac.
Abby, if we wait she'll have anoxic brain injury.
Jaw is slack. Suction.
Let's go! Abby Lockhart with the save.
We were about to crike her when the Pavulon kicked in.
Masseter spasm after sux.
There was a case report in J.E.M. last fall.
Good catch. Thank you.
Head CT on your carjack girl.
Hey, Morris, films on your carjacking.
Thank you, my man.
No bleed, no fracture, completely normal.
Why'd she stop breathing?
Hard to say.
Could be drugs, alcohol.
We need to get her into an ICU bed
and monitor for hyperthermia.
Police I.D.'d her yet?
No, they're still working on it.
Hello.
Hey.
Can you open your eyes?
Still paralyzed from the Pavulon.
Give her an hour. All right. Can you call RT?
Tell them to lower the F.I. O2 to 50.
Have you made a decision yet?
About what?
Look, if you really don't want me to go...
No, I know. You said that already.
I don't understand why you're putting this all on me.
I already told you, it's gonna be only for a few weeks.
Luka, the last time you went,
we thought you died.
But instead, you came back with malaria.
Dr. Kovac, paramedics are bringing in chest pain
with ST elevation. Okay, page cards and put the cath lab on hold.
I'll be right there. Okay.
Can we talk about this later? Yeah, sure.
Fifth metacarpal fracture, 30 degrees of angulation.
Non-displaced mandible fracture.
No need for surgery.
( groaning )
BARNETT: Hey, easy, man.
You broke your jaw.
( groaning )
Tox screen was negative, blood alcohol, zero.
Guess he was combative from his concussion.
Stop eyeballing me, jag off.
( grunts )
What?
You worried about her?
HOLLIS: You better be.
She dies, we got your ass on felony murder.
That's 25 to life
you get to spend with your homeys.
You've got a hell of a unit in there.
Good people.
Especially that Lockhart.
Worked her way up from a nurse?
You could learn a lot working under her command. Actually, Abby and I...
Yeah, she's excellent.
You're lucky.
Good leadership, half the battle.
So I was thinking, if we hurry, we can do Michigan Avenue
and still have time for Field's down on State.
You can't go two days
without swiping that credit card, can you?
You know, we need to get you something nice for the house.
Sheets. Michael loves soft sheets.
When he was a little boy, we had to drag him
out of our bed. That's not necessary.
I'm... we're looking for a new place
and we got everything needed after the wedding.
Oh, don't be silly.
We'll find you something at Field's.
I can always find something at Field's.
It'll be fun. For who?
You don't have to go with, James.
Neela and I can get along just fine without you.
Maybe she doesn't want to shop.
You ever think of that?
Our son deserves something nice for the house.
The boy isn't in the house, Glo. And why is that, James?
Why don't you explain why he's not here with his wife.
Come on.
Jim Coker, 82, assault victim.
HARMS: Multiple contusions to the arms and torso.
A and 0, B.P. 165/100.
TAGGART: Nasty bruises.
What'd you get hit with, sir?
Felt like a brick. They get the attacker?
Meet Fredna Nasse, 80.
Lacerations to the right palm.
TAGGART: You attacked him?
Damn right.
Cheating bastard!
What did you hit him with, ma'am? An urn.
I would have hit him again, but the damn thing broke
and cut my hand and spilled Wally's ashes
all over everything.
Who's Wally?
My husband, God rest his soul.
Can you wiggle your fingers?
Order a hand series. Where does it hurt, sir?
All over-- mostly my chest.
What's this scar?
They put a pig valve in my heart 10 years ago.
You got a pig head, too, philanderer!
Come on, open your eyes.
Yankauer.
B.P.'s sky high-- 190/122.
Okay, amp of atropine.
Morris!
195/120. Mix up nipride.
Hey, have you seen Neela? I gave her a few hours off.
She's out with the Gallants. What's up? Hypertension and bradycardia.
MORRIS: Cushing reflex--
increased pressure in the brain.
No, the CT was clear.
Right pupil's slightly bigger.
BARNETT: Check her fundi. Yeah.
Disc margins are blurry. Elevated ICP.
Is it a brain bleed? No, I just told you the CT was clear.
I doubt she bled in the last five minutes.
Okay, I'll call neurosurg for an ICP monitor.
Where's Luka? I think he's in exam three.
Okay, 50 of mannitol, dial up the nipride.
And I'll be right back.
Chest is clear, heart looks good.
He doesn't have a heart. For God's sake, Fredna, give it a rest, will you?
I'm not the one who needs a rest.
I'm gone two days, and you can't keep it in your pants?
I crack a rib or something, doc?
Pain's getting worse.
Awful hard to breathe.
KOVAC: Both lungs are up.
B.P's dropping-- 90/50.
Repeat EKG and chest, Whoa!
500 cc saline bolus.
Not gonna die, is he?
No, no, I don't think so.
Well, if he is, let him.
You sure you two aren't married?
Luka, can you take another look at our carjacking girl?
Not right now. I'm sorry. Systolic's only 80.
She's got elevated ICP and a normal scan.
Let's put him in Trendelenberg.
Should I repeat the CT? Anything pertinent in the history?
I didn't get a history.
She's intubated and paralyzed.
Okay, try to talk to the guy they brought her in with.
The carjacker? Yeah.
ICP rises with cocaine and amphetamine.
She may need phentolamine or a beta blocker.
TAGGART: Repeat EKG.
Sat's only 82. Try to get a history.
I'll be in as soon as I can. Set up for bipap,
get an ultrasound and let's see if there's any free resident.
He's really not okay, is he, doc?
What's his name?
HOLLIS: Deshawn Liberty.
Deshawn, the girl in the car,
does she have any medical conditions?
He's not the helpful type, doc. Did she take any drugs?
Coke, meth, anything?
What are you doing? I'm trying to get a history,
He can't talk with a broken jaw.
Well, okay, fine, then he can write.
Not with a busted hand.
Well, he could use his good hand.
Can you take these off? I don't think so.
Fine, I'll take off the hard restraint.
MORRIS: Abby, Abby, are you crazy? He's dangerous.
( Lockhart's dialogue muffled )
Deshawn, did she take any drugs?
( muffled dialogue )
Kid know something? HOLLIS: Like what?
Take the cuffs off. That girl could die.
HOLLIS: He hit a police officer!
MORRIS: Let them do their jobs, we'll do ours.
( muffled dialogue )
LOCKHART: That girl needs help.
Hey, what are you doing? He's deaf, okay?
Do you read lips?
Good.
The girl in the car,
did she take drugs?
BARNETT: Damn it, I don't know what that is.
All right.
X?
Ecstasy?
Did she take ecstasy?
G... GHB.
All right, that girl's been frying her brain for 20 minutes.
Brooke Sawyer.
We didn't know.
Maybe if you guys weren't so busy beating on him...
LOCKHART: That's 8 of Ativan.
MALIK: Systolic's up to 220.
Head CT is ready. She might not need that.
Her brain's seizing, but the Pavulon has her body paralyzed.
Sub-clinical seizure. Yeah, the Ativan should take care of that.
That doesn't work, she's gonna need a CT.
Keep going, 50 migs a minute.
I'm calling neurosurgery.
Just give it five minutes. It's not a bleed.
If it is, we don't have five minutes. It's not a bleed.
Pressure's coming down-- 130/85.
Pulse normalizing-- 84.
Hang up, Morris. Wrong number.
BARNETT: Nice call. What do you think happened?
I don't know.
your broken arm kid's mom is packing.
Okay, you guys good here? Yeah, we got it.
Jerry, can you ask Frank where our sign interpreter is.
Right here.
What? I'm trilingual.
I hate this thing!
Well, it's only for six weeks, buddy.
Six weeks?! That's forever!
Dickie, quiet down. Can I just check your cast here?
No! I hate you! Stop it! Now!
You suck.
Right. Any pain in your fingers, buddy?
No.
Can you feel this?
Yeah. Can you feel this?
Ow!
Dr. Morris, Jordan Prior, Ladokern Pharmaceuticals.
If I could just steal a moment of your time.
Systolic's down to 75.
Heard you needed a hand. Blood in the belly? No, it's clear.
In the heart?
TAGGART: No cardiac effusion.
PRATT: All right, let's try with a Doppler.
Please, I didn't mean to hurt him, not...
not like this.
You did this?
Yes.
KOVAC: Mitral regurgitation through his porcine valve.
Yeah, looks like he blew it out.
He was hypertensive when he came in.
Stress raised his B.P. and damaged the valve.
All right, page Cardiothoracic and hold an O.R.
TAGGART: B.P.'s 60/40.
Dopamine at 10 mikes.
1.25 of Enalopril.
Ma'am, we're gonna fix him right up, don't worry.
MARKOVIC: They were at an after hours party.
And he couldn't wake her up,
so he threw her in the car
and brought her here.
That car was stolen.
MARKOVIC: No, that car was her parents'.
And she snuck out.
Why didn't he stop for the police?
He knew that Brooke needed help, and he needed to get her here.
And he figured he'd just explain everything when they got here.
Then why did he fight with them?
He was fighting back,
trying to protect myself.
Cops don't sign.
And Brooke-- she's gotten drunk before, but never like that.
He doesn't even drink.
He's an athlete.
He wants to know if she's gonna be okay.
We hope so.
You probably saved her life.
Thank you.
Thank you.
MRS. GALLANT: So, you're sticking
with surgery then?
I'm not sure yet. It's a big decision.
Mm. Well, sounds like a good idea.
You'll be able to find work anywhere.
I was hoping to stay at County, actually.
You like working there.
I never thought I'd say it, but, yes, I do.
I've grown quite fond of Chicago, as well.
Well, don't get your heart set.
I've got a residency set up for Mike when he gets back.
Muskogee V.A., Oklahoma.
Perhaps Michael will decide to settle here.
Don't worry.
First time's the hardest.
You'll get used to it.
To what?
Relocating.
Soldier's got to go where they tell him to.
The upside is, you get to see the world.
Bismarck, North Dakota,
Barstow, California, Christmas
in Anchorage,
and my all-time favorite, Indian Springs, Nevada.
Gorgeous in July.
I guess you don't remember
when Mike learned to sail on Lake Como.
How Val's face lit up
when she saw her first ballet in Paris.
You've had a good life, Gloria.
So,
you two talk about kids yet?
Um...
no, not yet.
Abby, your carjacking girl's waking up.
Did you check the NIF?
Yeah, it's 30.
Tidal volume is 700. Oh, oh, oh, oh.
Don't do that, don't do that.
Hey, look at me.
I'm Dr. Lockhart, okay?
Wiggle your fingers for me.
All right.
Give me a thumbs up sign
if you want me to take that tube out.
All right, hold on just a second.
( wheezing )
All right, deep breath in.
And blow it out.
( coughing )
Oh. Oh, my head hurts.
1,000 of acetaminophen.
MALIK: You got it.
You remember what happened?
We were at a party.
You got in a car accident.
And you stopped breathing.
We had to put you on a ventilator.
And the Ecstasy that you took
caused you to have seizure,
and we had to treat you with anti-convulsants.
( teary ): Oh my God.
Yeah, you were very lucky.
( sniffling )
( sniffling )
He likes to feel my heartbeat.
It's funny.
He's the only person in my whole life
who actually listens to me.
You would serve on the advisory board, be responsible
for recruiting doctors to participate
in important clinical trials.
And with your residency ending in July,
this could be a real opportunity
to advance the practice of medicine,
as well as your own career.
Okay, you know what? I-I... Ow. I don't know.
You know, I'm-I'm really not that much of a salesman.
Expense account?
A generous one.
And this isn't a sales position we're offering you, Dr. Morris.
Your official title would be Director of Physician Relations.
Hmm. It's got a nice-nice ring to it.
Anything broken?
Thankfully, no.
It's just a sprain. Please continue. Aah!
Well, there are meetings and presentations
at major medical centers across the country.
Um, first-first class air travel?
Of course.
And quarterly meetings at some very desirable resorts.
Best of all, no nights,
no weekends, and no exposure to bodily fluids.
Salary?
You would start somewhere in the neighborhood of $300,000 a year.
Plus bonuses.
My kind of neighborhood.
( both quietly laugh )
KOVAC: You sure you want to wait?
That's a four-hour surgery.
Somebody has to be with him when he wakes up.
Now, let me give some sound medical advice, Mr. Coker.
Please do not make her mad again.
I can't help it. I'm a ladies man.
Always have been.
( laughs ): Well, just take it easy, okay?
Thank you, Doctors.
Pretty nice save, huh?
Yup, timely diagnosis of a rare condition. Good work.
Looks like Dr. Pratt is back.
Yeah, well, that's something I-I want to talk to you about.
What?
Your status here.
My status? I thought my suspension was over.
That was time off so you could think about what you did
and so I could think about what to do about it.
Look, I was talking to Dr. Carter recently.
Okay.
He wants me to come to help him in Sudan.
Oh. You're leaving?
No, but I thought you could use a change of perspective.
No, I think my perspective is just fine.
Greg, you're going to be an attending next year.
That means all the decisions fall on your head.
A month over there will only make you a better one.
Get your shots, make sure your passport is current,
and get your hat.
It can get really hot out there.
Wait a minute, wait. You're sending me to Africa?
Yeah, I am.
And what if my answer is no?
It's not a request.
Well...
RASGOTRA: That's about it.
I'm sorry, it's not much of a tour.
So, when do you plan on moving?
Uh, been looking for a place.
It's just been a bit of a challenge
with my schedule and Michael being gone.
Only one bathroom, huh?
Must get hard with a roommate.
Oh, we manage.
We work different shifts most of the time.
Hmm. So he's not really here much?
Cut it out, James. They're just roommates.
It's not her. I don't know the boy. I need to use the phone.
You can use the phone in my room.
( sighs )
Neela,
I feel I should apologize for the way we've been acting.
Oh, no. There's no need. Couples bicker.
We passed bicker years ago.
Oh, it's nothing, really.
You should hear my parents.
Is there, uh, anything I can get you?
Gloria and I are separating.
Oh. Does Michael know?
No.
Nobody does.
We decided to come to the wedding,
put on a good show for the family
before we dropped the bomb.
We'd like to
tell Mike ourselves, so,
if you don't mind, keep it in the vault?
Uh, yes, of course.
36-year-old with epididymis.
He doesn't need ultrasound, it's nottorsion.
Any STD risk?
Of course. He's male.
Did you give him levofloxacin?
Already wrote the scrip.
Okay, fine.
That's all. Thank you. Abby, we...
We need to finish our talk.
No, we don't, actually, 'cause you know what? I understand.
No, no, you don't. No, I do.
Listen. No, you listen. I-I mean...
Sorry. I just... I... I'm...
You know, I know that we're not married,
and, um... and we don't live together,
( whispers ): and we haven't really defined our relationship,
and I know that that's mostly,
probably all, uh, because of me.
But you looked at me and said
that we were going to do this together.
And I know that you'll be back
before the baby's born, but I just... I just hate
And I hate that I hate that you want to go.
But I'm just a little bit scared, Luka.
And, um, I don't want to do this by myself.
But if I have to, I-I can, and I will.
I'm sending Pratt.
To help me with the baby?
To Darfur.
He...
He-He... He volunteered.
Long story.
So you're staying?
Mm.
Oh, good. That's good.
Well, I'll see you tonight.
Yeah.
KOVAC: Hey, man.
Hey.
What's up with the suit? You getting married?
It's my new school uniform.
How do you like it?
It's school.
But our new house is sweet.
Oh, you moved?
Yeah, to Kenilworth.
Man, you should see it, Luka.
It's like a museum, it's so big.
Uh, when, uh...
When did that happen?
Oh, when mom started working for Mr. Elliot.
It's his house,
but he's got an indoor pool and a movie theater.
( footsteps approaching )
You ready, kiddo? Hey.
I didn't know you guys moved.
Yeah, uh, my boss needs chelation therapy every night,
so, room and board is part of the deal.
See you later, Luka.
So, uh, do you guys live there now?
Yeah. Wow.
That's a big change.
Well, it was either that or double up on my shifts here,
and even then, wouldn't pay me as much money.
This part of the deal, too?
I guess.
We're good, Luka.
Really.
( engine starting )
RASGOTRA ( knocking ): Mrs. Gallant?
Is everything okay?
( sniffles )
Are you all right?
Can I get you anything?
No, thank you.
He told you, didn't he?
I'm very sorry.
So am I.
You're a very sweet girl, Neela.
And I see why Michael fell in love with you.
I can tell you love him, too. I do.
Very much.
And that's good.
I just wish that love was always enough.
God knows I love that man in the other room.
But here I am.
You know...
Michael always talked about what great parents you were.
Maybe there's still a chance to...
Have you any idea why Michael went back to Iraq?
Not exactly.
I guess he felt like
he was needed there.
He... has a strong sense of duty.
Ah!
Duty.
For years,
I have sacrificed and compromised,
moving from one sorry little town to the next
all because of duty.
That boy is his father's son.
They're soldiers.
And no matter how much you love them,
there's always another war.
I'm...
I'm not quite sure what you're trying to tell me.
What I'm trying to tell you is
that a strong marriage is about two people.
Now Michael's a good man.
Michael is kind, he is loving,
he is generous, just like his father.
But if staying here at County in Chicago
is something you want to do, then that's what you should do.
Never ever let anybody or anything
make you ever forget who you are.
Miss Taggart.
Please, come quickly.
Mr. Elliot, you're awake.
I couldn't get him to open his eyes.
I'm fine.
Go make sure they don't ruin the duck, please.
Mr. Elliot... Regina, come on.
We got 20 people waiting here.
Please, go. Yes, sir.
You might want to think about canceling your dinner.
This transfusion's suppose to last three weeks.
Well, not this time-- you need blood.
Yeah, right, take three hours.
I got guests.
Then let's get you on some oxygen at least.
Out of the question.
How will I be able to sing, huh, with a tube up my nose?
You know what? This is serious.
You're obviously anemic right now.
Really?
Well... I'll be done by 9:00.
You can transfuse me then.
You hired me to take care of you.
then I don't know what I'm doing here.
What you're doing here now, Samantha,
is you're working for me.
Maybe I shouldn't be working for you.
Maybe not.
The 'rents are signing some paperwork for your transfer.
I guess they want you at the highfalutin hospital
in the suburbs.
Yeah, that sounds like them.
And we were finally able to get ahold of your father.
He should be here pretty soon.
WOMAN: We called Dr. Christiano.
He's going to meet us at St. Helen's.
So we checked it out.
( Jerry clears throat )
Guess the parents were out of town,
and came home early,
saw the car gone and called it in.
They, uh, thought the daughter
was at a friend's house.
Um... my guys here
have something they want to say to you.
Uh... ( clears throat )
We just wanted to apologize for the misunderstanding.
We thought you were flashing gang signs at us.
Yeah, um...
we had no idea you were, um...
We're... we're really sorry.
Um, he says that he has a special sign for you guys.
I think that requires no translation.
Yeah.
And GYN has a bed but they can't take the PID for hours.
So, did you get a chance to meet the Gallants?
No, I must've missed them.
Yeah. Probably better that way.
Would've been weird.
Why's that?
Why do you think?
Hey, to tell you the truth,
I don't know how you do it, my man.
Every girl I've ever slept with won't give me the time of day.
Ooh, I bet it was really freaky being at her wedding.
Dude, what are you talking about?
You know, you and Neela,
the whole roommate-with-benefits thing.
You think I slept with Neela?
You didn't?
No.
Huh.
Uh, I just assumed.
Everybody did.
Everybody did?
Pretty much. Hey, but, you know, don't sweat it.
It's just a rumor. FRANK: Pratt.
Kovac left this for you.
What is it?
Looks like you're heading back to the motherland.
Hey, better be careful, Frank. I'm having a very bad day.
Maybe you woke up on the wrong side of the bed.
Hey, look, we should go talk somewhere.
Oh, really? About what, Greg?
What do you mean "what about?" About us.
Olivia, come on. Who was she?
Nobody.
Look, I'm sorry. I really am.
Come on.
What? I just said I'm sorry. I heard you. I-I...
You know... ( sighs )
Explain to me why you did it.
Look, we never talked about being monogamous.
We never said anything about not being monogamous.
All you had to do was be straight with me.
I never meant to hurt you.
I... You what?
You played me, Greg.
You acted like we were in this committed relationship.
And if you really thought that it was cool
for you to sleep around, you wouldn't've had your sorry ass
at the door playing like you were sick.
Olivia, I like you, and I never was misleading you.
No, you didn't think, that's... FRANK: Pratt.
I got a phone call from L'Alliance de Medecins.
They got your number from Kovac.
Yeah, just tell them to hold on, okay?
Listen, I really cannot do this right now. Why not?
Because my boss is making me go to Africa, that's why.
You just don't stop, do you?
What are you talking... stop what? Right.
Olivia. Wait a minute.
I'm not lying to you.
( sighs )
You know, you're right, Samantha.
I feel much better with the oxygen.
Did it affect your singing voice?
Well, I didn't wear it for the party.
I just stayed in my chair, never got up.
Just did much more listening than talking.
Wow, I was beginning to think you didn't know how to do that.
( chuckles )
Anyway, if you're ready, I'll... I'll take my blood now.
Yo, Neela.
I'm in here.
Hey, I brought you a peace offering.
Extra anchovies. ( zipper closing )
And I promise, no more dirty dishes, okay?
I, uh, going to go and stay at Abby's for a while.
She's at Luka's most of the time so...
So, what, are you moving out, like, tonight?
I'll get to the post office when I can,
get my mail forwarded.
You want to at least wait until you find a new place?
Don't think that's such a good idea.
Yeah, you're probably right.
Hey, um,
all good things, right?
Sure had a lot of fun though.
Maybe the next guy won't drink all my tequila, huh?
Uh, you need a hand with anything?
Uh, no, thanks.
Pizza? I better get going.
Okay.
( chuckles softly )
You know I've been looking for this for, like, a month.
I rather liked sleeping in it.
I'll, uh, I'll get the rest tomorrow.
RAY: Neela.
Look, just...
Would you just wait one second, please?
I wish I didn't... feel how I feel.
But you...
you're the best friend I've ever had.
Keep this.
