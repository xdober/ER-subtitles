Previously on E.R.:
Michael's coming home today.
Well, hello, soldier.
MAN: Michael's unit had a heavy patient flow.
He'll be unable to make it home on leave as anticipated.
Hi, I'm Tony Gates. Dr. Rasgotra.
You don't like my style?!
We were all here a long time before you.
We work together. You're the new guy.
I'm her father. I have a right to know! Dad, please!
RASGOTRA: Stop it! ( groans )
You ever come near my daughter again
and I'll kill ya.
Wasn't as cold this morning.
I thought people from the Bronx are tough.
We are.
Yeah, right. Talk to me in February.
Hey, what's up? What's up?
What we got?
Martin Trudeau, 60, short of breath.
Oh-oh, looks like trouble.
You're telling me.
How's the rookie doing?
Ah, she could smile more. She's fine.
All I wanted was a little oxygen,
and these clowns keep poking me for ten minutes.
Status: post-cardiac transplant 2001.
Think those bastards at the Mayo Clinic
give refunds of bad hearts?
Marty here's on a lot of meds.
Neoral, Mycophenolate, lipitor, benazepril, nicardipine,
isordil, furosemide, potassium and aspirin.
Oh, we got freakin' Rain Man here.
I'm taking her to Vegas. Lungs are wet.
40 of Lasix, 25 of sublingual captopril.
How's it going, for real?
They don't have a coat that fits, they woke us up at 5 am and Gates is like a dog in heat.
Other than that... there's nothing.
Look on the bright side. What bright side?
Pratt, your bloody diarrhea guy? His butt is exploding again.
You could be stuck here.
Yo, Mayday.
"Dr. Rasgotra" will be fine.
I'm going to go restock, Mayday. Thanks.
Nice jacket, roomie. Or can I still call you that?
Long as you don't call me "Mayday," you can call me whatever.
How was the ride-along? That good, huh?
You need a fresh steri-strip.
Mm. Ah, ow! Ow...
Sorry.
Yeah, still a little tender.
All things considered, you got off easy.
My ass-kicking was a breeze. All I had to do was lay there.
It beats jail time.
Ah... Here, sit.
Heard from Gallant?
Not yet. He got stuck.
He's still coming home, right?
Not at the moment.
That's cool. I mean, too bad.
But, uh, maybe I can come home now?
No. No?
It's actually quite nice without you,
and that smell hasn't been there since.
It's my place.
Got another run, Mayday.
You can come back on the following conditions:
No dirty dishes and no using the couch as your clothes hamper.
Didn't I let you move in?
Okay, deal. I'm on graveyard. I'll be back in the morning.
Oh, crap. Admit, 2:00.
I thought you got rid of her. A little help, please?
Ray? Neela?
Zoe.
Oh, hey, Neela.
Why you here?
Where is Ray? He's off today.
Well, that's not true. He pulls doubles Thursdays
so he can do Friday gigs. I totally know his schedule.
He had a doctor's appointment, eye specialist.
He hasn't returned my calls or anything. I've been so worried.
Come on. We got a man out there.
I'll tell him. Could you give him this?
It's all our songs. It's a make-up mix. Okay.
Hey, residency office is looking for Abby.
She's on nights.
Lucky her.
Oh, she's on nights.
I know why you've got fluid in your lungs, Mr. Trudeau.
I take long showers.
Is there anything you want to tell me?
Like what?
Your... your cyclosporin level was zero.
Yeah, so?!
So you stopped taking your meds. Am I right?
Are you taking your pills?
Nope.
You're wasting a perfectly good heart, not to mention my time.
You know how much the medicine cost me a month, huh?
I take piles of that medicine
at almost four large a month.
What about Medicare?
Oh, please, you got to declare poverty for that.
You have to give up your house and your savings and your car!
Huh?
Who's going to take care of my wife?
How you supposed to take care of her if you're dead?
She-She drives me back and forth to the hospital.
I-I puke, she cleans it up
and I can't make it up the stairs alone.
I pass out.
Mr. Trudeau, are you refusing
to take your medication?
Because if you are, you're going to go into heart failure
and you're gonna die.
Aw...
All right, then. Put him in Curtain Three.
We're done.
EVE: Sam, how many nurses are you short?
Two, and the registry's empty.
You'll manage. Here's my hotel number.
My flight leaves at 4:20. I'll keep my cell phone on. What about Malik?
Funeral in Detroit.
Arson capital of the world.
Did you try Jarvik?
I called everybody.
Sam, do you want me to stay?
Oh, go ahead. We got it. Go.
I got a flight to catch.
Yo, Rocky.
Hey, Inez.
Wanna pick up a drunk samurai? A samurai?
GYN has a bed, but can't take the PID for two hours.
I'll call 'em.
Why's my UTI still here? We're out of ICONS.
Yeah, could you, please? I got it.
Like, before Christmas.
I said I got it. Four more.
What'd she say?
The same thing she said the last six times.
"Kobayashi," that's your real name?
Hai.
Irrasshaimase.
Konnichiwa. Hai.
You, with hair like ray of sun,
you are beautiful.
Hee-hee!
Ho!
What are you doing?
Looking for my underwear.
You on tonight?
No.
Why are you leaving?
Just thought... I should.
You should stay.
I probably shouldn't.
I have a lot of stuff I need to... do and...
Oh, your bra.
Thank you.
Panties.
Still like ketchup on your eggs?
Okay.
I'll make us some breakfast.
I think we probably slept through breakfast.
And lunch.
I can't believe he's doing this to himself.
Can you stop it?
Really, what's the point, if he's not going to take the medication?
He's not such a pain in the ass, you know.
He's just angry because he's been so sick.
I wish you could help him.
I'm not sure I can.
He's my life.
I'm not ready to let him go.
Take a cab.
Next time, fake a seizure.
So how about some sushi? You like sushi? I know a great sushi place.
Does he ever stop?
Get a ring. He's scared of husbands.
I told you I have a boyfriend.
So what is he, a lawyer,
a commodities trader, a dentist?
He's a doctor. County?
In the Army.
Stateside, I hope.
Iraq.
CASH unit?
Tenth Combat Support.
You know, I was a medic in Desert Storm,
101st Airborne.
Airborne?
Did you fly planes?
Nope, just jumped out of them.
When's he coming home? Soon, I hope.
To prove I'm a good guy, you know what I'm going to do?
I'm gonna let you sit in front.
and I'm going to buy you coffee. With an empty wallet?
ZADRO: Paramedics and cops drink for free.
So, technically, you're not buying me anything.
Technically, it's the thought that counts.
Come on in.
( chuckles )
Sorry, sorry. I won't do it again.
My foot slipped.
I promise. Scout's honor.
What took you so long?
Buckle up.
What the hell's that?
Monoclonal antibodies to stop the rejection.
Did I not make myself clear? I don't want it.
Yeah? Well, you're getting it anyway.
And you're gonna take these, too.
I spoke to your doctors at the Mayo.
They've agreed to take you in transfer,
by helicopter. I'm not going.
This is neoral-- if you take this now,
you'll have a detectable blood level by the time you get there.
You are so wasting your time, Doc.
Yeah, so look, this is how it's gonna go.
You're gonna take these pills, get on that chopper,
and you're gonna stay on your meds for as long
as that donated heart keeps beating.
Who the hell do you think you are?
You see that woman over there?
She loves you.
And... and I have no idea why,
because personally, I find you extremely annoying.
But if you think you're helping her by killing yourself, you're wrong.
You know, you're a miserable guy.
But she seems like a great lady,
and she wants to keep you around.
So open wide, Marty.
( explosion )
( shelves rattling, glasses clinking )
Careful, it's hot. Thanks.
( explosion )
NEWSCASTER: Jet crashed and the fifty seven hundred.
Are the trauma rooms clear? And Sutures and Curtain Two.
CCU can take Jenkins.
I'll get him up next.
If they walk, they go right to the lobby, you hear me?
I've been waiting six hours with a dislocated finger!
There's a lot of critical patients... My finger's critical!
Excuse me? My finger's critical!
Let me see that.
( yells in pain )
Not anymore.
Guys, shut up. Please.
Craft struck the passenger jet at low altitude
moments after takeoff... Terrorists?
What airline was Eve on?
...the pilot lost control, eventually colliding
with the ascending jet... So much for conspiracy theory, huh?
Okay, that's it, folks.
Here we go. We're about to get clobbered.
Exam Three-- I want six monitored beds.
Hey! Damn it!
PRATT: Ray, I got two words for you:
hard restraints. We can't do that anymore.
Hey, settle down! The warrior's path is never easy.
Snow him with haldol. Where's your attending?
Battalion Chief needs another doc.
Possible field amputation.
Yeah, okay. I could go.
No. It's not a good idea. I could use the experience.
It's not a teaching drill.
Have her home by 10:00. Could you set this up in the bay?
City Fire needs a physician. With experience.
Somebody with experience would be better here.
It's a tough call, I've done my ride-alongs.
They're gonna need crikes, central access, chest tubes. And I'm good at that.
Only if supervised. I'm going. We need to roll. You got anybody?
Okay, okay, Pratt, it's you-- but get your ass back here in an hour.
GATES: Drug box, airway kit.
Triage tags. Let me see these.
Green is nothing, yellow is urgent,
red is critical, black is dead.
Oh, man.
( people coughing )
Chief Bukata!
Triage on the north side!
All right, stick with me.
One patient at a time.
Sir?
Sir?
Sir, can you hear me?
He's not breathing. There's no pulse.
Black tag and move on.
Ma'am?
Ma'am, can you open your eyes?
Flail chest, respiratory arrest.
Trauma One, then ICU. Quickly, quickly.
Shouldn't the nurses be... No, you decide who stays and who goes.
Thanks for coming.
Where do you need us?
Hypotensive pelvis, ETA two minutes.
We can triage in the Waiting Room.
What, the Waiting Room?
It's warm, the light is good, can do a better assessment.
You're not serious, are you?
That's how we do it.
This incident is like Night of the Living Dead.
You let the walking woundeds through the door, it's over Triage stays right here.
Abby, this is your pelvis. Come on.
The plane was going to Cleveland. I don't care about that.
Eve was going to St. Louis. I'll deal with it.
Who's in Two?
Altered stroke patient. Let's park him in the hallway.
Please, yes, I need you right away. Great.
'Kay, sir, we're gonna have to move you.
We're gonna have to move you folks... ( gasps )
I am so sorry about my dad.
You're not supposed to be here, Zoe.
I know, but you're so cool for not pressing charges.
It's not a good time. You get off at 8:00?
When I said we can't see each other, I really meant...
Just 'cause my dad's a jerk doesn't mean we can't keep it going.
I got my ass kicked I don't wanna go to jail.
We could keep it a secret, like Romeo and Juliet. No, you need to leave right now.
No. You can't just walk away. What, don't you have some homework to do?
I am not a child! Yes, you are.
I'm your girlfriend! No, you're not!
Yes, I am! 45-year-old, unstable pelvis.
90 palp, after a liter-- and can you check the dorsalis pedis?
But I love you, Ray! Clogged ear wax. I had to help clean her out.
Whatever. Yeah, well, I... Oh!
What are the foot pulses?
Ray?
Keep pressure while I wrap.
Saline's wide open.
Neela! What are you doing here?
Heard they needed help.
Fire's knocked down at the fuselage. Let's go, Pratt.
Woody Evans, 85, auto versus pedestrian, blunt chest.
Okay, she's not critical, move her to the yellow tarp.
How's your breathing? It's been better.
Something fell and hit the car, and the car came right at me.
'Kay, deep breath.
The driver okay?
We'll have to check on that. 95/60. Tachy 120.
Five liters by nasal prong. Got it.
You seen a dog around here?
Hold on, I'm gonna give you some oxygen here, Woody.
I was walking my dog. 'Kay, big stick in your arm.
Look over here, look over here. Over here. ( groans )
A cocker spaniel. You seen her?
Hold still.
Maybe he didn't get hit, you know?
You'd have seen her if she got hit.
Hold on, sir.
Breathe in. Hey, Riley!
We'll find the dog. Take a deep breath.
Hey, Riley!
( Pratt groans )
Oh, man!
Anything for us?
BUKATA: Not in there.
This way, Doc.
Guy in back got lucky.
Coming through!
Up here. Talk to me.
Baxter Yee, facial trauma, projectile to the right chest.
Can someone call my fiancee?
Well, the airway's good.
Strong pulse. Unbelievable. Lila...
Lila Frankfurt is her name. Line's in. Need to get him down.
Okay, we need some Xeroform on this. And she's...
she is waiting for me. Oh...
PICKMAN: Dr. Pratt!
Saw and a backboard! Let's go!
Baxter, you're one lucky guy.
Well, can you... call her cell?
I have the number.
PICKMAN: Crushing substernal chest pain, ten out of ten.
Adrian, Dr. Pratt. What about his arm?
I can't feel it. 170/95.
Yeah, blood pressure's high. So's my cholesterol.
You taking Viagra?
I look like I need Viagra?
All right, lift up your tongue for me.
( saw buzzing )
Hey, we need help with the extrication.
Stand by.
Now, just calm down, sir.
Don't worry, we're gonna get you out of here.
105/75. That's better.
( speaks foreign language ) What?
It means "thank you" in Hindi.
WOODY: Had to learn a little in '44. Army Air Force.
I flew supplies over the hump to China. ( groans )
C-46's? I've never been to India.
Hey, she was asleep when the window blew out. What's her name?
Olive. The glass cut her. ( child wailing )
My son's on the second floor.
His legs are cut and he can't walk.
They'll evacuate the apartment.
But my building's not on fire!
It's a precaution. I can get in and out real quick!
We'll get to him. Go! Stay here.
( panting )
( loud crying )
OLBES: Baxter Yee-- passenger on the commuter jet.
And he's still got vitals?
Blunt face, penetrating chest.
We've got a trauma room open.
Systolic's down to 80. All yours, Kovac.
I'm losing the pulse.
Okay, then prep for a thoracotomy. No, no, hold on.
Hold up! ( inhales )
Pressure's coming back.
The dressing converted it to a tension pneumo. Good call. Go to Trauma One.
No, I can't waste a trauma room. He fell, like, 2,000 feet.
He'll be just fine with the chest tube. Exam Three. Go.
Hey. Hey, where the hell is Pratt?
he'll be back with the next run.
Pratt's out there? Yeah, they needed a doc.
Well, you gave away our senior resident?
Not now, 'kay? I-I got a triage.
We need our doctors here, not off playing in a field.
Okay, bag 'em.
That central line okay? Good.
Hey, how's the chest pain? Down to two out of ten.
Okay, four of MS.
Bukata! We need some help, man.
As soon as we get these two out of here.
How's my arm? It's hard to say.
I guess I'm lucky-- could've been my head under there.
You still live on Dearborn?
Huh? Yeah.
I came over here to visit my girlfriend.
( panting ): I made her bougatsa--
custard in phyllo dough.
Women love a man who can cook.
PVC's on the monitor.
All right, 100 of lidocaine.
So, what, you go to chef school or something?
When I was a kid,
my mom wouldn't let us watch TV.
That's rough.
We could either cook... or read a book.
And I never did like...
PICKMAN: V tach!
( Pratt groaning )
Charge to 200. Yeah.
Charged.
Adrian.
Okay, clear.
PICKMAN: Sinus.
Good pulse.
What the hell was that?!
Hey, we can't wait anymore.
Pressure's staying up? But compare the radials.
My son's still in there!
my partner went to check. He should be out by now!
Someone will find your son.
Go ahead, help her. Pulse discrepancy. You may have injured your aorta.
WOMAN: Stop!
I need my stuff!
You're not going in! My checkbook! My jewelry!
What is this, a police state?
( screaming )
You can't do this! Get away from me!
Take her out of here.
Let me go! Get her out of here.
Let me go! You can't do this!
Come back!
Go ahead, she needs you! Ma'am!
Ma'am! Stop! You can't go in there!
Hey! Guys!
( explosions )
( screaming )
Keep moving. We've got people inside.
Dr. Rasgotra, do you read me?
Are you there?
( coughing ): Yes.
ALICE: Somebody help us!
Can anybody hear me?!
I've got guys inside the building who can help.
Hold on. Tony!
She's impaled.
Help! I have a mid-shaft femur fracture.
Get out of the building now, Neela!
Doc, talk to me.
Hold on!
My son! He's in 207!
Neela, go! Help him!
Get out!
My son! Help him!
Leave the building now!
Please help him! Hold my hand. Hold my hand.
Help him!
Doc, acknowledge.
Paramedic Gates and a woman are trapped inside the basement!
Where are you, Doc?
( over walkie-talkie ): There's a kid upstairs. I'm going to get him.
BUKATA: No, find a door. Get to a window. Give me that.
Neela, it's Greg. Turn around.
I'm almost there.
Get your ass out now!
( panting and coughing )
Hello! Hello!
BOY: I'm in here.
( grunting )
I'm over here! Hello?!
Hello?! I'm over here.
I'm over here.
Hey.
Cover your mouth with this.
( grunting )
BUKATA: Doc, come in.
Acknowledge, Doc.
Dr. Rasgotra, do you read me? Are you there?
Neela, respond. Neela!
BUKATA: Dr. Rasgotra...
Somebody in trouble? A friend from work.
The guys are all over the building. They'll get her. Here.
This all works out, I'm baking you two a cake.
I'm more of a low carb guy. All right, fellas, let's do this.
You can't just eat to live.
Come on. You gotta live to...
( yelling )
No radial pulse. No ulna.
( grunts ) Adrian, can you feel this?
Adrian?
PICKMAN: V tach again.
Charge to 200. Charged.
Clear.
No change. All right, 300.
Charging. Amp of epi.
Charged. Clear.
Still tach.
Damn it. 360. Intubation kit.
Starting compressions.
RESCUE WORKER ( over walkie-talkie ): Second floor.
We've got a female body, no vitals.
RESCUE WORKER 2 ( over walkie-talkie ): Keep looking.
( groaning )
Get up!
Get up!
Who's next for the O.R.?
Avulsed ear in Two, tib fib in Four, then him.
Haleh, thank you so much for coming in.
Glad to help. Is Eve here? No, but it's okay.
We're out of cefotetan and D.T. All right, I'll call the pharmacy.
And I'll get to work.
Is that blood?
You cracked a bone in there.
Minimal chest tube output.
Who called my fiancée?
In a minute, you can call her yourself.
We were to meet with the caterers and the DJ.
Vaseline gauze.
Tomorrow it's flowers and the pastor.
She'll be worried.
Haleh?
Sam called. Good thing, too.
Been home for two weeks and my husband was driving me crazy.
Glad you're back.
Call for a portable chest.
( gagging )
Sats are dropping.
LOCKHART: Baxter?
Baxter.
He's not breathing.
Knocked out the alveolar ridge-- fracture
teeth nine, ten and 11.
Must have aspirated the fragment.
Try a finger sweep.
Another 50 of lidocaine. Got it.
They ID the body in there?
Woman in her 80s. Still looking.
( crying ): Where's my mom?
Where is she?
Find anybody else inside?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. He's awake.
Holding compressions.
Still v-tach.
No pulse. What the hell?
Adrian. Adrian.
Can you hear me?
Your heart stopped beating. We're doing CPR. Keep going.
The compressions are getting oxygen to his brain.
We're gonna get you to the hospital, all right?
( grunting )
( coughing )
You had no business going in there. I'm sorry.
You put yourself in danger, you put my men in danger.
Can we talk about this later? We will.
Woody, you found your dog.
Probably blew out his aorta.
I was just talking to him.
ZADRO: Over here, Doc!
Large bore IV, O2 15 liters.
Take Mom and the kids together.
( coughing ): Doctor...
( labored breathing ): Thank you.
Neela!
Pressure's borderline.
( wheezing )
What's he got?
Distal neuro-circ is intact.
You can stop being the med student.
As soon as you stop being the firefighter.
( groans )
Tongue is too edematous.
Okay, bag him a few times.
I can prep his neck.
Take another look, I'll retract.
PVC's.
I'll get the crash cart.
There it is.
Got it.
( gasping )
See something new every day.
All right, settle down. Settle down.
Settle down. Okay.
15 liters by mask.
Nice work.
You did great.
Probable MI with refractory v fib.
KOVAC & CLEMENTE: Trauma One.
And an ischemic right arm.
KOVAC & CLEMENTE: Be right in.
Inez, she needs to get to the Suture Room.
Nah, she doesn't need the Suture Room.
It's a complicated lac.
Nope, not that complicated.
What, you've never seen The Zipper before?
RASGOTRA: Any chest pain?
( groans ): My belly.
Probably just broke a rib.
It's his liver. Scoop and run. Soon as we get another rig.
We don't have an ambulance? We just sent 30 patients in.
Heart rate's up to 140.
'Cause I'm in pain. Maybe.
Elevate my legs. Shock position.
I need to stick your belly.
Peritoneal aspiration?
Maybe you should numb up my... ( yells )
( groans ): Ow!
It's positive.
Splenic lac?
More likely hepatic.
Oh, I was hoping for spleen.
Do we have lap pads? Just burn dressings.
Ten of them.
Push etomidate. What are you doing?
Tony, I need to sedate you, open up your belly
and pack off your liver.
What?! You can't be serious.
Do I have your permission? Will you go out with me?
I need to do this.
If you didn't have a boyfriend. Yes or no? Yes.
I'm all yours.
Okay, bag him through this.
From the subxiphoid
through the symphysis pubis.
PRATT: Clear!
BARNETT: Still v fib.
When's the last time you saw her?
I told you, we were a block apart. Resuming compressions.
Amiodarone's on board? Five minutes ago.
You should have kept an eye on her.
Pronestyl drip? Infusing.
What, you could have done better?
I wouldn't have let her go inI wouldn't have left her there.
Guys.
You're doing okay, Adrian.
Hey, take a break.
I got it. Greg. Go.
Adrian, we're doing what we can, okay?
TAGGART: Here.
All you do is point, okay?
Okay, we're using all the medication we can to fix your heart.
Sometimes it takes a while.
Anything else?
TAGGART: You want your family?
We called them. They're on their way.
15-foot fall! I packed off the liver!
Whoa, whoa, in the field?
Damn, girl.
He was about to arrest.
Pressure's up at 100 systolic.
Was he awake when you opened him up? I had etomidate.
It's always the quiet ones, isn't it? Always the quiet ones.
I'll take him up to the O.R. You let Dubenko finish.
You got big huevos, Neela. They look good on you!
I had no idea what else to do. Need to put you on a pulse ox.
Yeah, you sound terrific. No, I'm okay.
Singed nasal hairs-- that indicates substantial smoke inhalation.
I just need to wash off a bit?
I would hate for you to stop breathing.
I'd hate that, too. Neela, come on.
Can I at least pee first? I'll get you a bedpan.
( coughing )
94 on room air. That's not great.
And there are some expiratory wheezes.
Those will pass. Or get worse.
I'm a little bit worried here.
( breathing heavily )
Hello?
I'm sorry.
I was just...
Today was so... terrifying.
And amazing.
There was no labs, no X rays, no rapid infusers
or cutdown trays-- just me.
Maybe it's the adrenaline, but...
I feel high.
I need to go back out.
Sounds like I should call for a psych consult.
( inhales deeply )
There are still patients out there.
Yes, and they're being handled.
INEZ: Excuse me, Abby.
Dubenko called from the O.R.
Alice Watson died on the table.
Okay, thanks.
Patient of yours?
Impaled abdomen.
From the crash?
Where are her kids?
Exam Two.
( breathing heavily )
( groaning )
You need to be monitored.
Hi.
KOVAC: Hey, Abby.
How's he doing?
Um, lung is up after two chest tubes.
We're going up to ICU.
So I stopped breathing?
Uh, it was more like holding your breath.
But I could've died?
Theoretically, yeah.
I think you were in more danger on the plane.
Oh, I cheated death twice today.
You're lucky.
I guess I should feel bad,
or guilty or something.
But truth is, I feel...
( voice breaking ): happy.
I have a second chance.
I'm calling off the wedding.
Oh, uh, you might want to sleep on that.
No, I have been sleeping my whole life.
I never do what I want to do, I never say how I really feel.
I'm not in love with her.
Maybe you two should talk about that.
Screw that!
Screw it.
No more messing with could've, should've, would've.
Carpe diem!
All right, well... good luck with that.
Besides, I'm pretty sure I'm... I'm gay.
PRATT: Getting tired?
RAY: No.
TAGGART: Dr. Pratt, this is Adrian's girlfriend,
his brother and his uncle.
I explained everything.
I'm sorry. We gave him every kind of medication possible.
Nothing's working right now.
He's awake. You can talk to him, if you want.
You hang on.
Everyone's coming.
Pratt, check it out.
Well, I guess she's okay, then.
Yeah.
Ah, it's alive.
They shut down the Dan Ryan. It took two hours to get here.
Where do you need me? How about Peoria?
Uh, how did we do?
Still here.
No ICU boarders? None.
Hmm, and we're reopen for Trauma? Yup.
Hey, call housekeeping for T-One, pharmacy's here to re-stock.
KOBAYASHI: Excuse me.
Could someone please remove these?
Go for it.
Sir, why are you restrained?
I have no idea.
Hey, Sam.
Uh... More Sianis family members.
I'll be right there.
Sam, what is Haleh doing here?
Uh, Exam Two's going
up to Four-West. I can help Pratt
with the trauma. Did you bring her back?
Yeah. Listen, Haleh is one of the best nurses in town.
We're getting our asses handed to us. I did whatever I thought I could.
Good move.
( coughing )
You need a chest X ray. I told you I'm fine.
Tell the kids I'll check on them in the morning. Oh, Neela! Come on.
Please? I've been on for 16 hours.
What if your lungs get worse? I'll call 911.
Just stay at the hospital. Sleep in the call room.
I need to be at home tonight That's not be safe.
If I start to die, you'll be the first one I'll call.
I'll come and stay at your place.
It's not necessary. Oh.
Okay, is there anything, anything I can say to get you to stay?
No.
I slept with Luka.
Yeah, nice try.
I can bag.
So how's this gonna go if you stop?
There'll be a lack of oxygen to the brain.
He'll pass out like going to sleep.
Is he gonna be in pain?
He's had a sedative, he'll be comfortable.
And you've done everything?
Yes, we have.
What, you want us to stop?
Are you ready?
No.
( woman crying )
( wailing ): No...
( moaning sobs )
9:42 p.m.
WOMAN ( sobbing ): No...
I'm sorry.
No!
( sighs )
He was a lucky guy.
He's dead.
A lot of people loved him.
They all got a chance to say good-bye.
( sighs heavily )
All right, you gotta stop calling me.
No, 'cause-'cause we're done. We've been done.
No... no... no, 'cause you, you're not listening to me.
You're not... Let me, let me say it to you
really nice and slow for the last time.
I... don't... love you.
Go back to your husband.
Hey, Dr. Kovac.
You know, you and I should have a little sit-down.
Yeah, probably.
No, I think like definitely.
Look, we're both captains on this team here, right?
And if we break down, the whole machine breaks down we can't have that, on days like today.
I agree.
Well, 'cause, see, I thought I was the incident commander.
You know what, let's talk tomorrow, okay?
Yeah, tomorrow's great.
I'll be here all day,
8:00 to 8:00.
Hey.
Hi.
Rough night.
Yeah, I'm glad it's over.
Yeah, me, too.
Ah, did Baxter get upstairs okay?
Oh, he's fine. Not so sure about his fiancée, though.
( soft chuckle )
Hey, I was thinking... Listen, I was thinking of...
Sorry. No, you go ahead.
No. Go ahead.
Well...
( chuckling ): Okay.
No, I was just thinking about, uh...
uh... I was thinking... about what happened last night.
It was nice.
Nice?
Yeah.
Wasn't it?
No... yeah, of course.
But... What?
I don't know.
I don't know. What do we do now?
Not sure. Um...
For a long time, even when we weren't connecting a lot,
you... you've been one person I can count on.
I feel like that, too.
That means a lot to me, that friendship.
Me, too.
So?
Maybe we should just leave it at that, then.
( inhales deeply )
I don't know. I don't want to lose that, you know,
but if that's what you, um... that's what... what's the best...
So what we're just saying is that we'll just stay friends, then?
Need a lift?
No. I have, um, some stuff I need to finish inside.
Oh.
Okay. Good night.
See you.
