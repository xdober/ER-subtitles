Previously on ER.
SAM: Got a letter from your dad.
Steve was saying that he's got some new job in Colorado.
KOVAC: Sam, you've got to tell Alex the truth.
Alex!
It's all going to be okay.
He's 12.
MAN: When was the last time you saw him?
Around 8:30.
So four and a half hours ago?
Friends, relatives, anyone he might be with?
We've been calling and driving around.
There's nothing.
Any fights, school problems?
We had an argument.
I went upstairs to take a shower and get ready for bed.
And about an hour later,
Visa called for an authorization on my card.
He went to the bus station and tried to buy a ticket.
A ticket to where?
Colorado.
Why Colorado?
His dad is there.
What about his home situation?
Is it stable? Drugs? Violence?
Alex has a good home.
What about dad? Did you tell him Alex maybe on his way or call him?
He's not easy to get a hold of.
Why's that?
He's in prison.
SAM: Alex doesn't know that
his dad's in jail.
He's been asking me if he can go live with him.
I'm sorry, shouldn't we be calling Amtrak or the airlines?
No. They won't board a minor without parental consent.
You got a recent photo?
MAN: This happens all the time.
Nine times out of ten, they're back in 24 hours or less.
Alex doesn't have 24 hours. He's diabetic.
He could be in a coma by this time tomorrow,
if he doesn't get his insulin.
KOVAC: Sam.
We've gotta go by Shelley's. Sam.
Union Station and the park... Sam, the car...
He likes Navy Pier. Maybe he went over there.
And then we'll circle back to the school
and uh, the, the, the.... the arcade...
We should be at home when he calls.
We'll check out Denny's and McDonald's.
Open the door open... Sam, he's not...
Please, open the door!
Sam, when he calls,
he'll call home.
They said we should be there.
He knows how to monitor his carbs, stay hydrated...
He's too smart.
He's stubborn and resourceful and smart.
He's not coming back.
( sobbing )
Oh... the day shift.
( loud kiss )
There is a God.
Ew. Hard night?
Okay, everybody's here? Good.
It's 8:02, time for rounds.
Curtain number one.
Wait. Ray, you're on.
What?
You're an R-2 now. R-2s run the board.
Uh, okay.
Well, uh, okay, curtain one.
Foreign body in the eye.
Sanding his boat without any eye gear.
Shard of glass under the lid.
Corneal abrasion?
Didn't get a chance to check.
Okay. Jane, he's yours.
Fluorescein, slit lamp, exam, and home.
In curtain three we have an altered 19-year-old.
Drank a gallon of antifreeze.
Responding to fomepizole, waiting on psych and ICU bed.
Great, moving on.
Whoa. This is a good teaching case.
Yeah. Take a minute and tell us all about fomepizole.
Uh, well, it's pretty new.
Yeah, what does it do?
Lowers the ethylene glycol level?
Tell them how.
Increases renal excretion.
LEWIS: Anyone else?
Does it inhibit alcohol dehydrogenase?
I think it might prevent formation of acidic metabolites.
Get it in early, you'll avoid dialysis.
I'm gonna read about this and make a hand-out for you.
No, R2's have to read before rounds start.
How? I just got here. Then get here early.
Teaching should be spontaneous, off the cuff.
WOMAN: Excuse me. Is there somewhere
I can breast feed? Been here three hours. Kid needs to eat.
Oh, yeah, yeah. There's a, uh, family room down the hall.
Mom, I'm starving.
MORRIS: All the way on your left.
How old is that kid?
He's got to be six.
That is a little freaky.
KOVAC: Sam? Hey...
( gasps ): What? It's okay.
Did they call?
No, just his picture on the TV.
How long was I asleep for?
About an hour.
All right, we got to start calling everybody again.
You already called everybody.
They're going to call us if some...
Hi, Debbie.
Yeah.
No.
No, huh?
Okay, yeah, yeah, of course.
As soon as I hear anything.
Hi, yes, this is Luka Kovac, again.
( phone ringing )
Hello.
LEWIS: What is it?
Altered traffic collision.
GCS eight, systolic 100. Let's bag her.
What's your plan, Ray?
All right, intubation, FAST exam and a head CT.
Okay, I'll be in curtain two.
Dr. Lewis...
Call me if you need me.
I guess she trusts you.
Uh, yeah.
20 of etomidate, 100 of sux,
portable c-spine and chest to follow.
Let's get that Sonosite ready. Come here.
You mind if I intubate?
You might want to observe one, first.
Why do you use Etomidate?
You need a sedative with the paralytic.
I know, but isn't it true that Ketamine causes
less respiratory depression?
Uh, maybe.
Well, does it have a more favorable hemodynamic profile?
I mean, if you're concerned about intra-abdominal hemorrhaging,
then it seems like you would definitely want to...
we use Etomidate because it's a good drug.
Okay, let me take a look.
Sat's up to 92.
All right. Now pull the handle at 45 degrees
and never rock back against the teeth.
Shouldn't you give a de-fasciculating dose of Pavulon?
Uh, sometimes we do.
Is sux okay in crush injuries?
Uh-huh. Cricoid pressure.
What about hyperkalemia?
Look, this is never going to happen.
Okay, the 8-0, it won't pull through.
All right, we need a smaller tube. Bag her.
Is sux okay in burn patients?
Look, more observation, and less conversation.
We tube her and then we chat.
Okay? Okay.
Seven and a half.
Okay, thank you.
Sergeant Parker wont tell us what this is about on the phone.
We haven't found your son yet.
12,000 fliers went out--
precincts, hospitals, state police.
We notified the folks in Colorado
and we're getting some play on local television.
Please, have a seat.
We canvassed the airline ticket counters, Union Station, buses,
nobody recognized your son.
Hey, thanks for coming back down.
Still nothing from Alex?
No, you know, I'm sorry, I don't understand
why you couldn't have over the phone.
Why did you want us to come down here?
We got a report
of an unidentified diabetic kid in a coma.
It matches your son's general description.
Where is he?
In all likelihood, it's not him.
We're waiting for them to fax a photo,
but, uh,
they're still working on him at the hospital.
Where is he?
Iowa, Davenport, Iowa.
It's 200 miles. I'll drive.
They'll figure out if it's him before we can get there.
If it's him, we'll be that much closer.
If it's not, we'll be that much further.
I can't just sit waiting for a call that they found Alex
in a ditch or a Dumpster!
I can't, okay? I can't.
Tell Dubenko the second hemocue was 12.1.
Going to the O.R.?
Yeah, FAST was positive, needs an ex-lap.
How did it go, Haleh?
It was a little rough.
Do you want to give Dr. Barnett some feedback?
There wasn't much teaching.
You seemed distracted by questions from the interns.
Well, they wouldn't shut up. Ray.
His frustration prevented the team from working together.
There was a lot of tension.
It could have caused a delay in diagnosing the splenic lac.
Oh, please.
Thank you, Haleh.
Thank you. Thanks. What was that about?
Improving your skills, making you a better teacher, a better leader.
And since when do nurses evaluate the residents?
Haleh has been here long. She knows.
I needed to treat this patient.
You also need to create a positive learning climate.
Are you torturing all the R-2s or is it just me?
Ray, resolving TIA.
Go.
We must have missed it.
Well, they said it's over a mile from the Interstate...
We've only gone... Ah, that's it.
Hello? Anybody here?
Excuse me?
There's a button.
Over there.
( bell ringing )
WOMAN: Hold your horses,
I'm coming.
You have a boy in DKA?
Security guard found him
down behind Penney's at the mall.
Didn't have any ID.
His blood sugar was 764, PH 7.10,
GCS eight, ketones were positive at 1 to 64.
He's on I.V. saline, insulin and potassium.
He just started opening his eyes on command. You just missed Dr. Hahn.
He went home to get his digital camera
so that we could send a picture to the police in Chicago.
KOVAC: No, it wasn't him.
Right. Thanks.
Anything?
No, not yet.
( screaming )
Damn it, Alex!
Erica's fine to stay at the apartment
until we get back.
He's not coming home, Luka.
The keys?
Where we going?
Colorado.
No infiltrate.
Like I said, fever without source.
Everything okay?
Well, he doesn't have pneumonia.
Urine? All clear.
Rapid strep?
No clinical indication.
Okay.
Mason, can you open up your mouth for me?
I don't like that.
Come on. You're a big boy.
I already did it.
Okay, real quick-- ah?
Ah.
A little bigger.
Ah.
Any rash?
No. No.
He looks good.
Can you remove his pajamas for me?
Dr. Babinski had him in a gown.
I don't want to take off my clothes again.
I'm sorry, but it's important, okay?
You said we can go home.
I want to go home! Mason...
I want to go home now!
Mason, come on. Ray?
Two seconds.
Excuse me. I'll be right back.
No! One more time.
No!
Come on, Mason. One more time.
How's it going in there?
Uh, just looking for a fever source.
Babinski said there wasn't one.
You know how it is with interns. You got to check up on them.
But not for 20 minutes.
Ray, the interns are doctors. You have to trust their skills.
They were students last week. They don't know what they're doing.
You're micromanaging every case. It's bad for patient flow.
Yeah, we were caught up.
Now we've got six and 20 in the rack.
And that's my fault?
I liked you better when you were the closer.
Still no service.
We're about 30 miles from Omaha,
so we'll probably get service soon.
Where in Colorado?
Huh?
Where is Steve?
Uh, Canon City.
Where's that?
In the mountains somewhere, I think.
I've never been.
What?
Colorado.
I always wanted to go.
I heard it's beautiful.
Yeah.
What were you and Alex fighting about
last night?
The usual.
Me?
Us.
( sighs )
I should have just told him the truth.
He knew we were having trouble.
No, the truth about his father.
So after the attending leaves you high and dry in trauma,
you're going to be critiqued by a nurse. That's weird.
Even if the patient's crashing, make nice with the newbies, or be dinged.
Ray, can I give another four of morphine to McKenzie?
Do you think he needs it?
No, I just want him to stop breathing.
Fine. You're responsible for every little thing the intern does.
But you question the history, and they get all testy on you.
Sounds like you had a great day. Yeah.
You ready, Neela? Tonight's all about you and me.
And me. Teddy Marsh, new intern.
Hello.
My first shift-- an overnight, awesome.
This is Neela. She's the R-2. She's in charge.
You're mission: clear that board by morning.
I'm screwed.
Antifreeze overdose has been here all night waiting on the ICU.
Step it up. The day shift wants to get out of here.
Just remember, fomepizole's an alcohol dehydrogenase inhibitor
and you'll be fine. What?
Neela, you're running rounds, so let's start.
It's about nine hours to Denver.
Think we'll make it by dawn.
You should sleep. I'll drive.
No, I'm okay. No, I'm awake.
Not sure I'll be in the next four hours.
Shoot. My cell phone battery is almost dead.
I should have brought my charger.
( sighs )
Hey, Luka.
Thank you.
NEELA: The calculated osmolality is approximated
by multiplying the sodium concentration by two
and adding glucose divided by 18 and the BUN over 2.8.
Anyone have the numbers handy?
That's okay, we'll make some up.
Let's say his measured osms are 300...
What's this have to do with a fractured rib?
Absolutely nothing.
I have a date.
Go, we could be here all night.
Thank you.
NEELA: ...divided by 2.8.
20 minutes and we're only on our second patient.
Neela, try to stay focused
on the clinically relevant teaching points.
This is clinically relevant. There's an osmolar gap.
The interns need to know meanings.
Not right now.
Stab wound! Need some help here.
Neela, take it with Marsh.
Pratt and Morris, finish running the board.
Ready?
My first trauma as a doc. All right.
Single stab to the right chest. Agonal resps, sats 84 on 15 liters.
All right, trauma one, let's go.
Now enter the thoracic cavity through the intercostal.
Okay, I felt a pop.
Okay, insert finger.
Feel lung tissue, pass the tube on a curved clamp.
Pretty cool.
My first night, my first chest tube.
The key is to avoid the neurovascular bundle
at the inferior margin of the rib.
The tube won't pass.
All right, let me try.
I can't find the tract.
Sometimes you need to check again with a finger.
There is no tract. Did you enter the thoracic cavity?
I thought I did.
Did you feel lung tissue?
It was warm and soft.
Lung tissue expands and contracts with ventilation.
Right.
Now we're into the pleura.
I'm sorry. I thought I was in.
I'll do better next time. How you doing?
Finishing up a chest tube. Start a central line?
I've got a cue ball vs. cheek to sew up.
A trauma patient takes priority.
O-silk? Pulse is 98,
BP is stable. What's the big deal? My guy needs
a three-layer closure on a complex stellate facial lac.
That could take two hours. Yeah.
Let Plastics do it. Someone needs check the board.
I already told the nurses
to send labs and X rays on everyone.
Morris! You've got everything under control.
Is that a vertical mattress?
No, it's horizontal!
What are you doing?
Bugs. It's difficult to see.
( sighs )
Where are we?
We passed Grand Island about an hour ago.
We should get to a phone and call Chicago.
Okay.
What time is it?
1:30.
I was dreaming about Alex.
He was two or three.
And I needed a bathing suit,
so I was looking through the racks at some department store.
When I looked back, Alex was gone.
He just vanished.
I guess you don't have to be Freud
to figure that one out.
I lost my son at the ocean.
Daniella didn't want me to take him,
but I insisted. I was mad that she didn't trust me.
So, uh... we had a big fight and she let us go.
What happened?
It was a very hot day,
so everyone had come to the beach.
They have beaches in Croatia?
Beautiful beaches, miles of them.
Anyway, so, uh, we found about an inch of sand
that wasn't already taken and, uh,
we went down to the water.
He wanted to build a sand castle,
so I went back up to pick up his little shovel and bucket.
And when I came back he was gone.
I looked everywhere.
Ran up and down the beach,
the shops by the road, into the water,
couldn't find him.
How long was he missing?
Two hours.
( sighs )
Where was he?
Some boy had a dog.
The police found him wandering.
He knew his name so they called our house
and Daniella answered.
When I got home, he was sitting in a bathtub with his sister
having a wonderful time.
I went to the kitchen and I cried by the sink
with the water running.
Mm.
What was his name?
Marco.
Alex is going to be all right, Sam.
We're going to find him and he's going to be all right.
It's 3:00 a.m.
Shouldn't this be slowing down by now?
You've got a dark cloud, Neela.
Always have.
12 more out there triaging as we speak.
Neurosurg's coming to see the subdural, he'll need a unit bed.
I'm going to lay down for a couple hours?
We've got three intubated patients and a full board.
You are more than capable of managing whatever comes in.
That's the fun of being the big R-2. You get to be queen of the night shift.
I don't wanna be the queen. I wanna get the board cleared before the day shift.
Give me a copy of your schedule? Gonna avoid nights you're on.
You going to bed leaving me with this mess?
You have him. You busy?
Want to present my guy in three.
Wake me only if it's really, really important.
He's going to bed?
Yep, it's you and me against the world.
Chuny had me correct your fentanyl order.
It's "micrograms," not "milligrams."
Oh, God.
That could've led to a serious mistake.
Caught in time. No harm.
I am so sorry. Thanks for fixing it.
It's okay. Got to learn somehow.
What do you got? 37-year-old
with a deltoid abscess. Never done an I and D,
thought you might want to supervise. Any other history?
Chronic I.V. drug use, that's about it.
Physical?
Four-by-five fluctuant lesion
on the lateral aspect of the upper arm.
The remainder of the exam was entirely normal.
Hey, Doc, you ready to slice open this bad boy?
This is Dr. Rasgotra, she's my supervisor.
I just want to take a quick listen.
It's so satisfying when you guys cut it open
and all that pus comes pouring out.
Shh. Ten blade,
saline, swabs, packing gauze,
anything else?
Mister... Uh, Kingsley.
We'll be back in a minute, okay?
Did you listen to his heart?
Of course I did.
So when you said his exam was entirely normal,
were you just forgetting to mention his murmur?
He has a murmur?
Four over six at the left sternal border. Has a thrill, not subtle.
Wow, big miss. I'll listen again.
You can't miss a murmur in an I.V. drug user. Could be endocarditis.
He needs an echo and antibiotics before the I and D.
I heard you were smart,
but I had no idea you were such an awesome teacher.
Thanks for saving my ass.
( screaming )
What was that?
I don't know.
( door beeping )
( panting )
Oh, God.
( panting )
Wait here.
What is it?
A deer, I think.
Is it dead?
No, I... ( motor revving )
I don't think so.
What do we do?
I don't know.
MAN: You folks need help?
I didn't, uh, I didn't... I didn't see it.
Antelope.
Did a real number to your car.
You both all right?
Yeah.
I got a rifle in the truck.
Sam?
We got to keep going.
Sam, the car's wrecked.
The radiator is leaking.
( door beeping )
The windshield is shattered.
You won't be able to see.
Come on.
Come on! God!
( gunshot )
( gun cocks )
Our syphilis guy's had over 50 partners
in the last 90 days. Wants to know if they can come here for treatment.
As long as they wait until sunrise. Pen G, 2.4 million units, IM.
Neela! Your COPD'er isn't looking so good.
Sats dropped to 87 on room air.
( pants ): I can hardly catch my breath.
He was fine when I saw him, wasn't even wheezing.
You can't wheeze if you're not moving air.
We're gonna give you some medicine to help.
Albuterol, five migs with 500 of atrovent.
Sure that's a good idea? His theophylline's 53, and he's throwing PVC's.
What?
You didn't bother mentioning a toxic theophylline level?
I didn't know. I hadn't checked.
I didn't think we'd have the level back until tomorrow.
CANBERRA: My breathing's been bad.
I took some extra pills.
100 of lidocaine and move him to trauma. And hold off on the Albuterol
until we stabilize his arrhythmia.
You got it.
We'll be right back, Mr. Canberra.
You were great in there. You really took control.
Teddy, listen.
I'm sorry about the theophylline thing.
I'll have to thank Chuny for... Just listen, okay?
You want to know a secret?
You don't have to be that smart to be a good doctor.
You just have to be thorough, systematic and meticulous.
I'm trying.
Not hard enough. You've missed glaring physical findings,
overlooked critical labs,
and I've been correcting your med orders all night.
It's my first shift.
I realize that,
but you're responsible for real people here,
and I can't watch your every move.
I know that.
And I want to thank you.
And your attitude...
It's just so...
contrite and appreciative.
It's just weird.
I...
I guess I just don't get it.
Wait.
I'm going to get some coffee. Need anything?
Teddy, wait!
We'll do a head-to-toe H and P together.
It might help identify where some of your deficiencies are.
Bollocks.
They're gonna send a truck to tow the car in.
Did you call Chicago?
The guy inside gets off at 7:00.
Offered us a ride back to North Platte.
From there we can catch a bus to Denver, or maybe rent a car.
North Platte's an hour east?
What are you doing?
( sighs )
Sam!
Sam!
( truck approaching )
Sam!
What are you doing? What does it look like I'm doing?
You're going to hitchhike?
He's been off his insulin for two days, Luka!
He's out there dying.
Hey!
How'd it go? Not well.
Will you take a look at this board?
Not even 8:00, and the day sucks. Good morning, Pratt.
Neela, you should have called me.
Hate leaving a mess for the day shift.
Most of them are waiting down here for beds.
This is ridiculous. Antifreeze overdose has been here
since yesterday morning.
Case in point.
What have you been doing?
Taking a bubble bath and eating bonbons.
Lewis is going to make you run the board. I know.
Just remember that fomepizole's
an alcohol dehydrogenase inhibitor.
( snaps ): Hey, come on, come on. Present this thing already.
Okay.
Let's get the night shift home.
You are...? Lana Clemons, new intern.
You've met Dr. Sackowitz.
Pratt's the senior and Dr. Lewis is our attending.
Neela, where's your intern?
Sent him home a bit early.
Okay, day shift, let's go. Curtain number one.
22-year-old with myelomenigocoele.
What is that? Spina bifida?
Excellent. The most common congenital neurologic deficit,
compatible with life. How does it happen?
SACKOWITZ: Neural tube doesn't close in utero.
Most likely due to an interaction of genetic
and environmental factors.
Ladies, remember to take your folate.
Okay, on to why the patient is here.
Rule out shunt obstruction-- common ER complaint--
what's your approach? Shunt series?
Before that? Tap the reservoir.
Guys...
before you do anything?
Take a history.
Classic symptoms
of shunt obstruction:
headache, nausea,
vomiting, lethargy.
I'm like a bad trailer park version of myself.
What are you doing here, Luka?
Sam, I care about Alex.
But you can't replace his father.
I know that.
Just not ready for this to be all there is in my life.
I can't bring your kids back.
I have a child of my own,
and if it's a choice between you and Alex,
I am always going to choose Alex.
I'm not asking you to choose.
Of course you are.
I don't want what happened to my family
to be the end of my story.
I was a good father. I can be a good father again.
What if it's not what I want?
Why...
Why don't you want to have children with me?
It's not about you.
I don't want to have any more kids.
I'm done.
I want my life back.
Oh, they can stop the run, but the secondary's kind of suspect,
champ or no champ.
I tell you what, they make the playoffs again,
Colts'll eat them up. My brother and I
got tickets in a couple of weeks.
Raiders. ( chuckles )
Should be able to beat up on those jokers.
What's this idiot doing?
You want to ticket him?
Hang on, I'll be right back.
What do you got?
Alex Taggart?
Hey, Alex? Are you Alex Taggart?
( gasping )
I'm Samantha Taggart.
Dr. Collins.
How is he?
He was lethargic when they brought him in here.
Glucose was 375.
That's not too critical.
After a little insulin and saline, he's doing much better.
( sniffles )
Can you give us a minute, please?
Damn it, Alex.
I'm okay. I drank lots of water.
You were lucky.
I know how to monitor my sugar.
You're 12 years old and diabetic.
What the hell are you thinking?
I couldn't find him.
What?
Dad.
I looked in the phone books.
I called information, a bunch of different rafting companies.
He's not here.
Come here.
ABBY: How we doing?
We're losing the battle and we're knee-deep in triage.
Well, I'm going as fast as I can.
Yeah, more than I can say for your interns.
Well, say no more.
Dr. Sackowitz. Four-centimeter scalp lac.
After copious irrigation,
I'm using a 4-0 nylon interrupted.
The wound's edges are evert...
Abby? Cosmetic repair is not an issue with the scalp.
I've never used a skin stapler.
You'll will next time. Just point and shoot.
grab another two patients. Dr. Lockhart,
there's a guy with abdominal pain in a lot of distress.
I sent off a CBC, Chem 20, uh,
I ordered an abdominal series and a surgical consult. Hello.
George, how are you feeling?
I can't get comfortable.
Okay, tell me...
does it feel worse when I do this? ( shrieks )
Okay. ( groans )
All right, you have a kidney stone.
How'd you know that? I... just do.
Four plus blood.
30 I.V. toradol, and ten of MS.
Get a CT urogram and cancel all the other orders. Got it.
Ten minutes, you'll be feeling no pain. Thank you.
Should I wait and see if the analgesics take effect?
No, you should pick up another chart.
Are you sure?
'Cause you don't have to.
I'm sorry, Alex.
I wish that this wasn't your life.
I can't tell you how much I wish that.
It's okay, Mom.
I want to go.
Here?
Here?
How about here?
Ah!
Three cc's, one percent lidocaine.
Lidocaine?
You have a knot in your muscle,
which this shot should help.
( gasps ): Ah! Okay.
All right... I'll be right back.
Okay.
Uh, right lower quadrant tenderness, low-grade fever,
no white count, anorexia or rebound.
Can you stand up for me?
Is it appendicitis?
I'll tell you in a minute.
Okay.
Can you do this?
Yeah. Let's see.
Can you do it again?
( laughs )
Okay, excellent. It's not an appy.
Clear liquids, recheck in the a.m.
How's your headache? Completely gone.
Thank you, Doctor.
I'm about to clear the rack. Oh, yeah?
If I saw all the patients myself, we wouldn't get behind.
Bet you're feeling pretty good about that. Mm-hmm.
I can't believe it took me so long to figure it out. You haven't.
What?
You didn't show Sackowitz how to staple.
You didn't teach Clemons about your approach to kidney stones.
You did a trigger point, a jump test, and ignored your interns.
They were moving slow you told me to step it up.
But your job isn't to just move the meat, Abby, you're a resident now.
Um, the lady in exam three spiked to 104.
Guess I better go.
Nice job on the board, Abby.
What's the matter with her? She's a new R2.
It's gonna be a long year. She'll catch on.
But she's not supervising, she's not teaching,
and she's doing everything herself.
You know, that reminds me of someone I used to know.
How is he?
Full of crap, like always.
I meant Alex.
He's okay.
He wants to spend some time alone with his dad, so...
It's only ten more minutes of visiting hours.
So... I figure Steve can't screw him up that bad in ten minutes.
God knows, I'm sure he'll try.
Alex is a good kid, he'll figure it out.
Damn it, that bastard.
He couldn't care less about us.
But that little boy loves him anyway.
What the hell is right about that?
Thank you.
For what?
Coming.
( sighs )
Now what?
Home, I guess. I don't...
Luka, you cannot possibly want this for your life.
Want what?
This. This mess.
Isn't that something I get to decide for myself?
No.
If it were just me...
maybe.
I better go in and check on him.
Steve's in prison.
You don't have to run anymore.
I'm not running.
I just don't want what you want.
( sighs )
