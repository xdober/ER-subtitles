Previously on E.R.:
Oh, uh, Dr. Kovack, I'm Eve Payton.
Our new nurse manager.
It's "Kovach."
Then maybe you can educate the nurses
about inferior alveolar dental blocks.
What?
Is there some sort of history between you
and Dr. Kovac?
I don't think it's appropriate
for the two of you to work together.
That's two less than I'm already doing,
which I can't afford, and I'll never see my kid.
1,000, 2,000, 3,000, 4,000.
What are you doing?
Counting.
6,000... Yes, that part I get.
The time between the lightning flash and the thunderclap
tells you how far away the storm is.
( thunder cracks )
Getting closer.
Oh, that's great.
You going outside?
Yep, drew the short straw for the coffee run.
Whoa, where do you think you're going?
We're getting slammed here.
I'm not on for six minutes.
I'm going out for coffee for everyone before my shift.
Then be a Flower Drum Song-- and grab me a bear claw.
I'll settle up with you later.
Hi, I'm Dr. Morris,
Chief Resident.
What brings you here today?
Some guy rear-ended me.
Ooh, ouch.
I hope you were driving.
We're getting a little backed up here, Dr. Morris.
Perhaps we could clear some of these necks clinically.
We? I think it's best if we left that decision to the doctors.
Well, if patients meet all five of the nexus criteria...
And what do you know about nexus?
As research coordinator at Emery,
I enrolled 2,000 patients in the initial study.
That's really interesting, Eve.
Maybe you can bring it up at your next Nazi nurse rally.
You know, Dr. Morris, my knowledge of the human anatomy
is so extensive, I could kill you with this finger.
Somehow I find that hard to...
Ow!
Whoa.
I saved your life, boss.
I've been telling them all morning
to keep these floors mopped.
Maybe it's time I fired some janitorial staff.
Maybe it's time you cleared some patients.
I'm glad you're back in the trenches with us, boss.
Yeah, that makes one of us. What is the problem here?
Oh, we've had like 20 paramedic runs...
Every E.D. in the city is closed to saturation,
which means we're all open.
Fender-benders are clogging up the hallways.
I'm not sure they all need a C-spine film.
Of course not.
Get with it, Morris.
Half these patients don't even need X rays.
Start clearing necks.
PAYTON: Alright, so they've called radiology.
They're going to send us a tech.
What the hell's your problem?
You can't wait for a little break...
Crazy bitch! It's a crosswalk, you asshole!
Diverticulitis grandma is being admitted to Medicine.
My mandible fracture is going to the OR with OMF
and Mr. McKay goes home with rest and ibuprofen.
And on that note, I'm out of here
with no pass-ons, thank you very much.
I thought you were going to help Neela clear some X-rays.
I did. Now I'm going home.
Doc Rock is going to help you out.
Sorry, dude, I'm not working down here today.
I start my Toxicology elective.
Yeah, I picked neurology, I didn't even get an elective.
That's because you still need to complete
your pre-hospital care training requirements. My what?
Your ride-alongs.
You never did them as an intern.
And you have 24 hours in the field with the paramedics.
Well, yeah, I've been meaning to do that.
Well, come see me when you do,
and then we'll discuss your elective options.
Where'd you go for coffee, Milwaukee?
The doughnuts are soggy.
God forbid you don't get your morning ration
of deep-fried fat, Frank.
Maybe I can dry them in the microwave.
You okay?
Yeah.
Nothing a week in the Bahamas wouldn't cure.
What about you?
Eve stuck me on nights.
Now I get less sleep, less money and I barely see Alex.
I have to have a baby-sitter spend the night with him.
What is it about rain
that turns the residents of this city into idiots?
Tell me about it.
Haleh, what are you doing here?
Connie's sick, asked me to cover for her.
I thought I warned you about your overtime.
I wasn't planning to be here.
I'm just trying to help her out.
Well, you should have told her to call someone else.
So what, you want me
to turn around and go back home?
Unless you want another letter in your file.
Have a great day.
Sam, can you cover for me until I find someone else?
Sam?
Why not? I'm not going to be home on time
to see my kid off to school anyway.
Who's this?
Blaire Collins, 29.
Sent in from Lake Shore Gardens for infection around her G-tube.
Does this hurt, Blaire?
Ma'am?
MAN: She's in a coma.
Since when?
Six years.
No, come on. No way. No way, guys.
We don't have the room.
She doesn't need to be here.
They can give her IV antibiotics
and the doctor at the nursing facility can change her G-tube.
So what are we supposed to do?
I just told you. Take her back.
We don't get paid for round trips,
and we got another run.
Hey, guys... Hey!
What's wrong?
Nursing home dump.
What else is new?
Come on, I think Trauma Two's open.
Uh, Sam, check the lobby.
We could use another nurse in triage.
You've got to be kidding me.
Don't worry about it.
No, this is ridiculous.
Hey... Kerry,
are you going to do something about this? About what?
I mean the way she's managing the staff.
If it's a nursing issue, it's Eve's rice bowl.
You two work it out.
MAN: Morning rounds are at 10:00 a.m.
10:00, 10:00 is good.
We discuss our toxicology consultations
from the entire county.
You will carry the pager every third day
and research conference is Thursday afternoons.
( rattling )
Wow, check it out.
Is it poisonous?
Venomous? Yes.
I'm studying neurotoxic factors in crotalid venom.
Oh, cool.
Cool.
Please, don't do that.
Your main focus will be our Poison Control Center.
Calls come in from both the public
and other health care facilities.
You'll have online access
to an international PoisIndex database
and we are here to back you up.
You're number two.
WOMAN: Judy Anderson, 31!
Head-on collision; auto versus cinder block wall.
My baby, Grace, where is she? She's coming soon, ma'am.
Any belly pain, Judy?
It hurts when I breathe.
Driver with chest pain, good vitals.
Any victims in the second vehicle?
Only one car.
They forced me off the road!
Who?
They were driving like maniacs.
They hurt my daughter. Where is she?
The baby is with Rescue 73.
I'll take this one so you can take the baby. Uh, sure.
RASGOTRA: Don't worry. We're going to take care of both of you.
Nice work. Is that custom?
Yeah, Spanish Revival.
Ancef's on board.
Watch it, man. This frigging thing is attached.
I think he missed the femur.
Looks like he bagged the femoral artery.
Got a cold foot.
Give him another 50 of fentanyl,
we'll take him upstairs.
I'll be right back.
Dr. Dubenko. Yeah?
Is everything else okay?
Oh, I think he should be back to work in a few weeks.
Well, I meant with you, actually.
Oh.
Um, I know this is none of my business,
but I was up in oncology last week with a patient and...
Oh, oh, oh.
I had my annual PSA screening.
Oh. Duh.
It came back 6.5.
That's a little high.
Needle biopsy showed a moderately differentiated
prostate cancer.
I'm so sorry.
No, it's okay. We caught it early, stage T-1.
Good prognosis with surgery.
I got to get your ischemic foot boy upstairs.
Um, Lucian?
If you want to talk with someone,
or have a coffee or something...
Yeah, alright. Maybe.
That'd be nice.
Okay.
Hey, Frank.
Anything besides fender-benders?
Well, guy in number four
got scalded while driving by the hospital by some crazy broad
who was throwing coffee.
He thought she was a nurse.
Probably someone from ICU.
They're really wacky up there.
Abby! Chest pain!
When did it start?
Ten, 15 minutes ago. We came right in.
What does it feel like?
Heavy, heavy here.
Are you on any medications?
Lipitor and aspirin.
Alright, first day labs, 12 lead, lopressor and nitro.
Got it.
Is he having a heart attack?
We'll have to look at the EKG before we can tell you that.
Three-month-old, rear-seat passenger,
multiple lacs to the head, face and chest.
She was found outside the vehicle.
Looked like she was ejected.
Car seat wasn't anchored down?
Looks that way. Heart rate is in the 160s.
Access?
Tried twice, IV blew.
Hey, you any good with a tiny vein? Maybe.
I'll take that as a yes.
C-spine's clear. Get her off the board.
Pulse ox 97 on two liters.
Now when you say a truck, do you mean they were driving
an SUV or a pickup, ma'am?
SUV, it was blue or black. It was definitely black.
Okay, Judy, we're going to sit you up.
Ow, my chest!
Did you see the driver or any of the passengers, ma'am?
There were at least two of them.
The driver was young, a teenager.
White, black, Hispanic, Asian, what?
White. I'm not sure about the passenger.
Lungs are clear.
BP 112/78.
It hurts when I breathe.
Stop.
Okay, Judy, I think you've broken your breastbone.
Add a sternal view, troponin, CT of head, abdomen and pelvis.
What else can you tell us about the vehicle?
There was a bike rack on the roof.
They tried to force me off the road.
They wanted to steal my car.
Am I bleeding?
You hit the window. It's not bad.
Will I need stitches? Yeah.
Did either of them have a weapon, ma'am?
I don't know.
It happened so fast.
I just wanted to get out of there. Enough for now.
She's had a concussion.
We need to let her rest
before she goes up to the CT.
We're working here.
Sorry, Luka.
We've got a trauma. We need the room.
Alright, here we go, gently.
( baby crying )
Lift up the neck.
On my count, one, two, three.
Here we go.
We're out of infant C-collars.
Luka do you know if we have any infant C-collars?
You can use towel rolls.
Airway is patent.
I can't hear breath sounds with all the crying.
Do we have a sat?
Won't pick up.
KOVAC: Kid's pink, sat's fine.
24 gauge going on in the right.
You want me to take this, Kerry?
I don't mind.
What, you think I'm rusty?
Superficial head lacs, no step-offs,
left frontal- parietal hematoma.
Call CT and let them know we need a head.
Finally calming down.
Or going apnic.
Come on, baby. Wake up. Wake up.
( baby screaming )
Alright, uh, Inez,
miller one and a 4-O.
She needs a tube.
Kerry, the kid's screaming. The airway is obviously fine.
She's got a good mechanism for a head injury and she needs a CT.
So what you're going to subject her to the risks of intubation,
just to make it easier for the radiologist?
She'll settle down. Just give her some time.
She doesn't have time.
Agitation could be an early sign of head injury.
Or an appropriate response to a stressful situation.
Babies cry when they're scared.
Thank you, Dr. Kovac, but this is my patient.
Her mental status is waxing and waning.
She could go apnic in the scanner.
You bag her through it.
.5 of versed and vec.
Hold on. You're going to lose your neuro exam if you sedate.
And watch her bleed into her brain? No, thanks.
Push the meds, Inez.
She's alert.
Pupils equal, good tone.
Do it now.
.5 versed going in.
Come on, Kerry, we've both seen enough head trauma
to develop gut feelings about this.
Yeah, and my gut says intubate. She needs a tube.
Giving the vec.
Suction.
The scope.
Where are they taking my daughter?
She's going up to the CT.
But what are all those tubes?
Why isn't she moving?
The tube helps her breathe.
It's just a precaution.
Sometimes babies have to be sedated for CAT scans.
It doesn't mean anything's wrong.
Have the... police found anything?
It's still early. They will.
I should have waited... till it stopped raining.
No one can control the weather.
The good news is
that your brain and belly CT are normal.
Unfortunately, you've broken your breastbone
and we'll need to monitor your heart
to make sure it wasn't bruised.
But I didn't have to go out.
I... I could have waited.
Grace was fussy all night
and sometimes a car ride settles her down.
I'm gonna numb up the cuts on your face before I suture.
What am I gonna tell my husband?
"Need a new car"?
You're going to feel a little pinprick
and then some burning before it kicks in.
JERRY: You have a bunch of phone messages.
Uh... no, no, no.
Tell Kayson to stop bothering me.
I'll call Anspaugh back when I get a chance.
Oh, crap.
Henry's got a birthday party tomorrow.
Hey, Jerry.
Could you go down to that toy store
on Michigan Avenue for me?
You want me to go outside?
Yeah. It's just a few blocks.
I need a King Funshine.
I'll write it down for you.
In the storm?
What, you afraid you'll melt?
What about the lightning?
I'm a pretty big target.
Well, then I suggest you try running in a zigzag pattern.
Dr. Weaver? Yeah?
The results are back for that little girl
who ejected from the car.
Is she awake yet?
Not yet, but I'm gonna double-check.
Hey. Hey.
Baby's head CT is negative.
Just some soft tissue swelling.
Is she awake?
No, she's still sedated.
Then you can't follow her neuro exam.
She'll wake up and we'll extubate.
Dr. Weaver? Yeah?
This is Bradley Anderson.
His wife and daughter were brought in.
The police said there was an accident.
Somebody tried to carjack them?
Yeah, they're doing well.
Come on, I'll take you to them.
Aren't you two supposed to keep 50 feet apart or something.
Bite me, Frank.
Ask me, you're better off.
I didn't.
Second EKG is unchanged and troponin is negative.
He's pain-free after nitro and metoprolol.
So, he's okay?
Well, it doesn't look like a heart attack,
but I think he has unstable angina.
One of the arteries around your heart may be closing down,
so you're gonna have to stay in the hospital
for observation and some more tests.
For how long?
Could be just a day or two.
You okay with that? Like I got a choice?
You hang in there.
I'll stop by later if I can.
Um, excuse me.
Excuse me. Hi.
Um, it might be better if you stayed,
because the cardiologist is probably gonna have
questions and instructions for you and your husband.
Oh, I'm not Lee's wife. I'm his therapist.
Are you a doctor?
I'm his... satisfaction facilitator.
What is that exactly?
I have a select group of clients like Lee
who require... something they're not getting at home.
Something... sexual.
Mm.
See, I provide the one thing that's missing,
which allows them to live
happily ever after with their wives.
Really?
Oh, I help women, too.
You call me if he needs anything.
Okay.
KOVAC: 60cc's of gastrografin
and check the K.U.B.
What's this?
Nursing home dump.
I'm changing G-tubes on comatose patients now.
How's your M.I.?
Unstable angina.
Just out of curiosity,
what type of guy hires a satisfaction facilitator?
I believe it's the...
politically correct term for "call girl" these days.
A smart one?
We have a saying in Croatia.
( speaking Croatian )
You know, "If it floats, flies or..."
Fornicates?
Rent it.
Hey, Dr. Kovac. Hello.
Um, I thought I might take you up
on that offer for some coffee.
If you got a minute? Sure.
Um, page me if you need me.
How many stitches?
Oh, let's see.
There's seven on the forehead,
five on the cheek, that's 12 all together.
That's not so bad.
Neela, uh, this is Brad, Judy's husband.
Hey, baby.
Honey, I'm so sorry.
Oh, come on.
It wasn't your fault.
The police told me what happened.
The bastards who did this should be shot.
No, I tried to get away and I lost control.
You did everything you could.
Don't worry, the cops will get these guys.
Have you seen Grace?
She looks good.
They think she's gonna be okay.
Really?
Uh, we still have to run a few tests.
Everything looks good, but as soon as I can,
I'll bring her down
so you can be with her.
Okay, thanks.
I'm gonna go back and stay with Grace
until they're ready to bring her in here.
I love you.
I love you, too.
Your husband seems like a great guy.
( sobbing )
It's okay, Judy.
Everything's gonna be okay.
I'm sorry. I'm not usually like this.
( sobbing )
Okay, well, the Venus flytrap is nontoxic,
so it's not lethal if ingested.
However, the larger ones are extremely dangerous,
and have been known to devour pets and small children.
( chuckles )
No, no, no, I made that last part up.
( chuckles )
Uh... I'm sorry.
Ma'am, I...
You're absolutely right.
This is not a venue for humor.
I... I understand.
I-I apologize.
You, too.
( sighs )
Do you need any help with the snakes?
Could have gone to the cafeteria.
This one. Their coffee sucks.
Here we go.
Um, you didn't mention seeing me upstairs
to anyone else by any chance, did you?
No, no, no.
I mean, I....
I wouldn't have said anything to you,
but I just thought maybe you might want
to talk to someone or something.
Yeah. No, I appreciate the gesture.
Okay.
So what are your treatment options?
Well, um, I've opted for a radical prostatectomy.
My urologist, Dr. Peter Singh, do you know him?
Uh, no.
He does a, a bilateral nerve-sparing procedure
for patients with low volume disease.
Well, that's great.
Unfortunately, even in the best of circumstances,
there's a 25% chance of loss of erectile function.
Yeah, then you're looking
at penile injection therapy, intraurethral pharmacotherapy,
vacuum erection devices, or a penile prosthesis
to achieve an adequate erection.
Why, uh, then the good news is
that-that there's a 75% chance of success.
Well, the procedure also eliminates
the ability to ejaculate.
Uh-huh.
But the chance of urinary incontinence
is relatively low, so at least I won't be wearing
a diaper or need an artificial sphincter.
Oh, well, there you go.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It is, um, it's... it's just, it's....
it's-it's rather daunting,
knowing that you may never have sex again.
Well, it sounds like you're in good hands.
Yeah.
Look, um, I know this is, uh, rather unconventional,
and under different circumstances
I certainly would have employed a more traditional approach
with regards to courtship
and romantic methodology,
and assuredly enjoyed all the ritual of that,
but given the time constraints
and obviously what I'm potentially faced with...
You know, you might want to just kind of...
Look, look. Mm-hmm.
If I'm going down, I want to go down swinging.
And I'd like it to be with you.
So you want me to sleep with you?
Yes.
Wow, that's something.
That's...
I'm flattered, I think.
Uh, but I, uh...
I can't do that.
No, no. I understand.
Nothing personal.
No, I understand.
Just asking purely from a scientific approach.
What about after?
After what?
The surgery, to see if anything still works.
I'm gonna have to take a pass on that, too.
Yeah.
Abby, you want this?
GSW to the upper chest!
I gotta.... I better get back.
You want to hop on?
I mean, are you coming to the, uh, for the...
Place a chest tube,
call me if the initial output's over 500cc's.
H-How's Grace?
We moved her to one of our exam rooms
so we're going to take you to her.
Mrs. Anderson, I brought some
mug books for you to look through.
Um, it all happened so fast,
I'm not really sure what I remember seeing.
Well, take a look.
Maybe a face will jog your memory.
I can't.
Why don't you give us a few minutes?
Sure.
I don't want to look at those books.
You might be able to identify
the two men who drove you off the road.
I can't.
Why not?
It was, it was pouring rain.
I could barely see out the window.
I... I... The car started to skid.
I don't know, I saw the wall coming
and I didn't stop, I just kept driving.
What are you saying, Judy? What happened?
I...
I didn't know that Grace's car seat wasn't clicked in.
I would... I would never do anything
to hurt my child.
Did you do this on purpose?
Sometimes I...
I can't help it.
Sometimes, it's like I don't know how to snap out of it.
It's like... everything is coming at me at once
and I just want it all to go away.
Judy, did you try to hurt yourself?
I just wanted it to stop.
Do either of you have a moment? Shoot.
I think my MVC mom's suffering
from severe postpartum depression.
Dr. Weaver?
Just one second.
It's the baby. Grace Anderson.
What about her? She's waking up.
I thought you might want to extubate.
Yeah, I'll be right there.
What are her symptoms?
She drove head-on to a wall with her baby in the car.
I think it was intentional.
I'd like to put her on psych hold.
Dr. Rasgotra?
That's the husband.
Uh, get Psych down here.
Can my wife go home now?
Not yet.
What, you moved Judy out of the trauma room.
I thought that meant she was good to go.
We needed to clear the room.
We have to rule out a cardiac contusion,
so we need to monitor her heart some more
to make sure it's not bruised.
For how long?
I'm not sure.
It could be a while.
Mr. Anderson...
does Judy drink alcohol?
No.
I mean, she has a glass of wine now and then.
Why?
What about drugs?
No.
What's this all about?
Just routine questions for her chart
to, um, avoid any drug interaction,
that sort of thing.
Have you, uh,
noticed any change in her mood lately?
Like what?
She seem depressed?
No.
Any loss of appetite or trouble sleeping?
You're kidding, right?
We have a three- month-old baby.
When Gracie doesn't sleep, none of us do.
Look, the sooner I can get them both home,
the sooner they can start getting better.
I don't want to send her home
until I'm sure there's no danger.
No, of course, you're right.
Thank you.
Dr. Kovac, could you help me clear some beds?
I thought I was.
Well, maybe if we work together.
Look, what's going on in Exam Two?
D.U.B. needs an ultrasound to rule out fibroids.
Good crits. Vitals stable.
How about an outpatient scan and a GYN referral?
Well, if you can get her in this week.
Done. Okay, next: Buster Freeman.
Dirty puncture wound to the foot,
waiting on IV...
Could he sit in a chair for that?
I mean, it frees up a bed.
Crystal Maranacchio.
Waiting on an ortho consult.
She's been cleared. I called the attending.
You what? That's a new policy.
When we call for a consult,
the resident has 60 minutes to respond to the page,
or we call the attending.
All the department heads signed off on it,
except Psych-- crazy bastards.
Blaire Collins has been here forever.
I called the nursing home twice.
They were supposed to be sending a ride for her.
Well, if they're not here in ten,
I'm putting her in a cab.
She's comatose.
I was kidding, Dr. Kovac.
Frank?
Call Blaire Collins' nursing home again
and tell those idiots she's been ready to go home
for the last four hours.
Tell them yourself. I'm busy.
Dr. Kovac?
I think I'm one of those idiots.
Trish Gorham, the assistant director
from the nursing home that's been caring for Blaire Collins.
I didn't mean that...
It's our policy to check on patients prior to transfer.
I gather she's well enough to return?
Yeah, she's right over here.
To be honest with you, all she needs
is a course of IV antibiotics
and the G-tube could have been changed
at her facility.
We're not staffed as well as the hospital,
and the gastro-neurologist
doesn't come out to the nursing home.
The earliest I could have gotten anyone to see her
was in two weeks.
She have any family?
No.
Apparently her mother died from the crash that did this.
There was a boyfriend,
but he's stopped coming around years ago.
MAN: He didn't even try to stop!
Somebody call my son. I need you to reach my son.
47-year-old victim of auto-versus-pedestrian.
I just ran out to get the kids some pizza.
He didn't even slow down.
Systolic only 80 after a liter.
Pulse 140, pale and diaphoretic.
Ecchymosis across the abdomen and pelvis.
Four units of O-neg and prime the rapid infuser.
Am I dying?
No, but you may have some internal bleeding.
Resps are shallow. Let's set up for intubation.
How often are you sad?
Uh, not often.
And what makes you happy, Judy?
Being with my baby and my husband.
Why are you asking me all this?
We ask all patients these questions
to assess mental status following a head injury.
Well, my mental status is fine.
Really.
Any thoughts about wanting to hurt yourself?
Uh, not unless you count
wanting to take a carving knife to my hips.
Do you ever think about wanting to hurt your baby?
Of course not.
What did you tell him?
Judy, you said you were upset
and that you couldn't snap out of it.
What are you talking about?
You told me you felt like everything was coming
at you and that you wanted it all to stop.
No, no, I said
that I lost control of the car and I couldn't stop.
You're putting words in my mouth.
It's not uncommon for new moms to have
bouts of depression.
The first year with your baby
can be very stressful.
I'm not stressed and I'm not depressed,
although I will be
if I have to spend any more time here.
So stop accusing me of being crazy
and let me go.
Nobody's accusing you of anything.
We have to be extra careful
whenever there's a child involved.
( sighs )
Look, I appreciate your concern.
Really.
There's nothing wrong with me.
I've had a rough day.
And I just want to take my baby home
and get some rest.
Well, I hope you have a speedy recovery, Mrs. Anderson.
So are we good to go?
Uh, not quite,
but you can go back inside now.
I'll be right in.
She's changed her story.
There are no vegetative symptoms,
no anhedonia.
She doesn't have a depressed affect.
In fact, she appears to be in pretty good spirits.
Well, something is going on.
She as much as confessed
to deliberately crashing her car.
But she's not saying that now. She's lying.
She's a prime candidate for severe...
Dr. Rasgotra, I want to be sure
she doesn't have postpartum depression
just as much as you do.
But it can be one of the most difficult
conditions to diagnose.
And if the patient is in complete denial or lying to me,
not only can I not tell, but I cannot hold her.
I gave her every opportunity to let us know.
I'm sorry.
Whoa.
Need a hand?
I need eight.
Oh, God, it hurts!
What's this?
Driver of our auto-versus-pedestrian.
The guy ran out in front of me.
Please, give me something.
No neck pain, no chest pain,
good vitals, but complains of bilateral
thumb pain. Look at this. I can't even make a fist.
And we're out of beds. Okay, let's park him. I'll see what I can do.
Thanks. Dr. Weaver, Psych's
refusing to admit Judy Anderson.
Psych? I believe her condition was a deliberate act.
Yes, I know you suspect postpartum depression,
but did she admit it?
Practically.
She drove head-on into a wall.
The baby's seat wasn't properly anchored.
She's obviously overwhelmed at home.
ER. Please hold.
Please hold.
Please hold.
Has anybody seen Jerry?
I sent him out on an errand,
but he should be back by now. You sent him out in this?
You don't send Jerry out in the rain. I've heard that, too.
Maybe I should get DCFS involved.
Well, have you talked to the husband?
Maybe he could convince her.
A voluntary admission would be better
for everyone involved.
I'll try.
Frank, where's Jerry?
Dr. Weaver sent him on an errand.
Oh, no, you didn't.
What is the big deal?
Big man does not do well in the wet weather.
What the hell does that mean?
Excuse me.
Could you help us find our dad?
Lawrence Digby. He was hit by a car.
The doctors are still treating him.
They said he got hit while crossing the street.
Yeah, this guy was talking on his cell phone,
wasn't paying attention,
went right through the crosswalk.
Come on. I'll take you back to him.
Sam, you can go home now.
I've got a float from ICU coming down.
I'm gonna stay and help with this guy's kids.
You're welcome to do so, but if you do, you're off the clock.
Fine with me.
Come on, you guys.
Can I take her home now?
We'd like to keep her overnight for observation.
Oh, come on. Overnight?
Why?
I think your wife needs some help.
Believe me, I've tried to talk her into getting a nanny,
but she doesn't want another woman raising her daughter.
It makes her feel like she's less of a mother or something.
I don't mean that kind of help.
I think Judy needs some psychiatric help.
What?
Mr. Anderson...
Brad, why don't we sit down.
It's not uncommon for new moms
to get overwhelmed with all the challenges
of child care, especially in the first year.
So why are you making a big deal out of this?
Usually, it's short-lived
and goes away after the baby falls into a routine
and the mom's hormones stabilize.
But occasionally, it lasts longer,
becomes more severe,
and develops into something called postpartum depression.
Yeah, yeah, but that's not Judy.
Judy's not depressed, not like that.
I mean, sure, she's anxious to get back to work,
and sometimes she's a little down about that,
but that's normal.
Purposely trying to hurt herself and your baby isn't.
What are you talking about?
She had an accident!
Some creep tried to run her off the road.
I don't think she was forced off the road.
NURSE: Dr. Rasgotra,
nosebleed on Coumadin in Two.
Okay.
Please, talk to your wife, ask her yourself.
Ask her what really happened in the car.
Sux on board. Yankauer.
Assist ventilations. O-neg's going on the right antecube.
We're gonna need the rapid infuser.
Curtain Four. They did an in-service.
I got it. 'Kay, let's take a look.
Sats down to 92. Turn on the suction.
It's on. No, it's not.
I have it on high.
KOVAC: I'm not getting anything here.
Inez, go next door
and help Dr. Lockhart with the chest tube.
Okay.
I'm not allowed to work with any
of the nurses now?
The patient is paralyzed. I can't see the cords.
I need suction. Hold your horses.
Suction container wasn't sealed properly.
You're welcome.
Tube.
Found it. Two units on the infuser.
Set up for a subclavian. Okay, bag him.
End tidal CO2 is yellow.
Yellow's good. I'll be right back.
Alright, hook me up.
O-silk is next?
O-silk. Come on.
Here you go.
And I want to auto- transfuse this guy.
Okay.
You need a side collector on the thoraseal.
You know, just go help Dr. Kovac
with the rapid infuser, Alright? No problem.
LOCKHART: Vaseline gauze, 4X4's and elastoplast.
What do you need?
Central line, supraumbilical DPL,
rapid infuser and a t-pod
What's a t-pod?
Fine, I'll get it... again.
What do you want me to do first?
Find the O-neg.
Everything okay in there?
For the time being.
Call for four units of type specific.
Soon as I get this up.
Hey, Sam?
Hypotensive pelvic fracture.
He needs the works.
Those are his kids out there.
Hey, Frank, can you bring those guys to the Family Room?
Sure. Come on, kids. This way.
I'll be right in.
Great.
Guide wire?
I'm getting an error signal.
There's not enough water in the warmer.
( sighs ): Thanks.
Cordis inducer.
Stitch.
Where's Dori with the T-pod?
T-pods are on the bottom shelf.
Update his vitals?
Okay, infuser's on. Looks good.
Cathet...
Pressure's up to 95 palp.
No gross blood.
PAYTON: Where do you need me?
We're all set.
She's good.
Thanks, Sam. We'll take it from here.
I'll go check on his kids.
BRAD: She's really not sure what happened.
She gave herself a pretty good whack in the head.
We can't do anything
if she doesn't identify her assailants.
That's okay.
Like I said, she's not sure what she remembers.
She's not even certain it was intentional now.
Fine. Let me know if she changes her mind.
You did the right thing.
The next step is to get your wife some help.
No. The next step is for me to take her home.
Mr. Anderson... My wife is not crazy, okay?
She had an accident. It happens.
I'd rather she chose to stay,
than have psychiatry put her on forced hold.
She's gonna be with me.
She's gonna be fine.
Just leave us alone.
I mean it.
Pressure's up to 100 systolic. Crit's 28.
Send another 4 units to angio.
Daddy?
Your dad has a broken pelvis,
which are the ring of bones around his waist.
Some of his blood vessels have also been damaged.
He's bleeding inside.
Can you fix it?
We're gonna try, but he's lost a lot of blood already.
It's very serious.
It was supposed to be me.
I was supposed to go get the pizza, but I-I...
MAN: Yeah, it's ridiculous I'm still here.
I don't know, some pizza guy ran out in front of me.
Hey, jerk-off!
Jason...
I can't drive for a week.
Jason!
Not that I could anyway-- my car is totaled. Hey!
What was so important
you had to be talking on the phone while driving!
Come on! What was so damn important!
Hey! That's enough! Hey, come on!
Hey, get that guy away from me!
Shut up!
Jason, hey, I know you're mad,
but your father's condition is very serious,
and your brother and sister need you right now, okay?
Come on, Jason,
I'll take you to the Family Room.
( sighs ): Dr. Kovac, one of your patients
is getting agitated. Which one?
The girl from the nursing home.
She's in a coma, Inez.
Not anymore.
Hey? ( weakly ): Where...
I'm Dr. Kovac.
Wh-Where's my mom?
Okay, keep your hands up as if you were holding a tray.
( quietly ): Okay.
( weakly ): What's wrong with me?
What's the last thing you remember?
Uh...
My mom and I were going to the mall...
and it was snowing,
and, um...
Were we in an accident?
Is she okay?
I-I didn't treat her, but, um,
let-let me see what I can find out, okay?
Yeah. Okay.
How is she?
She doesn't remember anything.
What are you gonna tell her?
I don't know.
Your mother's dead, and you've been in a coma for six years?
How are those kids doing?
They're hanging in there.
I got ahold of an aunt and uncle.
They're with them right now.
Inez, walk with me.
Do I have to?
I better get into this.
EVE: I think you have
just fantastic potential, but in every spare moment,
you've got to be in there honing your skills.
Got a second? Not really.
If you're so concerned
with the efficiency of this department,
then you need
to allow those of us who work well together
to continue to do so.
If you're referring to the...
And if you want us to act like professionals,
then you need to treat us as such.
Sam...
You saw me in there with Dr. Kovac.
You saw how well we work together.
If that doesn't prove that we can work
the same shift,
then I don't think you know your job
as well as you think you do.
Feel better?
FYI: I already changed the schedule.
You're back on your old shifts next week.
Thank you.
Don't worry.
When I first started, I could barely hook up an I.V.
It's all muscle memory.
You'll get it, Inez, I know you will.
I felt like an idiot.
I didn't even know what a T-pod was.
Everybody needs help with stuff.
When you do, come find me.
Thanks.
Page me when he's out of surgery.
Will do.
Hello. You're back.
Had a cancellation. He's this way.
I tried calling Lee's cell, but he wasn't answering.
Is everything okay? Yeah, he's doing great.
We're just, uh, waiting for them
to take him up to the cath lab.
Ooh, that sounds ominous.
They're going to do an angioplasty,
which is a procedure where we
insert a catheter into a blood vessel in his leg,
thread it up to his coronary artery,
which is used to inflate a balloon
that will open up the blockage.
Guess those cheese steaks caught up with me.
I've been telling him to eat better for years.
WOMAN: Lee?
Hey, you! Hi.
This is my... wife, Viv.
Hi.
Hi.
I'm Dr. Lockhart.
I've been treating your husband.
Hi. Everything's okay.
I've got a little blockage, but they're gonna fix it.
Oh.
I didn't get your name.
Shawna.
Hi.
And you are...?
Therapist.
From Cardiology.
Really?
Your husband has to undergo an angioplasty.
That's where we're going to
insert a catheter into a blood vessel in his leg,
and we're gonna use it to inflate a balloon
that will hopefully open the blockage.
( Lee laughs )
Oh.
Okay.
Well, good luck, Mr. Rappaport.
I have to get back to my other patients.
It was nice to meet you.
Excuse me for just one second.
( Shawna sighs )
Whoa. That was close.
Mm-hmm.
Thanks. I-I really owe you one.
Hey, listen,
if you ever need a sex therapist...
I... I think I'm good. Um...
Now that you mention it,
do you ever do any pro bono work?
Yes, I spoke to your resident,
and he thought a hold was unnecessary,
but I disagree, and all I'm asking
is for a second assessment from another attending.
Watch it!
No, Dr. Wakita, not you.
Hey, Jerry, where have you been?
I was getting worried about you.
Everyone was acting as if I'd sent you out in a hurricane.
Are you okay?
What the hell happened to King Funshine?
Did you get hit by lightning again?
He didn't get hit by lightning.
Here's your change.
Okay. Uh, let's
get you on a cardiac monitor.
CBC, chem panel, EKG.
CPK, troponin, myoglobin and UA.
I-I realize that.
I'm sure he is, but this isn't about me,
him, or even you.
It's about the welfare of a mother and her child.
You will? Great!
Thank you so much.
Um, psych attending's coming down to assess Judy Anderson.
If Dr. Wakita asks, you agree
with my postpartum depression assessment, right?
WEAVER: Yeah, you got it.
Mr. and Mrs. Anderson, I have some good news.
One of our attendings from upstairs has agreed
to come down and speak with you.
I've seen enough doctors today.
We're going home.
Please, he's on his way down right now.
We've been here for hours already.
This will only take a few minutes. I'm tired.
I just want to go home, have dinner and a bath
and put Grace in her own crib.
You want what's best for your baby, so do I.
Then leave us alone. Judy you need to speak to someone.
She just needs to rest.
I know you don't want to hurt yourself or Grace.
You need professional help.
Do you have children? No.
Then how do you even know what you're talking about?
I'm a doctor. But you're not a mother.
Judy, listen to me...
Please don't go.
My wife has a touch of the baby blues,
and you want to lock her up?
No one's locking anyone up.
I just want her to get the help that she needs.
Oh, by giving her drugs.
Maybe. Ignoring it is not gonna make it go away.
It needs to be treated the same as any other disease.
No. This could happen again,
only next time, it could be worse.
Judy!
Judy, please.
You could die, Judy.
Your baby could die!
