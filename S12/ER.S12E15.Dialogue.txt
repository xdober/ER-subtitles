Previously on ER:
He shot me.
CLEMENTE: They think I did it.
They think I did it. All right.
Is there anyone who can back you up?
Yeah. She's down there.
You've been accepted into the surgical elective.
Oh, my God. Thank you.
I'm the one who writes your evaluation,
I'm the one you've got to impress.
I need you to draw
a blood alcohol for a suspected DUI.
You gotta help me, Greg.
His blood alcohol came back negative.
It won't happen again, I promise.
...because you're gonna stop drinking
and get yourself in a program.
Debbie's enlisted me to give a hand
to a Sudanese doctor who's a bit short staffed right now.
He works out of a camp called Dumtalah in Darfur.
( speaks Arabic )
( man coughing )
( coughing continues )
Dr. Carter?
It is Stephen.
You startled me.
You've been coughing all night.
I brought you some tea.
Thank you.
It is the dryness, you know?
And the sand.
( coughs )
Happens to everyone when they get here.
That's good.
Zahra, she made me that when I came.
And I would drink it every night
before I went to sleep.
Debbie said you needed some help here.
Yes.
She's a good person.
And your help will be appreciated.
So, you and Debbie are, um...
Yes.
How long has that been going on?
Well, she has been here two months,
so seven and a half weeks.
You know what?
You should go back to bed.
Okay.
And thank you.
No, thank you.
Now we can all get some sleep.
( gunshots )
MAN: What's that?
It's the Janjaweed again.
You will learn to sleep through it.
( screaming ) No, Bernie! No biting!
Am I bleeding? Did he break the skin?
I am so sorry.
He's not usually like this.
You know what? I'll get a nurse to give him the shot.
Can somebody please take a look at this wound?
Yeah, we're a little short. Do it yourself.
Hey, what's this?
Ah, that's for you and the little bastard.
Thanks, Frank.
Hey, congratulations.
Thank you. It was supposed to be a secret.
Everybody was saying you were getting puffy.
I had to defend you.
Am I getting puffy? You're not getting puffy.
Are you on today? No.
Clemente will be here at 8:00.
Damn it, I'm bleeding.
You should get a hep panel and HIV on that kid.
LOCKHART: Clemente's back on the schedule?
Isn't that a little bit too soon,
after everything that happened.
Which I hear was very similar to what happened in Newark.
What happened in Newark?
Nothing happened in Newark.
The guy is a loose canon.
I mean, he's a suspected murderer.
Look, Dr. Clemente
is an excellent physician with some personal issues.
That's nothing new around here.
CLEMENTE: It's the fifth time you brought me in
this week, man-- five times.
Why don't you put it all down on this piece of paper and sign?
'Cause if I shot her, then how did I get shot?
Because she went for the gun, it went off
and it clipped you in the shoulder, all right?
Come on, man. Her husband did it.
Her husband did it, okay?
He was working in Jersey.
Well, then he's got to have a twin, okay, 'cause I saw a guy
just like him in my apartment.
Well, if that's true, if he were there,
why can't I find a neighbor to back your story?
I don't know, man-- 'cause people hate me
'cause I play my music loud, maybe, I don't know.
Because it's bull, Vic, and you know it.
Now, we talked to the doctor and your girl ain't waking up.
So if I were you, I'd get a lawyer.
( water spattering )
DEBBIE ( angrily ): This is great.
Just great.
( women chanting in Sudanese )
Okay, okay, we'll be with you soon.
( chanting stops )
Zahra, where's Stephen?
In the back.
What's wrong? Everything.
( patient gasping )
Good radial and ulnar pulses.
( grunts )
Are you okay?
I'm fine.
Stephen, the Janjaweed shot up the reservoir.
There's a patch kit. Tell the engineer.
He went to Khartoum. We can't wait.
At least we still have the bore holes.
We need 15 liters per person per day.
CARTER: Cephalexin 500 milligrams
Qid for a week.
You know, why are you being so calm?
People are drinking sand.
We have been through this before.
We drain the tank, patch the holes
and we treat with chlorine, so, sweetheart,
please, take two deep
breaths and do your downtown dog.
Down and out dog?
( chuckles ) It's not funny.
We can't provide basic needs.
What's new?
Fine. Yeah,
be like that.
Oh, I have two more, but I'll just save them
for someone who's listening to me,
appreciates me.
She was like this in the Congo?
She was worse.
At least in the Congo we had television and beer.
I'm not saying anything against anyone's religion,
but this place would drive anybody to drink.
ZAHRA Dr. Carter?
I need you in here.
It's, um, downward dog.
Ah...
( Carter coughing )
I.V.'s already in.
( Zahra speaking Arabic )
I hear that you're feeling better.
( Zahra speaking Arabic )
( Osman speaks Arabic )
( speaking Arabic )
They want to go home. Tell her that I'm going
to give him some medicine so that we can release them.
Who's this?
ZAHRA: His brother, Khalid.
An artist.
May I see?
( speaking Arabic )
ZAHRA: It's him and his father,
fighting the Janjaweed.
Tell him it's, uh, it's good.
Somebody needs to kick the Janjaweed's butt.
( Zahra speaking Arabic )
( laughter )
Okay, doxycycline, single dose,
four migs per kilo, ORS,
one cup after each loose stool.
Thank you, Dr. Carter.
She's gonna take very good care of you.
( Zahra speaking Arabic )
This for me?
( speaks Arabic )
MORRIS: Dr. Clemente.
How was jail?
I didn't go to jail.
Oh, so you called that lawyer I left on your machine?
I don't need a lawyer, Morris, thank you very much.
Welcome back.
So how'd you survive without me?
Oh, we did our best.
Oh, yeah? You okay?
Yeah, I'm okay.
Why? People talking about me?
Well, they're concerned.
They just want to make sure you're all right, that's all.
Yeah, well, tell them not to be so concerned about me.
You didn't have to come back so soon.
What's that supposed to mean?
Yeah, well, before Morris or somebody starts a blog,
I want to set the record straight.
I didn't shoot Jodie.
Okay.
But how did you know about the blog?
That little rat bitch.
KOVAC: Bolus with a liter of NS, Hey, wait up.
and ten of realan. Hey, Kovac, Kovac, wait up.
Wait up.
So what have you got for me?
Good to see you, Vic, but you're not on the schedule today.
Come on, Weaver said I could come back.
I'm head of the ER, not Weaver,
and I don't think you're ready.
So what are you doing, man,
giving me the slow walk to the door?
I'm looking out for you.
Yeah, well, I can take care of myself, thank you.
And more importantly,
I'm looking out for every patient in here.
Patients don't need to be protected from me.
Dr. Kovac, we've got a 14-year-old,
auto versus peds coming in.
Go home, Vic. I am home.
You're not working today. Come on, Chief,
put me back on the schedule.
Kovac? Come on.
14-year-old hit by car going about 30 or 40.
BOY: Oh, my leg.
Distal deformity of the left lower extremity.
I'm Dr. Kovac. What's your name?
Jose Rodriguez.
Jose, you remember what happened?
I got hit.
Let me guess: Flute. Tuba.
Sorry about that.
Any LOC? MARQUEZ: Nope.
A and O times four.
Vitals?
Tachy in the 120s, resps 20s, B.P. 110/78.
Okay, Abby, you take the airway.
Pratt, you run it. Let's go.
So, how long is your wife in Paris?
I don't know.
So how long are with us?
How long do you need me?
It's hard, huh, keeping relationships going
doing what we do. Right.
I have a sweet lady friend in London named Grace.
Whenever I am in town we fall in love,
and when I leave, we fall out.
How does Debbie feel about that?
She has the exact same relationship
with some Spanish photojournalist.
What happens in Darfur stays in Darfur.
( laughing )
( shouting excitedly )
( laughing, coughing )
( laughs, sighs )
So when do you think all these people
are going to be able to go home?
Who knows?
The government funded the Arab militias
to find and kill the rebels.
So they burned the villages,
killed the men, raped the women...
Whoever survived, wound up here.
Janjaweed have turned this place into the Wild, Wild West.
Kofi Anan and Colin Powell,
they call this genocide.
And then congress, they just went on holiday.
I guess 300,000 dead and a million displaced persons
aren't enough to get involved.
Does not matter whether it is Somalia, Rwanda, Darfur,
or New Orleans.
When the faces are black, the world moves slow.
Is she doing what I think she's doing?
Yes. She's quite a woman.
CARTER: Hey, how much for the yoga class?
It's free.
( speaking Arabic )
( kids speaking in unison )
( laughter )
( speaking Arabic )
What happened?
( speaking Arabic )
He's got a stomach ache?
Yes. He also has diarrhea.
( speaking Arabic )
His mother has gone to get wood.
He doesn't know where his father is.
All right let's take him back to the tent
for supervisory rehydration.
( speaking Arabic )
It's okay. We'll fix you up before your mom gets back.
( women yelling in Arabic )
( women screaming, men on horses whooping )
( screaming continues )
( screaming )
I'd let him keep it,
but what happens when the battery dies?
It becomes iTrash.
( chuckles )
Help! Help! She needs a doctor.
( speaking Arabic )
( speaking Arabic )
Bring a towel, go get a stretcher.
Tell Zahra to prep the procedure room.
( speaking Arabic )
Zanjaweed.
The airway's clear, she's tachy at 120. B.P. is 100/60.
DAKARAI: Two liters of saline wide open.
She's lost a lot of blood.
Let's hope it's just from these lacerations, huh?
( pained groaning )
She's got a nasal fracture.
( groans )
Probably an inferior orbit blow-out, as well.
Chest is clear. Okay, let's get these lacerations cleared up.
I want to see what we're dealing with here.
Why did she leave the camp?
The women have to get the firewood for their families.
Why don't the men go?
The men would be killed. Okay, I.V. is in.
Okay, let's get two of morphine, and I need two suture kits, too.
4-0 vicryl, 4-0 nylon.
( speaking Arabic )
Where's your husband, Gada?
Whoa, we got a lot of blood down here.
( groans ) What is it?
Uh, we have, uh, lacerations
and contusions to the external genitalia
and upper thigh.
No. Enough.
I need to examine her.
She doesn't want to be examined by men!
She's not comfortable!
She needs post-exposure prophylaxis for STIs and HIV.
I know. Okay, she get her husband in here...
Do not tell him she's been shamed.
Shamed? Their word, not mine.
Sudanese men sometimes disown their wives after a rape.
When Gada awakens,
we'll let her tell her husband what she chooses.
We're going to regionals.
If I miss practice, the drum major will bench me.
MALIK: Pratt, Endocrine saw your IDDM kid,
so he can go, and KJ's dad is out here, he's asking for you.
All right, he's got a little guarding here.
Okay, ultrasound and call surgery to come take a look.
Here, have them follow up tomorrow.
Where's Darnell? Right here.
All right, take your time with the discharge instructions.
I always do.
What happened this time?
I got in a fight, man. It's no big deal.
Some cat at this restaurant.
You been drinking again, D?
Damn, man!
Come on, I blew it, okay?
Had a going-away party for a buddy at work.
I had a few, next thing I knew, me and this kid got into it.
Yeah, but you're supposed to stay clean.
You my sponsor now? No, man.
I'm your boy who you promised you were going to come clean to.
Look, I'm not gonna kick this overnight.
What I need from you right now
is fix me up before KJ gets down here.
I don't want him to see me like this.
Then stop coming in like this.
Hey, there, Jodes.
How you doing?
I'm sorry I haven't been around much.
It's just... I got a lot of problems.
Things are really messed up, baby.
Look, I can see you're mad at me.
You been going to the meetings?
Hell, yeah. It's hard, man.
DARNELL: What happened in there?
Kid got hit by a truck.
Come on, hold still.
He gonna be all right?
Who knows?
( speaking Arabic )
( speaking Arabic )
Where she?
Your wife was attacked outside the second checkpoint.
She okay?
She will be.
Shamed?
She was badly beaten.
See her...
I can see her now?
Yes, come with me.
Oh, Gada.
There are bruises to her chest and to her abdomen.
But I don't think that there's any damage
to her internal organs.
She live?
Yes. We gave her some medicine to help her sleep.
She has many cuts, but they're not so deep.
And I think the stitches need to stay in for one week.
She cut here?
Yes, but I think it will heal very well.
There shouldn't be any scarring.
Sir. Sir.
Sir!
Sir, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Wait.
What happened?
I brought him in to see her.
Did he see the wound?
Yeah.
Slash on the thigh is the mark of rape.
How the hell was I supposed to know that?
Where are you going?
I'm gonna go get him.
John!
LOCKHART: Chuny, what are his vitals?
Pulse 97, resps 20, BP 102/58.
A hundred percent on room air.
Heart rate's a little high.
There could be occult blood loss.
What took you so long?
Our favorite surgeon has arrived.
I was in three with the Crohn's girl.
Why isn't Albright down there helping you out?
Please, I was given strict instructions to handle the ER
so she can scrub in on an ileoanalanastamosis.
What have you got?
This is a tier one trauma.
He should have been seen
before you dealt with any other consults.
Well, I heard he was stable.
Thought I'd get the acute obstruction upstairs first.
That's fine. No, it's not.
This patient's gonna need an ex-lap and that takes time.
Ex-lap? The ultrasound was negative.
What's an ex-lap?
Abdominal pain, tachycardia and a good mechanism.
That's a bleed until proven otherwise.
Guys, that's basic trauma 101.
All right, get Albright or Dubenko
down here to evaluate.
I'm sure they'll agree with me.
Serial hemoglobin?
13 to 11 point six.
Probably dilutional.
Am I gonna have surgery?
We're not sure yet.
RASGOTRA: This is the ER.
I'm gonna need a CT of the chest and abdomen.
Thanks.
Get a portable, Chuny.
Would you forget the scan? It's a waste of time.
Thank you, but I don't agree.
If the CT shows a bleed,
he's going to the O.R. And if it doesn't?
He's still going to the O.R.
Not necessarily-- we'll OBS him in the unit.
OBS? That doesn't sound good.
What do you expect gain from the scan,
other than giving this young boy a whopping dose of radiation?
Pratt.
A chance to spare him from an operation
he doesn't need, a better sense of what we're dealing with.
Surgeons don't like surprises.
You're not a surgeon.
Today I am.
( sighs )
Give her a break, Pratt.
PRATT: Neela.
Neela, listen, I've got a lot more experience
with pediatric traumas than you do.
Kids are tricky. They have a huge reserve.
They maintain normal vitals for a long time,
but believe me, when they crash they crash hard.
The CT scan is simply part
of the complete workup of the patient.
It'll take 15 minutes. We've got time.
I don't think you do.
It's my call, Pratt.
Dad. Are you okay?
You have to tell Monty I won't be able to play tonight.
Don't worry about that, son.
The officer wants to ask you
some questions about the accident.
Did you get a description?
He was a black dude, blue pickup.
You see the license plate?
All I remember is that the side door was smashed,
and the grill was crushed.
Oh, and there was bumper stickers,
lots of Bears bumper stickers.
Malik, take a break.
What's up?
I need you to take a break.
What's wrong?
You still drive that old truck?
Yeah. Why?
Because that kid you were so curious about,
the one who got hit,
says the guy who hit him was a black dude
who drove a blue pickup!
There's a million brothers drive blue pickups.
I'm not talking about a million brothers!
I'm talking about you!
Did you hit that kid?
Yo, Greg...
Answer me!
Did your drunk ass hit that kid?
Greg, I-I didn't mean to hit him, man.
It was an accident, man, I swear.
It was an accident, man.
I didn't mean to hurt that kid.
I swear to God.
( sighs )
( speaking Arabic )
I think it's this one.
I think it's this one up here with the Oxfam logo on it.
( weakly ): Okay. Hey.
Salaam...
Salaam.
( speaking Arabic )
( speaking Arabic )
What's he saying?
He said Lwendo went to find the Janjaweed.
She said it happened by the second checkpoint.
Don't do this. Maybe we can stop him by the time he gets there.
It's too dangerous. This is my fault.
It's Lwendo's fault.
He knows it is suicide to leave the camp.
He's right. Carter, you'll get yourself killed.
So could Lwendo.
Look, I'll go.
I at least know where it is.
You stay.
Drive.
Is my dad still here?
RASGOTRA: He's outside.
No talking, Jose. You have to hold still.
Liver and spleen look good.
How's he doing? Why are you here?
Following up on my patient. Vitals are good?
I've got this, Pratt.
Apparently, you don't.
Why are you here?
Dr. Pratt was concerned that you were not receptive to his input.
So concerned, actually, that
he had to page me out of the OR
to come see this patient. You went over my head?
I want to make sure we didn't miss anything.
I'm doing exactly what you said.
I'm getting the ER to work up their patients completely.
No, not really, since you're the one here doing the CT.
( alarm ) TECH: Heart rate is up to 125.
Got some fluid in the retroperitoneal fossa.
That could be blood.
Scan's over.
Retroperitoneal injury wouldn't show up on an ultrasound.
Jose?
Jose? He's hypotensive and nonresponsive.
He was just talking, and his heart rate was
in the 90s before you walked in.
Get two units type specific.
Send off another set of blood cultures.
Change to Zosyn and up the dopamine to ten mikes.
Hey, whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
You just skipped right over her.
What are you doing?
We just rounded on her ten minutes ago.
I don't think so. I checked the chart.
I didn't see any new orders. Come on, what are you doing?
I need to know what's going on. I'll catch up with you.
She's off pressors, stable from a cardiopulmonary standpoint.
We're just waiting for her neuro status to declare itself.
So, what are you going to do now, hmm?
What are you going to do?
You're gonna sit back and twiddle your thumbs?
Is that what you're gonna do?
We're gonna wait. That's all we can do.
( phone rings )
What's up?
KENYON: How does it feel, Vic?
Who is this?
KENYON: How does she look now?
You still want to touch her?
You sick twisted piece of...
Yeah, I might not have finished the job.
But it's still a beautiful thing.
The cops were all over you.
You wait, man.
You wait till she wakes up and starts talking, all right?
'Cause you're gonna be in a world of hurt...
Keep dreaming, buddy.
You got out of Jersey okay.
You're not gonna pull that off this time.
Oh, you don't think?
You know, she was mine.
( voice breaking ): And you never should have touched her.
Is that kid gonna be all right?
I don't know. He's up in the OR.
We're trying to stop the bleeding.
Look, man, I messed up. Man, I'm sorry.
I went out on a limb for you.
I risked my job to cover for you because you promised me
you were gonna get help.
I'm trying. All I do is think about drinking.
I wake up, I want a drink.
I walk down the street, I want a drink.
I see the winos on the corner, and I'm jealous.
I just think to myself,
If I could get through raising KJ,
get him through college,
then I could be out there with them dudes.
Come on, man. Are you listening to me?
This is serious.
I'm not proud of it, but it's serious.
What's serious is, that kid could die.
And I know that, and I'm sorry for it.
But what else you want me to do?
Turn yourself in.
What did you say?
You heard me.
Look, you talk about raising KJ to be honest, right?
Got him working up in here
to teach him integrity and respect.
Now, how's he supposed to learn that
if you just get away with this?
I ain't going to jail.
You've got to turn yourself in, D.
CARTER: What does he think he's going to accomplish?
For a man like him,
pride slips away on a daily basis.
They can't provide without getting killed,
so their wives must do it.
And then the worst happens.
He's had enough.
Just wants to be a man again.
This...
This is one of the places.
Doesn't seem to be anybody around.
Let's go a little further.
Look, the further we go,
the more dangerous it gets.
Now I'm sorry, but we are going to turn around.
( engine revving )
( speaking Arabic )
( speaking Arabic )
How is she doing?
( speaking Arabic )
She wants to know where Lwendo is.
( speaking Arabic )
( speaking Arabic )
( speaking Arabic )
( speaking Arabic )
Tell her we have doctors out looking for him.
( speaking Arabic )
Her children.
They're here. I'll get them.
Come on. Your mother's awake.
( speaking Arabic )
( speaking Arabic )
( whispers ): What's he asking?
Asking if we have weapons.
We don't have any weapons.
( loudly ): We don't have any weapons.
We're doctors. ( speaking Arabic )
( speaking Arabic ) A woman was raped, we're here trying to find...
He said shut up and so do I.
Okay, I'm just saying they can help us.
John...
( speaking Arabic )
( speaking Arabic )
( speaking Arabic )
( speaking Arabic )
Look, John, there's a lot of corruption.
The government, the military, the police, everybody.
They could have helped us. They could have helped us.
Yes, but then the U.S. would prefer to have conversations
with criminals like Salah Gosh.
Who's Salah Gosh?
Your government flew him to Washington to get intel
on the war on terrorism.
They wouldn't be able to do that
if they started pissing off Bashir.
Wouldn't be able to get our hands
on the oil out here, either.
( chuckles )
So let's go a little farther.
It is too late.
A little farther, please.
No. We are going back.
( groans )
What?
What? What is going on with you?
It's not cholera, is it?
I'm fine.
Cirrhosis.
Spironolactone.
You have hepatitis.
Schistosomiasis as a child.
Left me with a few liver granulomas.
What is that?
It could be them, huh?
( sighs )
So what happens now?
He'll get booked,
probably post bail.
My dad's going away, isn't he?
( sighs )
( shuts engine off )
( whispering ): John?
( sighs nervously )
( men shouting in distance )
( whispering ): John!
( voices grow louder )
( soldiers laughing and speaking in Arabic )
( screaming )
( soldiers laughing )
( whispering ): We've got to go back.
There's nothing we can do.
They'll kill him.
They will kill us, too.
( birds calling )
( shouting in Arabic )
( shouting in Arabic )
Stay still, John.
Say nothing.
( speaking Arabic )
( soldiers laughing )
( repeats phrase in Arabic )
( soldier shouts back in Arabic )
( laughter )
( repeats phrase in Arabic )
( shouting in Arabic )
( laughter )
( shouting in Arabic )
( shouts command )
( laughter )
( truck door slams )
( two gunshots )
( third gunshot )
Lwendo?
Lwendo, stay with me.
Stay with me.
We got multiple GSWs to the chest, flank and leg.
Bag the femoral artery, I need a clamp.
John?
Start an IV.
It is one hour to camp,
and another two to the surgical hospital.
John?
Don't worry, Lwendo,
we're gonna get you back to camp.
Ah!
Damn it!
I need some suction.
I need to intubate him.
We can't even do that at the clinic.
I lost the pulse.
John?
( weakly ): Vic?
Vicee?
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, you're awake.
You're awake, baby.
I was so worried about you.
What happened?
You don't remember?
Gunshots.
Yes, yes.
And Bobby...
Bobby shot me?
That's right.
That's right-- you think you can tell the police that?
Is he in jail?
No. No, not yet, not yet.
But we're going to be okay.
And how long am I going to be...
How long am I going to be like this?
Ah, baby, it's just going to be a little while longer,
about a week or two-- and your moms is coming up
to take you home.
Oh, not my mom, Vic, please.
It's just going to be for a little while, that's all.
You got to do it.
We're still going to be together though, right?
Don't you leave me now, jerk.
We're gonna be okay. We're gonna be okay.
You just take it easy, all right?
I'm gonna get your doctor.
Okay.
( sighs )
Um, I'm headed out.
Somebody coming to pick you up?
Yeah, I'm going to stay with my aunt for a while.
Hey, KJ.
Look, um...
I feel bad about all this.
But you got to understand...
It's not your fault.
I mean, every time my dad picked me up from school,
I could smell the alcohol on him.
He's going to get the help he needs.
Thanks to you.
KJ...
Look, all my dad's other boys,
they just help him get out of trouble,
but you're the only one
that makes him step up and take responsibility.
That means a lot, Dr. Pratt.
A lot.
All right, man.
Damn. What was all that about?
How is the kid?
There was a tear in the mesentery,
which opened up a small artery.
Easily controlled once we got in there.
So he's okay? Yeah.
He didn't drop his pressure, he didn't code on the table?
No, Pratt, the case went well.
All right, thank you.
Look, I'm sorry.
You were right, I should have listened to you.
Oh, forget about it.
He tolerated the anesthesia okay?
Yeah. All right, good.
What's going on? Nothing.
You're lying. What's up?
I, uh...
I know who hit that kid, and it's all my fault.
What do you mean it's your fault?
The cops brought in a friend of mine a while ago
for a blood alcohol level.
I drew my own blood, switched the tubes.
What?
He swore to me he was going to get help.
That kid almost died!
You just said he was fine.
He's got a pulverized leg.
He needed blood transfusions.
He's going to be on a ventilator.
He's going to be in the hospital for weeks.
You call that fine?
All right, I made a mistake.
Look, Darnell's not a bad guy.
Just, at the time, it seemed like him going to jail
for a DUI wasn't going to help anybody.
It would have helped Jose Rodriguez.
He wouldn't be in the hospital now.
I made him turn himself in.
You think that's enough?
So now what?
You gonna tell Kovac or something?
You got your friend to own up to what he did.
Take your own advice.
How about Celine or Jewel?
Have you been going through your CD collection again?
I love Jewel.
Well, yeah, me, too, I guess,
but not for a name.
What about Charo?
( chuckling ): Or Liberace?
How about we give him the name
of the first person who walks through the door?
Seriously? Sure.
Okay.
Well, maybe not.
Hey, what's up?
That's great news about Jodie.
Thanks.
We were all happy to hear it.
Maybe now you can put me back on the schedule, huh?
Give me a sec. Mm-hmm.
Hey, Vic.
You need to undergo an evaluation
by the Impaired Physician Committee.
Come on, you're not serious, are you?
Medical, drug testing, psych.
You're serious.
Yeah, well, I don't need that, okay?
I do.
Okay, fine, fine.
Whatever you need, man, I'll do it for you, okay?
Okay.
You son of a bitch.
You're screwed, buddy-- oh, yeah,
'cause she's upstairs telling the cops right now
everything you're doing.
Right now, that's right.
We're gonna get you, you hear me?
We're gonna get you.
( car horn honking )
Hey!
( tires screeching ) Son of a bitch!
I can't get Gada to rest.
She's inside with the children.
Look.
DEBBIE: She won't have to wait too long.

CARTER: What is he saying?
It's from the Koran.
"From the earth, God created you."
( man continues in Arabic )
"To the earth, God will return you."
( man continues )
"From the earth, God will bring you out again."
