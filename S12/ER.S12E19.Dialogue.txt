Previously on ER.
Change the orders.
This means war, you know.
Look, we never talked about being monogamous.
We never said anything about not being monogamous.
The surgery is gonna take away my crutch. Who will I be then?
You're sending me to Africa? Yeah.
How did you get in here?
I got lots of experience
getting into dumps like this, Vic.
( clearing throat )
Hey, this is Jody.
Leave a message and I'll call you back.
Hey, Jodes.
Yeah, I know it's late there
and you're probably sleeping and whatnot.
I just wanted to call and say hi. Yeah.
Yeah, well, board's a mess and it's the usual.
Bunch of lowlifes.
Yeah. I don't know when I'm going to get out.
Yeah, you know, I heard, I heard you got six inches.
Of snow.
Yeah. In April.
Go figure, huh?
Alright, um...
I'll call you tomorrow.
I love you. Bye.
Dr. Clemente?
Lateral decubitus on the coin ingestion.
Dr. Lockhart said
that we could discharge.
Hey, who are you?
Uh, I'm Jane.
I'm an intern.
Hey, how come I never seen you before... Jane?
I... I don't know.
I mostly work nights.
I work nights.
And?
Did you want to see these?
Thought you were gone two hours ago.
I'm a dedicated guy.
What can I say, huh?
Want to help me stock some shelves?
Do I want to help you what?
Dr. Clemente.
Dr. Pratt for you on line two.
It's about time.
Hey, Pratski.
Hey, I got
a patient here, Ottley,
claims that you promised him some Vicodin?
That's right. He came in with a migraine.
I resolved it with imitrex
I told him I'd give him Vicodin in case the pain came back.
I think he's playing us,
drug-seeking and whatnot.
Vic, write him the scrip, man.
Hey, you know, you know what I was thinking the other day?
Remember the time on top of the roof?
Where we talked. Remember that?
What's the matter with you?
Is Jody okay?
Yeah, Jody's great, she's great.
It's just, uh...
It's just her ex, Bobby, keeps sending these weird
freaking sympathy cards.
This one, the latest, was filled
with this bunch of little dead goldfish.
What?!
What's he trying to tell me?
That whole "sleeps with the fishes" thing?
Okay, look. I think you should give Mr. Ottley his drugs,
go home and get some sleep.
Alright?
Okay. Alright. Alright.
Thanks, man. Thanks. Okay.
You have fun in the motherland,
alright? Right.
Two Vicodin? That's it?
Dr. Pratt said... Yeah, well, Dr. Pratt's not here, okay, Mr. Ottley?
What if my migraine comes back?
Well, you take those and you call
your regular doctor in the morning
Okay? You got any more questions?
Hey, Jer, what else you got for me?
Possibly the slowest night on record
and I... am out of here.
You going? Yeah.
Well, hang on, hang on. I'll, I'll go with you. Alright.
You want to go to Ike's and grab a beer?
I would but actually I'm waiting on a friend to pick me up.
That's alright, he can join us.
What's the big deal?
Well, uh...
It's actually a friend of the female variety.
Ah, I gotcha. Gotcha. Right. Right.
Next time.
Okay.
Yeah. So, um, I'll be going then.
Okay. Goodnight.
Take it easy.
( men laughing )
( footsteps approaching )
You want to take me on you little prick?!
You want to take me out? Is that it?!
Okay. You did it.
I can't believe I'm done.
Happy graduation day.
Looking forward to getting back to work?
I've been back for about a week,
trying to keep up with my paperwork.
Well.
Here's one thing you don't need
to keep up with anymore.
Thanks for everything.
Ah.
Abdominal breathing. 10 reps a day.
Okay.
Lenore Bee, 43, ten foot fall from a second story window.
Are we here? W-what're we doing?
What happened to the 12 year-old?
Morris, why are you wearing...? A Prada suit?
No reason. Is-is he a doctor? I want him.
Dr. Archie Morris at your service, ma'am.
12-year-old MVC complains of tenderness over the sternum.
What's your name? Ruthie Pooler.
You got this? Yeah.
( dog barks ) Oh, and you get to have this, too.
And I recommend a face mask. Damn mutt farted all way here.
Abdominal pain, low-grade fever.
Doc was worried about appendicitis,
so he figured he'd get a surgical consult.
The guy seems fine to me.
Kovac.
Nice to see you again.
You didn't need to come in here, Grandma.
Of course I needed to.
My eyes don't hurt.
I'm checking for signs of head trauma.
I was only going like two miles an hour.
You were driving?
Did you know about that?
RUTHIE: Did you tell
your family everything you did when you were 12?
I did not know.
I wanted to pick up your prescriptions and still
get to school before first period. Let me see.
What about your parents?
Oh, uh, Ruthie's mother and father died
when she was six months old.
I was about a year, Grandma.
I'm sorry. ( coughing )
I would be, too, if I remembered.
( dog farts )
( both laughing )
Oh. Bob, ooh, he's a regular
wind tunnel this morning, isn't he?
Ruthie, we're gonna keep you here
for a little while for observation.
Grandma, maybe Dr... Lockhart
can ask you about your cough.
Sure, we can check that out.
What about the dog?
Oh, uh, I think it's his diet.
No, no. Uh, he can't be here, even temporarily.
Is there someplace where you can keep him?
So should I call the SPCA?
Oh! Bob's 13 years old.
Don't get me wrong-- I support the SPCA.
but, they take him,
I'm stuck here a day or two
and for some reason my Grandma can't get him out,
they may put him down.
So if Bob goes...
I go with him.
You're sure you don't want this?
HALEH: You'll be sorry.
Lenore, did you lose consciousness?
No, Dr. Archie. I remember everything.
Cleaning my windows...
Next thing I know, bam! Fell out
right smack dab in the middle.
Gotta worry about the spleen?
Good bowel sounds, slightly tender
in the left upper quadrant.
She on meth?
Okay, possible left tenth rib fracture.
Whoa. Whoa.
Whoa... kay!
You know...
You know what?
If you don't mind.
You want me to hold it?
What's with the suit, man?
Uh, you know what? Keep this on the QT,
but I took a job with Ladokern Pharmaceuticals.
Doesn't start till July 1st but, uh... signing bonus.
Always been my dream: pushing over-priced meds
to people who probably don't even need them.
Always been to hold Dr. Archie's coat.
Okay.
Trauma panel, c-spine, chest.
Page Surgery and let's get an ultrasound.
Will Ruthie's X-rays only take a little while?
Only about 30 minutes.
Isn't that what you said?
Yeah, something like that.
Will you take another deep breath in?
( inhales, coughs )
How long have you had that cough?
Oh, about three or four years.
Since Jimmy Carter was president, I guess.
Since you wished Jimmy Carter
was president, right, Grandma?
I write his name in every time.
Still waiting for Radiology. Shouldn't be too much longer.
Thanks.
Don't worry, dear, they said it would only take
about 30 minutes.
Can you remind me again, when was
Jimmy Carter elected?
I think it was back... Mrs. Pooler?
Well, sometime before this latest bozo.
Oh, thank you.
You know, I don't much like any of them.
You want to know why?
I don't think Dr. Lockhart cares much about our politics.
Stamps.
The price of stamps.
They all keep raising them.
This latest increase-- can you believe it?
19 cents for first class.
19 cents?
Come on, Grandma.
You know it's gone up a lot more than that.
Yeah, I know, I know,
but I don't like to think about it.
If Ruthie has to stay in here,
it won't be more than a couple days, right?
'Cause I really do want her home for Easter.
Grandma...
I think Easter was last week.
Well, I certainly hope not.
We're picking up the ham on Saturday.
We got four cases backed up in the O.R.,
so this had better be real.
I'm Dr. Albright, from Surgery.
Does your belly hurt?
I guess so. Here you go.
Fluid in Morrison's pouch?
That looks like it.
Blood anterior to the bladder and in the splenorenal recess.
I've seen enough.
Prep her for the O.R.
I think we should get a C.T. She's unstable. She's anemic.
Could be chronic.
She's hypotensive.
BP normalized with a liter.
She's bleeding in her belly. End of story.
Get her upstairs.
Guess you told her.
Repeat the hemocue,
get a serum albumin and a urine protein.
Yeah, but that could take...
Yes, Haleh, it could.
KOVAC: Sam, just wanted
to give you a head's up.
Steve's in Exam 2 now. I know.
Hey, we can get another nurse. It's okay.
Luka, thank you.
I can handle it.
Hey, Sam.
They thought it was appendicitis?
Yeah. I was in a lot of pain on the drive over,
but I feel okay now.
I figured they'd assign me another nurse.
Just doing my job.
So things are going pretty well, huh?
Alex writes me a lot of letters now.
Yeah, I know. Your temp's 99.4.
I'm happy for you, Sam.
New job, new place to live...
What's with the cross?
Oh, the chaplain gave it to me.
You keeping up on your Bible studies?
Yeah. Picking up a thing or two.
And it doesn't hurt that those are the guys that watch your back.
Your B.P.'s 124/80.
That's good, right?
It's normal.
You think I'm faking this pain, don't you?
A lot of guys do just so they can get out.
Yeah.
I can't say I blame them.
There's one thing you can say about jail--
it's everything it's cracked up to be.
One of the docs will be in to check you out.
with abdominal pain-- rule out appy.
Oh, we got a "detainee"?
Pain was ten out of ten. Now it's resolved.
Resolved? That's convenient.
Dr. Clemente, I feel I should tell you
that Mr. Curtis and Sam...
Neela.
It's my ex-- my kid's dad.
Oh, wow. That must be really tough
on your little boy, huh?
It is what it is.
Hello, Mr. Curtis. I'm Dr. Clemente.
You feeling any tenderness at all anywhere?
No. It's better now.
His white count's 10,000.
Well, that's not very impressive at all, now, is it?
Pulse is down after a liter.
It was pretty painful for a while.
Oh, yeah? Could be the stomach flu though, right?
That kind of thing can run rampant
through half the population.
Close quarters? You're a riot.
Anyway, anyway... You're feeling better, right?
And Dr. Rasgotra here will sign you out.
He has a low grade fever.
Maybe we should observe him for a bit.
It's barely a low grade fever. Please.
CBC shows a left shift.
Yeah, but there's no leukocytosis.
Look, I can appreciate these guys wanting
to get out of the can now and then,
but we're not running a time-share here, okay?
Just release him.
I'm sorry if you didn't want me
to mention your relationship.
That's okay. I just don't like people protecting me.
You want to write up his aftercare?
No. Repeat the CBC.
You don't have to do that for me.
I'm not doing it for you.
His history tells me to do it.
History? What? Lies and deception?
You never really thought he was sick?
I don't know. Clemente examined him and released him.
He's a patient like anyone else.
Repeat the CBC.
So it's not Alzheimer's?
No. But there are similarities
in how it affects people.
And, with this type of dementia,
it can sometimes progress very quickly.
But that means sometimes it can be slow.
Ruthie, let the doctor talk.
There are some concerns, Mrs. Pooler,
about your ability to take care of Ruthie--
to make decisions, to cook...
I can cook. I can make decisions.
Like you did about driving this morning?
And Social Services
is going to want to talk to you.
Most likely, they're going to want to discuss
putting Ruthie into foster care.
They can't do that!
You can't do that! That's not fair!
We're not going to let them.
Ruthie... I don't take the car very much.
And I've never hit anything before.
I know everything she needs--
all of her prescriptions:
Neurontin,
300 milligrams, twice a day,
Diltiazem, 240 milligrams a day,
Stop. Lanoxin, .125 milligrams a day.
Stop it now.
RUTHIE: Please, please, don't let this happen.
I don't want anything to change.
Ruthie, when your mama and daddy died,
I thought that nothing would ever be the same.
And then we took
the worst possible moments,
and we turned it into years and years
of the best possible moments.
Didn't we?
Yes.
Now, I know that, at least about this one thing,
Grandma is not confused, am I?
No.
( chuckling ): No. That's my girl.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, okay, so you don't want me to hold the coat this time?
Had a little talk with myself this afternoon.
I said, "Archie, you... You know what?
"You are Dr. Archie Morris.
You don't need no stinking Prada suit."
What did you spill?
Coffee.
A little numbing medicine here, Lenore.
Morris, what the hell are you doing?
Peritoneal aspirate.
Is your name Morris ?
Her crit was stable,
so I decided to do...
I have been waiting for half an hour.
I discovered she's been on lithium for a year.
Oh, and that changes everything?
Not quite everything, but...
Whoa, whoa. Wait.
She's prepped and draped.
And bleeding internally. What's going on?
Wait, wait. The lithium could cause nephrotic syndrome.
Tell me something I don't know. Okay, her hypotension
could be vasovagal from the rib pain.
Oh, you want to make that assumption?
Where... where am I going?
Hold on, honey-- they're figuring it out.
She may not need the O.R. You know what?
I feel very strongly about this, Dr. Albright. Oh, you do, do you?
Yes, I do.
Morris!
Wow. Wow.
Straw-colored fluid,
not blood.
It's ascites, from nephrotic syndrome.
She doesn't need surgery.
She needs steroids and a kidney biopsy.
Hey. Double trauma pulling up
if you're looking for some action.
No. I got to head upstairs.
Dr. Morris, sorry we missed you in your suit. How did you know about my suit?
I know everything. Everything?
Dr. Weaver, don't suppose I can get you
to look at this open tib-fib in Four?
Sorry, Chuny. I'm not on today.
Okay.
Dr. Weaver. Dr. Albright.
ABBY: Don't worry about it. I'm handling it.
You haven't even called Social Services yet.
I didn't say that. I said they put me on hold.
Do you really think you're going to make things easier
by... by keeping them around?
No. Well, it's not easy.
They've always had each other.
I know, and it's horribly sad,
but it can't stay that way.
Well, we don't know that 100% for sure, do we?
That woman has bilateral lacunar infarcts.
She's going to decompensate,
sooner rather than later.
And what? She's going to raise a 12-year-old?
Well, a very mature 12-year-old
that seems, so far, to have done
a very good job of holding it together.
They're a family, Luka.
Why aren't we fighting for that?
Kids shouldn't be caretakers.
Sometimes they have to be.
Look, I know, in Croatia,
you grew up like Ozzie and Harriet.
And I'm sorry. I know you probably
don't even know what Ozzie and Harriet is.
But whatever. The thing is, yes,
it's going to get harder and harder,
but that doesn't mean, they're not better off together.
Like you were better off with your mother?
Sorry.
You know, that girl is healthy, she's in school,
she's in a loving environment.
The grandmother is still functioning.
She can still handle her ADLs.
Yeah, for now If you had asked me when I was 12,
if I wanted to be taken away from my mother,
I would have said no. It's not our job to let 12-year-olds decide.
Ruthie.
Hey, Ruthie! Stop!
Very mature.
FRANK: Neela, your repeat blood work
is back on your no doubt unfairly-prosecuted,
wrongly-incarcerated rule out appy.
Hey. I told you to discharge him, didn't I?
His white count's up to 12,000.
Big deal. So what?
If his appendix burst on the way here,
his pain might've been relieved. We should see if he declares.
He's got to go.
Temperature's up to 100.4.
Could be an appy. Right.
No way. It's impossible.
Let me take a look.
The initial exam could've been done
in the post-perforation window.
He'd have signs of peritonitis.
Takes a while to develop.
Steve.
Hey, Steve. Oh, Sammy...
He's diaphoretic. Barely has a pulse.
Alright, two liters wide open. Put him in trendelenberg.
Can you get his cuffs off?! Alright.
Abdomen's rigid as a board.
It was soft. Pressure's 70 palp.
He's going to need a second I.V.
Alright, give him a gram of cefoxitin.
You gonna take him to the O.R.?
If we get his pressure up. He's septic. Mix up dopamine.
Run a V-tach. Okay, get the crash cart!
Hey, how are you?
I wasn't faking it.
Yeah, I know.
Hey, Rasgotra, Barney Fife here wants to know
how long you're going to be detaining his detainee.
I was thinking, as long as possible?
Yes, that will be correct.
( phone rings )
Yeah?
BOBBY: Been working pretty long hours, Vic.
Getting any sleep?
Bobby, I'm not doing this.
You hear me? I'm not doing it, man!
I been wanting to talk to you.
Even stopped by to drop something off,
but there was this sheriff's van outside.
What'd you do, go and hire protection?
I'm not playing your game.
You hear me? I'm not playing your little games.
Okay. Calm down, buddy. I'll let you go.
Oh, and one last thing, though.
What time you going home tonight?
Where's Dr. Lockhart?
I would have to check.
Could you please tell her Ruthie Pooler's here
and I'll be in with my grandmother, Exam Three? Sure.
Any word from Social Services?
I think Dr. Lockhart called them,
but no one's been down yet.
It just I haven't been getting any sleep lately.
And the thing is that I've been really, really needing some.
Things have been kind of rocky since
Jody and all that.
She okay? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
She's, she's great. She's great.
It's just...
I'm just wondering can you write me a scrip for some Ambien?
Is herbal tea not working?
Ha, ha, very funny. Did you ask your doctor?
Docs don't have docs, you know that.
Abby, thank you. Thank you.
I really, I really appreciate it.
I really do. Sure.
What'd you give me, two?
Is that it, just two?
Yeah. Tonight, tomorrow night
and I'm sure by the next day
you'll have your very own primary care physician.
Hey, uh, Ruthie Pooler's back. She's looking for you.
She's in the room. Thanks, Jerry.
Come on, Abby, you're killing me.
Try those nature CDs, birds chirping, waves crashing.
I wasn't running away.
I didn't think you were.
I didn't think you would leave your grandmother.
Or your dog.
Ruthie, believe me,
I know it's not going to be easy.
Keys to my grandmother's car.
"L" passes, three months worth.
Italian Cooking Made Simple.
Rachel Ray's 30-Minute Meals.
Better Food For Dogs.
This one's for Bob.
This one's for us.
I can do this, Dr. Lockhart.
We can do this.
You know, for this to happen,
Social Services is going to have to follow up with you
probably once a week.
You're going to need
home healthcare workers probably every day.
You said it wasn't going to be easy.
ER.
Don't you ever pull that crap on me again!
Excuse me. Excuse me. Last time I looked, I was right.
You were lucky.
A hypertensive patient with a low crit
and a positive ultrasound always needs surgery.
It was vasovagal, chronic anemia and it was ascites.
I saved your ass. She could have bled to death!
You would have sliced her open on a table for no good reason!
( gasping )
Hey, Jerry.
Olivia, how you doing?
Where are we?
Pick your poison. Trauma One or Two.
Thanks. Uh, Dr. Pratt
dropped this off for you before he took off for the airport.
They're lovely.
Too bad they're not mine.
(male on speakers) 'Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. This is Captain Balisma..'
Hey. Here you go.
Thank you.
Here you go, sir. Vodka tonic.
Thank you very much.
You're welcome.
How you doing?
I'm Greg Pratt.
Fatima Abakar.
Nice name.
So if you don't mind me asking,
what's taking you to Khartoum?
I live there. Ah.
Work for the government, Ministry of Education.
Wow. I'm a doctor.
An emergency physician, actually,
and I'm on my way to Darfur to do some work
at one of the refugee camps.
You mean IDP camp.
They're not refugees, they're IDPs--
"internally displaced persons."
Right, right.
Why?
Why what?
Why are you going?
Um, I don't know.
Something new, I guess.
You know, something different.
And you've read up on Darfur?
Oh, yeah.
It's a lot.
Yeah, well, I work in Chicago,
a county ER,
and I've treated hundreds of gunshot wounds,
knife wounds, domestic violence.
I think I know my way around.
AIDS, malaria, dysentery.
Two million people homeless,
not to mention the nearly 400,000 already slaughtered,
boys, babies, tossed onto bonfires,
women and young girls raped,
sometimes by men, sometimes by bayonet.
The work of gangs, all things you have seen.
But in Darfur,
it's political and on a massive scale.
And while this insanity rages on and on and on,
the rest of the world continues its debate--
"Is it or is it not genocide?"
This is not debate, this is paralysis.
Can you treat that, Dr. Pratt?
Can you cure paralysis?
( speaking Arabic )
I don't speak Arabic, only English.
What, where are you working?
Yeah, I'm going to work in a refugee...
an IDP camp, Dumtala.
I'm a doctor.
( speaks Arabic )
( replies in Arabic )
( speaks Arabic )
Is there a problem?
( The Beach Boys' "California Girls" playing )
Ibrahim, you're going to run the battery down.
Come on. We need you.
Assalaam alaikum.
Alaikum salaam.
I was wondering if you could help us, Mr...
( speaking Arabic )
Mudawi.
Mr. Mudawi, we're here to pick up that gentleman right over there.
It'd been easier if they had someone who could speak English.
Yeah, the whole language thing, very inconvenient.
Giving me the third degree over a paperback.
They wanted to confiscate it
like it's the Nazi master plan or something.
Guess they don't put much money into road work.
I'm just going to assume you're being facetious.
Doesn't look like they put much money into anything.
Money's not the real currency around here, Pratt.
Life's about a little bit of food, a little bit of firewood.
Safety is the scarcest resource of all.
Well, it's hot as hell.
Got any cold sodas or waters in this cooler?
Oxytocin,
measles, Hep "B" and tetanus vaccines.
( sighs )
( "I Got You, Babe" plays )
* They say we're young and we don't know *
( hums ) * ...until we grow
* Well, I don't know if all that's true *
* You got me, and baby, I got you *
I can't believe it, we're in the middle of nowhere
and this cat's got Sonny and Cher.
Ibrahim speaks English, Pratt.
* I got you babe
Hey, sorry about that, man. How you doing?
* I got you babe
* They say our love won't pay the rent *
* They say our love won't pay the rent.. *
Whoa, what the hell is that?
Keep driving. Slowly.
Maybe they won't stop us.
Who are these guys?
Janjaweed.
( speaks Arabic )
Don't do anything, don't say anything.
( speaking Arabic )
( speaking Arabic )
No, no, no!
( speaks Arabic )
It's okay. No.
I'm not leaving you. He won't hurt me.
I'm not leaving.
( yells in Arabic )
( speaks Arabic )
( speaking Arabic )
He's not Sudanese.
He's an ex-pat doctor only here to help, He has no gun.
We're on our way to Dumtala camp.
Pratt tell him. Pratt! What?
Tell him who you are in English.
Tell him!
I'm a doctor, we're all doctors.
We're on our way to the Dumtala camp to help the sick people.
We're not armed. We have no guns.
We're only here to help.
( yells in Arabic )
Okay, Ibrahim, let me take a look, man.
Ouch!
Okay, okay, okay.
Yep, it might be broken.
No septal hematoma, so you'll be okay.
Just pinch it, keep the pressure on.
Ah!
Radio's no good.
Yeah, what a surprise.
What are you looking for, a phone booth?
Who feels like walking?
Mouthwash.
You got to be kidding me.
You're a weird dude, Pratt.
Ow.
( grunts, groans ): Ah.
( baby crying )
( crying )
Shh...
Shh...
( loud groaning )
You need some help?
( yelling in Arabic )
What? No, take it easy, relax. I'm a doctor.
Take it easy, rel... whoa!
Sorry, sorry.
Um... I'm a doctor.
Do you speak English? Do you need some help?
Actually, I think it is you that needs some help.
I'm Steven Dakarai, medical director here.
Right.
Nice to meet you, I'm Greg Pratt.
I know.
I was trying to see if I could do anything.
The girl was raped.
It is a custom here that only women
take care of those patients.
But don't worry, Zahra is an excellent nurse.
She will handle it. Yeah.
Come.
So...
you just got here.
And not easily I heard.
Well, that's one way of putting it. ( chuckles )
The Janjaweed, generally they do not hurt the doctors
or the NGO workers.
But one never knows what might happen.
You okay?
I caught myself a stomach virus.
You must be careful what you eat here.
Here you go.
That's the best we could come up with.
We don't have a supply sergeant here. Thank you.
We will take up a collection for you later.
Dr. Carter,
This young girl outside
wants us to check her grandmother in the camp.
What's the problem?
She's got vomiting and diarrhea, too weak to walk.
Hey, Greg. Want to take a ten cent tour?
Yeah, sure. I'll be right out.
I'd offer to come, but these IV poles,
they don't run so well in the sand.
Hey. Hey.
Hey, Pratt,
how are your feet?
Still working.
See you later.
So Debbie and Dakarai, huh?
Yeah, they're an item.
So tell me the news. What's the news from County?
Uh, well, Susan Lewis left.
She took a job over in Iowa City.
Yeah, I talked to her.
She thinks she got kind of screwed.
She did. So now we got this guy named Clemente.
He's the new attending.
Frank calls him "Dr. Schizo."
He's really not a bad guy, he's just...
I don't know, a little nutty.
And the R2s?
Well, we're still keeping our fingers crossed
that they don't kill anybody.
Even Abby?
She's always ahead of the rest.
Her and Kovac are back together again.
Really?
( chuckles )
Yeah, and they're about to have a baby.
Wow, that's news.
That's great news. I'm happy for them.
Yeah, I'm going to have to send them something.
From here? Good luck with that.
( yelling )
( yelling in Arabic )
Ishaak, what happened?!
He went too close to the village by himself.
They took him off his horse.
( clamoring )
( yelling )
They're beating the hell out of the guy.
Stay back. Pratt, let Ishaak handle it.
( yelling )
( yelling )
( yelling )
( yelling )
Is that vodka or gin?
Something like that.
Little green food coloring...
That's a good trick.
Yeah, well...
I'm a guy who really knows his way around.
( speaks Arabic )
Welcome to Darfur.
