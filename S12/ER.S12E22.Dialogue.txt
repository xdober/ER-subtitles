Previously on ER:
What's with the cross?
Oh, the chaplain gave it to me.
You keeping up on your Bible studies?
I wasn't faking it.
Yeah, I know.
Take it off me!
Get it off me! Hey, hey, hey!
Weaver knew he had problems before she hired him.
Now we're paying for it.
Well, Luka, it's your E.R.
Have you any idea why Michael went back to Iraq?
The boy is his father's son.
Soldier's got to go where they tell him to.
Why don't you explain why he's
not here with his wife?
The secretary of the Army
would like to express his deepest regret.
that your husband, Captain Michael Gallant
was killed in action in Iraq on April 29th.
JERRY: So we can't even
send anything, or... Flowers, donations?
There's going to be a memorial next week.
For today, Neela and the Gallants,
they want to have a private graveside ceremony, family only.
And you.
Yeah, that's right.
She needs somebody to lean on right now.
Plus, Mike and I were tight.
Well, let her know we're all with her.
And tell her not to even think
about coming back to work until she's ready.
All right. Look, I should get out of here.
A car's picking me up.
I need to be up there by 9:00.
Dr. Weaver, that was Dr. Anspaugh's office.
He's waiting for you upstairs.
Dr. Weaver? Yeah.
This is Mary Warner.
She's an EMT trainee from Mitchelson.
Hiya.
My program sent me over to spend the day
taking vitals or whatever... for credit.
Of course. Somebody needs to sign this
at the end of the shift to say I was here
and did stuff. What would you like to do with her?
Uh, let her shadow,
see how different nurses do the primary.
Yeah, that's what my instructor suggested.
Well, patients come in through the triage desk here.
Waiting's out there and ambulance runs
come in just outside those doors there.
Right, I got it.
How long have you wanted to be an EMT?
Oh, not long, actually.
Got tired of retail.
Christmas sucked.
Sam.
This is Mary Warner.
She's studying to be an EMT. Hey.
I've got to irrigate a full-body road rash
on an unfortunate Vespa driver.
I got the mother of all meth mouths here.
So can you let Mary observe you for a while?
Haleh...
I'll come get her as soon as I'm free.
Haleh... Bye.
Yuck.
Yep. That's the magic of meth.
Corrosive substances in the drug eat away
at the tooth enamel.
Plus, I have a feeling Mike here hasn't been flossing.
Have you, Mike?
It's not really a priority.
Dude, you got to floss every day.
Hey. Hey.
So, uh, how's she doing?
I left her some messages, but I haven't heard back.
Amazingly well, actually.
Yeah, she's tougher than she looks, huh?
Hmm. Yeah.
I'll try calling her again.
Ray, I, I think she needs some space, man.
Yeah, but I just thought that...
Look, she...
I just don't that think you should...
What?
Complicate it.
You Dr. Pratt?
Yeah, that's right.
Where's Neela? Dr. Rasgotra has asked
that we go on to the cemetery without her.
She said she's not feeling up to it today.
( clattering )
( paper rustling )
( Kovac speaking Croatian )
( Kovac sighs )
( clattering )
Hey.
Bob Vila, look out.
( sighs ): It's not finished yet.
Looks pretty finished to me.
( chuckles ) ( groans )
Well, either I've been sleeping for days,
or you're working really fast.
How is the insomnia?
Ah, I kept thinking about Gallant and Clemente.
( sighs )
It's a lot.
I, uh, I went with yellow,
because we don't know is it going to be blue or pink.
What's it going to be, huh?
Blue or pink? Hello?
Is it just me, or are pandas kind of creepy?
They're terrifying.
Hey, steady.
( speaking Croatian )
Listen, I know we don't say it,
because I guess it's just how we are,
but I hope you know how much I love... this.
All of this.
But since we are on the cusp
of this hugely life-altering event,
and we haven't been as specific as we could be about us,
um... about our relationship...
You're right. Let's get married.
Donald. I'm sorry I'm late.
I didn't realize we were having a pre-meeting,
so I went to your office...
Have a seat.
I wanted us to talk prior to the session
with the medical executive committee.
The fallout from Clemente
may be more significant than I thought.
I've been hearing things.
What kind of things?
This is a letter from an attorney
representing Mr. Fred Fong, a patient
Clemente saw a few weeks back.
Yes, diabetic with a gangrenous toe.
I reviewed the case.
Ended up needing an amputation.
A reasonable outcome for which Vic was completely blameless.
The family sees an opportunity.
You know, can we, uh, talk in private?
I'm sorry.
Hospital policy.
I need this
conversation documented.
Dr. Clemente was cleared
by the Impaired Physicians' Committee.
He never once tested positive for drugs.
I don't believe he ever
compromised patient care.
I'm not sure that that matters.
The state board
posts a bad doctor list on their Web site
and Clemente's on it.
Any idiot with a computer can access that.
You know what, that doesn't give them legal cause.
Well, let's let the lawyers determine that, Kerry.
In the meantime, the board feels let down.
They expect their chief of staff to exercise
the utmost discretion in hiring.
I needed an attending, Donald.
I hired the best doctor I could find.
Even when you knew his past history?
What happened in Newark, last year...
I'm tired of hearing about Newark.
That was a very... very...
complicated situation, very unclear.
There were lots of unsubstantiated allegations.
You should have kept your eye on him.
You know, I'm not down there, Donald.
I don't run the ER anymore.
Which leads me to a second issue.
The board has concerns about Dr. Kovac's ability
to manage the department.
You're not serious.
Are you satisfied with the job he's doing?
He's doing the best he can with what he has.
Keep him on 100%. Six of pavulon.
Uh, I gave him Norcuron.
Fine.
Dopamine to a systolic of 100.
Did you call the ICU?
Ten minutes ago.
Okay, fine.
Let's find him a monitored bed until we get a room.
I'll put him in Two.
Cold shoulder, huh?
Well, not exactly the answer I was hoping to hear.
Well, not exactly the best proposal
I've ever heard.
How many have you heard?
Hey, hey, hey, okay. So you don't...
you don't know what you want this to be. How committed...
No, I just don't want to get married
for the sake of getting married.
I tried that once.
Don't we love each other? It's not about that.
Of course we do.
Look, don't you think
we should stay together forever?
Well, I don't know if anybody should... or can.
Paging Dr. Lockhart!
I just... Let me get through
one humongous life change at a time, okay?
Luka, got a minute?
Yeah.
Sometimes it's easier
if you lump them all together.
Hey. Hey.
How's the hip?
Good, thanks. Better all the time.
Looks like you'll be short an attending after all.
I have to attend an emergency Med Exec Committee meeting.
Risk management is coming
to advise us on the Clemente situation.
What situation? He's gone.
You know, there's potential litigation.
We're getting some heat about it.
We are getting some heat?
It's your department.
Kerry, he was your hire.
He was on staff even before I moved up to this job.
Yeah, I know that, because I'm the one who moved you up.
So what, I-I should have fired him sooner?
The warning signs were there.
You had the authority.
Am I going to lose my job over this?
Look, all I'm saying is, if I weren't Chief of Staff,
I'm not so sure you'd be Department Head,
so, let's just get through this.
Okay?
( knocking )
Neela!
You know, I'm not used to getting stood up.
I'm not going, Greg.
It's gonna be fine, I promise.
Going means saying good-bye, and saying good-bye means...
forgetting.
It doesn't have to.
Can't help it.
Started already.
I-I can't remember his... his hands.
His voice.
( sighs )
Can I come in?
I keep asking myself why he went back.
It's like a hammer in my head.
He did what he wanted to do.
What he needed to do.
It's not a bad way to go.
He was 29 years old, Greg.
He was blown up by a bomb.
It's a tragedy,
and believe me, I'm not saying it isn't,
but, Michael-- he...
he wanted to be a part of something bigger than himself.
Two months ago, I would have laughed at that,
but now...
Look, he put himself out there,
and sometimes that means taking risks,
and doing things that you could never imagine yourself doing,
because you have this crazy idea
that you just might be able to make a difference.
Nobody wants to forget Michael.
We all want to remember him,
and that's exactly what today is all about.
( sighs )
( sighs )
Smart.
Uh, efficient.
Um...
loyal friend.
Something sexier.
Sexier?
Something-Something about my-my charm.
Like, "A man whose charm with women
is matched only by his sensitivity to his patients."
Yes! Action! This is stupid.
Forget it. What?
Abs, this is it! Abs? Don't call me Abs.
I am out of here today.
You're not gonna have Archie Morris to kick around anymore.
Abs? You can't blame a guy
for wanting to carry around some fond memories.
You're not going to Kilimanjaro, Morris.
You're going to Ladokern Pharmaceuticals,
seven city blocks from here.
Six and a half.
Besides which, people don't make
memory videos unless they're getting married.
I'm a sentimental guy.
And besides which, they don't film them themselves
so the person is held hostage to say nice things.
Really? You didn't seem held hostage.
In fact, I expected better material out of you.
Well, you were feeding me lines, Fassbinder!
Oh, what was that, some kind of nasty Croatian words?
Something about me and a goat?
This is, uh, Timmy Jankowski.
Overindulged at the buffet of his school's spring pageant.
Let me guess-- fruit salad.
You must be the funny guy.
( Jerry chuckles )
School nurse brought him in, parents are on the way.
Well, seeing as this is my last day,
and seeing that I am Chief Resident, I designate
Lockhart. Excuse me?
I'm out of here in about ten hours.
I call no kids for the duration.
I'm sick of getting bit, kicked
and pissed on.
Guess you stopped dating, too, huh?
71-year-old male found slumped over in a parked car.
GCS-224. Okay.
Put him in, uh, Curtain One.
I'll try to be right back.
Take it easy, Timmy.
Easy? I'm a freakin' strawberry.
Right there.
Your stomach hurts bad, huh?
Kinda.
Hmm. Well... Here.
( grunts )
Try, uh, try pinching yourself.
Here, let me do it.
Ow. That hurts.
But you're not thinking about your stomach, now, are you?
When Mitch didn't show up for the bus trip to Bloomington,
we knew something was wrong.
They're all part
of the same church group.
Mitch.
Mitch, can you wake up for me?
We prayed and prayed, and then we started seeing things.
Everybody thought he was dead,
but we found him.
Our visions
led us right to him.
Half a mile
from the church. Can you save him?
We're gonna do our best.
Oh, thank you.
And, uh...
( sighs )
You should be very, very proud, Mr. and Mrs. Morris.
Okay, cut. Mama Morris is dead.
So can we just take that one more time?
Holly says they need us in Exam Three. Holly?
You know-- that other nurse.
Haleh? I gotta go.
Hey! The old lady in Three's still waiting on a rectal.
No, no, no, not on my last day.
No rectals, no geezers.
Are there any patients
you're actually willing to examine?
MORRIS: Yeah. Hot chicks.
I got the vitals like you asked on the medium-timer.
Mediastinum.
Mediastinal mass.
Whatever.
Had to pry her cell phone off her ear to check her temp.
Mary. She thinks I'm a bitch for taking
her phone away but you know what?
This is a hospital. We've got a job to do.
Did you write this?
BP: 28/17?
Did I do it wrong?
28/17 is practically dead,
not eating Jell-O or chatting on your cell phone.
Sorry. I'm new to this.
Is that her?
MARY: Yeah. She look dead to you?
Not right now.
Okay. Well, before you take any more vitals,
you need to know what's normal and what's not,
and if you're not sure, then get some help, okay?
Okay.
Let's see what we got here.
Hey. What do you have?
Obtunded with bradycardia.
I need point five of atropine, CBC, chem. 7, ABG, tox screen
and set up for transcutaneous pacing.
Okay, got it.
No gag, I have to tube him.
What happened to your friend?
Eight-oh and a mac two.
He must have passed out at the wheel.
Not from drinking.
He's not like that.
Atropine's in.
Have another dose ready to go and I need some suction.
Is he taking any medications? Maybe.
Maybe something for his pressure.
Yes.
Right? Pressure.
I'm in.
Heart rate's down to 38.
Damn, his IV blew.
We lost the pulse. Start compressions.
He needs to be paced.
You know CPR, right?
Uh, yeah, a little.
Good. Go.
JERRY: So how did you audition for this role?
I didn't.
I wanted to be the bad bunny.
You know, I wanted
to be the Cowardly Lion once,
but I had to play a Munchkin.
They cast you as a Munchkin?
It was before my growth spurt.
Okay, no tenderness, guarding or rebound.
Do you think you could eat a Popsicle, maybe
help settle things down? Sure.
I'll get you one.
Let me guess-- strawberry?
Oh, and here comes our trusty paramedic, Brian Dumar,
wheeling in another needy patient.
28-year-old blunt head trauma, altered LOC, vitals stable.
Bitch-sucker!
Rabid dog, I'll send you to hell!
Nasty fight in detention.
Sparring partner's right behind me.
All right, Trauma Two. Ray'll be right there.
What?
No prisoners, man. I called it. Last day.
I'll send you all to hell!
You kiss your cellmate with that mouth?
I'm right here, you dumb bastard!
...opened up a recent surgical scar.
Come and get it! Shut it, Curtis.
BP: 124/78, pulse: 98.
Does your belly hurt? Hey, put me with him.
I'll save you some trouble.
Hey, Steve, right? Nice to see you.
Recovering from an appendectomy.
Must have ripped open his stitches.
Oh, yuck.
Yeah, that's, uh, that's not good.
Dr. Ray Barnett will be right with you.
How long do I have to keep this up?
Epi infusion, 10 mikes per minute.
( shouting ) He's very healthy, Mitch is. Even virile.
Okay, tell me.
Bradycardic arrest.
No response to atro.
No capture with pacing.
What are you doing?
CPR.
You can't possibly hope to perfuse the brain that way.
Fuse the what?
Okay step back.
Step back.
Who is she?
Who are you?
That's Mary. She's an EMT trainee.
She's shadowing the nurses today.
Then you should be showing her the right way to do things.
Okay, Mary, I'm Dr. Kovac. I'm the attending physician here
and the ER chief,
so let me train you a bit.
100 times a minute, and you should
really compress the chest.
There'll be a military honor, as requested.
I didn't request that.
Colonel and Mrs. Gallant requested it, ma'am.
Sounds like something he might want.
After the ceremony, we'll, uh, head out
to the reception in Lincoln Park.
"Canapés will be served."
It'll be ready in a half an hour.
Sedation's wearing off. He's trying to self-extubate.
Okay. Give him a few minutes,
then you can pull it, send him up.
Hey, Luka, can I get a minute? Yeah, sure.
His heart's beating well now.
He looks good.
You hear, Mitch?
You're okay.
Probably took too many pills by accident.
Well, he gets confused sometimes.
Can we go now?
Take him home?
No, probably not for a couple of days.
Something the matter?
Well, there's something bad here. I can feel it.
Yeah. I feel that every day.
Is everything all right with your baby?
It's fine.
Are you a believer, dear?
You must be very brave, then.
I could never have brought a child
into this world if I didn't have faith.
In a higher power.
In a higher power.
BOTH: Amen.
I'm sorry about in there.
You're a senior nurse.
I expect you to know what's going on around you.
I want you to be exact about the meds.
I know. It's...
just that that girl is kind of dragging me down.
I'm sure you'll whip her into shape.
My bad, I guess.
He sure is a Gloomy Gus.
He needs to lighten up a bit, doesn't he?
It's his department.
Hey, Sam.
You got a minute?
I may have to tube this guy.
I need you to draw up induction meds.
Steve's here?
Yeah, he got in a little jail yard altercation,
but he's okay.
Belly's benign. Looks like it's superficial dehiscence.
Does he need anything?
Look, I'll get somebody else to redress the wounds, okay?
Uh, I'll get you a CPR dummy, okay, after this,
and you can practice compressions in the lounge.
I think I've had enough CPR for one day.
GCS is 11 and resps are shallow.
Sometimes if you hit your head bad enough,
you can stop breathing.
So then you do mouth to mouth?
No, we put a tube in his trachea
and breathe for him with a vent.
This is Veck, it knocks him out so we can do the intubation.
132/84.
Good.
Pulse ox is up to 99. Excellent.
Let's lay off the tube for now. He's doing okay.
Doc, how long I got to wait on Miss Congeniality here?
He needs to be admitted for observation.
Jerk off.
Come on, Hendrix, we're missing lunch.
Gumbo Thursday. Hey.
As long as they're here,
they're our patients, not your prisoners.
Sorry, but they're always our prisoners.
It's been awhile since I seen that.
What?
Compassion.
( horn blows "Taps" )
Ready.
Ready... aim...
Fire. ( shots fired )
Ready... aim...
Fire. ( shots fired )
Ready... aim...
Fire. ( shots fired )
GALLANT: Neela, it is too
dangerous over there.
Oh, it's too dangerous for me,
but it's okay for you?
What a load of crap.
Neela, I am a soldier, remember?
And you're also a husband, remember that?
GALLANT: Seems kind of silly now, but out in the bay
this morning, I was, uh...
I was thinking about asking you out.
I was thinking of saying yes.
Ready.
RASGOTRA: You'd better come back,
you know that, don't you?
Yeah, I will.
You ready?
Bye, Michael.
( engine starts )
How am I doing?
Your CT's normal,
but it looks you'll be spending the night.
Lucky me.
Yeah, well, you've got a standard issue jumpsuit,
an armed guard and a major head injury.
What, you're not the luckiest guy in the world?
Yeah.
Could be worse, could be dead.
No arguing that, dead would be bad.
Hey, you know, it's the other guy who started it.
Is that so?
Yeah.
I've made some mistakes in my day,
but that guy's a wrong number.
I'd stay away from him.
Thanks for the advice.
I'm gonna go check on the guy in sutures.
Does he get a bandage on that?
Just a little Neosporin.
Oh.
And, uh, we're gonna need some urine.
I'll check his vitals.
You said every 30 minutes, it's been 35.
I'm not peeing in front of everyone.
Use the screen.
Hey...
I'm getting to be like a regular.
Leave the nurse alone.
It's all right. We know each other.
What is that?
It's called a moist-to-dry dressing.
We soak gauze in saline,
then we pack it in the wound.
How'd you do this?
Jerk tried to shiv me.
Bible group got out of hand, huh?
He was trying to snag my smokes, man.
Yeah, these dudes will beef it up over anything.
I thought you were trying to turn things around.
I am, Sammy.
I really am.
Then you got to stay out of trouble.
Hey, B.P.'s 125 over...
Nice and easy, dumbass.
Pull the blinds, now.
Are you out of your mind?
Pull the blinds, bitch!
"Handsome...
"sensitive...
"generous...
"debonair...
macho"?
What is this macho?
Thank you. Thank you, Sveta.
That's good.
Dude, I slayed him!
No, no, he's still moving. Look.
But I cut off his head.
Well, I got to the oblivion gate
long before you did anyway, so...
Don't cheat, Jerry.
I'm gonna move your old guy to another room.
The cops are coming to interview him. What for?
There was a missing persons report.
I got to follow it up.
Who did the initial workup on migraine guy?
Sam and Mary.
These vitals are completely wrong.
Where's Sam?
In with prisoner number one.
What?
Yeah, Steve and another guy came in.
I guess they had some sort of jail fight.
Steve is here again? Mm-hmm.
Here's how this is gonna go--
you're gonna walk us out of here
like old Steve's going back to lockup. This is it, Steve,
you cross this line, there's no stepping back from it.
They got me, Sam, on all kinds of stuff.
You are such an idiot.
I ain't getting out any time soon.
Then that is what you deserve!
Hey, hey, kids, can we move this thing along?
Now if there's anything you haven't anticipated,
this is the time to mention it.
( door rattles )
Hey, open up. ( knocks )
Um, just a second.
Come on.
Hi. What's going on?
Sit down. Come here.
Sit down, now. Babe, tape him up.
SAM: Luka!
No! No! Don't shoot!
Shut up! Shut up! Luka!
SAM: Stop!
What was that?
That crap you were going to give Rafe.
Veck? You gave him veck?
Get me the ambu mask.
This thing? Yes.
That was vecuronium. You gave him vecuronium.
You were gonna give it to Rafe.
You said it would knock him out.
It paralyzes muscles. He's not breathing.
Let's go, Sam.
No, he'll be paralyzed for the next half hour.
Good.
His diaphragm isn't working, okay?
He's gonna asphyxiate.
Not our problem.
Look, if you leave him here,
in the next five minutes, he'll be dead.
He needs to be intubated, please.
You want a murder wrap?
We're not killers, man.
Let me fix him up.
I swear, I promise you--
let me fix him up, I will walk you right out of here.
Mary, go get the van.
Curtis. Shut up.
It's my call.
We'll be right out.
Hey.
Hi.
Is the sonosite in there?
The ultrasound machine?
Oh, I don't think so.
Something going on?
They're about to do an intubation.
Who is? Kovac?
No. No, he went over to that place
where they do the head thingy.
The head thingy? CT?
The what?
CT? CT, yeah.
Oh, Exam Three.
That's where I saw it.
Thanks.
COLONEL GALLANT: Sitting Bull,
facing terrible odds against Custer,
turned to his warriors and said,
"This is a good day to die."
That's how a soldier has to think.
That's the kind of boy I raised.
Michael would want you to have these.
To me, all they mean is that he's dead.
This is a hard time for all of us.
How dare you.
How dare you stand there and say that?
"A good day to die"?
I was explaining the mindset of a warrior.
You could've kept him here.
You could've saved him.
Come on, let's sit down. But instead
you made him want to go back.
For what?
Because there was something noble in it?
Why did you do that?
When it would have been just as easy to convince him to stay
for a much better reason--
because we loved him.
Because we loved him.
Come on, let's go for a walk, okay?
I can't see anything.
Stick the damn thing in and let's go.
It doesn't work like that!
Luka, I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
He can hear you?
He's paralyzed, but he can hear and feel everything.
Come on. Come on.
She's waiting for us out there.
Come on, Sammy, we got to go.
Steve, why did you do this to me?
It was his idea, I swear.
Okay, are we going together
or am I leaving you here?
One more try, okay?
Enough! Grab her, man and let's go! Yeah, yeah.
Put your hand... What?
put your hand right here on his Adam's apple.
Please. Yes, push on that.
Through the cords.
Okay, okay.
Squeeze this bag.
Squeeze it just like that, okay?
I swear to God, right now. Right now! No.
Come on.
Thank God.
Thank God. I'm so sorry.
Ow!
He still needs help breathing!
Too bad for him.
Hey, Sam. Hey, Morris.
I'll help you in a second. Just let me get Steve off. Hold it.
You have a missing person, an old guy.
Mitch Keely? We need to talk to him.
He was moved out of Three.
Do you know where he is?
Uh, no, I'm not sure.
You might want to check in Sutures.
Sutures? Didn't, didn't you just come from there?
Oh... yeah.
Okay, you know what?
Ask at the front desk. They'll help you.
All right. Thanks.
So, back to the joint, huh?
Yeah, I'm a quick healer.
Where's your fight club buddy?
They took him up to the ward for observation.
Okay.
Well, nice to see you again.
Watch your back.
Let's go another way.
This way's fastest. That's what you said.
But there's cops now.
Well, if we'd split right away,
we'd be on the Dan Ryan by now.
Hey, Steve, we can just turn around.
We're 30 seconds from freedom.
We are not pussing out now.
And no more smoke signals from you.
Got it?
JERRY: Hey, Sam.
You got to fill out the discharge.
Admin says we got to be really tight
about prisoner paperwork.
Uh, check in Sutures.
I think I might have left it in there.
Okay, Abigail?
Something's wrong.
Something's wrong.
Hey, Sheriff, hold up.
Hey. Hey, bring it back here a minute.
( gunfire )
( groans )
( gunfire continues )
Get in!
What the hell happened?!
Get in!
Steve, just go!
Stop! Just go!
Think about Alex!
Steve, go.
I already did!
Alex!
Get back!
Go!
MARY: Damn it!
MORRIS ( muffled ): The ER is closed.
OFFICER ( muffled ): Emergency! Emergency!
( muffled ): We got shots fired by and at police!
( muffled ): I got officers down at County General.
If you got someone hurt by you
of if you're hurt, give us a sign.
Outside is clear. We can move people out.
Vehicle seen heading north
from the hospital on Franklin.
Are you okay, honey?
I think so.
Is this okay?
Please! Need a doc here!
Hey, buddy.
Do you know what day it is?
Neck. Axilla, too.
Can we get a gurney in here, please?!
Airway's okay. Pulse is thready.
Page Surgery. You'll be fine, all right?
Hey, find Kovac. Jerry's hurt.
It's hard, hard to breathe. ( gasps )
He saved me.
I almost got shot.
Zadro, get a gurney.
Wow, getting shot sucks.
Here.
Ow!
Is that better?
( chuckles ): Thanks, kid.
All right, set up for a chest tube.
O2, 100% non-rebreather.
Radial pulse is strong.
You're good, Jerry.
Jerry, man, what'd you do?
I'm a, I'm a big target.
Tell Frank
I can't cover for him on Friday, okay?
( all grunting )
( gasps )
This is on you, man!
Shut up! Shut up!
Just keep driving! Where to?
Just put some distance between us.
We'll figure it out later.
Yeah, yeah, we need to figure this out.
Just shut the hell up!
You probably killed someone back there, Steve.
One of my friends.
I thought you said you were turning yourself around.
I've been praying, Sam.
I asked God to make me a better man.
And it took a while, but he finally started talking back.
It's not God.
( coughs )
He said that losing you is where I went wrong.
Everything would be right in my garden
if only I could get my family back.
Did He tell you to do it with guns?
Curtis, Steve Curtis.
He's down to 80 systolic.
Any other one? I don't know. There's probably a chart.
Where's Sam? Have you talked to her?
We haven't located your nurse yet.
We're still looking.
I'll be right back.
A lot of pressure here, pal.
Ah! Oh, man, I'm not liking that!
You had to go and get shot, huh?
I was three hours away from a clean getaway.
ABBY: I can't, uh, I can't find it.
Keep looking.
They taking him up to surgery?
He arrested twice after the thoracotomy.
They're not optimistic.
Uh, I can't do this.
He's a big man, go supraclavicular.
Supraclavicular?
Ray, sew this in for me.
The junction of the subclavian and the IJ is a bigger target.
Are you okay, Abby?
Yeah, I'm just, um...
I'm all dizzy. I hit my head.
Here, I'll prime the rapid infuser.
It entered the clavisternomastoid angle,
and bingo, we're in.
Ladokern Pharmaceuticals is going to be lucky to have you.
Ray, did Luka take your cup up to the OR?
I haven't seen him.
I thought he was with you.
( grunts )
( grunts )
( grunts )
( cell phone rings )
Is this something I never get over?
No.
This is something that you find a place to put
and let him make you stronger.
Then you go on living your life
because that's all you can do.
And that's the way he would have wanted it.
( cell phone rings )
( sighs )
I think there's something going on at the hospital.
Dropped his pressure again.
How you doing, Jerry? Come on, big guy.
Time for you to say something intended to be funny.
RAY: He's got to be bleeding in the belly.
No, I looked. The belly's clear.
Well, we're missing something, all right?
Unit's three and four going up.
He needs a second chest tube.
The first one's in a good position.
He had less than 500 cc's out.
There's more in there.
I don't see a hemothorax. I was upstairs.
They wouldn't let us down. What the hell happened?
The OK Corral. Oh, my God!
Jerry... Any, any free fluid?
He may need a CT. It's not the belly, Ray.
Dr. Weaver, look at the film.
The right hemithorax
is still slightly opaque-- that's blood.
You don't see an air-fluid level because he's lying flat.
The first chest tube should have drained it, though.
Not if it's kinked or clotted.
Oh!
Oh, okay, over a liter in the chest.
Where's another thoraseal?
Next door, I think.
All right. Be right back.
( gasping )
( panting )
