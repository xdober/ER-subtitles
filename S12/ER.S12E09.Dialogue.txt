Previously on E.R.:
Oh, man.
I've been here for a long time. I know the people.
I know the department. I just want to put my name into the mixture.
You want me to take this, Kerry? I don't mind.
What, you think I'm rusty?
You've been the one person I can count on.
That means a lot to me-- that friendship.
What you're saying is that we'll just stay friends.
I told you I have a boyfriend.
Oh. So what is he, a lawyer,
a commodities trader, a dentist?
He's a doctor.
County?
In the army.
When's he coming home?
( chuckling )
That's got to be the wankiest idea I've ever heard.
You must be shell-shocked.
What are you... wankiest?
Uh, foolish, ridiculous, possibly even stupid.
I think that is the best idea
I have ever had.
I don't know what the problem is.
Okay, it's sweet, yeah. "Best"? I don't think so.
And it's ten after 7:00. I have to go to work.
GALLANT: Just give me one good reason why we shouldn't.
Because it's 100 degrees in here and I'm about to die.
You're trying to change the subject.
I can't breathe.
Listen, you can be honest with me.
No, I am being honest with you.
I can't breathe.
Michael!
GALLANT: I'm not budging until you give me
one good reason why we shouldn't.
Because you've gone completely mad.
Oh, come on, no muss, no fuss.
No family.
Okay, okay, they might be a little surprised.
Oh, you think?
Hi, Mom, hi, Dad. Guess what I did today.
They'd get over it.
No, actually, I don't think mine would.
They'll have to, 'cause I love you. Michael.
Listen, it'll be a great story to tell our grandchildren.
They'll think we were crazy.
We would be crazy.
Do you love me?
Yes, I do.
See? You already said "I do."
That settles it. That settles it.
We're getting hitched today.
Wait, wait, not so fast.
Will I have a bouquet?
Michael...
Michael...
( snoring )
Uh, little head lac, CT negative.
Just move her to an exam room,
let her sleep it off
and then, a la casa.
Okay, let me know when she's set up.
Sure. Right this way, Glenda.
What's with the stop sign?
Oh, it's a school crossing guard.
Doesn't that just make you sick?
The idea that that woman's getting drunk on the job?
Small, innocent, helpless, possibly even frail children
in her charge.
Whoa, whoa.
What's happening in there?
Hey, Frank, que pasa?
PRATT: I think they're talking about you.
What? Weaver's kicking their butts is my guess.
She's going to kick their butts right out of here
if they don't stop yapping at each other.
Isn't one of them going to be the new ER chief?
My money ain't on the nosebleed.
The nosebleed?
You miss just about everything, don't you?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Where the heck do you think you're going?
Uh, a guy in Curtain One
wants me to grab him some doughnuts.
Give me that. What are you thinking?
He was going to give me a tip.
Urine sample, Exam 3, to the lab.
I need you to run up to the surgical floor,
pick up the level one rapid infuser.
Surgical floor?
That's good.
All right, let's clear some of these patients.
I will be on today,
but first run your cases
by either Drs. Kovac or Clemente.
You're on today?
Good.
I mean, that's good.
You're stuck up in administration all the time.
It's good to keep your skills honed.
Dr. Kovac
and Dr. Clemente will share the honor
of running the board today.
Share?
Abby, head lac's ready for you.
Doctors.
After you.
No, no, after you, my man.
KOVAC: No, no, really. Really. I insist.
Oh, I insist, too.
KOVAC: No, no, I mean, I'm serious.
I'm serious too...
Dr. Clemente!
The board.
Right.
Okay, Linda, come on, come on, come on, stop it.
Don't make nobody...
Haleh, your paranoid gardener
needs another slug of Haldol.
That's all right, I got this. Go ahead.
I'll be back.
Okay, Glenda...
Here we go, a little stick, okay?
( yells )
Crap.
Ortho's here for your tib-fib.
Oh, crap, crap, crap...
Nice.
Yeah. Morris signed her out as a garden-variety drunk,
but her IV's bleeding like stink
and her lac's oozing around the sutures.
Alcoholics are often
a little coagulopathic. Stuck you...
How was your little sit-down with Weaver this morning?
No, crossing... She was telling me and Dr. Clemente...
I told you you little punks... ...how charming we are.
Really? Don't sit in my chair...
You don't think I'm charming?
I think you're extremely charming.
I just also think...
( yells )
Oh, crap, spilled my coffee.
Uh, she was... she was telling us
that we have to get along better.
You know, leave a better impression
Fat little children... to the residents,
and be more agreeable.
Well, that's a lot to ask.
No drinking. You don't think I'm agreeable?
I think you're agreeable, yes...
No, you still think I'm full of...
Oh!
Active duty servicemen can get married the same day.
Bingo.
Ah, well, that's where you're headed.
I mean, I realize it's all sex now,
but 20 years down the road
she's dragging you off to the Moose Lodge
for folk dancing and bingo.
You know, I'm damn envious of you, Gallant.
Finding your soul mate.
Someone to share your hopes
and calm your fears. Uh-huh.
You know, hold your hand in the dark night.
That's a good one, man.
Keep saying it to yourself--
you might believe it.
Dr. Gallant, I'd like to offer my services
in officiating at your nuptials.
What?
I'm a Universal Life Minister.
I can marry you and Neela.
Jerr, I think they're looking for something legal.
It's completely legal.
I've married lots of people.
So, what are you, like, Reverend Jerry?
Actually, I go by Father Superior.
LOCKHART: So the rumors are true?
Yes, and I'd like you to be my bridesmaid...
maid of honor, whatever.
Well, normally I'd say no,
because of the taffeta dress and matching peau de soie shoes.
But this time it's because
you've had a complete brain lapse.
Michael and I love each other.
We want to be together.
But today?
We thought it'd be kind of crazy, you know?
Something good we could tell...
Anyway, his tour is over.
Well, what if he gets stationed in, like, Romania?
He's hoping to finish
his training in stateside army hospital.
I'm not saying
he's not a great guy-- he is, but do you know him?
Of course I do.
He's incredibly kind, generous...
My dry cleaning guy is kind and generous.
Where's the prednisone?
Left bottom shelf.
I know him. I do.
Does he fold the newspaper inside out when he reads it
and then forget to put it back when he's done?
Does he clip his toenails in bed?
Does he drip when the toilet seat's down? Abby...
Does he like jam on his grilled cheese sandwiches?
All these things I can learn during the marriage.
Well, yes, but I don't think that's the best... I love Michael.
And I could use a little support here.
I'm very happy for you,
I really am.
And of course I would stand up for you.
I wouldn't miss it.
Great. Okay.
Dr. Pratt, you got a moment?
Sure.
Walk with me?
All right.
This young man, KJ Thibeaux,
you've been sponsoring him as a volunteen?
Yeah.
Apparently he got into the surgical floor storeroom--
stole a digital video camera.
What? Get out of here.
Yeah. I don't want to make a big issue about it,
but as long as he's willing to admit it,
give the camera back,
it doesn't go any further than this.
Wait. Who told you it was KJ?
Chief of security called me.
One of his guards reported it.
And he's sure about this?
Surveillance cameras. Everything's on tape.
I'm sorry.
All right, I'll talk to him.
He's just a teenager.
I'll talk to him.
Jack Gitts, 38, high speed MVC, no medical history.
Hey, so I've been checking. Restrained, complains of abdominal pain
we can get the license, but they close for an hour at 1:00. I can't talk right now.
I know, but just quickly, I got a lead on three possible places.
Probable femur fracture.
And the florist in the hospital would love to do a wedding.
Michael, I have a patient here.
Vitals? Tachy to 130,
shallow resps, BP 80 palp.
Oh, and Jerry's going to marry us.
What?! I'll come back when you're not so busy.
Page Dubenko and call for O-neg...
Did he say Jerry?
I thought you knew.
One, two, three.
Cantaloupe allergy's waiting for the Benadryl to kick in.
Infected nose piercing is home on Keflex.
She did that herself with a thumbtack.
Ah, sexy.
Is she single?
And platelets are back on my drunk head lac.
A little low-- 98, and the INR is 1.4.
Yeah, borderline.
Still, I'd like to give platelets and FFP.
Yeah, go ahead.
Even a tiny bleed can become serious
if she can't clot.
Possibly a good idea, Dr. Kovac,
but you do realize that blood products
carry the risk of infection
and transfusion reaction, don't you?
Yeah.
Was the CT negative?
Well, there's not bleed that we could see.
Do you really want to expose your patient to those kind of risks
just because the platelets are low?
The scan was four hours ago.
She might have a delayed bleed.
I'd worry more if she had mental status changes,
or a focal neuro exam.
He's got a point.
Well, she's drunk, so that's kind of hard to assess.
Yeah, well, drunk people get sober.
KOVAC: And careful observation
is still better than any lab.
That's right. I'd have to agree.
What just happened?
They've been pulling that on me all morning.
I don't know, some sort of competitive agreeing contest.
I wouldn't steal any stupid camera.
Did you just hear what I said?
They got you on tape.
It couldn't have been me.
You were up there long enough.
They had to look for that infuser thing.
Don't give me that crap, KJ.
Okay, there's this girl-- one of the volunteers.
She's fine as hell.
You know, I went out on a limb for you.
I thought having you here was going to teach you something,
keep your ass out of trouble.
Then you go and do this.
I didn't do anything!
You know what? Your father's on his way here.
So for now, go sit in the waiting room.
But Dr. Pratt...
Waiting room.
Bag him. Have you got a second line?
Vein keeps blowing.
Run the first unit of O-neg and hold four more units ready to go.
So where's the reception going to be?
He needs central access.
They haven't decided yet.
I'd go to Baby Joon's.
La Chiquita Roja is more romantic.
Neela, place the subclavian.
Cordis and sterile sixes.
What was the other place Gallant mentioned?
MALIK: The Mandarin Club.
No way. Yeah, that's a bad idea.
Turn his head to the left.
Systolic's 84.
I've always liked the Mandarin.
Got a flash.
Should definitely do Chiquita Roja.
Candles, white tablecloths, you know.
Nah. Baby Joon's, I'm telling you.
Martinis and chili fries.
X-rays are up.
C-spine's clear. Mediastinum looks okay.
Very good.
So where are you registered?
What? Definitely have to register.
Could I have the sonosite, please?
My ex-wife didn't register
and we ended up with a bunch of clocks.
With my sister, it was salad bowls. Seven of them.
Does anybody mind if we just focus on the patient?
Okay, then.
Can we have that sonosite, please?
Neela.
So, can you get away?
We need to go get a license.
We don't even know where we're getting married yet.
Absolutely we do. The hospital chapel.
Well, when did we decide that?
You were busy, so I thought you...
And Jerry's going to marry us?
He has some kind of minister's license, so...
Is that really who we want?
What's Frank going to be, the ring bearer?
Listen, we don't have a lot of time.
I had to make some choices.
You going to choose the flowers, too?
No, no.
Well, you like lilies, though, right?
Michael, we have to talk.
About what?
I just think all this is maybe getting a little... Dr. Gallant,
you know the groom isn't really supposed to see the bride
on the day of the wedding. Yeah, well,
we have a few details to work out.
Nothing that can't wait, I hope.
Dr. Rasgotra's going to scrub in on this one.
I am? Yeah. You did that open lap on the paramedic
in the middle of the street. I think I can trust you
within the confines of a sterile operating room.
You're not getting cold feet, are you?
We'll talk later.
Are his vaccinations up to date?
His pediatrician and I don't believe in them.
Immunizations are probably one of the most successful
public health interventions ever developed.
Thank you, but it's a personal decision.
Did you know the air
has 21% oxygen in it?
He's studying the atmosphere in school.
Well, that's very cool.
He's setting at 94, which is low,
but nothing dangerous.
Probably has to do with the fluid I heard in his lungs.
I'd like to get a chest X-ray,
which is nothing scary.
It's just a special kind of photograph
and it doesn't hurt at all.
My Uncle Deaver had one of those and we got to see all his bones.
Mm-hmm. I don't want X-rays if possible.
Mrs. Kenig, I'm pretty sure Stewy has pneumonia.
Well, can't you just treat it then
and we can avoid the radiation?
It's a small amount and it just helps us have a look
at what we're dealing with.
Glenda's waking up.
Thank you.
Wouldn't you go with antibiotics anyway?
Okay. He needs extra oxygen.
He's going to have to spend the night.
Okay, that'll be fine.
Then we'll hold off on the film for now.
But if he gets any worse...
He gets X-rayed.
He says he didn't do it.
D, I don't like this any better than you do, man.
He wouldn't lie.
Come on, man.
Did he lie about the tagging he got busted for?
Or the weed they found in his pocket?
Look, KJ's a good kid.
But right now, his judgment basically sucks.
I want to talk to this doctor...
Dubenko.
Yeah, and the security guard, too.
D, they don't want to press charges, man.
But they're accusing my kid.
I just want to talk to them.
( sighs heavily )
Banana bag is finished and she took a few ice chips.
Who are you?
I'm Dr. Lockhart.
You're at County General.
Let's see if you can sit up on your own, okay?
She should be sobering up by now.
Glenda...
will you squeeze my hand?
Okay, let's see, try and squeeze my hand.
Squeeze my hand.
Come on.
Okay.
Can you open your eyes?
Glenda, come on.
Good. Okay.
Over here, right over here.
Now do you know who I am?
Who are you?
Must've cleared, like, 30 patients
and no one's even brawling yet.
See, it's not that hard, is it?
You're right, it's like the man said.
"Can't we just all get along?"
Sam, weren't we sending that cracked broviac up to IR?
Don't you want a CBC first?
Yes, uh, you're right.
Hey, Sam, lab's done on Mrs. Garvey.
I just checked, it'll be another half hour.
Hey, Dr. Weaver...
the search committee meeting's been moved up to 12:30.
All right, Jerry, thank you.
Dr. Kovac. Dr. Lockhart.
There's something not right about Glenda.
Hey, that sounds like a movie, huh?
Like, Something Not Right About Glenda.
Like a body snatchers thing with a shaky camera. Morris.
I want to re-scan her.
Really? Why?
Because she's altered.
Yeah, but she's a drunk. How can you even tell?
Dr. Clemente, why don't you...
Why don't we let Dr. Lockhart present the case?
Absolutely. Look, she's disoriented, she's repeating questions.
I just want to get another CT.
How long has she been here? About six hours.
Luka, your malrotation in Exam Four is puking blood.
I'll check back.
Yeah, well...
Is she responding to commands?
Yes.
Hand squeeze and eye opening.
Rule of thumb: if a patient's exam is non focal
and they're responding to commands, just observe and wait.
Dr. Clemente, Ortho on line two.
Yeah, okay.
Yeah, I'm going to re-scan her.
Can you call CT, let them know we're on the way
and have the blood bank send a unit of FFP
and a six pack of platelets.
You sure about that?
Yes, I am.
( chuckling )
What's this, your bachelor party?
( chuckling )
There's not going to be one of those.
Well, you didn't give me much time to plan it,
having your wedding today.
I don't think there's going to be one of those either.
What, so I don't get to be your best man?
I mean, you were going to ask me, right?
I don't know, man, I...
You know, maybe this was just all too fast.
You know, I mean, I think she's scared.
Well, it is kind of a strong move
to the hoop, man.
Yeah, but I was going to ask her before.
But...
You know, over in Iraq, I mean, guys got married
the week they shipped out.
I know 'cause I worked on them.
Arms missing, legs gone...
faces half blown off.
But the thing they were in the most pain about
was the pain they were going to cause somebody else.
So I told myself if I ever made it through this...
And you did.
So you asked her now.
Yeah.
Well, I...
I mean, kind of.
Kind of?
( French rap music playing )
Is this French rap?
MC Solaar.
Do you understand what they're saying?
I can't understand any of them.
You want contrast with this?
No.
Whoa, ugly.
( alarm )
Glenda?
Glenda?
Okay, stop the scan.
Few more cuts and we're done.
Stop the scan and get the code team up here now.
Excuse me. Move.
I'm in. Hyperventilate her.
What's going on? You can see what's going on.
Equal breath sounds. Abby.
I got this. Sats not picking up.
50 of manitol.
So what happened? Well, meet Glenda, my altered drunk head lac.
While you guys were jerking each other off,
she was bleeding into her head.
B.P.'s 170/110.
What did you tell her to do?
Same thing you would've-- observation.
But she was responding to commands at the time.
Okay, go ahead and order the platelets.
I already did, if I had waited for either one of you
to sign off on this woman, she'd already be dead.
Neurosurgery's ready for her.
Okay, can we all agree she needs to go up to the OR? Good.
Throwing PVCs.
RASGOTRA: Can't see well enough to find it.
DUBENKO: Get control blindly, Neela.
Here, give me your hands.
What do you feel?
The liver, the edge is smooth.
B.P.'s dropping. 66/35.
Focus.
There's a defect. There's a tear in the SMA.
Over 1,900 cc blood loss.
Losing the battle here, guys.
Direct pressure, Neela.
Control it.
That's it.
Hold steady pressure.
Suction.
Hold it.
Satinsky.
Clamp the bleeder.
And we have liftoff.
Systolic's coming back.
Great job, Dr. Rasgotra.
Now we just have to run the bowel before we close him up.
Neela.
Welcome, Dr. Gallant.
Your bride-to-be here just saved this guy's life.
Michael, what are you doing here?
I, uh, I need to talk to you.
Well, now's not a good time.
Well, I just wanted to tell you that...
Michael, please.
Tell her what, Dr. Gallant?
Go ahead.
You know, when I was away... uh...
thinking about you gave me some other place to be,
someplace peaceful where I could belong.
Now, maybe... maybe all of this has been too fast
and I know that's scary and...
maybe I didn't ask you the right way.
But I just want us to be together.
So I'm asking you now, Neela...
will you marry me?
Will you marry me today?
fell through the ice playing hockey on a pond.
Doing what? I know it sounds stupid.
Not only does it sound stupid...
Dr. Morris, perhaps you'd like to let us
hear the rest of the case.
Hey, I need to talk to you.
Okay.
Altered and hypothermic.
Temp's too low to register. He's not shivering.
Heart rate's 74, BP 100 over 47.
BARNETT: Hey, man, when's the ceremony?
Not sure yet.
Okay, let us know.
Yeah.
Hey, Frank, where's Jerry?
Left early to get into his ministerial mode.
This thing better be happening
'cause we got a temp coming to cover the desk.
It is Frank. Don't worry.
I'm off. Cleared it with Dr. Weaver.
Okay.
So we need to go get a license.
And rings. And rings.
We'll call you with the details.
You are coming, right?
Yeah, went home at lunch, got my best suit.
Wish us luck.
Gonna need more than that... but what do I know?
WEAVER: Repeat rectal temp,
portable chest, EKG, CBC, chemistry and coags.
Crackles... may have aspirated some water.
Sats only 88. He needs an airway.
I've got it.
Dr. Barnett.
Uh, yes, uh, eight-oh, 20 etomidate, 100 sux.
MAN: I hope it's okay.
I made the paramedics bring me with them.
TAGGART: It's fine, Mr...
Spevacek.
There's a pond where we grew up
and a few of us took up our old skates...
knocked the puck around, you know, for old times.
Bolus a liter of warm saline
and call Respiratory for a vent.
Rectal temp, 86.
Uh, suction. Osborne waves.
He's at risk for an arrhythmia.
Tube.
Prep for bilateral chest tubes for pleural irrigation.
Um, with all due respect, Dr. Weaver,
peritoneal dialysis is better.
Greater capacity for heat exchange,
warms the solid organs faster.
It's an interesting approach.
That's what the Navy SEALS do... really.
Proceed, Dr. Morris.
Okay, okay, uh...
Betadine and a DPL tray.
So you never actually saw him?
I told you, I see him all the time.
He's always up here sniffing around.
Sniffing around? He's not a dog.
He likes this girl that volunteers.
You know what I mean.
I'm sorry. They've been at this for a couple of days.
How many people have keys to the storeroom?
That information isn't for general release.
Then let us see the tape.
Gotta get the chief's approval.
So call the chief.
He'll be back in an hour.
So, we got no chief, no tape
and he didn't even see KJ.
I don't check every room every minute of the day.
Maybe you should.
Darnell.
'Cause then he would've seen it wasn't my son.
Okay, okay, we'll talk to the chief.
We'll get the tape.
It takes time to rewind, run the tape forward.
Holds 24 hours,
not like you just punch in.
I got time.
You going somewhere?
We'll be here.
Come on, man.
TAGGART: Core temp's 88.3.
Up a couple of degrees.
Hang another liter of warm saline.
We've got to tip him on his right side.
I've got the head.
Can I help? We've got it. Thank you, though.
MORRIS: Here we go-- one, two, three...
Just a few PVCs.
Why are you doing this?
This drains the fluid through the abdomen.
How long does that take?
Uh, 30 to 60 minutes.
Human meat takes time to thaw.
Dr. Morris...
TAGGART: Sure we can't
get you a seat, Mr. Spevacek?
Harry lived across the street.
Must've been 15 kids up and down our block.
We played hockey all winter.
I fell in the ice once,
Harry pulled me out.
Then today...
Harry fell in.
And I tried to help him...
but I couldn't.
Just, you know, a little out of practice, I guess.
I'm sure you did all that you could.
I hope so.
He's in V-tach.
Roll him. What's happening?
No pulse. Get the crash cart.
Starting compressions.
When I get upstairs,
will I get my own room, or do I have to share?
I'm not sure.
Stop complaining, Stewy.
You already got to skip school.
Patricia.
I don't see why I couldn't stay in the gym.
I'm missing practice.
Patricia, please.
Dr. Lockhart, do you know how much longer it will be?
Well, I can page the pediatrician on call.
Are you still doing okay?
Clear!
No change. Still V-fib.
Again. Charge to 360.
Clear!
He's not going to respond to shocks until we warm him up.
Resume compressions.
Sam, 100 milligrams lidocaine IV.
Uh, excuse me, Dr. Weaver.
I think we should use bretylium instead.
What are you talking about?
They took that out of the ACLS guidelines years ago.
Yes, but there was a big study in the '80s.
That's you reference, something from the '80s?
Yes, Dr. Weaver, it is.
And it clearly showed bretylium
to be the anti-arrhythmic of choice
in hypothermia.
Core temps up to 89.1.
350 milligrams of bretylium IV.
Given his recent immigration from Vietnam,
you've got to consider empiric triple therapy.
Right, right, but if you have Hepatitis C...
Excuse me.
It's going to be a disaster... His liver function is perfectly fine.
For the moment, maybe, but... Hey, hey!
Stewy Kenig, five-year-old with fever and cough.
Non-toxic appearing with bilateral crackles on exam,
sats 92 on room air, 100 on five liters.
Mom's freaked out by radiation.
Refused a chest X ray.
So treating presumptive pneumonia with amp and azithro.
CBCs pending, got 20 per kilo of NS
and is being admitted to pedes since,
although stable, I can't send him home
with an O2 requirement.
That's the plan. Do you concur?
I don't know. Azithro? Have you tried...?
Do you concur?
Yeah.
Thanks.
The Chief of Security met with him.
McCauley kept stalling, then finally came clean.
There was a theft, but there were no videotapes
and no suspects.
No tapes at all?
No. KJ did nothing wrong.
Some camera goes missing and this fat ass figures
it must have been the black kid.
DUBENKO: Yeah, there was absolutely no excuse for it.
It was an unconscionable thing to do.
So where's this McCauley going to be working tomorrow?
Not here.
Listen, Mr. Thibeaux, um, from what
everybody's been saying, it sounds like
KJ's been doing a great job around here.
He did not deserve this and I'm very, very sorry.
On behalf of the entire hospital, I apologize.
Why don't you go tell that to KJ?
Yeah.
Sure you don't want anything?
Thanks, man.
Guess it always comes down to the black check, doesn't it?
No matter how good your job is, where you live,
how much money you make...
In the end, cops pull you over
for driving through a white neighborhood.
I'm done with this place.
I'm not doing this anymore.
The hell you ain't.
You're coming here every day till you finished your service.
That's right. And I'm going to make sure you work harder
than any other volunteer up in here.
So no more going out for doughnuts and chasing skirts.
Man, what for?
They always going to be on my back,
no matter how good I do.
Yeah, and it's going to be like that forever
so get used to it.
Can't think about it.
Just live your life and do your best.
You got to stay in the game, KJ, otherwise they win.
Look, I'm sorry about all this, all right? All right?
Where is everybody?
Hi, I'm Maureen. Can I help you?
Who are you?
I'm the temp.
Are you out of high school?
I'm 21, but I have my mother's cheekbones
and my father's chin,
and everyone always says
that that combination makes you look younger, so...
Hey, you still here?
Yeah, I'm looking for Ray.
I have a couple of patients I need to sign out unless
I want to wear this to the wedding. I can take them.
Or I can, if you'd rather.
Sorry. Luka beat you to it.
Let me walk you outside.
And you would be?
I'm Maureen the temp.
Well, hello, Maureen the temp.
Are you...?
I know what you're going to ask me
and I'm 21.
I have my mother's cheekbones and my father's chin
and everyone always says that that combination
makes you look younger.
Is that what they say? Yeah.
TEF with aspiration, going up for a bronch.
Jellyfish sting.
Jellyfish?
Yeah, it was a pet.
Obs for 30 minutes and then home.
And Stewy, my little guy with pneumonia,
is hanging out on O2.
Pedes has seen him, we're just waiting on a bed upstairs.
Well presented plan, by the way.
Yes, I had to do something.
Well, like you said,
I'm not very good at being agreeable.
I didn't say that.
You implied it.
I said it was a lot to ask,
and it turns out I was right,
not that I'm happy about it.
No, of course not.
I'm going to be really late.
Are you coming to this wedding?
It's in the hospital chapel.
I don't know.
Lots of things to finish up.
See you at the reception, yeah?
Right.
Charge to 360.
Clear.
Again, 360.
Clear.
Sinus rhythm.
And... we've got a pulse.
Ice hockey dude is warm and alive.
Welcome back, Harry.
Temp's 90. You want some more warm saline?
Uh, no, no. Keep him at 90.
Auto-induced hypothermia will protect the brain.
All right! Everybody, way to go. Is he okay?
Your friend's going to spend the night in ICU
for observation.
But he's stable and he has a good chance for recovery.
Thank you all so much.
Mr. Spevacek, you are absolutely welcome.
WEAVER: Okay, take out the DPL catheters
and get him a unit bed.
Hey... it was a good job, man.
What's going on?! Suction.
Heart rate's dropping.
Give me some cricoid.
Is this Abby's pneumonia patient?
CLEMENTE: Is she gone?
KOVAC: Let's worry about the airway.
Respiratory distress, not moving air.
Send a blood gas. Please tell me what's going on.
Pulse is 47. Pull out.
No, I got it. I'm in.
Good color change.
His oxygen level was dangerously low.
We had to take over his breathing.
X-ray's up.
TAGGART: Took me a while to get the mom to agree.
She didn't want the radiation.
Not little Stewy's biggest problem.
Interstitial infiltrates. There.
Maybe staph aureus?
Could be MRSA. We should add Vanco.
Check out the white count.
0.4?
White count should be through the roof
unless he hasn't got any white cells left.
And this is PCP pneumonia.
Any reason for this kid to be imunosuppressed?
Chemo, steroids?
Nothing in the history.
All right, who's going to ask the mom?
Mrs. Kenig, uh, the type of lung infection
your son has...
We ran a number of tests.
I didn't say you could do that.
He was about to stop breathing
and we needed to know why.
The tests showed your son has pneumocystis pneumonia.
It's a type of infection we only see
when the immune system is not working.
We'd like to test your son for HIV.
CLEMENTE: And if he does have the virus,
we can recommend medications that...
Here we go with the viral theory of AIDS.
Invented so biotech companies could charge people
50 bucks a pop for some bogus tests
when they're actually dying from real problems.
Excuse me? Real problems?
Pollution, drug addiction, toxins,
but nobody wants to deal with those.
It's better to call it a virus
and sell a vaccine-- the easy fix.
I have talked to 50 doctors since I have been diagnosed
and it's always the same thing.
"HIV causes..."
Wait, wait. You're infected?
I'm not infected with anything.
I carry the HIV virus as do millions
of other healthy people.
You don't believe HIV causes AIDS?
No, I don't.
Oh, lady, you're nuts.
I was diagnosed 14 years ago
and I haven't been sick a day in my life.
So you didn't take AZT while you were pregnant?
Why would I do that? Oh, I don't know.
Maybe to prevent your child from getting AIDS.
Which is, by the way,
what little Stewy might have. Dr. Clemente.
Are you so sure AZT doesn't cause AIDS?
Everyone knows it suppresses the immune system.
Lady, lady, you're out there, okay?
I'm a conspiracy freak, too,
don't get me wrong,
and the drug companies are trying to screw us...
Doctor... but when we tell you
that your child has a life-threatening disease
and you jeopardize his life
to prove one of your crackpot theories,
you're just as bad as they are, okay?
If he dies, is that going to make you happy?
Dr. Clemente, I'll take care of this, okay?
She knew she was infected with HIV
and she did nothing to protect her child.
It's the most moronic,
selfish...
So, you were saying you never even had Stewy tested?
No.
What about Patricia?
( organ music playing )
( sobbing gently )
Ah, there you are.
They're waiting for you. What's going on?
Oh, scheduling conflict.
Well, you could have put a note on the door.
Well, you could have been on time.
Well... Here, take one.
We're stealing their flowers?
Nah, just take one.
Where are we going? Come on.
( sighs )
Child Life took Patricia up to play some video games.
Yeah. I asked about their father-- he's not in the picture.
She will let us treat the pneumonia, but won't consent
to an HIV test, and doesn't even want to discuss medication.
If we don't get this boy on the cocktail...
How do people get like this?
When my son, Alex, was five,
the doctor thought he might have meningitis.
Wanted to do a spinal tap on him.
I'm a nurse, and I didn't want him to do it.
I was worried and scared.
I didn't want anything hurting my kid.
I don't want anything hurting Stewy.
Stewy is already hurting, Mrs. Kenig.
Everyone is entitled to their beliefs,
but the truth-- here, in this room, right now-- is if you
let this go on like this, there's not
gonna be a doctor that can help him.
He only has you.
Why do we have to go through the kitchen?
Because Michael and Neela are waiting by the front door.
Well, it's not a surprise party.
Oh, Abby! Oh, man!
If this isn't every bride's dream come true.
Come on. I'm coming.
That's a nice tie.
Thanks. And a lovely outfit, as well.
Better without the lab coat.
What are we waiting for?
I have no idea.
Where have you been?
( whispers ): Take that... take that...
Hey. What happened to the Chapel?
Scheduling conflict.
Yes, I know that...
Oh, but... Shh! Shh! Shh!
( guests murmuring )
( chuckling )
( guests humming "Here Comes the Bride" )
( humming stops )
Still won't change her mind about Patricia?
Says she's a healthy young girl,
she doesn't need any testing.
We're gonna have to get a court order.
Well, at least she's gonna let us help Stewy.
One out of two-- that's something.
I'm gonna go up with them to the PICU.
Okay, thanks.
Oh, hey. So, the wacko finally gave in, huh?
No thanks to you.
Yeah, look, I'm sorry about that.
I just... I don't know. I just had to yell at her to just...
Listen, I hope there won't be any hard feelings, but, uh...
Kerry let me know I'm going to be the new E.R. chief.
That's awesome. That's awesome.
You know... you know, when I withdrew my name,
I was hoping they'd pick you.
You withdrew your name?
Yeah. I just had a lot of stuff going on...
It's... a long story, man.
But you're the best guy for the job.
Congratulations.
Thanks.
Uh... going to the wedding reception?
You know, I'd love to-- I really would--
but Maureen over here... way in over her head.
Doesn't know where the forks and knives goes,
so I'm going to supervise her...
If you know what I mean.
GUESTS ( chanting ): Go! Go! Go! Go!
( Barry Manilow's "Copacabana" playing )
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
( shouting and cheering )
Do we have to call you Chief now?
Very funny.
If you get interviewed, they'll say:
"We're here at County, talking to Chief Kovac."
They don't do it that way.
I'm just saying I think it's cute if it's a guy.
And if the chief is a woman?
I don't think women should be put in positions of leadership.
Do you?
Peanut? Ah...
Young love-- they just have to show it off to everybody.
( sighs )
Here's to discretion.
Propriety. Maturity.
Well...
No, no, not that. ( mutters )
( Barry Manilow's "Can't Smile Without You" playing )
That'll be me someday.
Yup.
That's gonna be me.
I should have said something earlier.
Excuse me?
I should have said something earlier.
But I want you to know that I have a lot of respect
for how you handled that trauma today.
And there was some truth in what you said about me being...
up in Administration.
I'm a little out of practice.
But I-I want you to know that I'm going to start
spending more time down in the E.R.
What?
( cheering and shouting )
Really, we really want to, uh...
thank everybody...
Well, you said that already.
And when we get settled, I want all of you guys
to, uh, come out and visit us.
And you can all come and visit me
tomorrow morning at work, 7:00 a.m.
GALLANT: Uh, really. We love you all. Thank you.
Yeah, and, uh... we're leaving now. Good night.
Whoo!
( cheering )
Where are they going on their honeymoon?
My apartment. ( chuckles )
( sings along with radio ): * Her name was Lola, she was a showgirl *
* With yellow feathers in her hair *
* And a dress cut down to there *
* I don't remember... ( chuckles )
( hums melody )
( giggles )
Okay, well, thanks for the ride.
( chuckles )
That bad, huh? No.
I would just... keep your day job.
What? You never sing in the car?
You know, when you're... when you're alone?
Sometimes I do, yeah, but you're not alone in the car.
Yeah, I know.
I'm just kidding. I...
Would you like to...?
Come on, we can make it.
You try running with a sari on.
( both panting )
( sighs )
What a day.
What a night.
We're actually married.
Yeah.
( sighs )
( whispers ): Do you really think we should be doing this?
I do.
