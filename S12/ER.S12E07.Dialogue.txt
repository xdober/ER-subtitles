Previously, on ER:
We got to clean this place up.
Gallant won't be here for another three days.
I just want it to be nice for him.
He's been over there a long time.
Oh. Hi. I'm Zoe.
14 years old?
Why didn't you tell me how old you are?
'Cause you never asked.
Zoe, I'm going to give you a prescription
for doxycycline for the chlamydia.
It's just that you've been warned three times
and, uh...
We're going to have to let you go.
Who's this Clemente guy anyway?
I'm done arguing with a television set.
It's believed to suppress radical formation...
Did you just call me a television set?
Is he gonna be the new department chief?
We're forming a search committee.
The guy wouldn't be here
if he wasn't angling for it, right?
MAN: You going to eat your eggs?
They're cold.
What about your waffles?
I'm not hungry. I got a stomachache.
You want to bring them home with you?
Mr. Coogy might want to eat them later.
( sniffing )
He doesn't like waffles.
Um, excuse me.
Can we get the bill, please?
I'm sorry. Our machine's still out.
WAITRESS: Would you like more coffee?
Uh, no. Thanks.
It should be just a couple of minutes.
Come on. We're gonna get out of here.
Grab your coat. Hurry up.
You want your picture? No.
No, no, this way.
Let's go.
MAN: You can't come back here, sir.
Hey!
( sighing )
Hey.
I like your picture.
Okay, I think we should keep it.
( tires screeching )
No!
No!
Damn!
I'm hit!
Don't move. Stay down.
Easy.
Okay, I'm going to take care of you.
Try to stay still, okay?
OFFICER: I'll call for another rig.
73, we need backup.
( grunting )
Put him down, Darrel! Security!
What the hell are you doing?!
Just checking for internal bleeding. That's it.
By sticking your finger in my butt?!
It's called a guiac test.
Oh, geez. Get that away from me.
Ugh... ugh!
Aah!
DARREL: Ah, ah! You got crap on my nose.
Oh, man! That's horrible!
( gagging ): Oh!
( groaning ): Oh! Oh! Oh!
That guy is terrible!
Somebody give me a towel! Oh, my God!
Guiac's negative.
( groaning )
Give him two of Ativan. Make it four.
Has C-spine and first-day labs.
That's horrible!
I need a tetanus shot!
Yes?
You seen your buddy KJ around?
Nope.
Me neither.
I'm going to broom him.
What, you can't fire him, he's a volunteer.
Very involuntary volunteer.
I need kids we can count on.
All right, I'll talk to him.
Okay, okay, okay, kids, gather around.
It's show time.
Yo, Lockhart, Barnett, come on, fall in.
You, too, Pratt.
All right, in order to bring this ER into the 21st century,
we're gonna be introducing new equipment
and new procedures on a regular basis.
Now, first up...
my, uh, lovely assistant will be demonstrating
the Patient Communication board.
No more pens and paper.
This'll make everyone's life easier.
From now on, intubated patients can point, circle
or mark any questions
or requests they have.
Beautifully done.
Next up will be the Freedom splint.
The federal regulations are discouraging
the use of wrist restraints, which, by the way,
should be checked every ten minutes.
( snickering )
What's so funny, Barnett?
Uh, I just find that hard to believe.
EVE: Well, there have been a few cases of patients left
unattended for few hours who've lost hands to ischemia.
Therefore, we are going to start using the Freedom Splint.
Any volunteers? Volunteers?
CLEMENTE: Any volunteers?
Hey!
Thank you, Jerry. All right.
EVE: The Freedom splint is less restrictive and should
be used before any hard or soft restraints.
The splint is very helpful in preventing
obtunded or combative patients
from pulling out tubes, picking at wound sites
and disrupting
life-saving medical equipment.
Oh, yay.
Oye... mami. Que sexy.
Thank you.
Thanks.
What's the occasion?
Playboy doing a "Girls of the ER" edition?
Bugger off, Frank.
You do look very nice.
Michael's coming home today.
Well, hello, soldier.
Vic, Big Darrel just put his head through the supply cabinet!
Well, give him five of Haldol.
Wait, make it ten.
But the guy's like a rogue elephant.
Do you shoot it from a tranquilizer gun?
We got one of those?
That was just a joke.
Hey, X-Ray, you and me,
come on, tag team-- you distract him, I'll shoot him.
Distract him with what?
You pretend to be a rodeo clown.
Come on, do something. You go first.
Heads up, guys. Multiple GSWs coming in.
Abby, you're with me. Neela, call the OR.
Make sure the suite is open.
Pratt, you prepare Trauma One and Trauma Two.
I'll clear out the rooms.
Frank, hold the blood bank!
Tell them we're gonna need some O-neg!
Okay.
Is this a gang shooting?
Father used his daughter as a human shield.
Ah, lovely.
Yeah.
Well, you missed show-and-tell.
Huh?
Clemente is implementing
some changes and new equipment.
Think they're going to make him head of the ER?
That's what they were saying.
Look, the guy who got you and Neela suspended
for working on a monkey?
It was a chimp.
Well, if he wants the Chief position, he can have it.
Maybe he can open a petting zoo in the doctor's lounge.
Ten-year-old, single GSW to the right chest!
BP: 85/60. Pulse: 120.
Pulse ox? 96 on two liters.
What's your name?
Vincent calls me Mezoti.
Who's Vincent?
Guy she was with. She's a kidnapping victim.
Her father started shooting. We returned fire.
You shot her?
No. I had a clean shot,
but the guy's gun must have discharged when he went down.
Is Vincent dead?
PICKMAN: 73's bringing him in.
Guy got popped a bunch of times, at least once in the head.
He shot one of our guys.
You got this? ABBY: Yeah.
Okay, I'll go with for the next one.
Come on. Let's get you fixed up, okay?
GIRL: It really hurts.
ABBY: I know. We're going to make it
stop hurting real soon, okay?
I lost Coogy.
Who's Coogy?
My stuffed puppy.
Maybe the police found him.
I'm sure he's okay.
One's open. Blood's on its way. You need a hand?
No, I think we got this. Thank you, Sam.
SAM: Hi.
Nice mustache.
Ian Summerlin.
Your buddies do that?
I wouldn't call them my buddies,
but, uh, yeah, uh, we live in the same dorm.
Freshman?
How'd you guess?
( chuckles softly )
I thought campus life was supposed to be fun.
If you like being tortured.
You've been vomiting?
Yeah, I puked all night.
Keg party?
Passed out, woke up with a bad hangover
and a magic- marker facial?
Something like that.
Okay, well, you don't have a fever,
so it's probably not viral.
Your BP is a little low, which means you're maybe dehydrated.
All right, thank you.
Um, what if I have to puke again?
Ah. Here you go.
Uh, you got anything a little bigger?
Well, if it isn't the hatchet lady!
Which beloved employee are you axing today?
Stick a sock in it, Frank.
I'm sending Haleh her last check.
You want to include a note?
Haleh was Eve's idea.
I was just following orders.
That's what Himmler said.
You got a letter here somewhere from your jailbird boyfriend.
Yeah, probably marrying his cellmate.
BARDELLI: Jimmy Howe, 25!
Grazing GSW to the upper arm
with a lot of blood loss!
Have no fear. Dr. Pratt is here.
This isn't the shooter? No, this is the cop he shot.
Oh, this is my first week riding solo.
I just got out of the academy.
Looks like the bullet snuck up under his vest.
I thought the other guy had more critical injuries.
We just took what they told us.
BP: 100/65. Pulse: 120.
Must have bagged the brachial artery.
I can't feel my hand. Median nerve, too.
Oh, am I going to lose my arm?
No. The bleeding will stop. We can repair the artery.
You okay with this? Yup.
I'm to go check on Abby. I'm all over it.
Hey, where you been? Doing stuff.
I'm going to do some stuff on your head.
We need O-neg from the blood bank. Go, now!
I've never seen him move that fast.
I can't move my hand.
You might have bruised the nerve.
( groans ) RAY: What's this?
Penetrating axillary trauma with neurovascular deficit.
You want to clamp the bleeder?
Only if we can visualize it.
Oh, I'm getting dizzy. Don't let me die, man.
Hey, you're not going to die.
Please don't let me die.
Hey, you with the 23rd?
What? Yeah.
Ready? one, two, three!
( grunting )
My father and brother are with the 17th and the 109.
Really?
Uh-huh. You know Joe Buchitelli?
Yeah. He helped me through the academy.
He's your brother?
No, he gave me my first orgasm.
( Jimmy groans )
Hey, it was a milestone.
ROBO-DUBENKO: How's his pulse ox?
Holding at 92.
And what's the status on the other patients?
Uh, Pratt's got a cop with a grazing GSW
to the upper arm,
and there's another victim en route.
All right, I'm on my way down.
The station confirmed her ID.
Her name's Sydney Carlyle.
She was abducted in a campsite
from upstate New York in August.
Is your real name Sydney?
It's okay.
You can tell me.
Yes.
Yeah.
You're gonna have to do a rape exam.
I'll open a kit.
Sydney... we're going to check between your legs, okay?
Is Vincent dead?
YAU: Vincent Jansen... the creep who took her.
I don't know.
They shot him.
KOVAC: How big's the pneumothorax?
Abby...
Multiple abrasions adjacent to the external genitalia.
Four lacerations to the labia
in various stages of healing.
Did Vincent hurt you?
Did he touch you in your private parts?
Only when we play the married game.
Vincent loves me.
MARQUEZ: Systolics down to 70.
Hey, the shooter's here.
Thinking about a chest tube?
Abby?
Yeah? What?
Chest tube.
Yeah, they're processing the film.
Okay. Don't wait. Just do it now.
Right.
Betadine and steridrapes.
ZADRO: Vincent Jansen, 34,
multiple GSWs to the chest and abdomen.
GATES: And one through the melon.
You didn't intubate him?
Spontaneous resps, sating at 96.
He needs two IVs.
Full up. Exam 2.
How's the little girl? I think she's stable.
Hi, I'm Tony Gates. Dr. Rasgotra.
BP's at 100 palp after a liter.
You should have needled the chest. We scooped and ran.
He's bleeding out! This guy shot a bullet through our windshield.
Almost blew Gates' head off.
It's true. I saw my life flash before my eyes.
I think we were on a beach. Stop it! Can we focus here?
I lost the radial pulse.
He needs two chest tubes and a central line
and call for four units of O-neg. Yowza, look at that head shot.
This guy's gonna need a couple chest tubes and a central...
Isn't that your patient? What, that? I could do with my eyes closed.
It's probably best if you didn't.
I'll call you if I need help.
Yeah, you'll call me.
His head could roll off, you wouldn't call me.
110/70.
Is that good?
Couldn't be better.
Just sliding off the vest.
PRATT: Damn.
Okay, we need to lift up your arm and take a look.
( groans )
Whoa! Got it.
Oh, God. I'm bleeding out.
No, you're not.
Hey, Jimmy, look at me.
Look at me.
Is Marty Stats still the desk sergeant at the 23?
What? Yeah.
He used to baby-sit me.
You know he's got a metal plate in his head?
PRATT: I need a procedural tray.
Okay, right away.
Oh, what's happening?
Sterile gloves, please.
What's happening?
We need to clamp the artery you severed. Oh, man.
Can I steal your hemocue?
Help yourself.
Eve, you want me to take over for you?
Sure.
Yeah, that would be good.
I gotta go check on the others.
Hang in there, Jimmy. I'll be right back.
Cut, please.
Did they find Coogy?
Who is that?
Um, her stuffed animal.
He's a puppy.
Yeah.
Great, hang on.
I got her mom.
Okay. Vaseline gauze dressing on that.
Hi, Mrs. Carlyle. This is Abby Lockhart,
I'm treating your daughter.
Uh, yes,
she was shot in the chest,
but we're doing all we can for her
and she's doing well.
She's a very brave little girl.
Sure. Just a minute.
200cc's in the thoraseal.
It's your mom.
Mom?
I miss you, too.
( sobs ): I am.
Yeah.
I will.
I love you, too.
Okay.
I'm going to give you back to the police now.
We have to continue treating your daughter.
But we'll see you in a couple of hours.
Okay.
Mrs. Carlyle, Officer Yau.
It's okay, Sydney. You're safe now.
Your parents are coming to get you.
Nobody can hurt you here.
What about Vincent?
You don't have to worry about him anymore.
How's the chest tube output?
Less than 500cc's. Small hemothorax.
Good. Should be able to manage her conservatively.
Hey, nice lid.
You get a free bowl of soup with that?
Pressure's down: 80/50.
Okay, call for type-specific
and run in 500 of saline.
No, let's not.
Hi there. I'm Dr. Clemente.
We're going to put a little glop on your belly,
then I'm going to take this camera to look inside, okay?
Are you the little princess I heard was coming this morning?
I'm not a princess.
She's hypotensive.
Hypotensive can be a good thing.
What are you talking about?
Leave her systolic at 80.
Right, Dr. Dubenko? Right.
Permissive hypotension. Landmark papers by Bickell and Mattox.
When you have a vascular injury
you need a low pressure to stabilize the clots.
You blast away with blood and fluids,
you raise the pressure and blow out the clot.
Lots of sub-q air in the chest wall,
but the belly is dry.
Okay, well, we never allow the pressures to drift this low.
So I'm checking with Kovac.
Abby, the chief of surgery agrees with our plan.
We're going to make you brand-new,
all right, sweetie pie?
KOVAC: Okay, I'm in.
Hooking it up.
Sounds like tension pneumo here.
O-Silk...
and Xeroform next.
Five centimeters in the thoraseal.
Pressure's up. 120/70.
Excellent.
He just needs a little blood to his brain.
Nice work.
I heard Gallant's home on leave.
I didn't get a chance to see him last time.
Actually, he gets home today.
Hopefully he'll be here longer this time.
Well, tell him to stop by. I'll buy him a beer.
Hey, this guy just looked at me.
4x4s and elastoplast.
He's got spontaneous eye opening.
( yells )
Lie back down! Son of a bitch!
Stop! You have tubes in your chest!
Push four of versed.
Stop it. You're hurting me!
No! Don't shoot! Don't shoot!
Neela! ( yells ) I'm trying.
( sighs heavily )
You okay? Yeah.
I guess his head injury wasn't as bad as it looks.
It's a clean frontal lobe injury.
No vital functions are affected,
but he will have ongoing impulse control problems.
Wh-Where's Sydney?
Safe from you.
( whining ): I didn't hurt her.
I took care of her.
You raped her.
You don't understand. I need to see her, please.
Okay?
Sydney! Shut up.
Oh, God, I didn't do anything wrong.
Sounds like the lung is back up.
You think you know me, but you don't.
She loves me.
Not much blood from the chest.
It's all in the belly.
She needed me.
( softly ): She wanted me.
Looks like hemoperitoneum.
Yeah, and a grade 4 hepatic injury.
Grade 4?
AKA chopped liver.
JANSEN: I know what you're thinking.
You want me to die.
I want you to shut up.
MALIK: Tachy at 120.
Hemocue is eight.
Okay, transfuse another two units.
How soon can he go
to the OR? No vacancy.
I can turn over a room in 20 minutes.
KOVAC: Okay, you've got ten.
Have the blood bank
stay ahead four units.
Maybe you should just let me die.
BARNETT: A little more exposure?
Sure. Suction?
I got your blood.
Great, thanks.
Give it to her and get your butt over here.
More 4x4s, Ray?
BARNETT: Read my mind.
Can you visualize the brachial?
I'm working on it.
Eve was complaining about you today.
I don't even know who that is.
TAGGART: The nurse manager.
Tall blonde.
Oh, yeah, that Amazon?
She doesn't like me. Hey, show some respect!
This is her turf,
and you're damn lucky to be here.
You want to do the rest of your community service
in some smelly-ass soup kitchen?
Well, do you?!
No.
Well, you'd better get your act together then.
Okay, there it is.
Okay, ease up on the gauze.
( all shouting )
Sorry about that.
Proximal pressure.
I'm telling you, I hear one more complaint about you,
and your ass is...
That's one hell of a pep talk.
Let's get a gurney in here!
How much saline has she had?
Very little. It's TKO.
MARQUEZ: BP is 80 palp.
Why aren't you giving her fluids?
Permissive hypotension-- don't want to disrupt hemostasis.
When is she going to the OR? Waiting to hear from them.
You can't do permissive hypotension
without a definitive plan.
Abby, give her a liter wide open.
No, look, I've had experience with this, and it works.
I don't want our residents put in the position
of using unproven therapies on critical patients.
Dr. Kovac, we need you back in here.
KOVAC: Get her pressure up to 100 systolic.
PEREZ: Dr. Clemente.
Just a minute, please.
Well, CT's calling about your patient Darrel Insley.
Yeah, so what did Big Darrel do now?
He stopped breathing.
And why the hell would he do that?
Don't give a fluid bolus unless the MAP drops below 70.
BP's down to 60 palp.
Where are we on the packed cells?
Units three and four.
Hang another two.
Mr. Jansen?
Vincent, can you hear me?!
Sux and etomidate, 8-0 tube.
How fast we can get him upstairs?
Won't have an OR for at least ten minutes. Move him to pre-op.
He'll bleed out in the elevator.
Our job is to save lives, not judge them.
Death is the easy way out.
He deserves to rot in jail.
RASGOTRA: I'm in. Bag him.
KOVAC: What are you doing?
Exploratory laparotomy.
Here? Now?
Sterile drapes, cut-down tray, masks and gowns.
Scrub in, Neela.
You want to save this guy?
It's the only way I know how.
Sydney?
Come on, honey.
Come on, baby.
Hey, Luka!
Sydney...
Come on, Sydney.
Come on. Let's stay awake.
Say hi to your mom and dad, huh?
Sydney.
Somebody get Kovac in here.
Tachy to 150, BP not registering.
LOCKHART: Starting CPR. Can't get a pulse.
What do you need? Help.
She's going down.
Squeeze in the saline and give me two units packed cells.
You did type and cross her, didn't you? Of course I did.
Where is she bleeding? I don't know.
Chest tube slowed down at 300cc's, belly was clean.
You need to stay ahead of a patient like this.
My attending felt otherwise.
I'm the attending now. Prep the chest.
If she doesn't come back with a saline bolus, we'll crack her.
I was just talking...
Go ahead and intubate.
6-0, ET, and suction.
Okay, got it.
Well, here goes nothing.
All right.
Looking good, dry as a bone.
Okay, moist 4x4s.
Let down the Weitlaners.
Did you save my arm?
PRATT: Yeah, the bleeding is controlled.
You got this from here?
Piece of cake. I'll keep my eye on him.
Dry Kerlix, please.
Okay, what's his damage? One and half centimeter scalp lac.
Am I going to have a scar?
PRATT: Nothing anybody would be able to see.
What if I shaved my head?
Not such a good idea-- not with that helmet.
Two to three staples ought to do it.
Okay, I got this.
I never fainted before.
It's probably the best thing you could have done today.
What do you mean?
Eve was going to give you the boot.
Now she'll probably let you stay just out of pity.
Hold still.
Ow!
Yeah, that's going to burn a little.
It got a little tricky,
but he's a tough kid.
He's going to be just fine, okay?
Good to see you.
I'll come find you guys when I have more details.
Got a thing for the boys in blue, huh?
No. I know half of them.
My dad was as cop, retired.
My brother, fiance...
You're engaged?
I was-- a few years ago.
He was killed on the job.
I'm so sorry.
Thanks.
Still have a thing for that uniform though, you know.
Yeah.
Can I ask you a question?
Sure.
Under what circumstances would a prisoner
be transferred from one state to another?
Your ex?
He wrote me a letter saying he's being moved
from Cañon City in Colorado to Cook County.
There could be a lot of reasons,
but I can check it out for you.
Thanks.
Sam, this man is looking
for Dr. Rasgotra.
She's with a patient.
That's what I told him.
Dad, please, can we just go... Zoe...
Excuse me, I want to talk this doctor right now.
Yeah, well, you're going to have to wait,
unless I can help you.
She wrote this prescription for my daughter,
and I want to know why.
Doesn't your daughter know?
She won't tell me.
Dad, you're making a scene... Shh.
Well, if your daughter won't tell you, sir,
there's nothing that we can do about it.
Excuse me. Yes, there is.
You can get this damn doctor for me
right now, before I hit this whole place with a malpractice suit.
I've got lawyers, lady.
Yeah? Well, I've got Jerry.
So unless you want to be carried out of here like a dirty diaper,
I suggest you take a seat.
( sighs )
Come on, Zoe.
Thanks.
You know, I abhor violence.
Yeah, I know that.
But he doesn't.
So put on your best tough guy face.
Here we go.
From the xiphoid
to the symphysis pubis.
What kind of retractor do you need?
The human kind.
Lots of exposure.
What's this?
Linea alba.
Straight through it to the pre-peritoneal fat.
Retract the deep fascia.
Got it.
JERRY: Neela, you got a call
on line one. Sounds urgent.
Take a message. You need scissors?
No.
Poke a finger through the peritoneum and tear it open.
It's from a Lieutenant Strickland.
He's calling from Camp Claiborne in Iraq.
Okay, stand back.
Oh, God.
Can't take it, Jerry.
Get a number.
Okay, suction.
Lap pads.
LOCKHART: She's not responding to fluids.
She's in PEA.
Brady to 60.
10 blade to Abby. Rib spreader to me.
I'm not really used to doing this on kids.
Pretty much the same. It's just everything's smaller.
The pleura is dry.
Check the pericardium.
Oh, my God, it's full of blood. Really full.
Damn it. She's in tamponade.
LOCKHART: Too much pressure on the heart.
She's collapsed her ventricles.
Pick up and metz.
Where's Clemente?
Three lap pads around the suprahepatic space.
Three around Morrison's.
And the liver is packed off.
Eight units in.
Pressure's up to 90 systolic. That'll do.
OR's ready.
Okay, it helps to compress the liver
up against the diaphragm.
That was brilliant.
Another five minutes
and we would have been taking him to the morgue.
Let's go.
Sorry about your floor.
LOCKHART: Ready for another unit?
What the hell happened?
Cardiac tamponade.
That's impossible. It was a peripheral wound.
You know a bullet's trajectory can go anywhere.
She had a hemothorax.
She was only bleeding in the chest.
No, she was bleeding into the pericardium.
The pressure kept her heart from filling.
CLEMENTE: That's impossible.
There was no indication of tamponade.
Didn't you check for effusion on the ultrasound?
Of course, but there was sub-Q air.
I couldn't get a clear view.
KOVAC: She needed volume to fill her ventricle
and you withheld fluids.
Based on what we knew,
permissive hypotension was reasonable.
You killed her.
Um, her parents are coming here to take her home.
They think she was rescued.
Can we keep her alive until they get here?
Okay, let's cross clamp the aorta.
She's not bleeding in her belly. She's gone.
Well, this will help perfuse her heart and brain
until we get more blood into her.
Vascular clamp.
Vascular clamp!
Dr. Rasgotra, what's the word on that little girl?
They're still working on her.
The guy you brought in is going to pull through.
I wish it was the other way around.
Well, at least child molesters
don't last long in prison, right?
Are you a 'Hawks fan?
Excuse me?
Chicago Blackhawks.
Hockey.
I have two tickets to Friday's game against the Kings.
You interested?
You, me, hot wings, cold beer?
Sorry.
You more of a theater gal?
See, I figured as much.
I also have tickets to the opera and the Philharmonic.
You moonlight as a scalper?
No. Actually, my cousin does.
You know, I appreciate the offer,
but I don't get much time off.
Oh, yeah, I know that story.
Well, you know what. We'll just stay home.
We'll stay home. Order a deep dish.
You can quiz me on renal pathophysiology.
And what do you know about renal pathophysiology?
Not enough. That's why I need your help.
It's one of my fourth-year electives.
Fourth year of what?
Medical school.
I just do this for the free coffee.
Maybe some other time.
I'm sorry. I have to deal with something really urgent.
No problem. I'll see you around.
Doc.
Jerry, do you have that
Lieutenant's phone number for me?
Yeah.
Didn't say what it was about?
Sorry.
You have something sarcastic to say, Frank?
No.
MAN: Hey.
Hey, is this you? Dr. Rasgotra?
Yes.
Great.
You mind telling me what these are for?
See the patient's name below mine on the bottle?
That's who the prescription is for.
Unless you're Zoe Butler, I can't tell you anything.
Look, if you treated my daughter,
I need to know why.
I'm sorry, sir.
There are confidentiality rules.
Confidentiality?!
She's a little kid.
You didn't have my permission to treat her.
You know what? I want to see your supervisor.
Dad, let's go.
He won't tell you anything different.
In these situations, we...
What situations?
Is she pregnant? Is she using drugs?
What? I'm her father. I have a right to know.
Dad, please. If you want information,
it has to come from Zoe, not from me.
Excuse me.
I'm Dr. Barnett.
I've...
got this.
You the boss?
Ray...
Yeah, um, Mr. Butler, my name is Ray Barnett,
and the thing is...
I need to speak with you in private.
Neela... Ray...
Let me deal with this.
No.
You know, I can handle this.
No, you can't. Yes, I can.
How?
By talking to him?
Telling him his daughter has a sexually transmitted disease?
Because if you do, it's a breach of confidentiality.
Look, I just want to do the right thing.
Now you want to violate her privacy, too?
What you did is a crime, Ray.
If you tell him the truth, you'll go to jail.
You know that, right?
Best thing you can do
is just let it go and allow me to deal with this.
CLEMENTE: Clear.
LOCKHART: Asystole.
Resume compressions.
See if you can find a hole in the right ventricle.
Did she have a high-dose epi?
Five minutes ago.
If there's a cardiac injury to occlude,
we'll get better ventricular filling.
Pulseless V-fib and asystole for 25 minutes.
Still not perfusing with open compressions.
I'm giving her another chance.
All you're giving her is more abuse.
Stop it.
Just stop it.
3:49.
I'll sew up the chest before the family gets here.
MAN: Camp Claiborne.
Hello, I'm trying to reach a Lieutenant Strickland, please.
Can I ask your name and what this is regarding?
Neela Rasgotra. I'm returning his call.
One moment, ma'am.
Come on.
Miss Rasgotra?
Yes?
Lieutenant Strickland.
I understand you're a friend of Michael Gallant.
Yes, yes, I am.
Well, I have some bad news, ma'am.
There was an incident outside of Mosul.
Hello?
Lieutenant, can you hear me?
Lieutenant Strickland, are you there?
There were several casualties
and Michael's unit had a heavy patient flow.
He'll be unable to make it home on leave as anticipated.
His CASH is incommunicado right now.
He's asked me to pass this information on to you.
But Michael's all right? He's not injured or anything.
No, ma'am. A little homesick and sand-weary, I imagine,
but he's fine.
Uh, thank you, Lieutenant. I appreciate the phone call.
You're welcome, ma'am. You have a good night.
( sniffling )
Hey, does this look like a subdural to you?
Right here.
No. No.
95% of the time,
controlled hypotension would have worked in this situation.
Make sure you tell that to her family.
Come on. There's no way
she should have had a tamponade and you know that.
All I know is that she did.
And if she'd been given fluids, she would have survived.
That's not a certainty.
We would have seen the signs.
We could have drained
the pericardium.
Look, I did what I thought
was in her best interest.
Even when two other doctors disagreed with you.
Dubenko agreed with me.
You would have done the same even if he hadn't.
That's your style, do whatever the hell you want,
regardless of what anyone else thinks.
You don't like my style? What is that?
We were all here a long time before you.
We work together. You're the new guy.
You need to fit in with us...
What is this, a damn social club?
If you can't do that, then we have a problem.
I take risks to save my patients.
I'm sorry if that scares you.
Especially if you start sucking in the residents.
How about cutting-edge medicine?
I see a problem, I fix it-- bam!
What?
Maybe you should fix that.
( sniffling )
Here you go.
Does that happen often?
Only after five or six beers and a bar fight.
God, you know, people just seem really wired
after what happened the other day.
You picked up on that, too, huh?
Maybe we should have a critical incident debrief after shift.
That's a great idea.
Ooh, Dr. Barnett, we're going to have
a critical incident debrief in Exam 3 after shift.
Why?
Why do you think?
Look, this was a tough shift for people.
Helps if we can get a chance to decompress
before we go home.
Yeah, well, that's why God created beer, right?
This thing's mandatory?
Yes. Pass it on.
What do you think?
Kovac versus Clemente in a street fight?
Kovac has size, but I have a feeling Clemente's kind of squirrely.
I think you need help.
( sniffling )
What are you doing?
Nothing.
What happened to your nose?
Kovac.
He hit you?
No, but I bet he would like to have.
The last time I got one of these
was when Tina Marino caught me with her cousin.
Let me see. Let me see.
You're going to need to be packed.
No, it's tapering off.
Yeah, that's not working.
Lockhart, I'm fine. I'm fine.
I'm really sorry about the little girl.
Me, too.
I was trying to save her,
despite what Dr. Kovac might think.
I know.
Okay.
I'm really, really sorry.
Okay, put your head back.
Hey, Kerry, have you found someone to replace Susan
as chief of the ER?
We're still looking at candidates.
Is, uh, Clemente the favorite?
He's certainly up there. Why?
I'm just not sure he's the right person for the job.
Yeah, well, if you think of somebody better,
feel free to give me a call.
Uh, what about me?
You? I didn't think you wanted to be chief.
Luka, it's really not your style.
Well, maybe it's time for me to change my style.
Look, I've been here for a long time.
I know the people. I know the department.
I just want to put my name into the mixture.
The mix.
All right, I'll let the committee know you're interested.
Thank you.
Eve's waiting for you guys in Exam 3 for the big powwow.
She said it was mandatory.
Yeah, so did Clemente.
They want us to express our feelings
about what happened today.
Well, today sucked. Good night.
Great. Was it mandatory for everyone except the attendings?
Edna Casselman, 56, found down in the park, altered,
no sign of trauma.
Thank you, Edna. Tell Eve I'm with a patient.
( scoffs )
It can't be that bad, can it?
It's not that. Michael's leave has been postponed.
I'm sorry.
Hey, can I come by the house tonight, pick up my amp?
Whatever. I really don't feel like sticking around
for this dumb thing. Mm-hmm.
I'll ditch if you do.
I've got dinner reservations at Gibson's
if you want to grab a drink or five.
Wow. I like the way you think, roomie.
Your treat, right?
As long as you stop calling me that.
( chuckles )
How's the nose?
Seems to be working.
Thank you.
The hell with this. Go home.
See you later.
Eve, I thought it was a great idea.
I really did.
This department needs a lot of work.
This department needs a kick in the ass.
Yeah.
Parents show up?
No. They should be here soon.
After all she's been through.
Maybe she's better off.
I'm not sure anybody's better off dead.
Yeah. I recovered this in the parking lot.
She was asking for it earlier.
I got to go check in on Officer Howe.
I hear he's driving the nurses upstairs crazy.
How much trouble do you think
we're going to get in for not showing up?
Well, I'm not working again until Saturday
so hopefully things will have blown over by then.
You're kidding me. I'm working tomorrow.
That's great, Ray. Now I'm going
to get punished for both of us.
Whoa! Stop it! Stop it!
Security!
Someone call security!
Security!
Mr. Butler! Mr. Butler! Stop it!
( groans )
You ever come near my daughter again, and I'll kill ya.
You hear me?
( coughing )
Ray?
I'm fine. Right.
I'm fine!
WOMAN: ...across the Chicago area.
I'm going to widen the view out.
Big storms across central Illinois. This is along...
( knocking )
( TV turns off )
Hey.
Hey.
Want to come in?
You didn't, uh...
you didn't go to that debriefing.
Did you?
Yeah.
It was just me, Eve, and Clemente.
You hungry? You want some pizza?
I can warm it up in the microwave.
No, I'm not hungry. Okay.
Mad about something?
What do you think?
Yes? I didn't need to go to the briefing.
I don't care about that.
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about you and Clemente...
and whatever it is that is going on
between the two of you.
If you want to get into a pissing match with him,
that's fine, just leave me out of it.
He was wrong.
Yeah.
And that's the most important thing, isn't it?
He was wrong and you were right.
And while you were arguing about it, the little girl died.
As if she hadn't suffered enough.
God, she was ten years old, Luka.
And he had her for months,
and I just, I just can't stop thinking about...
( voice breaking ): what she must have gone through.
I can't stop thinking
about how afraid she must have been,
and I can't stop thinking about why we couldn't save her.
I just...
