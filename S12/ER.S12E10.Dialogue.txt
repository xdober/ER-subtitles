Previously on ER:
I'm not saying he's not a great guy,
he is, but do you know him?
Under what circumstances
would a prisoner be transferred
from one state to another?
Your ex?
I'm going to be the new ER chief.
You know, when I withdrew my name
I was hoping they'd pick you.
I'm going to make sure you work harder
than any other volunteer up in here.
So no more going out for donuts and chasing skirts.
Stay in the game, K.J. Otherwise, they win.
Would you like to...?
LUKA: Here's to discretion.
Propriety.
Maturity.
Well...
( whistling "Jingle Bells" )
How's it going, Louie?
I got two more sidewalks to clear
and a Furbie doll to find.
Hey, Louie.
No way.
Merry Christmas, buddy.
Thank you.
Hey, Dr. Kovac.
How's your mom doing?
One more treatment, then she's out.
Well, maybe this will cheer her up.
Thank you.
Ho-ho-ho! Ho-ho! Ho!
GIRL: I want one.
You look like you've been naughty.
No? There you go.
Ho-ho!
Well, look what the reindeer dragged in.
This is for you, Frank.
Wow. Last time I got a present in this hospital
is when that helicopter fell on Romano.
For you.
Oh, wow, a neon stethoscope.
Thanks, Santa Kovac.
What about me?
'N Sync's Greatest Hits? You didn't?!
I mean, I was hoping you didn't.
I love this love. Bear tickets. Thanks, man.
Just one?
Looks like it's you and me, man.
Okay, and now the bonus.
Since it's Christmas Eve, we're only going to need
a skeleton crew tonight, so I'm letting three support staff
and one resident home with pay.
I did the manual disimpaction.
I did a pelvic on a 300-pounder.
I debrided maggots out of a diabetic ulcer, you wankers.
This is going to jinx us into a night of trauma hell.
Okay, Rock-Paper-Scissors.
Neela and Morris, you're first.
No, this is sheet metal.
Morris, you're out.
Pratt.
Ray.
You suck.
Thank you, thank you, and thank you.
Michael and I are going to Jamaica
and I have tons of packing to do.
What, somebody giving lap dances
and I wasn't even invited?
Santa's sending people home.
"'N Sync." I didn't know you were gay.
Evil elf.
It's the thought that counts.
Maybe you could think about calling Jodie back,
getting her off my freaking back.
She did not call again.
Eight times.
Look, is there any way
to, like, change the main number?
Maybe you could work from somewhere
with a different extension, like Cambodia.
Ah! Hi.
Oh, hi.
Sorry I'm late.
I had to pick up the cake for the Christmas party.
No problem. Come here.
Oh, wow. That's for me?
Yeah. Open it.
Now? Yeah.
I can't.
Oh, tomorrow morning then.
Okay.
Are we spending Christmas together?
That's what you said last night.
No, I didn't.
You probably don't remember other things you said.
Shut up.
I never said anything about us.
We should.
We should?
Okay.
I should change.
I'll help.
Is Alex playing hockey again?
They just don't move you
from out of state for no reason.
Make sure that coach doesn't bench him this year.
He's got skills.
Are you listening to me?
Yes.
I need to see him, Sammy.
Steve...
It'd really help me right now.
I want to know why you were moved to Illinois?
It's nothing. It's nothing.
Do you still have the guitar that I gave Alex?
Yeah.
The DVD player, camcorder?
Yes.
People might come looking for those.
People with warrants.
Unbelievable.
You are such a piece of crap.
I'll explain everything to Alex.
No, you won't.
Don't call and don't write.
I've changed, Sam, I really have.
God is helping me.
Oh, yeah? Hell of a job he's doing.
He's making me see things
that I've done wrong. Sam, please?
Merry Christmas, jerk-off.
Tamara Gordon, 30, altered restrained MVC
with passenger space intrusion.
OLBES: Tachy to 110, good BP, sats 97%.
Frontal hematoma, breath sounds clear.
I'm Dr. Kovac. How are you doing, Tamara?
I'm okay.
Do you remember what happened?
TAMARA: Bring the green one...
Other driver skidded on black ice. Let her tell me.
Tamara? Tamara?
Ah, she's seizing!
Two of ativan.
Could be an intra-cranial bleed.
Let CT know we'll be up there
as soon as seizure stops.
I need background singers for the party tonight.
Ooh, I'll do it.
I want someone to have my back,
not stab me in it.
Baby, I got your back.
I'm looking for somebody who can sing, sing.
I can sing sing.
Seriously, I got soul.
I'm super bad.
Haleah takes her Christmas gig very seriously.
I grew up in a Baptist church.
I'm holding auditions in the lounge.
You're welcome to sign up.
And so are you, Dr. Weaver.
Yeah. For the tenth year in a row,
I think I'll pass.
75-year-old male, cough times two days,
no significant history,
afebrile, vitals normal.
Exam?
Good breath sounds. Otherwise, unremarkable.
X ray?
Normal heart, lung fields clear.
Your dispo?
I was about to send him home,
but he started complaining
of severe epigastric pain.
Did you check amylase and lipase?
Yeah. Not back yet.
All right. Let's see how he's doing.
Doc, am I going to lay here all day
just like a piece of herring?
I sure hope not, Mr. Goldstein.
I'm allergic to pickled fish. Dr. Clemente.
Oh, Doc, do I look pale?
I feel like I'm pale.
You know, let me check you out
so you can go home right away.
Can you see if my cell count is back
on my lizard-breeder's LP?
Sure. Thank you.
Pupils equal and sluggish.
Tamara, you were in a car accident.
Do you know where you are?
In a hospital?
Heart rate's 127.
Okay, hang a liter of NS.
Tamara, can you tell me today's date?
Chest wall stable.
Christmas Eve.
Good.
December 24, Chicago.
Breath sounds okay.
1986.
Still post-ictal.
Tamara, do you have any medical disorder:
Seizures?
Tamara?
Tamara?!
Tamara! She's not responding.
It could be subclinical seizure.
Another two of ativan.
Radiology says CT's negative.
Sat's only 86.
Okay, crank up the O2.
Guys, she's hyponatremic.
Hypotonic saline, 25 cc's.
We don't keep that in here.
Got to go to the drug lockup.
Go get it, then.
I can't leave. I'm the only nurse.
Guys, she's going apneic.
Okay, bag her through it.
You guys need an extra hand in here?
Where are the other nurses?
Oh, well, we're a little light,
seeing as Santa Claus sent half of 'em home.
ABBY: Hey, you out of here?
I'm a little nervous.
Well, it's a honeymoon, Neela.
You're going to have fun.
I'm not worried about that.
Oh, right, you hate to fly.
Oh, it's not that either.
I've got my Xanax and a sleeping mask.
So what is it?
We're stopping at his parent'' for Christmas dinner
before we go.
Ah. Do they know you're married?
I heard Michael tell them on the phone.
And?
Then I heard a dial tone.
We need to confer.
ABBY: Confer?
I have some department chief business
to go over with you in lockup.
I'm checking LP results for Clemente.
Clemente can wait.
You guys seem cozy.
Yeah.
We're spending Christmas together.
Really?
Look up. You got to kiss.
Kiss?
Britney and Madonna did it.
Perverts start young these days.
Hyponatremia is the condition
in which the sodium concentration of the blood
is abnormally low.
It does weird things to the fluid balance of the body
that can cause serious problems like seizures.
How'd she get this?
Well, a lot of things can cause it.
Any vomiting, diarrhea?
No.
Do you take diuretics, laxatives?
No.
Okay. Creatinine's normal.
Kidney's seem to be working all right.
How long before I can go home?
Oh, you're not going home.
I mean, at least not tonight.
But I'm fine.
You need to be admitted.
I got two kids that are expecting gifts
under the tree tomorrow.
Okay, I understand,
but we need to work this up to find out
why your sodium's so low
so that this never happens again.
No. I can't do this to my kids.
So whose kitchen are you dirtying up tomorrow?
I don't know.
I hadn't really given it much thought.
Guess what I got you?
Give me a hint.
Um, it's small.
Small. A necklace.
It's not jewelry.
Hey, our hyponatremia lady is signing out AMA.
She can't.
Then maybe you want to come and stop her.
Okay, I'll be right out.
Luka.
Yeah?
You're going to love what I got you.
You didn't get me anything.
Yes, I did.
No, you didn't. I did, too.
Keep guessing.
All right. Not jewelry. Sparkplugs.
Right.
A glass frog.
How did you know?
I'm not even close?
Listen, page me when you have a clue.
Okay.
Well, just come over
when you're done with your mother's.
I don't care how late it is.
You know, I got a stocking for you.
Actually, I have two-- They're fishnets and I'm gonna...
Ooh, I gotta go. I'll call you later.
You're late. I got tied up.
Uh-huh. Well, the phones still work.
Sorry, I had to drop my kid off at a friend's house
and then I had to take care of some personal stuff.
Get in line. You know my linebacker just called.
He was supposed to spend the weekend with me.
I think he's flaking out.
Linebacker, huh?
He plays for Cincinnati.
Hey, our ice skater's back from Radiology.
All right, I'll pick up her films.
Six-year-old female, single GSW to the abdomen.
Shallow resps, tachy in the 150s, Bp at 150 palp.
Access?
In the left tibia.
It hurts.
Please, you got to help her!
Good breath sounds.
How'd this happen?
We were buying garlands
and a bullet came through the window.
There was a dead guy at the scene.
700 cc's en route.
Trauma One. Let's go.
What's her name? Danielle.
Daniell, we're going to fix you up, okay?
Oh, lost the carotid. No pulse.
Does that mean that she's dying?
Satinksy. Cross clamping the aorta.
400 cc NS bolus
and call for two more units of O-neg.
Cordis introducer.
Chest is dry.
WEAVER: Hold compressions.
ABBY: Still no pulse.
Another epi and get ready with atropine.
CBC and trauma panel, type and cross for four.
Belly's full of blood. Notify the O.R.
Subclavian's in, threading easily.
Check for pulses with compressions.
WEAVER: She's got a carotid.
She needs a foley. O.R.'s ready.
I've got the blood bank, two units.
PRATT: Make it four and tell them to rush it.
Hey, Chuny, page Olivia Evans.
She's at the social worker party.
See if she can come down for this woman.
CAROLERS: * Joy to the world
* The Savior reigns
* Let Earth receive... *
Eight candles!
And we get gifts with each one.
What the hell is Kwanza anyway?
It's a made-up thing like Flag Day.
Who you calling made-up, fat boy?
Yeah, fat boy!
Is her husband okay with her leaving?
BARNETT: I get the impression
she generally makes the decisions.
Never heard that one before.
Repeat electrolytes aren't even back yet.
How about the UA?
Uh, it's normal,
but we still don't know what the cause is.
Mrs. Gordon, do you understand
that you'll be leaving against medical advice?
Honey, why don't you go get the car.
I'll meet you out front.
It's okay, just go.
You shouldn't go home yet.
I feel much better.
Hyponatremia is serious.
You need to stay here and be monitored.
I thought you fixed me with that saline stuff.
No, no, the fix could be temporary.
If your sodium falls again,
you could have another seizure.
KOVAC: Or worse.
It's Christmas.
Severe hyponatremia can cause a coma,
permanent brain damage, even death.
We got an MVA rolling in.
I'll meet you in a second.
We need to figure out why this is happening.
That's the only way for us to help you.
You can't help me.
Three months ago, I went to the doctor for a stomachache,
I walked out a cancer patient.
Ovarian.
I'm sorry.
It had already spread to the liver and the lungs.
Five year survival, less than five percent.
All the more reason for you to stay.
You can't fight this
if you don't take care of yourself.
I don't want to fight this.
Treatment means surgery,
chemo, months in a hospital bed.
I don't want that.
I don't want my kids to remembering me
as this weak, bald, dying woman.
I can devote my remaining time
to some futile fight or to my family.
I'm choosing my family.
What does your husband want?
He doesn't know.
Look, after the holidays, I'll tell him.
But right now... I'm going home.
I already told you: it happened so fast.
No license plate, nothing?
No. Why don't you give her a break.
I'll call you if anything changes.
Thanks.
He asked me if I saw the guy's face
and I didn't, so...
It's okay. It's okay.
They're trying to stabilize her.
We want to get her up to surgery as soon as possible.
Oh, that's good.
Here are her things.
I told her Santa wouldn't bring her anything
unless she wrote it all down.
We're doing everything we can.
Neighborhood's always been dangerous.
When I moved to New York,
I asked my mom to come live with us but she wouldn't.
Do you want me to call her,
arrange to have her meet you here?
Her diabetes-- she can barely walk.
Well, is there anyone else? A friend or family...?
My husband.
He's flying in tonight,
but he doesn't know about this.
Is there anything I can get you?
I should try Jason again.
Maybe I can catch him during the layover.
Thanks.
Yeah, hey, this is Dr. Kovac from the ER,
looking for a repeat sodium level
on a patient: Tamara Gordon.
Dr. Kovac, are you auditioning today?
I'm not sure yet.
Hey, schizo.
Mickey Goldstein's labs are back.
What about you, Dr. Clemente?
Are you a singer?
* Deck the halls with boughs of holly *
*Fa-la-la-la-la... Very nice.
Abby's short on baked goods,
so maybe you can help her out there.
Okay, Good news.
All your blood tests came back completely normal.
Bad news.
I feel like there's a truck
parked on my spleen.
Well, you can go home now.
Merry Christmas.
Wait a minute, my cough.
What about this terrible cough?
Don't worry about it.
It's probably just a little virus, that's all.
Virus? Well, can a virus cause chest pain?
What chest pain?
Oh, terrible massive pressure, right here.
Oh, the pain.
Why didn't you tell the other doctor about it?
It just started a little while ago.
Mm-hmm.
You still stuffing that suit?
I went to buy some Kinte cloth
but the salesgirls used it all
to wipe themselves.
That's why I kicked your ass.
How did you guys get started in this anyway?
Some "employee" complained
that our company only celebrates Christmas,
so the boss decided to throw a PC holiday party
to show how we all get along.
EVE: That sounds like a plan.
Santa, how do you handle one of those on your lap?
Oh, we break out the big Santa for that one.
Okay, that's enough.
Maybe I should bring her a leg tomorrow.
You don't stop talking, I'm gonna shove a leg... Eve...
You're a real nutcracker.
You want to help me jingle my bells?
You know, instead of pissing all over everyone else,
piss in that, okay?
I'm in too much pain to walk.
I need a urine sample-- now!
Crit's 31.
Hold compressions.
I've got a weak pulse.
All right, that's what I want to hear.
Let's get a BP.
All right, tube position looks good.
What's the delay?
Surgery's here.
Where's Dubenko?
On vacation.
I'm Dr. Albright. I'm covering for him.
PRATT: Bullet in right upper quadrant.
Cross clamped the aorta for traumatic full arrest.
ALBRIGHT: You told us almost an hour ago
you were redlining this patient to the O.R.
We've got a whole team scrubbed and waiting.
She hasn't been stable enough to move.
Didn't have a pulse.
Be more discriminating when you use the word "redline."
We hear it, we drop everything
and run to the O.R.
You don't redline a pulseless patient.
Yeah, well, the important thing is she has a pulse now,
She's bradying down. so let's go.
And we just lost that pulse.
Resume compressions.
Wow, you have a real three-ring circus in here.
Dr. Albright, I don't think we've met.
I'm Dr. Weaver, chief of staff.
Oh, Dr. Weaver.
I'm the surgical Chief resident.
Just got back from a VA rotation.
Good for you. Epinephrine, point two.
Type-specific blood is up.
PRATT: Hang a unit.
Give us a call when you know what's going on.
I know what's going on.
We can't hold the O.R. for a dead kid.
She's not dead.
Uh-huh.
What the hell?
She's a bitch, but unfortunately, she's right.
Let's get the mom in here.
All right, I'm going in with an atrial line.
14 gauge and four more units.
CAROLERS: * Noel, noel
* Noel, noel...
Hey.
Merry Christmas, Doctors.
Merry Christmas.
You're letting her go home?
You saw her sodium level.
She needs to be home.
She could develop central pontine myelinolysis.
She could start seizing again.
We'll re-check her level in the morning.
She promised to come back after her kids open their presents.
You're not gonna believe this.
Joe just called.
He wants to spend Christmas at his mother's.
That could be fun.
Without me.
Well, maybe
it's a family tradition.
You guys can spend New Year's together.
I guess.
* We wish you a merry Christmas *
* We wish you a merry Christmas... *
Isn't this cute?
Ray Charles, Stevie Wonder
and Roy Orbison together at last.
What did you just say?
My bad, Roy Orbison wasn't blind.
He just wore the glasses.
You sit down.
I'm not gonna tell you again.
You're ruining our performance!
You guys sound great. Keep going.
Yeah, and don't yell at me again
or you won't see any gifts under the tree.
Oops, my bad! You won't see 'em anyway.
( laughing )
Ho, ho, ho, you piece of crap.
Resume compressions.
Another atropine and stand by with epi.
She's had eight rounds of meds, Pratt.
Bring her mom in.
Just five more minutes.
The cardiac line might help us catch up with her blood loss.
I'm getting her now.
I'll go get her.
Is she okay?
I'll let you guys talk.
Would you like to come in and see your daughter?
Are you finished?
How is she doing?
Danielle's condition is very serious.
But you're helping her. I can see that.
We've given her fluids,
we've give her medicines,
we've even opened up her chest,
but her heart's just not beating on its own.
What are you saying?
Nadine, please, come with me... No. Just go back in there
and you help her.
It would be good for her to have you there.
Just hearing your voice. ( sobbing )
Okay? Mm-hmm.
MARQUEZ: Sat's are not coming up.
It's getting harder to bag her.
Up the rate. Watch your pressures.
PRATT: It's okay, you can get close.
Hey, sweetie.
You have been so strong today.
She responded to the calcium?
We've given her medications
to try to restart her heart,
but nothing's working.
She lost too much blood.
They've been working real hard
to keep you here.
Remember how I told you God does things for a reason?
Well, maybe he just wants you with him real bad right now.
I want you to know...
I want you to know that it's okay to let go.
See, God doesn't want you to be in any pain--
neither does Mommy.
Daddy and I, we love you
so much.
We will always love you.
So...
don't be afraid.
Don't be afraid.
It's all right.
Rate's coming up.
She's got a pulse.
Epi infusion, point one cc per kilo.
What's happening?
Her heart's beating again.
WEAVER: Package her up.
Let's go.
I want her fired.
Things got a little out of hand.
She poured pee on me!
At least it was your pee.
Oh, you think that's funny?
These guys saw what happened. Saw it?
We can still smell it.
What'd you have for lunch, asparagus fries?
We didn't see it, Santa.
No, but you heard it.
Yeah, and it sounded good, you fat bastard. ( laughing )
Dr. Clemente?
Yeah, what's up?
Nice going, Santa.
That nurse boss you got there
threw urine on me. I want her fired.
Eve did what?
Yeah, these guys were really out of control.
Eve told them to be quiet,
but they wouldn't listen.
So she pours pee on me?! I want her fired!
Oh, crap.
Hey, you listening to me?
Dr. Clemente,
your East Coast squeeze is here.
Tell her I'm with a patient.
She's kind of a looker,
in an interstate off-ramp kind of way.
Please, Frank, please, please.
Hey...
I need some help with this. Where you going?
Take it to Kovac. He's the boss, right?
I talked to the cops. The store owner I.D.'d the kids.
He's seen them around before.
They're going to pick them up now.
NADINE: Good. That's good.
PRATT: What the hell are you talking about?
You're supposed to be holding a room for my GSW.
Tell them this kid can' wait.
I don't care.
The kid can't wait. Her chest is open.
She's got a pulse.
Two minutes and that's it.
The O.R.'s full.
They're going to take her as soon as they can.
Now! They're going to take my child now.
or else I'll move her to another hospital.
She's not stable enough to move.
I want you to call Shriner's or Children's.
Look, if they don't call back within two minutes,
I'll take her up myself. I promise, okay?
( off-key ): * Holy infant, so tender and mild *
* Sleep in heavenly peace
* Sleep in heavenly peace. *
( off-key ): * Silent night
* Holy night
* All is calm
* All is bright
* Round young virgin, mother and child... *
( off-key ): * Holy infant so tender and mild *
( voice cracking ): * Sleep in heavenly peace
* Sleep in heavenly peace. *
* Jingle bells, jingle...
( clearing throat )
* Jingle bells...
What... how did it go?
Remember Debbie Allen from Fame?
Yeah.
Yeah, well, Haleh makes her look like Mother Teresa.
HALEH: Next!
You punched a patient.
He's lucky I didn't have a gun.
You can get suspended for this.
Oh, the guy's a moron.
He's a moron who wants to call his lawyer.
Good, I'll punch him too.
Now, keep the splint dry.
Watch for any pain, numbness, discoloration.
And remember, just 'cause Santa's reindeer can fly,
doesn't mean you can, okay?
Eve...
I'm busy. Walk with me.
Eve, hold on. What?
You have to go over there and apologize.
You want me to say I'm sorry
to some jerk who was teasing blind kids?
I want you to apologize so we can salvage this situation.
And if I don't?
You can lose your job!
Listen, Dr. Kovac, you may have gotten a gold star
and become chief of the department,
but I hate to break it to you--
only the nursing supervisor can fire me.
Okay, we've got no signs of ischemia or LVH or arrhythmias.
So, what have I got?
You've got absolutely nothing wrong with you.
Wait a minute, what about the headache?
What headache?
This terrible pounding between my eyes? You've got pounding, yeah?
Yeah, it keeps me awake all night. Mm-hmm.
And it's worse during the day. Right.
You know, I'm starting to smell something.
Yeah, I smell something. Yeah, me, too.
What is that? I don't know, bull crap maybe.
Oh, geez.
Come on, Mickey, first you say it's your stomach,
then your heart, then your head. Come on.
Look, I just can't go home.
Well, you got no choice, okay?
I need these beds for really sick patients.
Look, I need this bed.
Yeah, well, you know, you've wasted enough tax dollars.
Come on, just go home to your wife.
Just go.
My wife died about four years ago.
So what-- you're tired of spending
Christmas alone?
Tired of watching
Miracle on 34th Street by yourself?
Yeah, especially in living color.
Right.
How long you going to keep me waiting?
I've got... I've got a patient here, okay, Jodie?
Please, do you mind?
You're signing him out.
No, I'm not signing him out. He's really sick.
He's got Ohniatis Muchgotow.
He got it in Brazil, right, Mickey?
Yeah, right, Brazil.
I never heard of that.
That's right, because you're an ICU nurse, that's why.
And this is a toxicology problem.
In fact, he needs to be admitted
and watched tonight, and especially tomorrow.
Haleh.
Haleh, please.
Yeah, I've called you 20 times.
Right, and I haven't answered you back for a reason.
What's up?
That's why I'm here--
because I wanted to see you in person.
Breathe normally.
Go back. Go back to Jersey, go back to your husband.
Just leave me alone.
My husband is not going to find me,
so why don't you just relax.
Your husband's a cop, okay?
And don't tell me to relax.
Dr. Clemente, do you need me?
Haleh, yes, I do.
Mr. Goldstein needs to be signed in and needs to be observed for...
Systemic Ponderosa.
Systemic Ponderosa.
What?
You heard me.
Just write it down.
( softly ): I'll explain it to you later.
Jodie, please.
Come on.
Hurry up.
Have you witnessed violent behavior before?
I never said she was violent.
Angry?
She's very good at her job.
Today was just, a... a hard day.
Ms. Taggart...
Look, I don't feel comfortable evaluating her.
She's my boss.
That's part of management, Sam.
That's what everyone keeps telling me,
but I don't understand why you can't just bring her in here
instead of talking about her behind her back.
I will talk to her,
but we believe in 360 evaluation here
from supervisors, peers and subordinates.
So I expect you to be honest with me.
After she punched Santa and poured the urine on him,
what did she do?
She went to lunch.
Okay.
Thank you for your time,
Ms. Taggart.
So what happens now?
Well, this is grounds for immediate termination.
Oh, come on.
You can't fire Eve on Christmas Eve.
Look, it was good between us, okay?
Actually, actually, okay, it was great.
But that was for awhile.
God, you look good.
Jodie, you're married, okay?
Which is something that you deliberately omitted
when we first met.
You knew. No, I didn't know.
Okay, at first, at first.
Okay, but you know what?
It doesn't matter now,
because I can't stop thinking about you.
Jodie, Jodie, stop it, stop it.
I want you to hop on the first plane
and get the hell out of here, okay?
Before your husband comes here and puts a bullet in my ass.
Just tell me the truth.
Don't you miss it?
No, not at all.
You never think about it? You never think about us?
No, I don't think about us.
See, I think... that whenever I called,
you wanted me to call.
That's such bull.
I think that whenever you heard
my voice, you sprung to attention.
Oh, come on, don't be ridiculous.
And you went into a room,
and you saluted your little soldier.
Big soldier.
I know.
But, see, I'm here now, baby.
( passionate moaning )
Systolic's up to 83.
The art line's a little hinky.
If the waveform looks blunted, try repositioning.
This is probably a waste of time,
but it's a good opportunity
for the residents and medical students
to get a look at fresh young organs.
This is a child. Keep that in mind.
Yeah, I'll see you when you get here, honey.
They're taking her up to surgery.
Anesthesia will have some more questions for you.
Thank you.
Danielle's a fighter.
They're going to take good care of her.
Thank you.
Nice work.
Thanks.
Hey.
Hey, is she going to make it?
Not sure yet.
Did they find those shooters?
Still looking.
I'm going to come back later. I need to go out for awhile.
Where you going?
Come see.
You know, when they find these jerks,
the cops will make them come here,
make them see what they've done.
What's all this?
It's a vigil for Danielle.
But she's not dead.
They're praying to keep her that way.
Really?
Really.
Not bad, Olivia, not bad, baby.
Pratt! Our little girl brady-ed down in the elevator.
Lost her pulse. Brought her back to Trauma One.
Tell them to keep praying.
( sniffling )
Hey. Oh.
I just can't believe it.
On Christmas.
I know. I'm so sorry.
I just tried so hard, you know?
And now I... it... it's all nothing
You're gonna be fine.
Don't talk like that.
You know how hard it is out there.
Yeah, but you're experienced.
Hospitals are always looking for good nurse managers.
What?
What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?
My boyfriend just dumped me.
Oh.
Wait a minute.
What did you...?
Am I getting fired?
Uh... I didn't say that.
Answer me! Am I getting fired?
I've gotta get back to work.
What?! Oh, of course.
What did I expect?
Jodie, come on.
I'm setting up a new life here.
I want as little drama as possible.
You can understand that, can't you?
Mm-hmm.
Bobby hit me.
What?
Broke a rib.
I'm sorry. I didn't know.
But you didn't say anything.
Look, why didn't you go to the police?
He is the police. All they would've done is
come over, give Bobby a high five and then
had a beer with him.
I left him.
Mm-hmm.
Vic, I'm not going back.
Now...
I'm at the Marriott.
If you want to call me, do,
and if you don't...
then you can have a nice holiday.
( sighing ): Oh, my God...
At least she's saving on long distance.
Come on, Frank.
Was that Jodie?
How do you know her name?
Because she calls Frank about eight times a day
and I talk to her about three.
That's great.
Must've been.
Your fly is down.
Hey, Abby.
There's a snowplow accident coming in.
I'm making Croatian bread and a turkey.
What are you cooking?
Cooking...
Do you have amnesia from the last time we dated?
I thought that little girl was gonna die hours ago.
I guess she's not ready to go yet.
Is that them?
We got confessions.
Thanks for bringing them.
You're welcome.
Hey, what are we doing here?
What, you taking us to the morgue or something?
Somewhere even better. This way.
What happened?
She was fine until we tried to move her.
Holding compressions.
She's down on the right. Tension pneumo.
Chest tube tray and 14 French for Dr. Pratt.
I got the heart.
What's happening?
Her lung collapsed.
We're inserting a tube to reinflate it.
Nadine. PRATT: Betadine.
They found them?
Yes. They're outside.
Is it still okay if we bring them in?
I don't want to be in here for that.
I need to be able to see my daughter.
Okay. Yeah, we can have you go
wait in the hall.
I'll come get you in a minute.
Hey, nice shot, guys.
We didn't shoot no girl.
No, you didn't mean to, but your bullet went through
that other guy and landed here. Nah, dawg.
Yeah, dawg.
Right into her belly.
Ripped through her liver, her intestines and her spleen--
tube-- Took out countless veins and arteries
along the way, causing her abdomen to fill up
with blood. She's bleeding out so fast
we had to crack her chest open.
Yo, get us out of here.
No, no. Stay. Admire your work.
You know, your one shot is probably
gonna kill this little girl,
and if she lives, well... think about it. What if
this was your little sister lying here, having to have
her intestines removed and crap into a bag
for the rest of her life?
Pratt. Answer me.
Come on, man. And while you're laying
in that jail cell, I want you to remember what
you did to this little girl.
And for what? A dime bag?
'Cause somebody looked at you wrong?
All right, let's get them out of here.
Her name's Danielle Hopkins.
She's six years old!
Hey... You got me fired?
I don't have anything to do with you, remember?
Check with the nursing supervisor.
Yeah, I just did. She said I had to clear out
within the next two hours.
You know it's Christmas.
You'll be missed.
Bite me.
Don't make me call Security.
Oh, no, it's fine, I'm leaving on my own, but you know,
I tried to do something good here.
I tried to elevate this stupid ER,
and instead of getting praise, I get fired on Christmas Eve?!
Screw yourselves. You all suck.
Eve, come on. Calm down. Oh, you,
you, behind my back, trying to get my job.
Merry Christmas, Judas.
They've controlled the bleeding.
Vitals are good.
It looks like she's gonna pull through this.
I always wanted a girl.
I thought it would be easier, safer...
Those guys are gonna pay for what they did.
I don't want them to pay.
I want them to stop.
We turn our backs on these kids,
we don't educate them and then we wonder why this happens.
People have choices.
Some people don't know they do.
Is it over?
Not bad for your first shift.
Cleared the board and an employee.
I didn't have a choice.
Yeah. I gotta go get Henry.
I'll see you at Ike's.
Hey, what's up?
Nothing.
I'm gonna go play my game.
Thank you so much
for having a play date on Christmas Eve.
I can take 'em on New Year's if you want.
You know, Sam, I don't think so.
What's wrong? Is there a problem?
Alex keeps telling Willie his father's dead.
That's not true.
And now he's telling Willie his dad's gonna die, too.
I'm sure he's just joking around.
Sam, Alex needs help,
and until you get that for him, I'd prefer
he not hang out with Willie.
Heather.
I'm sorry.
Anything I can do?
Uh... thanks, I got it.
Alex?
What's up?
Why did you tell Willie that your father is dead?
Hey, answer me.
I don't need him.
So that's like being dead.
Come on. Your dad has problems,
but he loves you.
You know that. I know you love him.
If he loved me, he'd call.
He can't call you, Alex,
but he misses you.
No, he doesn't.
You're just lying for him.

Hey. Hi.
What's this?
I brought you a present.
Wow.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
This beats what I got you.
Open yours.
A compass?
I know it's corny.
It seems we're always finding each other.
It's beautiful.
Can we talk?
Yeah, sure.
You okay? Yeah.
Maybe go outside for a minute?
Okay.
I don't know how to say this.
What?
Well, it's just that these past few weeks
have been really, you know,
I-I couldn't have imagined it better.
For me, too.
Yeah. I haven't laughed so much
or felt so good in a really, really long time,
and I don't want to do anything to ruin that.
Hey, you won't. I promise.
Luka.
Yeah?
Oh, man.
What?
I'm pregnant.
