Previously on ER:
We're gonna have a baby.
I know.
You're not going anywhere. I don't care what Dr. Cruella says.
You must have impressed Albright.
How so?
You've been accepted into the surgical elective.
Really?
Your dick of a husband Bobby's
put up a missing person's report.
I haven't seen her.
But I can see what's going on here
and it's pretty low.
How long do you think
before I'm walking around
with my testicles in a jar? You tell me.
Vicky, Vic, Vic.
Ooh, I love you.
We have no attending for the day shift.
Clemente hasn't shown up yet and can't be reached.
PRATT: Intractable hiccups is on his way up to the floor,
self-tanner ingestion is waiting on tox,
and freaky nail gun girl needs Keflex and a psych consult.
Freaky nail gun girl?
Yeah, performance artist.
Believe me, you do not want to know.
Dr. Pratt, who's the lucky lady?
Oh, no, no, it's nothing like that.
It's just a little charity event I gotta attend to.
Oh, don't you be coy, Pratt.
Chicago's 50 hottest bachelors are being auctioned off
to benefit the Chicago Health Coalition.
JERRY: Impressive.
I, the 51st hottest bachelor, didn't make the cut.
How does Olivia feel about this?
Feel about what?
The fact that somebody's buying a date with her boyfriend.
Oh, no, no, I wouldn't put it that way.
It's a good cause, she's cool.
Really? Your African-American girlfriend is "cool"
with her African-American boyfriend being put up
on the block for a bunch of rich, white women to bid on?
Take it easy, Angela Davis.
How do you know they're all white?
PRATT: See ya.
Who's our attending?
Oh, we got a moonlighter again, thank God.
What are you talking about?
They're useless.
They never know how anything works.
Exactly. I conned the guy
yesterday into buying dinner
for the entire overnight staff.
Aw, that eggplant thing was delicious.
That's great, Morris. What else did you do?
Tape a "kick me" sign to his back?
Oh, you heard. Wasn't that awesome?
Is Clemente ever coming back?
He's missed, like, three shifts in a row.
Four.
Hope he's okay.
Hey, you met Jodie. I bet he's more than okay.
He's probably just
on a little * holiday.
( chuckling ): Ho, ho, ho.
14-letter word for "no higher form."
"No higher form."
( muttering )
"Quintessence."
( chuckling ): Shut up.
Quintessence-- go ahead, try it.
"Q-u-i-n-t-...
s-s..."
Oh, my God, you're so smart!
How did you know that?
It's Shakespeare, baby. Shakespeare.
"Oh, that is too, too sullied flesh or nothing..."
Shush, shush, shush.
I'm hungry. What time is it?
( clacking )
Whoa!
( laughing )
Time to get a new bed obviously.
No, I'm serious.
Oh, baby, what do you want me to do?
It's dark out, huh?
Mm.
Okay.
Eight letters for...
"great haste."
"Great haste." "Great haste."
"Alacrity."
Oh, do you want to see a movie?
Oh, yeah, I was thinking more like in a movie theater.
TV is good.
Vicky, come on.
What?
It's been a week.
I think we can go outside now.
We got everything we need right here.
( soft chuckle )
Okay, eight-letter word for "brisk."
Hmm... ( snorts )
( giggling )
Ah!
( sniffing ) ( giggling )
( slurping )
Let me see. Let me see.
"Brisk." "Brisk."
( soft moaning )
"Brisk." How about...
"spanking"? Ow!
( laughing ): Ow!
"Quintessence."
I don't think "quintessence" fits.
300. 300.
325.
325.
400.
Whoa, easy, ladies.
It's only dinner.
( laughter )
425!
425!
450!
450!
475!
475!
490!
Wow.
490! 490 is the bid.
Do I hear higher? Anybody?
MAN: $600!
Ah, hot off the presses:
a missive from the long-lost Carter.
Carter? Really? Yeah.
Finally found a stamp, huh?
Does he say why we haven't heard from him in so long?
He's happy. He's busy.
Yeah, or he just doesn't miss this place.
Hard to imagine.
What's it say? How's Kem?
Hold on. Hold on.
MORRIS: It's called the ER for a reason.
ER residents get to do the chest tubes and lines.
End of story.
Until your hack-jobs get stuck,
and you have to call us to do damage control.
Okay, Dr. Kovac, I need the mighty force
of your authority here, please.
I'll read it later.
You don't see me running to my attending like a punk.
What's the problem?
Dr. Stalin here is invading our turf again.
Wow, Morris, you're so versed in world history.
Well, you know what, in college, I spent a semester in Germany.
( clears throat )
Where we studied...
...Russia.
MORRIS: See?
I know all about Stalin.
Look, how do you expect my residents
to clean up your messes
if you don't let them get the training?
Training? For-for what?
Slicing hemorrhoids and doing boob jobs?
Excuse me?
What he's trying to say is,
only a small percentage of your residents
are ever gonna need any trauma skills after they leave here.
Yes, right, whereas our kids... Residents.
...need to be able to handle whatever comes through that door.
They need the practice.
Well, I'm with you there.
Okay, you know what, no need to get cold.
That was, that was cold, wasn't it?
Yeah, that was a little cold.
Don't be such a sissy, Morris.
You know what?
I need, I need to kick out my meth mom in Four.
Dr. Kovac, please consider what I...
Why don't you two work this out, okay?
I'll be covering for Clemente today.
JERRY: Again?
And I have to stay off my feet as much as possible.
Hip still bothering you?
A little bit. Page me if it gets busy.
I'll be fine, Kerry.
Hi, Dr. Weaver. Abby.
I consented sickle crisis for the pain study and heme's on its way.
ALBRIGHT: We gotta log ER procedures for the ACGME.
So you've got to share, Red.
End of story.
We should have Weaver chat with her, one bitch to another.
ABBY: You know what?
I'm getting really sick of this.
Why does "female" plus "tough"
have to equal "bitch" around here?
You know what, Abby? I don't need you to defend me.
Thank you very much. I don't mind that
guys think I'm a bitch. I kind of like it.
At least they respect me.
Oh. So, if they don't think I'm a bitch,
does that mean they don't respect me?
I got a hot appy waiting to be seen.
Bitch. Exactly.
Morris.
Morning, folks.
So, what price did you pull?
Excuse me?
Last night at the auction?
We did a pool.
I had you at 320.
Ah, once again, y'all underestimate me big, man.
I went high. 600 bucks.
Whoo! Hey.
That's right.
There were a lot of lovely ladies
willing to part with their cash
for a date with the doctor.
Nice!
Only problem is that the winning bidder was a dude.
A what?
I'm having dinner with a guy.
Is he cute?
( men laughing )
He didn't stick around long enough for me to meet him, Ray.
Well, it's, it's for charity.
Look at the bright side:
Maybe he'll buy dinner.
RAY: As long as he doesn't assume that means anything.
Yeah. No means no, Greg, okay?
( laughter )
It's really impressive how you guys
can leap from misogyny to homophobia in a single bound.
Hey, you're the one who just called Albright a bitch.
Oh, yeah, after you did, and that's not the point anyway.
The point is, why is everybody so... bigoted around here?
No more overnights for Abby.
Yeah, Kovac, your woman's starting to sound a little kooky.
Oh, Morris, I swear to God
if you ever, ever refer to me as someone's woman ever again,
I will slap you silly with this hole-punch!
Don't you mean "bitch-slap"?
KOVAC: Hey, let's walk. I'm not kidding.
I'm really not kidding.
It's alright. They get it. They get it.
You okay?
Yeah.
No.
Coburn's office is calling with the amnio results today.
When is that?
Um... as soon as they open, I think.
Why don't you relax for a while,
and we can do the call together, huh?
DUMAR: Dexter Jenkins, 62,
blunt trauma to the face, chest and abdomen.
Try not to hit Morris with any desk tools.
Ray!
I'm not promising you anything.
So what happened?
Just some dumb kids. They don't know nothing.
They beat him up right out in the open.
Witnesses called 911.
What, at 8:00 in the morning?
It's the breakfast special.
( grunting )
Sat's 99.
What do kids want with a can opener anyway?
Still got their moms cooking for them.
Distal pulses... two plus.
Your what?
EZ squeeze. Heavy duty, ergonomic handle.
Hard to come by.
What's your plan?
CBC, trauma panel, type and screen.
Some kind of stupid dare.
Okay, and head CT scan.
He seems a little confused.
I'm not confused.
What's the date today?
February 9, and I want my can opener back.
( laughing hysterically )
( screams and continues laughing )
You gotta have a sip of this.
And this. Chocolate milk?
What are you, 12?
Yes, I am 12.
Oh, yeah?
Mmm...
Yeah. Oh!
( laughing )
Oh, we gotta have some of these, too.
I didn't see that.
Yeah, okay, okay, okay, okay.
Make some s'mores, you know.
I'm sorry, man. I'm sorry!
Oh, dude, my-my bad. ( giggling )
I'll take care of it.
Hi.
( laughing )
Maybe we should wait till the end of the shift,
because if it is bad news...
It's not... It's not bad news.
The chances of having an abnormal amnio are what,
one in a thousand?
Two hundred.
Still pretty good odds.
We'll be fine.
Hi. This is, uh, Abby Lockhart.
I think you have my amnio results.
( whispers ): She's checking.
Hi.
That's great.
That's great.
That's great.
That's great. Thank you.
( moaning )
( moaning increases )
( laughing )
Get down!
Come here. You're gonna kill me.
Come on. Come on.
Oh, God, I've got to get you a Velcro belt.
MAN: Nice.
( gasps )
You kiss your husband with that mouth?
Oh, God, Bobby!
Oh, my God.
Did you really think it'd be so easy?
Make yourself at home, man.
I asked you a question.
Yeah, well, it sounded kind of rhetorical, you prick.
I wasn't talking to you, my love.
I was talking to Vic.
Yeah.
You know, Bobby,
Bobby, I know we got a lot to discuss, you know,
but, you know, breaking into my place
is not going to get it done, okay?
'Cause we're adults here.
Anyway, how in the hell did you get in here anyhow?
I've got lots of experience
getting into dumps like this, Vic. Oh, yeah?
'Cause you see, I spend every day
staying three moves ahead of scumbags like you.
Scumbags...
Bobby, you got to get the hell out of here.
Okay, this, all of this, over, okay?
Button up, get your stuff, and let's go.
Jodie, get your stuff.
I'm not going to go anywhere with you.
Okay, listen, you and your wetback boyfriend...
Alright, alright, alright, you know what, Bobby?
You always take things too far, right?
So now you got to go.
The smart thing for you, Chimichanga, is stay out of this.
Yeah, well, I'm in it now. Jodie.
I filed papers.
You what?
I called my lawyer, and I... I want a divorce.
A divorce?
Yeah, imagine that.
Come on, baby.
I flew all the way from Jersey to fix this.
Okay?
I know I screwed up.
I'm so... Don't.
I'm so sorry.
It's too late now.
So, I don't...
Too late?
You don't think I can just leave you here like this, do you?
I think...
What?
I think that you're going to have to.
Alright, Bobby, why don't you just call her later, man.
Probably she'll talk to you then.
Come on. Let's go.
Come on. Let's go.
Let's go.
( sighs )
All in all, it went well, didn't it?
Yeah.
( door opens )
Frank, do me a favor and call Central.
Order me a new scrub top.
I spilled betadine all over my shirt.
Scrub top?
You can't wear scrubs on your man-date.
Oh, no, no, you're misusing the term.
A man-date is two hetero guys hanging out for dinner and a movie.
See, this is a date-date.
Yeah, keep it up, Morris, and you're going to get smack-smacked.
Hey, I feel you, bro.
I dated this chick four times
before I realized she had an Adam's apple.
So, how's Carter doing?
Oh, you know what, same old, same old.
Saving the world, counting the money.
Tell you what, if I was rich,
I would be in Italy, not Africa.
It's for a good reason, Frank.
Yeah, you think there are no hungry kids on the Amalfi coast?
Pratt, can you write for morphine
for the infected branchial cyst?
Sure. Is she still here?
Yeah. No surgical beds.
Albright's boarding her until an OR opens up.
MORRIS: Give me that.
Excuse me, Doctor!
If the ER is going
to baby-sit your surgical patients
at least have the courtesy to write the damn orders.
As much as I enjoy your little rants,
I don't have time now.
I'm late for a sympathectomy.
Well, then you're going to be even later
because I'm forbidding my residents
to write orders on surgical boarders.
You can't do that. Oh, yes, I can. New policy.
Fine, have it your way.
Here. Your chief's a little penis.
Don't let her talk to you that way.
KOVAC: So what do you think?
LOCKHART: About what?
The baby's sex is right there on that amnio report.
Did you know that the X chromosome
carries three times as much genetic material
as the Y?
And you didn't ask?
Do you think that's why men are simpler?
Look, some nurse in Coburn's office
knows the sex of our baby
and we don't.
Isn't that weird?
It's a little weird.
So? So?
Coffee and apple juice, please.
Two coffees, please.
I don't know.
Just makes it... seem so real.
You're 16 weeks.
Amnio's normal, and it is real.
Is there anyone we have to tell?
Should probably tell your mother.
Oh, yeah.
I was thinking I'd hold off on that.
Till when?
Till we get...
( tires squealing )
( moaning )
I need help!
I need help! Somebody help me!
You're going to be fine, baby. You're going to be fine.
She must have lost about a liter in the car.
Why didn't you call an ambulance?
Trust me, it was faster this way.
Jodie, can you hear me?
Caught us completely off guard...
Carotid's weak. Sam, what's open?
Trauma one. What happened?
Entrance wound, left chest
lower right quadrant and flank.
Just out of nowhere.
I wasn't expecting it.
Expecting what? Expecting what?!
Just stop the questions, okay?
Let's get the re-suss going. Okay, Abby, take the head.
Sam, get her on the monitor.
Start working on access.
JODIE: Vic...
Where's Vic?
I'm right here.
He shot me.
BARNETT: And what is that?
Morse code for "get me the hell out of here"?
Nervous habit.
That looks like...
D... F... and B to me.
No, this is A and D minor.
You a musician?
I got this Yamaha mini-keyboard
I like to tap things out on once in a while.
Found it on some heap one time.
Couldn't imagine why anybody would want to throw that out.
Gone for good now.
Little bastards smashed it all up.
So what kind of music you into?
I stay with what I know mostly-- blues.
You any relations to a Brick Jenkins?
He was a bluesman back in the '60s.
My dad used to listen to his records over and over.
Played with Muddy Waters, BB King.
Even Big Bill Broonzy right before he died.
Nice to meet you.
Take care of stuff like this every day, Jodie.
Worse than this.
You think this is something? This is nothing.
Tell her, Abby, Abby, tell her...
Vic, you need to make room for us. Come on.
Liter of NS, six units of O-neg and call the OR.
I'm so sorry, baby.
What?
Who shot her, Vic?
Who shot her?
Her husband shot her.
Well, you think it was...?
When she said "he," she meant her maniac husband
who showed up with a gun, that's who she meant.
She didn't mean me.
Where, at your place?
Yeah.
You don't believe me, do you?
Sure, we believe you.
Okay, tachy at 138.
LOCKHART: Barely has a gag. She needs a tube.
Sats aren't coming up. She needs a tube.
KOVAC: Vic, why don't you sit down for a while. Hey.
7-5. Abby, use a 7-5.
She's tiny, but she's got a huge mouth. Small airway.
Okay, okay. I'll put it in. You want to put it in?
Systolic's only 72. Alright, 10 blade.
You're not working right now. Hey!
I heard what happened.
Good. Maybe you can explain it to us.
CLEMENTE: Where's the 10 blade?
Tell me where's the 10 blade?
I've got to do something.
I've got to do something.
If it wasn't for me, she wouldn't be in this kind of way.
PRATT: You alright? I'm good.
Hey, man, you're bleeding.
It's just a scratch.
Come on, man. Let's take a look.
No, no, no, I got to stay. She needs me, man. Come on, Vic.
PRATT: Come on. Get on the gurney now.
Sit down, sit down.
Listen... can you listen to me... I'm listening.
They think I did it, man.
Okay, alright.
Look at that. You've been shot.
That's impossible, man.
Good distal pulses.
Wound looks through and through. I didn't feel it.
Need the infuser. Yeah, go for it.
The bastard shot me, Sam.
He shot me, too.
Sam, you believe me now?
Sam, you believe?!
Suction and more cricoids.
Sat is 74. Can you see the cords?
Yeah, I can see the cords.
I just can't get the tube to go.
She's bradying down. 58.
Okay, pull out. Wait, hold on. I had it for a second.
Abby, why don't you just try a 7-0!
Kovac, how about more cricoid?
Somebody close the door, please.
Hey, remember I said to page me if anything came up?
Well, this would fall under that category.
We've got it under control... medically.
What do you got? LOCKHART: Tube.
Clemente's girlfriend Jody Kenyon--
multiple GSWs to chest, abdomen and flank.
And a hinky attending next door with a bullet in his arm.
LOCKHART: Okay, I'm in.
PVCs. Hang another unit of O-neg
and rush the blood bank. She needs type-specific fast.
What she needs is the OR.
Paged them ten minutes ago. Oh, that's great. We actually need Albright.
She's MIA.
Okay, page Dubenko. We can't wait.
You want to explain what happened to you in there?
I don't understand. I didn't cut a nerve.
True. But you didn't look for it either. You got lucky.
You were right there when I made the cut.
Don't get defensive. Don't make excuses.
911 page from the ER.
Can you hold it?
I, um... heard Gallant got called back by the Army again.
That's got to be hard.
Actually, he didn't. He re-upped.
Oh.
Well, he's certainly got a strong sense of duty.
LOCKHART: Introducer!
Damn it! Another 200cc's of blood on the floor.
Sixth unit of packed cells going up.
Cordis is almost ready.
Run of ten. Can't get a BP.
Come on, Jodie. Thoroseal and the autotransfuser.
What's going on?
About damn time.
Double GSW, we can't get a surgeon down here?
Hello. Nice to see you. We just got the page.
We've been calling your chief resident for 15 minutes.
Neela, go check out the other room. You know what?
Let's focus on the patients here.
We'll deal with that later.
Hi. Here for surgery.
Dr. Clemente?
How's she doing? How's Jodie doing?
They're having some trouble keeping up with her blood loss.
He's got a through-and-through GSW to his deltoid.
Neurovascularly okay, but he's going to need angio.
Hemodynamics?
Fine. No occult injuries?
No. You did a thorough
head-to-toe exam?
Yes, Doctor, we did.
Tell the blood bank
to send down another ten
of packed cells and two of FFP!
Need your portable defibrillator!
She's coding? Don't tell me she's coding!
It's just precautionary for the trip upstairs.
Oh, yeah? What are they doing for her?
What we do for any trauma patient:
fluids, access, blood and pressors.
Platelets and calcium. Platelets and calcium.
Myocardium loves calcium.
Dubenko, give her calcium!
Getting harder to bag.
You hear me? Okay, up the rate.
Do the best you can.
Best you can? Best you can, my ass!
Just let us take care of you now!
I'm not going to let her die.
She's not going to die!
Oh, yeah? You know you can't say that.
You know you can't.
Please, try to relax.
Look, I'm not perfect, and I've messed things up in the past,
but I know what to do with a shocky GSW.
And so does Dr. Kovac, I assure you.
Okay, squeeze in the blood. Call the OR.
Tell them we're on our way up.
I gotta go! She needs me!
Dr. Clemente!
I gotta go! She needs me in there!
Take it easy! Settle down! Settle down!
I gotta go! Calm down.
Settle down!
No!
You're restraining me?
We don't even use hard restraints anymore.
True.
But since you're spraying blood on my staff,
I'm willing to bend the rules.
What are we looking at, Neela?
Well, Neela?
Renal pedicle?
That's a question, not an answer.
I don't know.
It's the renal pedicle.
Dr. Albright. Decide to grace us with your presence?
Sorry. Got stuck in the ICU.
Metz.
What's our next move, Neela?
Find the bleeder?
Find the bleeder.
Before that?
Isolate the hilum.
Before that.
I don't know.
Intraoperative IVP.
That's correct.
50cc's of contrast. Get the portable X-ray tech down.
Hi. Remember me?
I'm busy, Morris.
Oh, you're busy. Okay. Alright.
Is this your writing here?
Sure looks that way.
Electrolytes, D-sticks and neurovascular status every 15 minutes
on a branchial cyst?
I was making a point.
So am I. My department doesn't have time
to carry out menial tasks
on patients who are only boarding with us.
Let's talk about this later. We're kind of busy here.
You're either scrubbing out to rewrite the orders
or coming down to do them yourself.
We've got a lady open on the table.
Morris, this really
isn't the best time.
Neela, I can't hear you.
You're... you're dead to me.
Lucien, please make it stop.
Oh. Oh, look at you, going to your attending
like a... like a little penis,
punk, sissy.
Jessica, would you please go take care of this?
It's getting very annoying.
This is a complex anastomosis.
Don't you think I should stay?
We'll be alright without you. Please go.
Please.
Alright, dissect the mesentery...
HALEH: I heard she tried to kill him,
and he grabbed the gun away from her.
Well, his wound is definitely self-inflicted.
He's a cagey little bastard.
You think he shot her and tried to cover it up?
Oldest trick in the book.
I heard they were having sex at the time.
Alright, come on, guys, guys.
We all have our own problems, right?
Right.
Yeah. Right.
Hey, I'll come get you when your boyfriend gets here.
Where's Clemente now?
I sent him up to angio.
In restraints?
We let him out once he shut up.
Alright, what do you think happened?
I think he's a complicated guy.
Hey, Ray!
Alright, look, let's try to keep the chatter to a minimum
until we find out what really went down.
Yeah, sure thing. Alright.
Hey, I picked this up in Trauma One.
Think it belongs to one of your patients.
Who, Jenkins?
Yeah, the old, uh, homeless guy got beat up by some kids?
Yeah, I got it. Okay.
Yeah.
What's this, Doctor?
Expanding hematoma, lacerated vessels.
( alarms beeping ) That's an ER answer.
I want a surgeon's answer. Which vessels?
Systolic's only 92.
DUBENKO: Neela, which vessels?
The renal artery splits into the... anterior...
DUBENKO: Stop vamping. We don't have time.
You either know it or you don't.
Extravasating contrast, left kidney's hit.
We're aware of that, Victor.
With a hilar injury like this, sacrificing
the kidney is probably the way to go.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa.
Is the hilum completely avulsed?
Because if it's not, you ought to, you to...
Please, please don't tell me what I ought or ought not do.
Yeah, well, she's a friend, okay?
Okay. You can watch from the OBS deck.
She's a good friend... OBS deck now!
One peep, and you're out.
( clattering )
So, think you can save the kidney?
She's young. We should try.
Mm-hmm. What's your plan?
I... don't know.
I've never done this before.
Look, it's just common sense.
If I weren't here, what would you do?
Uh, Lucien, I just want to point out that you are here,
and you are the attending.
Dr. Rasgotra?
Clamp the hilum for vascular exclusion.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, but if you clamp the hilum, you're gonna starve
the kidney of blood.
Please continue.
Find the bleeders and seal with fibrin,
repair the renal artery with an omental patch.
How much time do we have after we clamp the hilum
before the kidney starts to die?
About 45 minutes.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
That's not... It's not about 45 minutes.
That's 45 minutes tops.
That's tops.
Go for it.
She's all yours.
Lucien, you're not gonna seriously let an ER resident
go in there and clamp the hilum, are you?
You will stop talking now, or I'll come up there myself...
She's not even a surgeon! and personally remove you from the deck.
I'm working on that.
Oh, yeah. Now. You're gonna be working on that right now.
CLEMENTE: Look, Lucien, this isn't a teaching case.
I want you to do it, Lucien. I want you!
Stop playing around, man! Go ahead.
Her pressure's going to bottom out!
Hilum's... clamped.
Alright. 45 minutes.
Clock's ticking.
Change the orders.
This means war, you know.
Change the damn orders!
Nice work, Morris.
She's been driving us crazy all day.
Refuses to learn any of our names, calls us all "nurse."
She refuses to learn our names, too.
I think she's only interested
in learning the male residents' names.
I hate women like that.
Why are you still here?
Um, because my fridge at home is empty, and I was hungry.
You want a bite?
Didn't I see you eating one of those 20 minutes ago?
Mm-hmm. This is my third.
Third? Mm-hmm.
What are you, pregnant?
What?
What are you talking about?
Oh, my God, you are.
You're crazy. You are, aren't you?
No.
You are totally pregnant.
So what? You're in love with Albright.
No, I'm not.
Oh, Morris, come on. You shut up.
You shut up, too. You shut up first.
Shut up about what?
Nothing.
Nothing.
This came back on our GSW.
Want me to send it up to the OR?
No, I got it.
Hey, Ray, help Morris clear the board
while I run upstairs.
Alright. Help me? What is that?
I need help all of a sudden?
No, it's not really all of a sudden, nah.
I'm taking Mrs. Irby in to see her father.
Oh, okay.
You, uh... you need help with that?
No. Exactly. That's my point.
Your father's in here, ma'am.
Hmm.
You've been doing some snooping around, young blood.
Well, I thought your daughter should know.
Congratulations, princess.
It sounded like a nice ceremony.
We wanted you to be there.
Didn't want to show up
for your special day looking like this.
I would have paid for a suit.
I don't want that.
I don't want your money.
This doctor told me what happened today.
Stupid kids.
He needs to have his sutures removed in a week.
Come home till then, Daddy.
Nat and me--
we got a nice place over in Old Town.
You can have your own room.
That ain't me, Sarah.
Ain't never gonna be.
How's she doing?
Yeah, well, it's the 12th unit they've hung so far.
I looked for you in angio.
Yeah, well, you didn't miss much.
The bullet missed the brachial.
( sighs )
This came back on Jodie.
It's positive for cannabinoids and coke, Vic.
But you know... you know, this-this is irrelevant
to her treatment, okay?
I don't even know why you would send this in.
What are you, Big Brother?
Come on. Standard trauma labs, man.
You know that, and you might have mentioned it before.
Why? Why, would it have affected the resuscitation?
Would it have changed your management?
Come on. Let's be real.
Yeah, maybe you should also know that she's a Scorpio,
and she's allergic to clams.
Would that help?
So, this why you didn't want us evaluating you?
You were worried what we'd find if we sent in your urine.
You know... you know, you're a really good guy,
and I like you, but right now,
it's time for you to shut the hell up.
( sighs )
I just hope your story's good.
Yeah, what story?
The one about how you didn't do this.
Why, you think I did?
It doesn't matter what I think, Vic.
The only important thing is,
is there anyone who can back you up?
Yeah.
She's down there.
Hey.
Catch.
Cool.
Got it at the Boston game.
They killed us.
Yeah. That kind of year.
Haven't seen you around.
My mom said I was too distracting.
She wants to study hard.
Yeah, she said I was definitely going to college.
That's good advice.
Sounds boring.
Besides, I want to drive NASCAR.
I'll tell her you're here.
Thanks, Luka.
Hey, Chuny,
let's see if we can get a taxi voucher
for a Dexter Jenkins.
Already gone.
He left AMA.
They didn't even sign his discharge.
He did?
Yup. What do you want me to do with his chart?
Let's break it down, I guess.
Oh, Pratt, I forgot. Your date's out in chairs.
He is?
Been there about half an hour.
Oh, don't keep a young man waiting.
And allow me to say
that's the prettiest transvestite
I've ever laid eyes on.
Transvestite?
Where?
( chuckles )
MORRIS: Oh, that can't be him.
Had you guys going, didn't I?
Write the post-op orders
and page me for evening rounds.
How often should we check renal function?
BUN and creatinine BID.
There you go.
Just so you know, that wasn't cool.
What?
You deal with ER scut.
I scrub in on traumas. Got it?
You weren't answering any of your pages.
And that's cutesy shtick with Dubenko--
that isn't working either.
I'm the one who writes your evaluation.
I'm the one you've got to impress.
I'm not trying to impress anyone.
I'm just trying to get something out of this elective.
You get this: you ever crowd me out of the OR again,
there will be payback.
This is crazy. I...
Dr. Clemente.
Do you mind if I come in?
Yeah, sure.
Look, I want to thank you
for taking care of her.
We did our best.
Yeah. I know you did.
LUKA: Hey, Sam.
Hey. I'm just trying to get out of here.
Alex is at the triage desk.
Yeah.
We chatted a little.
Oh, good.
Uh, hey.
Uh, I just, I just wanted to talk to you about something.
Yeah.
Uh, about me and Abby.
Luka, I know about you and Abby.
Everybody knows.
And I really hope it works out.
Really. I want you to be happy.
There's, uh, there's a little more to it.
Abby and I, uh, we're, uh...
we're going to have a baby.
What?
A baby.
Wow.
I just, I just didn't want you to hear it somewhere else.
Uh, I-I appreciate that.
Uh, when is she due?
July.
Wow!
Congratulations.
Thanks.
Do you know where the Reglan is?
Because we're out of compazine
and Chuny's mad at me for not restocking.
But not that you would know where it is.
Doctors never know.
Uh, try, try the bottom shelf.
Right behind the...
Yes.
Right.
I'll, I'll see you tomorrow.
Yeah. Have a good one.
Yeah, you, too.
I remember now, Jodes. I remember.
It was Hamlet.
You know that part where he says
"Man is this and man is that.
Noble and intelligent, like the best thing on Earth."
But then he says, but then he says,
to his two buddies, he says,
"Yet what is this to me, this...
this quintessence of dust?"
Like he's, you know, lost.
WEAVER: I heard they were able to salvage the kidney.
Yeah, but with the loss of blood and the long anesthesia time,
you know how the brain is.
The police are here. They went to your place.
You know, the ICU attending wants, wants to keep her
intubated and sedated longer.
They found marijuana,
cocaine, some unprescribed medications.
You keep her O2 consumption down.
They think you did this, Vic.
Did they find the gun?
No.
Am I fired?
Not yet.
Okay, then, so why don't we start by you telling me
why in the world your friend Henry thinks
he has to buy you dates.
I had a bad breakup a few months back.
I think he got sick of listening
to my single girl woes.
( chuckles )
Plus he figured
I could use a change of pace.
You mean you never dated a doctor before?
Something like that.
Good night, Pratt.
Good night, Ray.
I figured you'd be long gone.
Good place to pick up some change.
I'm not going to try to talk you into anything
your daughter could.
She's upset. She'll be alright.
She figures this is how it's going to be.
Every few years she'll get a call
from a hospital or a cop,
get a quick hi-bye from her old man.
So when the last call comes in,
it's the morgue.
Let me get you a sandwich, at least.
Another couple hours, I can buy my own.
Come on, man.
So, how does a young fellow like you
know about Big Bill Broonzy?
I'm kind of a buff.
LPs, CDs, I got a big collection of everything.
I used to be in a band.
So what can I get for you?
BLT and a Coke.
Alright.
( playing bluesy song )
* Many rivers to cross
* But I can't seem to find my way over *
* Wandering, I'm lost
* As I travel along
* The white cliffs of Dover...
Hey, Maggie, it's me.
Uh, I have some good news, Mom.
* I been ripped, washed up for years *
* And I merely survive
( knocking )
* Because of my pride
* And this loneliness won't leave me alone *
* It's such a drag to be on your own *
* My woman left me, but she didn't say why *
* Guess I'll break right down and cry *
* Many rivers to cross
* But just where to begin, I'm playing for time *
* There've been times I found myself *
* Thinking I've committed some terrible crime *
* Yes, there's many rivers to cross *
* But I can't seem to find
* My way over.
