Previously on ER:
PRATT: I never wanted to be around this type
of suffering. I mean who would?
I'm glad I came here.
Glad you came, too. I've been evaluated
by the Impaired Physicians' Committee, and you know what?
I'm in the clear.
You better start showing me some respect.
Getting any sleep? Bobby, I'm not doing this.
What time you going home tonight?
I haven't been getting any sleep lately.
And the thing is that I've been really, really needing some.
BARNETT: I wish I didn't feel how I feel.
You're the best friend I've ever had.
Neela, I am a soldier, remember?
And you're also a husband, remember that?
( gunfire )
( gunfire )
( yelling )
One of the drivers got hit!
( gunfire stops )
Corporal Milton, can you hear me?!
Okay, you're gonna be okay!
I want you to hold pressure here.
I just called the CASH. They're sending a chopper.
That's not gonna work! ( gunfire )
How far are we from the aid station?!
Eagle is only about four kilometers due north!
Okay! Okay!
My count, we'll lift him up onto the truck!
I want you to keep pressure
on his neck.
Shouldn't we wait for the chopper?
He'll bleed out before they get here! Let's go!
One, two, three!
HODGKINS: I don't even think he's breathing.
Just keep holding pressure. You're doing good.
Pupils are fixed and dilated, sir.
We can stop.
Thanks for trying, sir.
He just got engaged.
You got a girl back home, Captain?
Me? Yeah.
I'm married.
My wife Neela is a doc...
( woman speaking Japanese )
( car alarm sounding )
( clattering )
( footsteps )
( creaking )
Mothers often eat their own young in the wild,
and we just think it's part of nature, right?
But when women kill their children,
it's a crime and we think they're crazy.
What?
Well, I mean, it just makes you wonder, right?
Are the lions crazy, too, or are women like Susan Smith
and Andrea Yates just acting upon some primitive impulse
that's deep within our genetic maternal makeup?
Am I interrupting something?
Just some girl talk.
MORALES: Dennis Young, 34, assault victim.
Blunt trauma to the head and face.
LOCKHART: He mugged?
No, it looked like a home invasion thing.
They tuned him up good.
KOVAC: What's your name, sir?
Uh...
MORALES: Airway's okay, decent vitals, moves all extremities.
Pupils are five millimeters and equal.
MORALES: There were two kids in the house with him.
17's bringing them in.
They got worked over, too.
One looks real bad.
Okay, Abby, Trauma One.
Head, facial and c-spine CT as soon as you can.
And send Sam out here to help, if you see her.
Okay.
BARNETT: Get out of here.
I swear. She invited me in for a drink.
Door wasn't even closed, she was tearing my clothes off.
Yeah, right. To quote my man Rick James, the girl is a super freak.
* Super freak, she's super freaky, yow! *
She had sex toys I've never even seen before.
They must have been German or something.
One took two hands to operate.
Morris... Check it out.
Oh, yeah. I tapped that.
What exactly am I looking at?
That's Albright.
Where? Right there.
I've seen more convincing photos of bigfoot.
But, but it was dark. I couldn't use the flash.
HOLLIS: Any chance he's gonna be able to talk to us?
I don't think so. Enlighten me, ladies.
Looks like we've got an open skull and facial fractures.
HOLLIS: We got nothing to go on. Nobody saw anything.
MORRIS: Glasgow Coma Scale?
LOCKHART: Spontaneous eye opening.
( groaning )
Hey, what's he trying to say?
He's altered. I don't think he knows
what he's saying. Withdraws from pain.
For a grand total of... 12.
And we incubate at...
GCS of nine. Excellent.
Any blood in the belly, Abby?
We were focusing on the primary survey.
If I wanted excuses, Morris, I'd ask you directly.
Give me the sonosite.
ALBRIGHT: Any idea why CT scan on your trampoline guy,
Margolis, never got to the OR?
I'll have a tech run them up.
Dubenko wants you to personally bring them up.
Hang a gram of vancomycin.
Is this about the oral contrast?
I have no idea.
You know, oral contrast
increases the risk of anesthesia.
If you want my professional opinion,
I'd find those CT results,
and haul my ass up there.
MORRIS: After we stabilize the patient.
No. Now.
LOCKHART: Neela, we got this, okay?
Belly's clear.
Call me after the scan, Moe.
And have Neurosurg and Head and Neck take a look.
Did she just call you Moe?
It's a nickname...
for Morris.
Or homo.
Hey, don't worry, okay?
That little vixen's getting punished tonight.
Oh, yeah.
She's in store for a little...
* Mo-Mo-Morris
* How do you like it, how do you like it *
* Oh, yeah, Morris...
Hey, stranger.
Welcome back, Dr. Pratt.
Thanks.
Glad to see you survived.
How was it?
Well, hot, sweaty, fly-infested, you know.
But it was a little overwhelming to be honest.
Save a lot of lives?
I tried.
PICKMAN: Three-year-old Eddie. Good pulses.
BP: 100/50.
Decided to stop breathing as we pulled in.
Can you open your eyes? Eddie?
PRATT: He's posturing. Little guy was awake
on the scene, but now this is all we can get out of him.
Okay, Sam, you're with me.
He's bradying down. Probable head bleed.
30 migs of mannitol.
Call CT and let's get neurosurg down here.
BARDELLI: This is Sean, ten years old, blunt trauma face and chest.
Tachy at 135. BP's good.
100% on room air. PRATT: How you doing, Sean?
I'm Dr. Pratt.
I want to stay with Eddie.
He's scared when I'm not with him.
We'll have you in the room right next to him.
Come on. Let's go.
Damn it. The IV blew.
Tube.
TAGGART: Who did this?
( Clemente groans )
Must have been the same guys who busted up the pops.
Looks like the work of meth heads.
What's this kid's story?
Three-year-old, hypertensive and bradycardic.
Looks like traumatic head injury.
Okay, I'm in. Bag him at a rate of 40.
Pupils dilated, left greater than right.
Step-offs? Hematomas?
Could be head trauma.
All right.
Retinal hemorrhage.
Definitely head trauma.
Call Neurosurg and get mannitol on board.
Already done that, Vic.
Pulse hanging in the 60s.
I still don't have a line.
Okay, throw me an IO needle.
You don't want to do that, trust me. Oh, yeah?
I do. Betadine.
The IO drill's the greatest, man.
Wait till you see this.
We don't have the pedes model.
Yeah, we do; we got it in last week.
I'm gonna show you
how to drive this baby.
( drill whirring )
Vic, let me do it.
No, I got it. Come on, man.
I got it. I got it. I got it. Hey, Vic!
Come on, okay. I got it.
Okay, I'll talk you through it.
Tibial tuberosity,
one-finger breadth medial, one-finger breadth medial.
That's what it is.
One-finger breadth medial-- listening to me?
TAGGART: He's seizing.
KOVAC: Two of Ativan.
I can't; I don't have access.
Hold on. Hold on.
CLEMENTE: There you go. That's it.
Okay, now you do.
Nice job. Get a head CT.
Okay, what's wrong with you?
Me? I'm trying to help you. That's all.
You don't listen to a word anybody says.
You're all over the place. Okay, I'm sorry. I was... I just
didn't get a lot of sleep last night, okay?
Seizing stopped.
150 of Dilantin and pack up for the scanner.
Outside.
What?
Now!
( scoffs )
What?
What are you on?
I'm not on anything.
I just told you, all I needed was a cup of coffee. That's all.
What? What? Do you want a drug test?
You want a drug test right here, right now? Go ahead.
Grab a cup, baby. Come on. Come on, baby.
Grab a cup. Okay, okay, look.
Why don't you take 20 minutes, and get yourself together? Huh?
What? Because I repeated an order, man?
Come on, please. What are you? My moms?
Luka! Frank, not now.
Look, you're an attending.
I need you to be on the ball.
Vic, I'm serious.
Yeah, I'm serious, too.
You're seriously starting to piss me off. Okay?
'Cause if you don't want to work with me,
that's fine, man. I don't need you.
Vic... Vic. FRANK: Dr. Kovac.
What, Frank?
These gentlemen are looking for Dr. Rasgotra.
One of them is a military casualty officer.
Sats are falling: 89.
BARNETT: Can't see the cords. There's too much blood.
We need a surgical airway. Crike tray.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow your roll.
Open up a central line kit. Abby, grab a MacGill.
We're gonna do a retrograde intubation.
I've never seen that work.
That's because you've never seen me do it, junior,
but today's your lucky day.
We're going to do a Seldinger technique.
We're gonna wire up through the cricothyroid.
I think it'd be faster just to crike him.
No, 'cause you're gonna get all kinds
of infection and bleeding,
not to mention subglottic stenosis
and a big, ugly-ass scar.
BARNETT: Sats down to 84.
You know, hypoxia's not so good for you, either.
Where's Neela?
She got called up to Surgery.
Okay, we'll aspirate air
and then, we'll pass the wire through.
There are soldiers looking for her,
and one of them is a chaplain.
You need to find her.
Yeah, I'm trying to page her.
Everything okay in here, Abby?
Yeah, I think so.
You know, we'd be doing a lot better
if you'd stop talking to the residents
when I'm trying to show them
how to save this guy's life. Listen, Vic...
Look, I'm all over this, Kovac. I'm serious.
Go find Neela, please.
Okay, Abby, look for the wire
in the oropharynx.
I can't see it.
You will. You will.
Just come on, you son of a bitch.
( sniffing )
Damn it!
Come on. Got it.
Hey, can you get this CT to Dr. Dubenko?
I think he wants to see you.
Yeah, well, I've just been paged back to the ER,
so if you can just make sure that he gets them... He was very specific
about speaking with you in person.
BARNETT: Sat is 78, bradying down to 60.
I still can't see your wire. Open up a crike tray.
No, no, we don't need no damn crike tray.
Vic! Stop staring at me.
Just focus on your patient.
Ray, give her more suction. It's got to be there.
Wait, wait, wait!
I got it, I got it, I got it. All right, keep going, come on.
Stop, stop, stop, stop!
It'll guide you right through the cords.
Okay, that's enough, Chuny. Thank you..
Hard to pass.
Wiggle it, mam√≠.
Side-to-side, wiggle it, wiggle it.
Okay, I think I'm in.
All right, wire out and bag him.
Call for a portable chest.
All right, we all good here?
Yeah, we're doing great. Abby?
Why you asking her?
I mean, I just told you we're doing good, right?
I'm going to go find Neela.
Can you believe this? Ridiculous, huh?
DUBENKO: What percentage of liver injuries
have stopped bleeding by the time
surgical exploration is performed?
About half? How about 86%?
It's okay. You have plenty of time to learn all that
in the next five years. What?
Well, it seems like all my complaining
has finally paid off.
We've been funded for an additional slot
in the surgical residency.
It's yours for the asking.
Are you serious?
Well, if you don't want it... No, I want it. I want it!
I'm sorry. It's the ER.
Ignore it. You're a surgeon.
We never answer on the first page.
I'm kidding. Go!
Come find me after your shift.
We'll grab beer at Ike's to celebrate.
Yeah, that would be great,
but the drinks are on me.
WOMAN: So...
I guess congratulations are in order.
Uh, yes, thank you. Dr. Dubenko just told me.
I'm so excited. I can't wait to get started.
Yeah, it's going to be fun.
I'm really looking forward to being your attending.
Right. Wonderful.
Neela, uh, Luka's looking for you.
Yeah, I got his page.
Hey, guess what? I got surgical residency.
Wow, that's great.
Uh, you should really try to find Luka.
Yeah, I will. Neela, hold up.
I need to talk to you. I got it.
What? Surgical residency.
That's good for you. That's really great.
Well, try to contain your enthusiasm.
Listen, I need to tell you something.
Yeah, Luka's paging me.
I know, because it's important.
Well, so is my news, but nobody seems to care.
Neela, listen... It's not like I'm leaving the hospital or anything.
I'm going into surgery.
You'd think you people would like having me up there.
Abby, have you seen Luka?
There are two men here to see you... from the Army.
The Army?
BARNETT: We, um, tried to find you.
Dr. Rasgotra?
Yes.
I'm Captain Evans. This is Father Marris.
Is there someplace more private we can talk?
Can you tell me why you're here, please?
I really think it would be better...
Tell me.
Ma'am, the Secretary of the Army
would like to express his deepest regret...
Wait. There must be some mistake. that your husband,
Captain Michael Gallant, was killed in action
No, I'm sorry. You've got it mixed up. in Iraq on April 29th.
Michael is a doctor. He's not a soldier soldier.
He was killed when his truck was hit by a roadside bomb.
Again, the Secretary extends his deepest sympathies...
I'm sorry.
I'm working. I can't do this right now.
Please tell Dr. Rasgotra
that we're here to help in any way possible.
Um, have his parents been notified?
No, but that's something we can do if she would like.
What about Michael's, uh, her husband's remains?
It will take seven to ten days
for the deceased to get here from Iraq.
Arrangements will be made to fly him here to Chicago
or wherever she decides.
Okay, I'll pass that on.
All the pertinent information is in the packet.
If she has any questions,
she can also contact myself or Father Marris.
Okay, thank you. Thank you.
Hey, was it friendly fire?
Sir?
I mean, how do we really know what happened over there, huh?
I mean, doesn't this whole war smell to you
a little bit of, uh, right-wing cronyism,
with the oil and the multi-billion-dollar
rebuilding contracts? Huh? Hey, Vic...
You know what the real psychological warfare is,
my friend? Vic...
You coming in here, feeding us a bunch of lies
to placate the masses, okay? Vic, shut up!
Tell me about the deficit,
tell me about why do we have to go over there
and kill everybody for democracy! Vic, Vic.
Is that what we're doing? I need help with Mr. Engle's blood gas.
Vic. Excuse me, come on.
LOCKHART: Sorry.
BARNETT: I'm gonna go find Neela, make sure she goes home.
Okay, he's doing better, so why don't we
lower the FI02 to 70 and...
grab, uh...
grab an ABG in 20, okay?
You want me to look at your nose?
No, I'm fine. I'm fine. Thank you.
Look, I just want to say I'm sorry, okay?
I'm sorry about what happened over there,
but those guys coming in here like storm troopers,
and just...
( coughs )
It's like I'm a stigmata.
Why don't you go crash in the lounge.
I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm really fine.
You know there's no rest for the wicked.
You, Abby, should know that.
That intubation was cool, though, wasn't it?
Got to put that in your bag of tricks, I'm telling you.
( clears throat )
( sniffles )
Look, I got to take care of this.
( clearing throat )
( sighs )
Hey.
Hey.
Did you find Neela?
Ray's looking for her.
You know, I came here today
thinking about how nice it is to be back, you know?
Figured I'd come back and save a few lives,
maybe even bring somebody back from the dead, you know?
I damn sure didn't expect to lose a friend.
Yo, doc.
Ten-year-old won't say anything,
and we got nothing.
Did you find mom?
Yeah, she's been in rehab since November.
Dad's out of it, and baby's in a coma.
This kid's all we got.
Can you try talking to him?
Yeah.
How are we doing in here?
Oh, kind of quiet.
Hey, man, you want to see something really, really, cool?
It's your skeleton.
And, uh...
If you look right here,
this is where you broke your collarbone.
Uh, looks like old rib fractures.
Do you remember hurting your ribs?
No?
All right, look, I know you're worried about your dad
and your little brother,
but we got the best doctors helping them out.
So now, we need you to help them, too,
by telling us what happened.
You do want to help Eddie, right?
Yeah?
Then you need to talk to me.
Eddie wanted to play with my Bionicle guy,
and I took it away from him.
And he started crying, and he wouldn't stop,
s-so my dad started shaking him.
Did your dad hit you?
He punched me, then threw me into a chair.
And what about your brother?
Eddie kept crying...
and he kept shaking him...
telling him to shut up, using the "F" word.
And then he grabbed Eddie's head and slammed it against the wall.
Eddie was crying so hard that he couldn't breathe.
So I got my baseball bat and hit him.
You hit your dad?
I wanted him to leave Eddie alone.
How many times did you hit him?
Until he stopped.
I was just talking to him four days ago.
He was complaining about the food,
and I was complaining about how cold Abby's apartment is.
I honestly don't even remember
what else we were talking about.
I'm so sorry, Neela, I...
We all are.
You know, I was probably ordering a latte
or watching Celebrity Pokerwhen he was being blown up by a bomb.
Just like that, he's gone.
Listen, if you need anything, um...
or you want me to do anything...
No, Ray, I don't.
I don't need you to do anything.
I just... I need to go back to work.
No, no, Neela, look.
You need to go home and take care of things.
You need to take care of yourself.
( sobbing ): You know what? I don't have a home.
I don't have a husband.
I don't have anything.
All I have is this stupid hospital.
Just... just stay the hell away from me.
You hiding?
Is it that obvious?
I can't believe Michael's dead.
You want to go home? I'll cover for you.
No. What about Neela?
Well, we can take care of things.
Who, you and Clemente?
Weaver knew he had problems before she hired him.
Now we're paying for it.
Well, Luka, it's your ER.
Let's go away someplace.
Where it's warm and where nobody knows who we are.
Like a vacation?
No, not like a vacation, a vacation, a real one.
I mean, even if it's just for a couple of days
before the baby's born.
Can hang out by a pool... or the ocean.
And I can dig a hole in the sand for your big belly.
What is that, some sort of Croatian mating ritual?
Mm-hmm.
What am I, a sea turtle?
Neela.
Neela, hey.
Hey, why don't you let me take you home?
I have patients to pass on.
We can take care of that, Neela.
You need to go home.
Why is everyone so damn insistent that I go home?
I have things to do.
I haven't even told Michael's parents yet.
Well, the guys from the army said
they could take care of that.
No. I have to do it.
Well, don't you think
it would be better to do it from my apartment?
Get some privacy?
You know what, doubtless they're both at work
and I want to tell them at the same time
when they're together tonight.
Neela, go home. Please.
Abby, Dennis Young's crashing again.
All right, I'll check in on you later, okay?
Hey, Neela, I just want to... Don't.
Um, the men from the army left a package for you.
Frank has it at the desk.
Neela?
You know what?
If it makes everyone else happy, I'll go home.
What's going on?
CLEMENTE: He's bradying down.
Push the damn atropine.
Hey, Abby, you sure he didn't have an epidural?
Nope, just diffuse brain edema.
All right, 100 grams of mannitol.
We gave him mannitol.
Bilaterally blown pupils.
Right. Check the ET tube. Maybe it came out.
LOCKHART: No, it's fine.
TAGGART: GCS 3.
His brain stem is failing,
there's not... a whole lot we could do about that.
Heart rate's down to 30.
I lost the pulse.
It's PEA.
An amp of epi.
Two angiocaths.
Maybe it's a tension pneumo.
LOCKHART: He's satting on 100%.
Did he get dilantin?
15 per kilo.
All right, champ, start compressions.
( moves stool )
( clears throat )
Okay, Sam, you call
those compressions? Come on.
New AHA guidelines.
December issue, Circulation.
100 per minute,
deeper and faster.
That's how you're going to save a life, okay?
Okay, I need to perfuse his brain,
and I need hypertonic saline at 23.4%.
Well, we don't have that.
We don't have that?
We don't have that? Hypertonic saline
reduces ICP
when mannitol fails.
That paper last fall in the, uh... Lancet...
or was it the New England Journal?
It was Neurosurgery. That's right.
The author was, uh...
Weston or Williams or something.
It was a "W." It was...
Wares! That's it. That's it.
Wares. Neurosurgery,
2004, October.
Hold compressions.
( flatline alarm beeping )
Asystole.
Okay, let's just call it, Vic.
Call it?
Lockhart, I never figured you for a quitter.
All right.
He needs Burr holes. We got to reduce the ICP.
He has an open skull fracture.
Burr holes are not going to help.
Vic!
( sighs )
Okay, all right.
He should have had ICP monitor,
and everybody knows it.
He should have had a damn ICP monitor.
Time of death, 14:20.
Come on. We can do better than this.
( metal crashing ) We got to do a lot better than this!
A lot better than that.
Vic, I need to talk to you.
Yeah, and I need a cup of coffee,
and not the crap they serve here in...
or the effluence they try to pass at the Roach Coach.
I need a real cup of coffee. Vic? Hey.
Listen... You ever been to this Italian place,
Marrinaccio's, on Randolph?
Oh, my God, the best coffee this side of Milan.
They make their own biscottis.
Man, you walk through that door, smells...
You know, I'm going to treat everybody. Everybody.
I'm going to treat everybody to espresso and biscotti, okay?
Luka?
48-year-old complaining of chest pain.
Uh... Exam Three.
Is he on any medication?
Lipitor and aspirin.
Should I go get Clemente?
No, uh... let him go.
Just pick me up as soon as he comes back.
First day labs, 12 lead, lopressor and nitro.
Sir, don't worry. We'll take good care of you.
PRATT: How many home visits did DCFS make?
JANE: One, following... One!
Following an accidental scalding
I'll be right in. several years ago.
So I guess his little brother accidentally
got his head slammed up against a wall
today, huh? Hey. What's going on?
I got a kid with a busted collarbone.
He's got signs of old rib and humerus fractures.
And he's the lucky one!
His little brother's in the room next to him in a coma.
Did you call Social Services?
Uh, yeah, they're coming.
We got CTs, MRIs,
PET Scans, Dopplers, 4-D ultrasounds...
but we still can't save one kid from getting
his brains beaten out.
That's right. He had to kill his old man
because there was nobody else there to help him.
I guess that would be too much to ask, wouldn't it?
I mean... because it's much better to have...
We spend, what is it now?
$6 billion a month in a war all the way across the world?
To kill off a few more of the other kids
who actually get to make it to their teens?
Did you tell the police?
So they could arrest him?
Yeah, because that's one thing
we do well in this country, isn't it?
We got prison down to a science.
Prison and war.
He and Dr. Gallant were, um... friends.
God, this coffee's good.
Man, the Italians know what the hell they're doing.
The French... French press, anyhow, what the hell is that?
Forget about it.
But I know.
Oh, yeah?
You a killer.
No, no, I'm not a killer.
Jerry Lee Lewis is a killer,
and you're the mayor of Munchkin City, pal, okay?
You kill them in the hospital.
You got blood on you.
Ah, damn, my nice new shirt.
Right through the trauma gown.
Ah, man! I know what you do.
You cut them up into little pieces... Okay, pal.
You got to step off, okay? and feed the surgical waste to the dogs!
Just step off, please. You've got to stop the slaughter.
You know how I got this? You know how I got this?
Saving someone's life, okay?
'Cause that's what I do: I save pieces of crap like you, okay?
You crazy...
( tires screeching )
Hey, watch where you're going, man!
Hey, what are you doing, man?!
I'm walking here!
You trying to...
Watch where you going, man!
Hey! Watch where the hell you going!
I'm a pedestrian. I have the right of way!
You're not even looking!
Listen, hey, you want me to kick your ass? Huh?
Oh, now you're gonna kick my ass? Yeah.
Now you're gonna get violent on me, right? Yeah.
You're gonna kick my ass. Come on, come on, come on.
Kick my ass. Kick my ass up here, huh?!
Hey! Try and kick my ass up here!
Hey! What the hell you doing?!
You gonna go violent on me, go ahead! Get off there!
What are you doing?! Hey, come on! Hey!
Hey! Hey! Hey! What, are you psycho?!
Psycho?! Yeah, psycho!
Psycho-- you don't know about psychosis!
Man, I'm the freaking doctor!
I'll show you psychosis?
Oh! Oh!
Oh! Oh, God...
That's psychosis, okay!
Hey, come on! What? Are you on drugs?!
Yeah, I'm high.
I'm wasted. I'm flipping...
You know, you want to dip my urine?
Is that what you want to do?
You want to dip my urine? Go ahead.
Go ahead. Oh!
Oh!
Ah! Yeah, watch out, huh?
I'm gonna get you all over the place.
Hi, Neela, it's Abby, um...
Uh, I was thinking about stopping by tonight
on my way to Luka's, and we're going to get some takeout.
So if there's anything special you want to eat,
or if you need anything, just give me a call.
You talked to her? Tried.
I think she just wants to be alone.
She's going to have a lot of time alone.
It's probably best if she was around people right now.
Yeah, well, like I said,
I tried, didn't seem to work.
Whoa. Abby.
Vic? Sam. Sam.
I got jumped. I got jumped.
I was going for a cup of coffee and they ambushed me.
41-year-old male, altered mental status...
I'm not altered. You're altered, okay?
There's just no connection with you.
No... on a human level.
Look, he was wandering around in traffic--
combative, uncooperative.
You know why I'm uncooperative?
Because you're tying me down.
That's why, man.
What is this, fascist Germany? 1984?
What are we living in? TAGGART: Take it easy, Vic.
Why is he in handcuffs?
He assaulted several motorists.
You know what it is? It's xenophobia. That's what it is.
They keep us living in fear. That's how they do it.
What about Trauma One? Full.
It's not a H5 in One.
Exam Two? Take him to Exam Two, yeah.
Pulse ox 99 on two liters.
Pulse ox 99? Ha!
I'm room air, you mouth breather.
Abby, get them away from me.
He doesn't know what the hell he's doing.
Dextrostick 102.
Sam. Sam, tell them I'm an attending.
Tell them what a colossal mistake they've made.
Yeah, listen, looks like you cut your leg, Vic.
Yeah, I did, but it's superficial.
I can feel the platelets are already going
to take care of it.
I feel them. I gonna fix that with a get well sticker.
Well, let's check it out anyway.
Yeah, come on. It'll only take a minute.
All right, all right, okay, okay.
I get it. It's-It's funny, guys.
The joke's on me. I get it.
Everybody's laughing? Okay, now get it off of me.
Okay? Come on. Get it off me.
Take it off me! Take it off me!
LOCKHART: Five of Haldol, IV push.
Five of Haldol, IV push. Hey, hey, hey!
Get it off me! Where's...?
( panting )
Abby, you can't give me Haldol.
You can't give me Haldol, Abby.
I'm not crazy, you understand?
It's okay. It's okay.
X-ray, come here, buddy. Come here.
Come here, buddy. Come here, buddy.
These freakin' chicks are losing their mind, man.
Come over here. Help me, man. Get Luka.
What are you gonna do, amputate my leg?! Take it easy, Vic.
Hey! Oh, that's it. That's it.
Run to Daddy, you little bitch, run to Daddy,
little bitch.
Sam, don't you dare. Don't you dare, Sam.
Sam, don't you dare. Just try and relax, okay?
Settle down, Doc. Settle down.
See, he said it. He said I'm a doc...
You heard him. I'm a doc.
I'm a... I'm a freaking doctor, not a freakin' patient.
Abby? Abby, I'm your attending.
You hear me? I'm your attending.
Do no harm, Abby. Do no harm, Abby!
I know, I know.
I'm an attending at...
( panting )
Hi.
I thought it would be okay.
Do you mind?
Oh, sure.
Sean, you want some more Jell-O?
Can I?
Yeah, we got tubs of it downstairs.
I'll be back in a few minutes.
Eddie's gonna be hungry when he wakes up.
( sighs )
You know, since your mom's away, you're going to have to go stay
with a foster family, probably until she gets back.
The Fosters?
No, their name's not Foster.
That's what they do. They take care of kids.
Eddie, too?
No. Eddie's going
to have to stay in the hospital.
'Cause he's still sick?
He's showing signs of improvement, though.
And, um, we're gonna have him
in a very special part of the hospital
that's just for kids.
And you can visit him there.
What about my dad?
His injuries were very... very severe,
and, um...
the doctors-- they couldn't fix him.
He's dead?
Yeah, I'm afraid so.
But I didn't mean to kill him.
I know that.
But I'm gonna go to hell.
What?
For killing him.
God sends you to hell if you kill someone.
Sean, I think that
God makes exceptions
if you were trying to save someone else.
Really?
Really.
How is he?
He's settled down.
Okay, uh, I'm going to get out of here.
I'm gonna go to my place, check on Neela.
Okay, call me. Let me know how she's doing.
Oh.
What's the deal with Clemente?
Have to hear what psych says.
Too bad. I was starting to like the little guy.
Clemente's labs. Tox screen's negative.
Not so sure that's a good thing.
Okay, come on, guys.
Let's just give Vic some privacy.
We still got a board to clear.
Back to work, everybody.
Do you need me to sign off on anything?
No.
Everything okay with you?
Yeah. Why?
Well, sometimes it can be a difficult transition
coming back to this place.
No. I'll be okay.
I was just a little rattled earlier,
'cause of the whole Mike situation.
Well, good to have you back.
Hey.
Thanks for making me go there.
Some day maybe you can tell me all about it.
Yeah, some day.
Neela?
Hi.
Hey.
( sniffles )
I brought you some dinner, some groceries.
Thanks.
Did you call Michael's family?
Hey, how about I stay here tonight?
Um, I think I'd like to be alone.
Really?
I could use a break from Luka's snoring.
Michael used to snore when he was drunk.
You know, I had to come home and find a photograph,
because I couldn't picture him in my head.
You know, one day I'm not even going to be able
to remember what he looks like.
That's not true.
I'm-I'm gonna be fine.
Okay.
( quietly ): I'm sorry.
I'm putting him on a 72-hour.
What are you calling him?
Gravely disabled.
He's blaming it on insomnia.
Tox screen was clean.
Well, there's no history of schizophrenia
or bipolar disorder,
but he's had prolonged sleep deprivation,
and was recently the victim of a violent crime,
so there's probably some PTSD going on, too.
But we'll know better in a couple days.
Yeah. Thanks.
Yeah.
( sighs )
Hey, Vic.
What a day you had, huh?
Yeah.
How are you feeling?
I'm pretty good...
considering.
Just feel like such an ass
for flipping out in front of the kids and everything.
I'm a passionate man.
That's what makes me a good doctor, right?
Right.
You just can't keep up my pace
without spinning off the road at some point.
I'm just sorry that it had to happen on your watch.
That's okay. That's okay.
The important thing is that you get some rest now.
Yeah, yeah.
I want to get some rest.
Oh, yeah.
I'm going to get some serious R&R.
Catch up on my sleep, and maybe do a...
Let me, uh...
Let me take you up... upstairs, okay?
All right, sure.
Okay?
Yeah.
Personal escort treatment-- I like that.
I appreciate it, Luka. I really do.
You helping me like this, and, uh...
Don't be afraid to come up anytime to see me.
Especially if you need to run something past somebody, or...
I can still make a diagnosis on the tough ones, you know?
Take care of yourself, okay, Vic?
Yeah. Be cool, man.
Yeah.
Get back to work.
Hey, it's, uh, it's me.
I'm, uh, getting the camera ready.
Neela, te quiero.
Get out of here, you freak.
MAN ( laughing ): I love you, Neela.
Get out of here. Get out of here.
You see what I got to deal with?
You see that?
( clears throat )
So,
hopefully, you're never going to see this thing.
But if you are, well, then, um,
you know, something went wrong.
Maybe not wrong, but certainly not according to plans.
I love you, Neela.
Marrying you was...
the happiest day of my life.
You make me strong.
( sniffles )
Now, I know you didn't want me to come back to Iraq,
and I guess if you're watching this,
you owe me a big "I told you so," but, uh...
but I did what I had to do.
You're the most beautiful and kind person that I know.
I just... I just want you to be happy.
And, um, just know that I'll always be with you.
I want you to find somebody, get married, have babies.
Of course, he won't be as fine as me, but...
( laughs )
you know, I guess you'll just have to live with that.
I love you, Neela.
Forever.
