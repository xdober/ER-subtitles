Previously on ER:
Anything for my roomie.
WOMAN: Congratulations.
Thank you. It was supposed to be a secret.
Everybody was saying you were getting puffy.
I had to defend you.
It's a part-time job, flexible hours, good pay.
You and Alex, you're more than welcome
to come live with me.
Move in.
You need to undergo an evaluation
by the Impaired Physician Committee.
You're serious?
Yeah, well, I don't need that, okay? I do.
Oh! Don't shoot.
Sorry.
Did I wake you?
I couldn't find my laser pointer.
I had to root around a bit.
Yes, I ate all your cereal at 4:00 a.m.
and no, there's no milk left, either.
I'm a terrible roommate.
It'll be fine. You know, I've known
about this trauma conference for two months,
so the fact that I'm this unprepared two hours before
is quite unsettling.
Well, you don't want to over-rehearse your talk.
You should just wing it,
keep it fresh. Wing it?
It's not open mic night, you know.
Oh! Oh, crap!
You know, I blame this on you. Me?
If you hadn't made me watch every horror film
from the 1970s, I might have actually
gotten some work done this week. Hey.
Not every horror film, just the devil ones.
You're a bad influence.
Oh, thank you.
Hey, come here, you got a little on your...
( sighs )
You know, I haven't pulled an all-nighter since...
Ever. I have never pulled an all-nighter.
It's good for a person now and then.
Not for me. I'm used to being in control of these situations.
What situations?
I'm usually so organized.
Dubenko's going to kill me
if I'm late.
Well, um...
don't worry about the cereal.
( door closes )
It's not about God. It's about tradition.
Religious tradition.
What's wrong with that?
Nothing, if you're religious, but I'm not religious.
( sighs )
Okay, you ever been to a baptism?
Yes, I have.
I thought it was weird.
Weird? Yes.
The ritualized spiritual purification of a baby
kind of freaks me out.
You thought that was bad, you should see a bris.
Hey, Rodney. Hey, you and you.
I heard the good news. Congratulations.
Thank you. Two coffees, please.
You want decaf, right?
No, regular, black.
Look, I was baptized, so were my brothers,
my cousins, my parents.
Baptism is what we do in Croatia.
But it's an initiation into a club
I don't want to belong to.
It would mean a lot to my father.
Thank you. Thanks.
Do you know there's absolutely no evidence
that a moderate amount of caffeine is harmful to the baby?
The American Academy of Obstetrics...
Please, stop changing the subject.
...people feel the need to curtail my caffeine intake.
Why is that? It's a little water,
a little prayer, and a chance
to make a lot of other people happy. I don't know.
There's something so... What?
...so Rosemary's Baby about it.
Victor Clemente.
All these people here for drug testing, too?
Oh, yeah, you can't tell me that.
Of course, you can't tell me that.
Midstream, in the cup.
All right, thanks.
Sample collection has to be witnessed.
Come on, I'm not trying to pull anything fancy.
Sample collection has to be witnessed.
What are we, in fascist Germany?
All right, fine. ( zipper whizzing )
Witness this.
It's okay, honey. You know you want to look.
I have a budget committee meeting until 9:30.
Page me if you get a trauma.
Carter called?
Yeah, you were in with an epistaxis,
whatever the hell that is.
I didn't want to bother you.
It's a nosebleed, Frank. You could have pulled me out.
He said he'd call back, it didn't seem that important.
If you're not sure, transfer calls back to the room.
I'll decide what's important.
Oh, hey, Luka. Huh?
Sign Kerry's card for me.
How is she doing?
Good. A little stir-crazy, but she's starting rehab soon.
I'm sending her flowers from her department.
Nice.
Hey, I need someone to parlez-vous a little Espa√±ol.
Inez is off, Marquez isn't in yet,
and goiter girl has been waiting an hour
for a Spanish translator.
Get Clemente. He's back?
Yep, should be.
If he's not here in ten minutes, call me.
Hey, I heard they sent Clemente to Atlanta for diversion.
Let's hope. He's on house arrest.
And they're letting him come to work?
Some kind of special arrangement.
Well, it's his first day, he's already late.
Yeah, ten bucks says he doesn't show.
Okay, pirate guy with testicular pain, Ray,
Abby, you get fever-rash,
I will take dog bite to earlobe.
Wait. Switch that.
No, you take dog bite, I'll take the rash.
It could be rubella.
We wouldn't want to risk our baby
getting a torch infection. What?
Torch infection: herpes, tox.
I know what a torch infection is.
Then you know it wouldn't be good for our baby.
Why do you keep calling it "our baby?"
I don't mean our baby like you and me.
I mean like our baby, right?
Like an ER mascot.
This baby isn't anyone's mascot.
Good morning.
Bagels, anybody?
Hey. Dr. Clemente.
MAN: Anybody?
Come on, Morris. Let's clean the board.
Hello!
I think I've just committed suicide.
A little stick here.
A gun's certainly the most reliable method,
but it's kind of against my politics.
Overdose just seemed like the way to go.
Slow, tidy, not a lot of fuss.
I suppose I have to be placed on three-day hold now.
I don't get it.
If you're trying to die, why come in at all?
Who wants to die alone?
All right, Mr. Sadler, we're going to get you
an acetaminophen antidote
and then call a psychiatrist to talk to you, okay?
That sounds great.
( clears throat )
Yikes. No kidding.
That's some real pathology there.
He's so calm it's scary.
More like sociopathic. ( chuckles )
You guys got one to present?
We're good, Mucomyst, charcoal, waiting on a tox.
I'll page Psych.
All right.
BARDELLI: 21-year-old, discovered down in the dorm near UIC.
Multiple stab wounds to the neck and shoulder.
Vitals?
Pulse: 97, resps: 32, sat: 93 on six liters.
I came to pick her up for class
and found her bleeding on the floor.
Sam, what's open? ( wheezing )
TAGGART: Trauma One.
CLEMENTE: Oh, well, well,
if it isn't the elusive Dr. K.
Okay, Vic, we'll have to catch up later. Abby, come with us.
Hey, you're busy. I get it.
KOVAC: Why don't you stay out and run the board.
Okay, got it, boss. What happened?
Knife wound, lacerated trachea.
Hi, I'm Dr. Lockhart.
Can you tell us your name?
( wheezing ) Nimet.
Please... I can't... breathe.
Hang in there.
We're gonna take care of you. Frick!
I'm here, Nim. Everything's going to be okay.
Abby, take the airway.
Sam, get another line. Ready?
One, two, three.
I'm scared.
FRICK: Shh. Don't try to talk.
Just let the doctors take care of you.
Sats only 84.
Zone three stab wounds with clear tracheal penetration
and an adjacent pulsatile mass.
The police are here.
How is she doing? Not right now.
Stridor with what appears to be an expanding hematoma.
Haleh, can you stay?
Yeah.
You know her? She's my girlfriend.
I need to take a statement.
Now? Can't this wait?
Just tell them what you can, won't take long.
TAGGART: She's hypoventilating.
HALEH: Her pulse is taking a dive.
LOCKHART: Nimet?
TAGGART: Sats only 78.
She was just talking.
What do you guys want?
Okay, uh, 7-5 ET, mac 2,
etomidate, and SUX.
KOVAC: No paralytics, could be a tough intubation.
What, are you trying to make it tougher?
No, if you can't get the tube,
it's going to be very hard for you to bag
through a lacerated trachea.
I'll get the tube.
HALEH: Systolic's 81.
MAN: Tote bag?
Uh, no, thanks.
That's a wrong answer.
You want this. Okay.
WOMAN: 19, 20, 22!
Yay!
Come demo the LifeWind. Free trip to Miami.
Uh, no, thank you.
Um, excuse me.
Can I get a nonfat latte, please?
Coming up.
You familiar with the Violet 4000?
Excuse me?
It's a new cataract emulsifier for use
in the operating room.
Foam?
Never mind.
More cricoid.
I'm pressing as hard as I can.
Towel roll-- the cords are turning anterior.
Okay, let me get that.
( grunts )
Haleh, suction.
You want suction or cricoid?
I can't do both.
Let me take a shot.
No, that's all right. I'm in.
I don't think you are.
LOCKHART: Oh, come on.
HALEH: Sats only 72.
Abby?
Call surgery. She needs a trach.
Paged them three times already.
Page them again. Heart rate is dropping.
I almost got it.
Damn it.
Where's the defibrillator? HALEH: Counter.
KOVAC: Get ready with atropine.
I got it. It's heavy. I got it. I'm right here.
TAGGART: Pulse 23.
Atropine, one mig now.
Starting compressions.
If you want me to jump in there and do that, I can. I'm fine.
Yeah, but you don't have to do that. All right, enough.
I'm having a baby. Get over it.
Let me do my job.
Amp of epi, right away.
MORRIS: Hey, Ray.
Have you seen the Wood's lamp?
These morgellons are supposed to be autoflorescent.
What? Are you speaking English?
My patient thinks some sort of fiber-producing bug
is crawling on her.
She brought some in a jar.
It's lint.
No, it's fibers produced by the morgellons.
Delusional parasitism.
DC home with a referral for counseling.
I thought there might be some therapeutic benefit
to looking at this under the scope.
Make her feel I'm taking her complaint seriously.
Morris, it's schmootz, okay? It's schmootz.
Spend your time on patients that you could actually help, okay?
Hey, guys, guys, okay, look.
I know my time off left you shorthanded.
Hey, no worries.
Okay, I'm sensing...
Look, if there's anything you want to ask,
anything you want to get off your chest,
anything you want to say... It's all good, really.
MARQUEZ: Crushing chest pain. Need a doc.
Exam three's open.
Holy crap, it's like I'm in a vise.
Vitals?
Pulse: 92, BP: 110/65.
Five of MS. Let's get him on O2.
You forgot the 12 lead.
Yeah, I was getting to that.
Aspirin, oxygen, beta-blockers, morphine.
It's cookbook.
Somebody say morphine?
Call the cath lab.
Yeah. This isn't our first MI.
Any word from surgery?
Trauma's still in with the liver lac.
What about cardiothoracic? Did you try them?
Yeah, they're doing a triple-A that choppered in from Mercy.
What, and that's all we have in-house?
Big surgical conference this week.
Skeleton crews at all the hospitals in town.
Here's your tube.
Come on, Nimet.
Abby, your GI bleeder is altered, and the crit fell to 9.
All right, two units of O-neg,
and tell GI to scope him him before he codes. Okay.
Guy needs central access.
Go ahead.
I mean, if you want.
We're okay here.
HALEH: Sats are coming up.
KOVAC: Hold compressions.
TAGGART: Back in sinus, 72.
Is she going to be all right?
This tube is helping her breathe right now,
but she's going to need surgery on her airway.
Have we tried head and neck service?
I'll give them a call.
The girl's mom and brother are here.
Oh, Nimet...
( speaks foreign language )
I'm Dr. Kovac.
What's he doing here?
Hey, let's just be cool, all right?
Get out!
Mahir, calm down!
Get the hell off of me!
Settle down, guys!
Settle down! Guys, settle down! Hey!
How dare you come here?
You're not family.
Stay away from my sister!
Please, for Nimet's sake, show some respect.
How's your first day back going?
It's great. Well, good.
Really, really good.
My day pretty much sucks. Oh, yeah?
I pretty much lost it in a code this morning.
Isn't it a funny thing that, one minute, your whole life,
everything is in order, and then wham, this split-second event,
and the whole thing just starts to spin around, you know?
Yeah, I know.
I know exactly what you're talking about because...
People at work, I mean, they see
this tiny sliver of what you're about,
and then they just make it all about that one thing.
I know. They jump to all sorts of conclusions...
Right, right, 'cause they don't know what I'm going through.
And they're making all these assumptions,
but they're only seeing what they want to see.
RIZA: Why must men always resort to violence
to settle their differences?
My son idolizes his sister.
But he's never liked this boyfriend of hers.
Our surgical team is working
on another critical patient right now,
but Nimet is next.
Trauma room.
Yeah, this is she.
Yeah, who's this?
Yo, where the hell do you get off calling me here?
I'm working, idiot!
Uh, since when do we get personal calls
transferred back to the trauma rooms?
I'm sorry. That might be my fault.
Everything okay?
Yeah, nothing winning the lottery couldn't help.
Sorry about that.
I'm going to clean your son's cuts now.
Thank you.
Don't worry, kuchuk hanem.
I won't leave
until we can walk out together.
Her name Nimet, it means "blessing."
That's lovely.
Her father called her Madame Curie because when she was born,
she was looking at us so intensely,
like she was studying her parents.
We thought she might grow up to be a scientist.
Is he coming in?
He died when Nimet was five.
He was a reporter for the newspaper.
Kidnapped and shot by the Turkish Hezbollah
while I was pregnant with Mahir.
I had to leave.
Had to raise my children in a country
where they wouldn't be killed for speaking the truth.
I understand.
I only spoke a few words of English when we arrived.
I had to work two jobs.
I know how that is,
trying to adjust, to fit in.
It was worth it.
She thrived.
Earned a full scholarship at UIC.
Journalism, like her father.
You've done well by your children.
I've tried.
DUBENKO: Neela.
"The Utility of the Seatbelt Sign
in Predicting Mediastinal Injury."
"Neela Rasgotra, M.D."
3:00 p.m. in the Sunflower Room.
Sunflower Room-- sounds happy.
Holds 200 people.
There's a lot of interest in your talk.
Lucian, hello!
Tim, hi, nice to see you. How you doing?
Love to catch up, but I've got to go mediate
the trauma panel. Oh, yeah.
Looks like an interesting group this year. Very.
And wait.
Now, why aren't you on it?
That's weird.
Too bad.
Timothy Weisner.
Remember when I said there's always one ass in the audience
who's determined to look smarter than you?
He's that guy.
You have his paper, right?
'Cause he's gonna ask you about it.
Okay.
Yeah, not enough love in the sandbox.
Needs to hear his own work cited in other people's talks.
Relax. You'll be fine.
I played a tangerine
in the Christmas play in primary school.
Lost my footing and rolled off the stage.
I'm having flashbacks.
Just relax.
Read your slides, don't go too fast, and...
well, memorize table three of the Weisner paper,
and you'll do just fine.
Oh, I bought you this.
Take one of these.
It's a beta-blocker.
It's okay. I always take one before I talk.
Takes the edge off the catecholamines.
I told you, over-golding is hazardous to your health.
Your skin's never going to heal
if you don't give it a chance to air out.
I did like you said.
I kept it off for a week. Make it a month this time.
Hey, Ray, Neela called. Said it was urgent.
Okay, another week of Keflex, and give the bling a break.
I got to be me, man.
Yeah.
Hey, Neela wants you to go to her locker
and find the Weisner paper
in the February 2005 issue of Trauma Annals
and fax it to her at this number.
She said you'd know the combination,
and you'd know what it's about.
I do and I do.
And she said that if you do this,
she'll watch any '70s movie you want tonight,
even the extended version of Dawn of the Dead.
And this came back on your overdose.
You sure this is right?
I even had them repeat it.
How you feeling, Mr. Sadler?
About the same.
But I suppose I won't feel much until most of the liver dies.
That's not gonna happen.
Your acetaminophen level is almost undetectable.
Strange, I know that's what I took.
Could there have been anything else in the bottle?
No.
But that doesn't change the course of action, right?
I mean, you still have to keep me on a hold.
At least until psychiatry sees you, yeah.
Yeah, that makes sense.
So what happened in there?
Nothing.
That wasn't nothing.
She shouldn't be with someone like that.
He seems like an okay enough guy to me.
He's a jerk.
He lives in Dorch.
It's the jock dorm.
Something bad happened there last term.
What do you mean something bad?
A girl got gang-raped.
It was in the news.
They never figured out who did it.
And you think Frick was involved?
They all knew what was going on.
I'll be right back.
Where's the boyfriend?
Uh, staying away for now, out of respect for the family.
Yeah, brother doesn't think he's such a good guy.
Well, I'm sure the police are investigating all possibilities.
The phone call before...
Ah, it's nothing.
Uh, surgery's still tied up?
Yeah.
Anything I can do?
No, I... I enrolled Alex in this tutoring program
where they, you know, help him with his homework
in the afternoons, and they keep him out of trouble.
That sounds good.
Yeah.
Except for you have to pay for the whole term up front.
So I maxed out my Visa and now...
I'm a little late on our rent.
Do you, do you need...
No, it's okay.
We're fine.
We're gonna be okay.
But thanks.
This thing has been transmitting for 20 minutes.
Is this normal?
The machine is archaic.
It prints on rolls instead of sheets,
and forget about confirming if it's been received.
This is just press and pray.
Yeah, right.
Okay, could you send this from the department office?
It's important. Something wrong with your feet?
I'm not your personal secretary.
Frank, please.
I have six patients ready to dispo,
and I haven't presented any of them yet. Fine.
I'll have a turkey club for lunch, thank you.
Thank you.
Hey, you need to present?
Ah, that's okay. That's cool.
What do you mean?
I just heard you say you needed to present.
Right, and I already started with Kovac,
so I'll just wait for him.
Okay. Okay.
X-Ray, I'm not feeling the love, man.
What's the problem?
No problem.
No, no, seriously, what's the deal?
What's going on? I don't know what you mean.
Yeah, you do.
I mean, you've been giving me attitude all day, man.
It's getting a little old, frankly, okay?
I mean, so what, I had a messy situation with a girl.
And that's all it was, okay?
Can we leave it in the past? Hey, hey, hey.
Your personal life, it's your business, okay, man?
Oh, so you want to know the whole story, huh?
Mm.
Okay, here it is, here it is.
I had the weekend off, went a little crazy.
There was some weed. There was some blow, okay?
Come on, man, you're a musician.
You know what it's like.
No, actually, I don't.
So, what, are you in a Christian band?
Just forget it, okay?
No, no, I'm not gonna let you forget it
'cause let me tell you something.
I want you to know that I never
showed up to work high once, okay?
Not once, you understand?
Want a medal for that?
Where do you get off being so self-righteous, man?
I've seen you stumble out of Ike's
plenty of times, okay?
So, what, it's cool to be obliterated on EtOH,
but you change the chemical, all of a sudden, I'm a scumbag?
You're right.
It's not fair.
Listen, let's me and you get something straight, okay?
I've been evaluated by the Impaired Physicians Committee.
And you know what? I'm in the clear.
And whether you like it or not, I'm back at County,
I'm your attending,
and you better start showing me some respect.
Now take this history, examine that patient,
and present to me in ten, you got it?!
( sighs )
Well, he's definitely got some some axis two stuff going on,
but he's not actively suicidal.
I'm sending him home. You're kidding.
No, he's a negative tox screen,
doesn't seem to have any plan to it try again.
It's a la casa, bye-bye.
Whoa, you're comfortable discharging him?
No, not exactly,
but the psych ward is full and I can't hold him.
I'll put a formal consult in the chart.
Excuse me?
You'll refer him for outpatient counseling at least.
Sure, but the next available appointment
is in 14 weeks.
Excuse me, sir?
What can I do for you, little lady?
We're looking for a doctor named Archibald Morris.
And who is "we?"
KOVAC: Okay, type and cross the thalassemia kid,
and I want post-reduction films on the tib/fib
before the ketamine wears off.
You got it.
So. How's it going?
Oh, it's going great.
Going real great.
You know, I just want to thank you for making the effort
and easing my re-entry.
Good to have you back, Vic.
Glad to hear it, because if I didn't know better,
I would have thought you're trying to avoiding me.
I'm not avoiding you.
I've been bouncing all day
between patients and administrative crap.
Budget committee, admission...
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you're important.
I get it. I get it.
Look, sorry we didn't roll out
the red carpet for you today...
Nimet's tanking again.
Right.
Can't get the sat above 80,
and she's getting really hard to bag.
Okay, suction.
Zone three stab wound to the neck.
Systolic's only 72.
Will someone explain, please?
I can't ventilate at all.
Hematoma's expanding. It's dislodged the tube.
All right, let's crike her.
No, no, too dangerous.
Lesion is low, if we cut into it,
she can bleed out.
Good point. Good point.
All right, let's go to Plan B.
Sam, call the perfusion team.
What?
Heart rate's dropping into the 50s.
What does that mean?
We're going to put in a cardiopulmonary bypass.
You need an OR and a surgeon for that,
and we don't have either.
We're going to cannulate down here
and we'll bypass ourselves.
You can't do that.
If we work quickly, we can get her on the machine
before she suffers permanent hypoxic damage.
Go get the resident.
I'll find Abby.
Tell me what's happening!
The bleeding is blocking her airway.
We can't get enough oxygen into her blood.
Oh, God.
( speaking Turkish )
KOVAC: We'll get her on the heart-lung machine
so we can buy more time before we can get into an OR, okay?
Whatever you think is right.
Brady to 45, lost the pulse!
Starting compressions.
Mahir, you should wait outside.
Mom... Go.
Nimet, Nimet...
You're a strong girl. You're a brave girl.
Don't leave me. Don't give up.
Okay, what's this about, kids? I'm a doctor, very busy.
You're Archibald Morris?
Yeah. What do you need?
You better have a seat.
( sighs )
Here's the deal:
we four live with different parents,
but we all share the same dad.
BOY: We're not supposed to be able
to find out the identity of our father.
But the Donor Sibling Registry
allows us to find out
the identity of each other.
So, I got in contact with all of them via e-mail,
and it actually turns out
that little Max here is actually a computer genius.
What's up?
GIRL 2: He hacked into the system
at the sperm bank
and found our father's name:
"Archibald Morris."
GIRL: So... are you donor 140
from the Chicago Cryo Bank?
Huh?
Did you donate any sperm between 1991 and 1996?
( scoffs ): Did I ever.
Oh, my God.
I'm... I'm your daddy.
Mr. Sadler.
Being a sitter for crazy people
seems like a really boring job.
Well, guess what, Barry?
You and the sitter can both go home.
What?
You convinced the psychiatrist
that it's safe to discharge you.
No. You're free to go.
Well, well... what about these?
Mr. Sadler, you took what, three, maybe four pills?
Two.
Two.
But-but a gesture is a gesture.
I was suicidal when I did it.
The psychiatrist is convinced
you're not going to try it again.
What if I'm homicidal?
You have to keep me here if I'm homicidal,
if I want to kill people.
Barry...
what's going on?
The thing is...
I, uh...
I need to stay here.
I can't go home this weekend.
Why not?
I just can't.
You're going to have to do better than that.
I'm in love with my best friend's girl.
It happens. You'll get over it.
They're getting married tomorrow.
I don't trust myself not to...
To what?
Object.
Or worse.
Lock me up till the wedding's over, please.
I'm begging you.
I'll talk to psych again.
See what I can do.
Barry.
Does she know?
Who, Helen?
Yeah.
Have you told her how you feel?
God, no.
That would be crazy.
Still in PEA.
Resuming compressions.
It's okay, Nimet.
It's going to be all right.
Got a flash. Introducer.
Have you ever done this before?
Nope.
All right, give us some room.
Give us some room. Come on.
I'll be right here.
Just listen to my voice.
LOCKHART: This seems a little unconventional.
Okay, fine. What's the alternative?
LOCKHART: Somebody call surgery again.
KOVAC: They were still working in an open chest five minutes ago.
Did I tell you Mrs. Kalter's daughter
has 14 bridesmaids in her wedding?
This is gonna work. We'll oxygenate her blood till surgery's ready.
It's gonna be awesome.
Yeah, if she doesn't bleed out from all the heparin.
Threading easily. Nine yards of silk organza for each dress.
Hook me up, Lockhart.
Does surgery even know we're doing this?
( sighs ): They're not available.
We can't wait.
Silk flowers all around her neck.
You must get better
so you can help me with the embroidery.
pH only 7.02.
Yeah, well, we got nothing to lose.
KOVAC: Okay, good flush.
MOTHER: You are such
a good girl, such a help to me.
SAM: Sats hanging in the 60s.
Come on. Come on. This is taking too long. Come on.
O-silk.
Okay.
Unclamping venous.
CLEMENTE: Unclamping arterial.
Ready.
Okay, mark the time.
Okay, pump is on. Four liters per minute.
Okay, you can stop.
Color's better already.
CLEMENTE: Full flow, baby.
Sweet! Ha-ha!
Sats coming up: 92.
Is it working?
Her oxygen level is improving, yes.
Thank you. Thank you for saving my daughter.
( sobbing )
RASGOTRA: Up to 15% of all deaths
following motor vehicle collisions are caused
by injury to the thoracic aorta.
I...
Uh...
We... set out to document the incidence and...
utility of the seatbelt sign in predicting...
( clears throat )
Is there anyone from audiovisual support here?
( crashing and splattering )
PROTESTERS: Unseen they suffer! Unheard they cry!
In agony they linger! Alone they die!
( chanting ): Rats have rights! Rats have rights!
RASGOTRA: I would just like to point out...
Rats have rights!
...that our study didn't involve
any rats!
PROTESTERS ( chanting ): Rats have rights! Rats have rights!
Rats have rights! Rats have rights!
Ray! Meet my kids.
Your what?
Yeah, I needed some extra cash in college,
donated to a sperm bank.
Best job I ever had, by the way. I'm Hana.
My eldest.
Stole her mom's car and drove 60 miles without a license
to get everybody here.
Michael is the regional Dance Dance Revolution champion,
Melia is a professional jump roper,
and my boy, Max, is a computer whiz.
What's up?
It's nice to meet you all.
Yeah, I'm just giving the tour. Okay.
All right. These are the trauma rooms.
Okay? This is where Daddy saves lives.
Abby.
Come meet my children. Not now, Morris.
Okay, she hates kids.
How's she doing?
Stable for now.
Where'd the family go?
I made them go get something to eat.
It's going to be a long night. Yeah.
Uh, okay, I kind of snapped this morning.
It's okay. It's hormones.
No, I hate that excuse. I just...
I just want to say that
I know you're trying to help, and I apologize.
Apology accepted.
It's just...
( sighs )
strange being pregnant.
It's so weird having such a personal thing be so public.
Well, for me, being pregnant
was something everyone was ashamed of.
My parents didn't want me to leave the house.
I think it's nice that everybody
wants to share in this with you.
Luka!
Excuse me. Excuse me.
MOTHER: Please, tell us what's happening.
Seventh unit, platelets, and FFP going up.
Wide open at the femoral.
Somebody, explain. What has gone wrong?
Heparin's off, right?
The heparin's off, right?! It's off!
Okay, one gram of protamine.
MOTHER: Please, you have to help her!
Can't get her mean above 30.
She's losing blood faster than we can put it in.
In order to put Nimet on this machine,
we had to give her a medicine
that thins her blood.
A possible side effect of that is internal bleeding.
We think that might be what's happening right now.
If you stop the medicine, she'll be okay?
That's what we're hoping, yes.
SAM: Whoa.
Acidotic, 6.8.
CLEMENTE: All right, one amp of bicarb
and one gram calcium.
Let's go. Let's go. Go! Go! Go!
Pupils are fixed and dilated.
No corneal, no gag.
Why? There's no head trauma,
and there's no reason for spontaneous bleed.
Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia
can cause acute intracranial hemorrhage.
She's been on heparin for less than an hour, okay?
It doesn't make sense. Does it make sense to you?
Check the oxygenator!
Get another ACT!
SAM: Volume's too low. No flow.
( brother praying in Arabic )
She's lost some very basic neurologic reflexes.
( continues praying ) What does that mean?
We think that she's bled into her brain.
Stop, Mahir. I can't hear the doctors!
You can fix this?
No, we can't.
( resumes praying )
CLEMENTE: Her brain is gone,
and as soon as we turn that machine off,
her body's going to die, too.
( praying forcefully ) Come back!
Nimet is strong! She can fight!
Stop, Mahir! Stop right now!
This never would have happened if she stayed home!
You should have made her stay! Enough!
Please! There must be
another machine or something! I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'll give my own blood...
It was a good idea, Vic.
Yeah. Yeah, if it had worked, right?
You gave her the only chance she ever had.
Yeah. Yeah.
DUBENKO: I'm sorry about the beta-blocker.
Ten milligrams was probably a bit much.
The fainting part just makes for a better story.
You know, I once ate a hash brownie
before giving a big talk in Amsterdam.
I mistakenly thought
that it would take an hour to kick in.
Suddenly, I was up on a stage,
completely out of my head,
lecturing to a roomful of biochemists
in a faux French accent.
Okay.
I feel better.
You know, today was a complete disaster,
but at least I didn't bring it on myself.
No, no, no, no.
No, you were the victim
of a truly astounding confluence of technical problems,
miscalculated pharmaceuticals and rat activists.
As crazy as that sounds,
that's totally in sync with my life at the moment.
Your life sounds pretty interesting.
Oh, no.
I know I may appear to be this kind of wild, spontaneous girl
who plans a wedding in a day and sits here getting drunk
with her attending in a hotel bar,
but I'm not.
I'm boring.
Really boring.
All I want to do is hang out at home with my roommate.
Your roommate? Dr. Barnett?
Yeah. Ray.
Well, that's nice.
It's good the two of you get along so well.
Yeah, we do.
Maybe that's what I need.
I was thinking of getting a dog,
but a roommate's probably easier to house-train.
You ready for another round?
Ah, no. No, thank you.
I, uh...
I should get going.
It was worth a try.
Yeah.
I need to go over organ donation
and explain about the coroner.
I don't want to rush her.
No, of course not.
This might take a while.
Maybe you should go home. Don't wait for me.
Um...
I've been thinking, and if it's that important to your family,
I'm fine with the baptism.
A little holy water never hurt anybody, right?
Well, Archie, this was fun.
I'm glad we came.
Wait.
You're not leaving, are you?
I was gonna take you all out for burgers and shakes.
Sorry, can't. I've got to get everyone home before 8:00
or our parents will start to worry.
Well...
I mean, what's next?
I wanna take you guys to ball games,
Millennium Park, movies your parents won't let you see.
There's just so much.
Perhaps.
We're all pretty busy, and I don't know when
I'll be able to steal my mom's car again, so...
Somebody hid the digital on the code cart.
Ooh, great, Frank. Thank you.
Come here, I want to take a picture.
Really, we gotta run. Please. Two seconds. Come on.
Please.
Okay, everyone say, "freak."
Samantha.
Hey.
I'm glad you called.
Where's all your stuff?
Oh, I thought we were going to conduct an interview first.
I thought we already did.
( sizzling )
( door opening )
Hey, how was it?
Endless.
Well, I'm making us stir-fry.
Beer or wine? Neither.
I'm exhausted and already drunk.
All right, here,
taste this.
Freshwater chestnut.
Crazy, huh?
Thought they grew in cans.
All right, well, I rented The Omen,
and I was too scared to watch it alone.
Ray...
It's better than The Exorcist, I promise.
It's a classic.
That's what you said about The Exorcist.
True, but... Ray.
I know, you're tired. Ray...
Okay, look, I know you don't like devil movies.
It's the last one, I promise.
I think...
I should move out.
Why?
I think we both know why.
( speaking softly )
Where's Mahir?
I don't now. I'm afraid for him.
He just needs some time.
I'm... I'm sorry to bother you with this,
but, uh, you need to sign for her things.
This is the hardest thing
for any parent to experience.
How do you protect them from all the evil in the world?
You can't. ( sobbing )
No matter what you do, you can't.
Mahir was beaten up at school after 9/11 for being Muslim.
They called him a terrorist.
Ever since then he became very strict about his prayers.
He cut himself off from everything
except his fundamentalist friends.
He wanted the same thing for his sister.
There's a park down the street where we live.
I close my eyes and they're just little children on the swings.
( sobbing ) Oh, God.
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
It's all right. It's all right.
I brought them to this country to find justice and freedom.
But I lose two children today.
Two children.
( sobbing ): Oh, God.
Mahir... Mahir will be all right.
I can't pretend that I don't know what I know in my heart.
He loved his sister,
but he thought she was disgracing the family,
disgracing herself.
Oh, God.
( sobbing ): Doctor,
Doctor, Doctor.
Doctor, tell the police to search my house first.
They should look in Mahir's room for the knife.
Oh, God.
( speaking Turkish )
( sobbing )
This was an honor killing?
Yes. Yes.
That's what they call it.
But there is no honor here.
( speaks softly )
( sobbing )
Hey, Morris, what the hell you still doing here, man?
Downloading a picture of my kids from the ER camera.
Really photogenic, aren't they, huh?
I'm going to use this one for my Christmas card.
I hate Christmas cards, man.
Hey, you want to go grab some dinner together?
Uh, no, my oldest boy, Michael, DJs an on-line radio show.
I want to check it out tonight.
Hey, why don't we listen to it right here?
No, I can't 'cause after that, I gotta brush up on my trig
so I can help Melia with her homework.
She's ten years old, she's smarter at math than I am, huh?
Family really keeps you busy, huh?
Yeah, but it's worth it, though, right?
So, you, uh, heading home?
I heard your apartment got pretty messed up.
No, it's fixed.
I mean, that's finally what it took the landlord to paint it.
Okay then. Cool.
Welcome back, Vic.
You have a good night.
You, too, man.
