MAN: Sir?
MAN: Sir
You... you can't be out here.
Sir?
Sir?
It's not safe.
Sir?
Sir, you can't be here.
Sir?
They found some guy wandering and disoriented.
Oh, just what we need-- another lost soul.
You can never have enough of them.
Nate Lennox, 54.
Medic Alert bracelet says he's ALS.
Paralyzed and unresponsive.
He rolled out onto the ice at Prospect Rink.
Somebody with him?
Uh, called the number on the bracelet.
Left a message.
Mr. Lennox, can you hear me?
How did he get out of the house?
Good question.
Do you think he was abandoned?
Somebody's taking care of this guy.
He's got clean clothes
and it looks like he had a shave this morning.
Pulse ox is only 89.
Let's get him on five liters by mask. Okay.
Gonna need some lifting help.
No, no, no, let's just leave him in the chair for now.
If we lay him down, it might compress his lungs.
It might make things worse.
Okay, crackles bilaterally.
CBC, chem panel and a portable chest.
Let's call for his old medical records.
Whoa!
( grunting ): Hey, hey.
What? Did you hit the joystick?
No.
Okay. Sats are up to 92.
Have RT induce a sputum for a gram stain
and culture.
Okay. Whoa! Hey.
Don't do that.
I didn't touch it.
Is there a short or something?
I think the computer has an eye sensor
that's controlling the chair.
I think he wants to get out of here.
He's probably altered from too low oxygen.
Yeah, well, I'm...
I'm gonna disconnect the battery.
Need a hand?
ALS with pneumonia.
Could use a hep lock.
What's his name?
Nate Lennox.
I've seen him before, a while back.
SYNTHESIZED VOICE: No.
Help. Don't.
He did that with his eyes?
Well, looks like a speech synthesizer program.
It's okay now, sir.
We're gonna take care of you.
Want out. Please, let me out.
Please,
let me out.
Sats are still borderline.
I'm not sure how aggressive
we need to be with this guy.
Is he a DNR?
If I were like that, I sure as hell would be.
Mr. Lennox, your oxygen levels are falling.
Do you understand?
We need to know your wishes about resuscitation.
Okay.
Home...
Does that mean you don't want heroic measures?
Home.
If you stop breathing,
do you want us to use a machine,
a ventilator?
Hungry...
Food.
SAM: Do you have a living will?
An advanced directive?
Drug store. I don't think we're getting through to him.
Do you know where you are?
I have amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,
also known as Lou Gehrig's Disease.
It is a progressive degenerative neurologic disorder
that has weakened my muscles.
All of my senses are intact.
My mind is clear.
Not today, it isn't.
Got his old records.
We need the name of his neurologist.
Maybe he'll know what to do with this one.
You want me to up his oxygen?
I'm gonna say let's go with BiPap.
It'll buy us time without having to intubate.
I knew he looked familiar.
What? He should already be on BiPap.
Neela and I treated him about a year ago.
He came in for shortness of breath.
NATE: Every time you have a thought,
every time you take a breath,
every time you move a muscle,
every time you take a crap...
( chuckling )
...you should thank your ATP... AT... ATP.
Oxidative phosphorylation...
( inhaling )
gives...
gives us...
a whopping...
SAM: The bedpan may distort things a little.
Hoo, boy.
The kids at school are going to make fun of me.
This too tight? No, It's fine.
It's like an oven in here.
I'm sorry, they're working on the A/C.
So hot...
The BiPap increases your tidal volume.
Your neurologist says it'll give you more energy
and a longer survival.
That's great news.
Sam, labs were hemolyzed on your heat stroke guy.
I'll be right back. I'll wait here.
I should have another listen.
Where'd you go to med school?
Um, right here.
I was a Biochemistry major at Yale,
so I placed out of your class.
Yale...
I worked in Sandra Hamilton's lab my senior year.
Yeah, I know.
We were in awe of your work on anti-sense RNA.
I cited several of your studies
in my paper on gene inactivation
in Trypanosoma brucei.
You published as an undergraduate?
Second author.
Impressive.
So what are you doing here
in this, uh, cesspool?
Are you just here for the big bucks?
What is it going to be?
Orthopedics?
Plastic surgery?
Neither.
I... can't stand surgeons.
They're arrogant workaholics
who can't relate to people unless they're asleep.
WOMAN: Sorry, Nate.
The car overheated and I had to take the El.
What happened?
I'm fine.
He had some shortness of breath.
I'm Dr. Rasgotra.
Uh, Fran Bevens...
Did you reach Dr. Ames?
He's already been down. Okay.
He's consulting a speech pathologist.
Good.
Not good.
I don't need it.
It's getting hard for people
to understand what you're saying, Nate.
Maybe they should start listening better.
Hello, Fran.
Jared... it's good to see you.
Ready to start?
I'm trying to contain my enthusiasm.
How long are you guys going to be?
Half an hour. 15 minutes.
We'll be back with your aftercare instructions.
You...
think about
what you're doing.
You may realize
you don't... belong here.
Where does he think you belong?
Probably back at the Jumbo Mart.
I think he misses my slushies.
Please be kind.
Hey, severe sunburn.
Dispo if the pain's down with toradol and aloe.
Not too bad.
Soft rule out going to tele...
Excellent. And this guy's with his PMD,
so there's nothing for you to do.
Lennox? Is that Nate Lennox?
Yeah, the biochemistry professor.
Oh, wait, I've got one more.
Yeah, I'll figure it out.
Nate...
Do you like my new look?
Well, not a lot of people could pull that off.
Good to see you, Abby.
Hi, Fran. Whatcha doing?
Playing Medal of Honor.
I just killed a convoy of Nazis.
AMES: His facial muscles are weakening,
he needs to practice with assisted speech.
SYNTHESIZED VOICE: Hey, I've got a great idea...
Oops.
AMES: Well, we can wait on speech therapy
for the time being, but I got to tell you, Nate--
you're just putting off the inevitable.
You need to start wearing this. Why?
Because it has your diagnosis on it and your name
and your phone number.
We're lucky you were in class today.
Otherwise, who knows what might have happened?
Huh?
Okay, okay.
How about this thing?
Do I have to wear it all the time?
AMES: Well, we'll start with bedtime use.
You'll get the benefits of eight hours a night
while you're asleep.
I keep waking up...
and something else is gone.
Thank God for the bracelet.
Is that comfortable?
Nate. Nate.
He was speaking with the computer
when he first came in.
Can't get an IV in him.
He always needs a central line.
He was at an ice rink?
Yeah. Any idea why?
It was like any other day.
I got up, I shaved him, bathed him,
fed him breakfast and then transferred him to the chair.
He was watching television, so I went to take a quick nap.
How did he get outside?
He can open the front door with his computer.
Ray, ready to present?
Yeah. Dr. Kovac.
Fran Bevens.
Hello. Hello, sir.
FRAN: You saw him a few years ago.
Right middle and lower lobe infiltrates.
He's altered, borderline oxygenation, even with BiPap.
Can we have a word?
Yes, of course.
We, uh, may need to make a decision
about intubating and ventilation.
You think he can get over the pneumonia?
BARNETT: He could,
or he could be intubated in the ICU,
going downhill for four weeks.
TAGGART: He hasn't got a lot of reserve.
There's no guarantee he'll get better.
This may be
the natural end point of his disease.
So maybe it's time to focus on keeping him comfortable.
Fran, I just heard you were here.
Thank you for coming by.
I've taken care of him before.
He decided
to go out by himself.
Why'd you do that, Nate?
COMPUTER: In motion.
What's in motion?
Free.
LOCKHART: His pulse ox is down to 82.
What are you doing?
Well, his lungs are full of junk,
his sats are down, he needs to be intubated.
Abby, we've been just discussing about how best to proceed.
Well, helping him breathe
would be a good way to start, don't you think?
I don't think that he'd want that, Abby.
Abby...
Yankauer.
We haven't come to a consensus.
I'm not comfortable with this.
I'm not intubating.
( hissing and gurgling )
Large mucus plug at the cords.
Okay, that should help.
Temporarily.
Sats are coming up.
Well, this will give us time to treat him with
oxygen and antibiotics until he's alert enough
to tell us what he wants.
Dr. Lennox.
Nate.
Nate, talk to us.
Around... and into the subclavian.
Fluoro off.
Okay, that's as far as we go.
Ceftriaxone's ready.
How'd he do?
Very well. We're starting the IV antibiotics.
When did he last eat?
I fed him this morning.
He could use some calories.
How you doing?
You're in the hospital, Nate.
LOCKHART: Nate...
You remember when we talked about putting in a trake
if you had trouble breathing?
You said you wanted to keep going
until they found a stem cell cure.
BARNETT: Why don't we just let him rest?
Snowmobile versus tree. Morris needs some help.
500 of Azithro after the Rocephin.
Got it.
Okay, we all need to agree on this.
You told me you wanted a trake.
FRAN: That was a long time ago, Abby.
His biggest fear now is that he'll end up on life support
aware of everything, but with no way to communicate.
He was communicating a half hour ago, wasn't he?
BARNETT: That could have been random eye movements.
400 cc's of Jevity.
Yeah.
So if we do the trake...
LOCKHART: He's out of here in a day.
He can go home with a portable ventilator.
You'd have to learn how to suction
and troubleshoot the vent.
But we can get you some help.
I know you're tired.
He's the one who's tired.
Fran.
I'm with him every day, Abby.
I know.
Looks like we've got a clogged G-tube here.
Do you flush it with water?
Yes, after every feeding.
He needs nutritional support soon
to fight off the infection.
It won't go. Do you know when the tube was put in?
No. I...
G-tube placed in May, 2002.
He came in after a choking spell.
( applause )
You know, each May, the graduating medical students
vote to present a Teacher of the Year Award.
Now this year's award is unique. Fresh flowers.
in that the students have chosen not a clinician, They must think it will make up
but rather a scientist, for cutting back on my teaching.
whose dynamism and passion for inquiry
made a strong impression during their first year
and stayed with the students throughout their training.
This year it gives me great pleasure... ( choking )
to present the 2002 Teacher of the Year Award Nate, what is it? Nate? Nate?
to Dr. Nathan Lennox. ( gasps )
Well, your chest X-ray is negative for aspiration.
You got lucky, Nate.
Yeah, I'm the luckiest man on the face of the Earth.
It's time for a feeding tube.
No, it's not.
Well, you know your chewing and swallowing muscles
are getting pretty weak.
Well, then Fran will have to cut my meat smaller, won't she?
Takes him an hour to eat a meal.
He's lost ten pounds. More like five.
The rest is water weight.
Weight loss accelerates the progression of ALS.
The extra calories from the tube feeding
will mean increased strength, more energy
and longer survival.
I'll think about it.
Romano around?
He's stuck in the OR with a pneumonectomy,
but I'll see about getting you on the schedule.
I said I'll think about it.
Well, we'll save you a spot.
We can always cancel.
Good night.
I'll walk out with you, Donald.
I'll be right back. Night, guys. It's been great.
Tell them to send the trophy to my mother.
Trophy?
I won the potato sack race at the county retreat.
Abby Lockhart around?
No, not tonight.
It's pretty quiet around here.
Sometimes it's slow.
It's not just that.
Are you cutting back on staff or something?
One of our attendings died.
Mark Greene.
A lot of people took off to go to his memorial.
Chen wants you in Exam Three with the belly pain guy.
It's a slam-dunk diverticulitis.
I called medicine-- all she has to do is co-sign my chart.
I'll let you tell her that yourself.
What year residency you in?
First. I'm an intern.
Ooh, pretty cocky for an intern, aren't you, huh?
You're either real smart or really insecure.
If I were you, I'd put my money on the first one.
Of course, 'cause all the great minds
want to work in the County E.R.
Actually, this is just temporary.
Planning on moving over to Northwestern soon.
Congratulations.
Got in, huh?
Well, not yet, but believe me, I will.
JARVIK: Pre-op instructions for the G-tube.
Okay, cool. All right, listen up.
This is going to show you everything you need to know
about the procedure: where to show up,
what to eat the night before, what to wear...
( sobs gently )
Uh... are you okay?
Look, I know it's hard.
This isn't me.
It's the disease.
Okay. The nerve deterioration leads to pseudobulbar affect.
His emotions can be very exaggerated.
Yeah, I see.
Okay, shh, shh.
It's called emotional incontinence.
It sucks.
You get a little upset about something,
and the next thing you're crying like a baby.
Well, there has to be some sort of medicine for that.
FRAN: He won't take it.
NATE: Side effects are too much.
And it's the BDNF...
I've been injecting Nerve Growth Factor
twice a day for a year.
Stuff turns ALS mice
into Olympic athletes,
but the human trials-- worthless.
Results haven't panned out in humans.
I'm sorry to hear that.
Now Fran has to pour...
Ensure in my stomach tube all day long.
FRAN: It's no big deal. Shh. Come on.
Come on. Calm down. I just...
didn't want to be a burden on anyone. Shh. Come on.
( sobbing ) Come on.
FRAN: Should this be hurting him?
Maybe just a little.
Okay, G-tube is in.
Balloon is up. Check the flow.
I think he's waking up a little bit.
Go ahead and set up for PFT's.
The flow's looking good.
Thank you.
All right, we need to test his lung function.
Nate, I'm going to put this in your mouth
and Sam's going to pinch your nose.
Here we go.
Easy. All right.
Easy.
Okay...
All right, deep breath in.
( wheezing breath )
And blow it out.
Blow it out, blow it out.
Great.
Forced vital capacity is 32% of normal.
That's the amount of air that he can move... I know what it means.
Okay.
Nate...
Nate.
Your lung capacity has deteriorated.
The best way to help your breathing
is for us to put in a trake.
You're going to need assisted ventilation.
Do you want us to do it?
I'm not sure you'll recover without it.
The trake is the best chance you have
of clearing up your pneumonia.
Nate...
Okay.
Okay.
Call Surgery. He consented to the procedure.
I'm okay.
Abby, I don't think that that's what he meant.
What? He said, "okay."
He said "I'm okay," after that,
which could mean leave him alone.
It's not exactly informed consent.
Nate, you want the trake, don't you?
I don't... you all heard what he said.
At a vital capacity of 30%, some ALS patients
enter into hospice care.
It means they have six months to live.
His FVC is low, yes, but that's because of the pneumonia.
We clear that up, and his lung function
will bounce right back. That's the best case scenario.
He expressed his wishes in advance.
Now he's too sick. He can't give reliable consent.
How's his PO2? I want to do a trake.
We have a consent issue here.
I explained the procedure to the patient.
I asked him if he wanted us to do it.
he said, "okay," on his computer.
KOVAC: He did?
He also said, "I'm okay," after that.
I don't think that he understood.
LOCKHART: He was alert
and looking at me the entire time. He understood.
I really don't think that this
is what he wants.
Fran has a durable power of attorney.
Thank you. It's your call.
You know, with all due respect,
I'm sorry, but...
Nate expressed
his wishes, and I think we have to go with that.
Well, if there's a chance that he asked for the procedure...
I'm not sure that he did.
I think we have to do it.
Dr. Kovac...
Ray, I need you next door to help me with a central line.
Let's go.
I'd like to page Dr. Ames.
I'll try to find him.
And call Dubenko to put in the trash
and RT to set up a vent.
Between the first and second tracheal rings. Dr. Lennox,
close your eyes if you're having any pain.
Doesn't look like he's feeling anything.
Aspirate air, confirm you're in. Guidewire.
So you're in surgery now, Neela?
I'm just doing an elective.
Well, things change, right?
Certainly do.
11 French dilator.
Balloon's good to go.
I hope he's okay with this.
Mm.
Doesn't want to pass.
A little more muscle.
( soft gasps )
You doing all right, Nate?
DUBENKO: Okay, remove the dilator.
Slide the trake tube in.
Mm.
Bit of oozing here.
Direct pressure should take care of that.
Little bit of bleeding can be normal.
Tachy at 130.
I'll open up his fluids.
Is he okay? Um, he could be sensitive to the blood loss.
Let's take another look.
Oh, my God. Pressure again.
Ten blade. What are you doing?
Converting to an open procedure. We need deep hemostasis.
Two units of packed cells.
A blood transfusion? It's just a precaution.
Call for type specific.
And, Sam, can you see if his antibody screen is in the old chart?
Okay, Abby, grab a Yankauer.
What is happening? It's just a minor complication.
It doesn't look minor. ABBY: Suction on high.
I never should've let you do this. Mosquito clamp.
Antibody screen's negative.
He looks like he's in pain-- you guys might
need to give him some pain medication.
Four of morphine.
No. No morphine.
Yeah, don't give him morphine, he had a bad reaction
in 2001 when he came in with a broken wrist.
But the transgene will be suppressed.
We'll use two fluorescent reporters with different spectra.
Why two? One for transfected cells
and one for translational fusion
with the target gene.
That's brilliant. Well, it's simple. I don't know if it's...
( groaning ): Oh... ow!
Four morphine.
Get back to work on the plasmid DNA vectors. Right now?
I don't want Gregorio beating us to the Nobel Prize.
KOVAC: Right.
You know that you're not supposed to take the stairs.
They were servicing one of the elevators.
So you wait for the next one. We were late, Fran.
All right. Listen, I... I've canceled your morning classes.
Don't be ridiculous. Why would you do that?
I couldn't get ahold of Baker, and he's the only one...
Baker doesn't... Uh, what did he say?
Uh, he thinks it's time to start using a wheelchair.
You've got to be kidding.
The weakness in your legs is progressing to the point
that it's not safe. Next time you could break your hip.
They have power wheelchairs,
motorized scooters.
You-you'll still be very independent.
Until my battery goes dead.
You won't be losing something,
you will be conserving energy so you can do more things.
You're trying to turn me into an invalid.
People with degenerative diseases
do best when... when they have...
What?
Hope?
Do you read the paper?
Bush just banned federal funding
for embryonic stem cell research.
I am trying to hold on to hope, Doctor...
but nobody's cooperating these days.
Well, Dr. Ames has some papers
on mobility assist devices for...
I don't want 'em.
I'll-I'll go pick them up. Thank you. Not for me.
Not for me.
( sighs )
( groans ): Ow!
So Fran drives you to all your doctor visits.
Mostly she just drives me crazy.
Ow, wow...
How long have you been together?
We're not together.
She works for me.
Oh. Yeah.
For some time now?
15 years.
She was right out of college.
I needed an assistant who was on the ball.
She was ridiculously overqualified.
Only thing that really surprised me
is that she stayed after that first year.
She could've gone to law school,
to business school...
I have to say, she stuck with me.
She knows you pretty well.
I think that's why I assumed...
you guys were... No, no. No, no, no. ( chuckles )
There was a point...
a million years ago...
when it almost happened.
But then I came to my senses.
You married?
Then you understand.
Who has time for family when you're devoted to your work?
Well, some people try for a balance.
Maybe if you're an E.R. doc.
But if you're trying
to push back the frontiers of science,
it's 24/7.
Right.
It's not bad to be married to your career.
My career is a good companion.
Never nags me.
Whoa.
( gagging ) You okay?
( loud groan )
Side effect of the morphine.
That's good to know.
This will make you feel better.
Two of versed.
That should settle him down. Sats are only 89.
Maybe we've done enough. We need to find the source of the bleeding.
And what if you can't? We may have to split open his chest,
but we'll find it. Damn it!
It's a detour, Fran-- we can get back on track.
You don't know that. If you'd like,
I can take you out to the family room.
No! Okay.
Stay there and hold his hand and talk with him.
Vascular clamp and pickups. Frazier tip suction.
Nate, I am so sorry. Careful, careful.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Right there.
( groans )
Deep to the manubrium.
I think you've got it.
My, oh, my. What?
We poked through the left innominate vein.
I've never seen anything like that.
RASGOTRA: Very unusual anatomy.
Well, when they made Nate, they broke the mold.
Sats are coming up, B.P. 120/75.
Okay, we're out of the woods. Good.
Trake's in, vent tubing.
Four-oh prolene.
You gave us a little scare there.
Let me help you. You're not gonna be needing this anymore.
Nate.
RASGOTRA: Dr. Lennox, open your eyes.
Could just be because of the sedative.
Um, there might be some damage.
RASGOTRA: The blood loss may have deprived the brain
of oxygen.
Pass the tubing all the way...
and cover the suction port with your thumb.
( wheezing, coughing ) Then pull out slowly.
It's making him cough.
That's good-- it'll help clear the secretions.
That's all there is to it.
How often?
Uh, maybe two, three times a day.
More if he sounds junky.
We're gonna get you some help at home.
I don't think so. ( chuckles )
You know how many caregivers he's made me get rid of?
It's just easier if I do it myself.
Sometimes you need a break. Well, I'm fine.
Uh, I've cut back to 12 hours a day,
and we have night aides now.
I mean, if there's a problem, they still come and wake me up.
It's hard for me to see someone not giving him the best care, so...
Nate.
Hey, Nate.
Okay, you let us know when you're ready to talk.
Can I take him home?
In a couple of days.
How about tonight?
I think that after everything
he's been through,
we should probably keep an eye on him.
I know, but I promised him
that I would keep him at home.
It's what he wants.
Well, he'll do better in the hospital. Yeah.
But I promised him.
How long have you been with him?
Oh, 21 years. ( laughs )
It's hard for me to believe sometimes.
It started out as just a job, you know, but, um...
after a while...
There was this one time I traveled with him to Boston.
It was, uh, September of '99.
It's beautiful there in the fall.
He was giving a paper at a molecular biology symposium.
I was still prepping his slides and his handouts
five minutes before the talk.
We worked so hard, he added a couple of days to the trip.
We went up to Cape Cod.
The hotel was right on the beach, and, uh...
( crying softly )
He took me sailing.
It was one of those times in life where you think
everything is just falling into place.
( sniffles )
Couple of weeks later he got the diagnosis.
Oh, one more thing-- I saw the neurologist today. Everything okay?
All the blood tests are normal. Oh, good.
No peri-ventricular lesions on the MRI, so it's not MS.
Great! Although I was kind of hoping for MS.
What? The EMG showed denervation
of the muscles of the right hand.
I have motor neuron disease, Fran.
I have ALS.
Oh, my God. The average life expectancy
is four years, but five percent of patients progress
and then plateau.
There's some guy in his 60s
who's still playing golf 40 years into the disease.
They're starting me on a new drug called Riluzole.
It's very promising
at slowing the progression of the degeneration.
There are going to be some challenges.
But I'm very hopeful about all the new research,
and they're setting me up
with a multi-disciplinary support team,
physical and occupational therapist, nutritionist,
speech pathologist, respiratory therapists.
I could help, too.
Well, I'm still going to need an assistant, Fran.
Obviously, of course. Now more than ever.
That's not what I meant.
I have to put all my energy into fighting this disease.
He didn't want to start something
only to have it taken away.
He was, um, he was afraid it would be too painful.
For you or for him?
For both of us.
COMPUTER: Hello.
Hey. Good to see you're back.
My neck.
They did a trake.
LOCKHART: To treat your pneumonia.
Really?
Yes, your oxygen levels are up,
your title volume's improved, you're more alert.
I'll never wear a turtleneck again.
You still want an ICU bed?
Uh, no.
I'll get a tele bed. Thank you.
We're admitting you
for antibiotics and respiratory therapy.
No trake.
I thought you would've wanted this.
Appreciate it.
It saved your life, Nate.
I understand.
Um, you know, you can live for a long time with this.
My facial muscles are getting weaker.
Once I lose my eye movements, I'll be locked in.
I'll be seeing, hearing, and feeling my surroundings
but I'll be unable to communicate my needs and wishes.
I don't want to get to that point.
Well, this infection that you have is a temporary setback.
Once you rid of that,
you're going to be right back to where you were.
I'm going downhill.
Well, maybe more slowly
with good oxygenation and ventilation.
Had enough.
No, you know what, in a couple of days
you're going to have a lot more energy...
He's made up his mind.
Take out trake.
I can't.
Fine. Then home.
Poker.
He wants me to invite some of his friends over for poker.
His friends can visit him in the hospital.
Beer.
We've got beer.
Well, you're in no condition to go home, Nate.
I'm not comfortable with this.
I am.
Why don't we wait in the lobby?
No. Outside.
I'm not sure that the van is here yet.
Fresh air.
You know, it's cold out there.
Oh, no. I might catch pneumonia.
Well, I'm sending a respiratory therapist home to assist you.
Don't bother.
You know, it's to help Fran.
Tonight, we turn off the vent.
Go to sleep, won't wake up.
Fran...
I got those papers for you to sign.
I'll be quick.
I know the way out.
Well, it's hospital policy.
Somebody has to accompany you to the van.
You forgot your coat.
You have a treatable condition.
I'm just asking for two days in the hospital.
Two days.
Can't. Why not?
I don't want to be a soul trapped in a corpse.
Well, you're not there yet.
Close.
Wait. Just wait a minute.
Wait, wait.
What happened to fighting this disease?
Too tired.
Well, once we treat the pneumonia
you're going to feel better.
You can even plateau-- look at Stephen Hawking,
he's had this disease for 40 years.
I'm not Stephen Hawking.
You're still advising students, writing books.
You published the lead article in Cel two months ago.
Just please wait. Wait.
If you recover from this,
you could hang on until there's a cure.
If I don't recover?
Then I'll be there...
to make sure you're comfortable,
take you off the vent and let you go.
I bet you ten bucks you can get through this.
Ten bucks?
All you have to do is go back into the hospital.
I'm impressed.
You've become a pretty persuasive doctor.
I'm not so sure I'd be here if it weren't for you.
NATE: The air you breathe,
all the food you eat,
it all leads to the production of one incredible molecule.
ATP-- adenosine triphosphatase--
the end result of oxidative phosphorylation.
This is the force of life.
7,300 kilocalories per mole.
Pure unadulterated energy.
What are you doing right now?
You're taking notes, uh, crossing your legs,
coughing, digesting your food, listening to your voice mail
while the professor is lecturing.
Every action of the human body,
every single thing it means to be alive, is powered by ATP.
How much do you weigh?
155. Stand up.
Stand up.
Every day, the human body uses 180 pounds of ATP.
Yes, yes. More than you weigh.
And yet... and yet, this body only has half a pound of ATP.
What's going on?
You recycle it?
Yes. Yes, you do.
Thank you.
Bravo. Thank you. A-plus.
You recycle it.
Otherwise, you would burn off your ATP
in five minutes.
The human body recycles it 300 times a day.
If you were a car,
you would get 150,000 miles to the tank.
Now, electron transport jams protons
into the inter-membrane space of the mitochondria.
ATP synthase is, in fact, a rotary engine.
The flow of protons spins the shaft.
That sucks in ADP and blows out fresh ATP,
filled with the energy it takes to fuel the human body,
the human mind and, yes, yes, the human spirit.
Okay, we're done. Thank you very much.
Tomorrow... thank you. ( applause )
Tomorrow, chapter 19, Lehninger.
Electron transport in detail. Thank you.
Thank you.
Dr. Lennox...
Yeah. Do you have a minute?
And you are...?
Abby Lockhart. I'm a first year.
Uh-huh.
Um, I need your signature to drop this class.
You want to quit Biochemistry?
Well, I failed the midterm, and I'm not feeling
very optimistic about the final, so...
It's a required course.
Well, maybe I'll try again next year.
Tough to do, second year curriculum is pretty busy.
I'm thinking about maybe taking a year off
to just reconsider my options.
Wow, I'm surprised.
So, you don't want to be a doctor?
I-I... I'm trying.
I just... it's a lot.
With biochemistry and physiology,
and microbiology, anatomy.
It's just a lot, a lot to memorize.
Ah, there's your problem.
Rote memorization
is the path to failure.
Um...
You like sports?
Ice skate? Not really, no.
You dance? Everybody likes to dance.
I took ballet when I was a kid, yes.
Did you like it?
Yes.
I was the Sugarplum Fairy in The Nutcracker,
third from the left.
Excellent.
Do you want to learn?
Stop memorizing and think conceptually.
Biochemistry is the dance of life.
Ballet is its central dogma.
Adenine holds hands with thymine, cytosine with guanine.
When they let go,
a line of gypsy dancers breaks free
to look for new partners,
and messenger RNA is created.
Ooh. Sorry. Oh, sorry.
I'm not usually so clumsy.
See?
Um, yeah. Can you sign my form?
My office hours begin at 1:00 p.m. on Tuesdays.
Show up.
You're going to tutor me?
Think of it as dance lessons.
After three weeks, I guarantee
that you will pass your makeup midterm with flying colors.
In fact, I will bet you ten bucks.
That's a very generous offer. I just...
I-I just don't... I think...
I know that you can do this.
I wish I had your confidence.
You will. Don't give up.
If nothing else, I will teach you how to fight.
See you Tuesday.
Thank you.
