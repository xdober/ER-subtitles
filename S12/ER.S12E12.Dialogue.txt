Previously on ER:
You ever come near my daughter again,
and I'll kill ya.
When I said we can't
see each other anymore,
I really meant... I know. I know.
But just because my dad's a jerk,
doesn't mean we can't keep it going.
I got my ass kicked once.
NEELA: Michael and I love each other.
We want to be together.
Anyway, his tour's over.
What if he gets stationed in, like, Romania?
He's hoping to finish his training
in stateside Army hospital.
I need a few weeks off. Why?
My band got a recording deal.
Resignation accepted.
What?
Kind of decided
the band's got to make some changes.
I want us to have this baby.
Our ice fishermen are on NEBS
waiting for a respiratory therapist,
the morgue picked up the nun
and our puking party boy went home
with a liter of saline, a Compazine suppository
and two very angry parents.
Uh, what about the post-op cellulitis?
Surgical floor.
Lucian was feeling generous.
She threatened to hurt me.
You see that?
Overnight shift has no pass-ons.
Gold stars all around.
Well, we also have no attending
for the day shift,
Clemente hasn't shown up yet
and can't be reached.
Once again, that's a problem
for the Chief of the ER,
and once again, that's you.
Uh, you can't cover until he shows up?
No, I can't.
I've got physical therapy upstairs,
and I'm supposed to stay off my feet until then.
And after that, I am out of here.
I can stay for a few minutes,
if you have to leave.
There you go. Thank you.
Hey, Barnett...
what the hell you doing here?
Uh, working.
You quit.
No, I didn't.
Yes, you did. Don't you remember?
You came to me, and you gave me an ultimatum,
said you needed time off to cut your album or you'd quit.
( laughs )
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Your band, Skunk Hollow.
Oh... I'm sorry, but I'm not in a band.
I swear.
Look, Dr. Weaver, you were pretty doped up
the last time we talked, maybe you were
just tripping a little bit, you know?
I don't trip.
Well, if you say so.
Is she coming?
No.
But she is watching me, isn't she?
Oh, yeah.
Now?
Yeah.
Eh, wait. Now. Now she's going.
Well, congratulations, Dr. Rasgotra.
You must have impressed Albright.
How so.
I mean, you've been accepted
into the Surgical Elective.
Really? Oh, yeah.
Oh, my God, thank you.
Thank you very much. Yeah.
I just hope you feel the same way in three weeks.
in three weeks.
Well, I'll certainly try.
I'm going to go and find Michael.
So, you and Mikey going to get your own place now?
"Michael." And don't worry, we'll be out of your hair soon enough.
We're looking for a place this afternoon.
Dr. Barnett, do you know a girl named Zoe Butler?
No.
Maybe.
Yeah, well, maybe she's here looking for you.
Exam Two.
I...
Zoe, what are you doing?
I told you not to come here.
You know I can't see you as a doctor or as anything else.
Ow, ow.
Ooh, sorry.
You're going to have some bruising,
but at least your eye socket isn't fractured.
Arm films are back.
Oh. Thanks, Inez.
We're going to clean up the cuts on your face,
and then I'm going to stitch you up, okay?
Will I have scars?
There may be some discoloration,
but it should all fade with time.
So, it looks like he broke your ulna,
which is the bone right in here.
We like to call this a "nightstick fracture."
We often see it in people
who try to protect themselves, so...
So do you want to tell me what really happened?
I told you: I fell.
I was running to catch the bus, I tripped on the curb...
It's true.
Okay.
Okay, I'll call your father and let him know you're here.
Wait, Ray...
What?
Don't call him.
Why not?
You got to talk to me, Zoe.
He's the one who did this.
Yo, Dr. M, got your breakfast and your threads.
Oh, thanks, dude.
Did they get the chocolate sauce out of the tux shirt?
I don't know, but here are the magazines you asked for.
What the hell you think you're doing? You talking to me?
I'm talking to the both of you: You know you're here
to work as a volunteer in this hospital, not be
his personal assistant. Well, I was just going...
You were just about to give me some lame-ass excuse,
and I don't want to hear it.
Now get your butt over to the admin desk
and check in with Jerry.
He's a good kid.
Want a bagel?
Look, man, stop using him
as your own personal valet--
buying your lunch and your dirty magazines.
Hey, take this.
And could you just pick these up
and put everything in the doctor's lounge for me.
Thank you, buddy.
Greg, wait up!
Wait up. I need some advice.
Stop smoking dope, slow down on the porn.
Serious.
I am serious.
No, I got a date.
Her name is Tamara. I met her online.
No, it's not like that.
She's smart, beautiful, funny, black--
sorry, African-American--
but I've never dated a sister before.
Please don't say that.
What? Sister?
Dr. Pratt, were you looking for me?
Yeah, Penny. Take it easy. Relax.
I just heard a good teaching case came in, that's all.
Come on. Let's go.
Well, are you going to help me out or not?
( gasping ) You need professional help.
You sure you're going to be all right?
We got in this fight a few days ago.
He hit me, so I took off.
I was staying at my friend Laura's house,
and... he was waiting for me outside my school,
and he made me come back home.
Then he did this.
It's not the first time.
Is there anyone else I can call,
like an aunt or an uncle or something?
No.
Well, what about your sister?
Jen lives in San Francisco.
My dad doesn't know about it though.
I swore I'd never tell him where she is.
He beat her so bad, one time, she missed her midterms.
Ow.
( sighs )
I think there's something really wrong with him.
Like he can't help himself.
He's not going to be beating anyone else up
once the cops get through with him.
Oh, no, no. You can't call the police.
I came here because I knew you wouldn't.
He assaulted you, Zoe.
I have to call them.
No, you don't.
It just makes it worse.
I called them once and they didn't arrest him.
It just made him madder.
Trust me.
They'll arrest him this time.
Well, then what?
What happens when he gets out?
He'll come looking for me.
Zoe...
Can I move in with you?
I have nowhere else to go.
We got an open fracture in Four,
some sort of parasitic infection in One,
and a foreign body inhalation--
looks like a roach clip,
according to one of the nurses.
I'm a little busy here.
Yeah, and we're a lot backed up out there.
And it's only going to get worse unless you start
signing off on these and a half dozen other discharges
waiting for your John Hancock.
All right, I'll be there in a minute.
Okay.
No.
Urine looks like pea soup.
Bingo. Send off a culture.
Thought you had a good one for Penny.
Urosepsis.
What's the antibiotic of choice?
Levaquin. Ceftriaxone.
Okay, fine.
In vitro, Ceftriaxone might give you
a slightly better gram-negative coverage.
SAM: I'll mix up a gram.
PRATT: Ma'am, how you doing?
Ma'am?
She had a subarachnoid three years ago.
So this is her baseline?
Yep.
Penny, what do you know about early
goal-directed therapy of sepsis?
It attempts to balance
oxygen delivery with oxygen demand.
And decreases mortality
through a multi- pronged approach.
She doesn't seem like a candidate
for aggressive therapy.
Well, we need to review her chart.
Let's talk to her primary physician.
Penny, if we were to pursue
goal-directed therapy, where would we start?
Get her BP up. Right.
That's the tip of the iceberg.
We want MAP above 65, the CVP over ten,
urine output over five cc an hour,
O2 sat above 93, the crit above 30,
and, most importantly, the SVC 02 above 70.
You'll need a center line for that. Right.
With a special oxygen-sensing tip.
PRATT: Okay, hold up.
She could be a DNR for all we know.
I mean, look at her. Well...
W-What are you suggesting, Dr. Pratt?
I'm suggesting that we treat her conservatively.
We give her a couple liters of saline,
antibiotics, oxygen, and see how she does.
Well, okay, fine.
And dopamine for pressure support.
Come on, dopamine?
Yes, dopamine. Low dose.
Okay... I'm going to see if I can pull an old chart.
You don't have to stay here for this.
Does that go for me, too?
Are you awake?
Barely.
I can't sleep.
Difficult to sleep when you talk.
I keep thinking about stuff.
So stop thinking about stuff.
Don't you want to know what I'm thinking about?
( sighs )
Hmm?
Uh-huh, yeah.
I'm thinking about what everybody's going to say
when they find out.
I think they'll be happy for you.
Us. Mm-hmm.
But still, I don't think we should tell anybody for...
for a couple of weeks.
Uh...
I might have mentioned something to my father.
You might have mentioned something to your father?
He's in Croatia, who's he going to tell?
Did you mention something to your mother?
Oh, God, no.
I need to build up to that one.
I'd like to wait until at least he's in high school.
"He?"
Or she.
Except I gotta think I'd be better with a boy,
because the mother-daughter dynamic
really just scares the hell out of me.
We're going to have a baby.
I know.
It's so crazy.
( laughs softly )
Where are you going? I can't sleep.
Well, you should sleep, you need your rest.
I'm too wired.
And I want something to eat.
Again?
Just something little, like a Pop-Tart.
No, no more Pop-Tarts.
I'll-I'll get you something.
I'll make you some breakfast or something.
Okay, I'm coming, I'm coming.
SAM: Sats 91 on five liters.
Change her to 100% non re-breather.
At what point would you intubate? Never.
Where's Clemente? A good question.
Hasn't shown up yet.
Okay, who's the attending?
You're looking at him.
What? What do you want?
I've got a battered teen
who doesn't want me to call the cops
on her abusive father.
Okay, well, uh...
Call Social Work.
Nah, I don't think that's a good idea, either.
Reporting is mandatory.
Dr. Dubenko, migraine mom is banging
her head against the wall,
the Alzheimer lady is missing,
and there's a homeless guy in triage
who just puked up something that looks like a human finger.
And her husband is here.
Okay, okay. I'll be there in a minute.
Could somebody locate Clemente?
I'll page him.
Mr. Venema, I'm Dr. Dubenko.
I've been treating your wife.
How is she doing?
Not so good.
How long has she been like this?
Almost three years now.
We were on the Amalfi Coast in Italy,
she got a bad headache.
I thought it was too much wine.
Time we found a hospital... ( clears throat )
she couldn't talk and she couldn't move.
She bled into her brain from an aneurysm.
A subarachnoid hemorrhage. Yeah, well...
I thought when we got her to the hospital
she'd be all right, but she never woke up.
Does she ever open her eyes and look at you?
No, not really but, uh, she knows I'm here.
It's a shame, too.
Beautiful blue eyes.
That's what got me the first time.
She caught me staring at her in math class.
You've known each other a long time.
Yeah.
Well, we started dating in '49,
and our 52nd wedding anniversary coming up in March.
Wow. Congratulations.
I know she's sick, but I'm not ready to lose her.
No, uh...
I-I understand, Mr. Venema.
We'll do everything we can.
Thank you.
Any word on Clemente?
SAM: Dude's a no-show.
Um... okay.
Set me up with a cordis introducer, an art line,
and type and cross for four units.
Excuse me? Set me up with a cordis...
No, no, no, I heard the orders,
just... are you sure you want to do that?
We're pursuing early goal- directed therapy for sepsis.
You ever put in a subclavian line?
No, but I'd like to learn. Great.
Prep the collarbone, we'll do it together. Number eight gloves.
Maybe you should run it by Pratt first.
Generally, attendings don't run things by the residents.
Well, generally, you're not the ER attending.
Okay.
You need to identify the junction
of the median and middle third of the clavicle.
What's up? How's her pressure?
What the hell are you doing?
Subclavian line.
Call the ICU for an SCV O2 catheter.
I thought we agreed not to do
any invasive procedures.
That's her husband out there.
All right. Look.
I know you're a surgeon, and you guys like
to cut and paste everything back together again.
But, sometimes, the best thing for the patient
is not what we do but what we don't do.
You know, she's not a DNR--
he wants everything.
Did you explain to him that she's never going to get better? Hmm?
Did you explain to him that she has no quality of life,
and that this bacterial infection
may be Mother Nature's way of saying it's time to let go?
( sighs )
Did he use anything to hit you with?
Just his fists.
Did he at any point threaten to kill you?
Uh... maybe. I don't really remember.
Okay, I'm going to take a couple Polaroids
of your injuries, okay?
Okay.
Hi, I'm Liz.
I'm with the hospital's Social Services department.
I didn't call you.
Dr. Dubenko said you needed a hand.
Okay, Dr. Dubenko is a surgical attending
who belongs in the O.R.
I'll be right back.
Her boyfriend do that? Father.
Sexual? No.
Look, I've got this covered for now.
She have other family? I'm working on it.
If you can't find anyone, I'll have to place her in a group home.
What?! They're nightmares.
Just until foster custody can be secured.
Well, what's to stop him from finding her there?
She's a minor, she has to go somewhere.
Like I said, I'm working on it, okay?
Work fast, I'm not leaving today
until she's placed somewhere.
I sent a squad car to his office.
I'll let you know once we got him.
Great. Thanks.
Where have you been?
( sighs )
Well, lets see,
I watched the Weather Channel, sorted through the mail,
cleaned some dishes, refilled the ice cube trays.
You're lucky I'm in such a good mood.
And why's that?
I got the surgical elective.
Are you kidding?
Wow. Congratulations.
My wife, the surgeon.
And you start back here next week as the new R2.
Get out.
Weaver told me this morning.
I say we go to Ritz and go and celebrate
with mimosas and lobster eggs benedict.
You know, I'll do you one better.
How about we go out for dinner to celebrate tonight,
and you go home and get some sleep.
You know we're supposed to go look
at that apartment this afternoon.
I'm not tired.
Of course you're not.
Listen, I promised a buddy of mine, Rogan,
that I would stop by, visit him at the hospital.
He'll be disappointed if I blow him off.
Well, then don't.
We can run up and see him before we leave.
No, he's at the VA hospital.
He just got transferred from Walter Reed,
and I haven't seen him since I left Iraq.
Okay, fine. Well, I'll go with you.
I want to meet your friend.
And then you and I are going to go and celebrate.
Okay.
I cant believe you put in
a central line and an art line.
Don't look at me. Or me.
I am just trying to give her
the best chance of recovery.
Did you read her chart?
What's her condition, Dr. Pratt?
Chronic vegetative state
with no chance of meaningful recovery.
Well, she cant go to the medicine floor
with an art line.
So, pull it.
Do it, Dr. Pratt.
Iris scissors. Wait.
I said pull it.
I said wait.
She's not going upstairs, Dubenko.
We have limited resources in the ICU.
We treat the sickest patients who have a chance for recovery.
We don't flog people who are going to die.
I never have enough beds as it is.
All right, all right, fine-- I'll do it.
Dr. Pratt...
Cops brought in some guy who's asking for you.
All right.
( indistinct dispatch over police radio )
Yo, Greg!
Darnell, what are you doing here, man?
They said I ran a red, but it was yellow.
He almost ran over a traffic cop,
and he smells like a brewery.
I told you, a bag of groceries fell off the front seat
and some beer bottles broke.
I can't get the smell out of my floor mats.
I need you to draw a blood alcohol
for a suspected DUI.
DUI? Come... Would you talk to him?
Look, I can vouch for this guy.
That's great, but I don't need you to vouch for him,
I need you to draw a BA.
DISPATCHER ( over radio ): 7-8-5-1, a family dispute...
Yo, is KJ around?
I can't let him see me like this.
Should've thought about that before you started
drinking and driving-- what's the matter with you?
I only had two beers, I swear to God.
But what if I don't pass this, man?
They'll bust me, I'll lose my license,
I'll lose my job.
You got to help me, Greg.
I've been trying damn hard.
For me, for KJ.
( sighs )
Inez...
I need you to take Darnell and Officer, uh... Hollis.
Hollis to the suture room for a blood draw.
Sure. This way.
( sighs )
Morris...
You seen KJ around?
What is that, like a trick question
to see if I have him washing my car?
Which was one time only, okay?
And its not like he detailed it or anything,
it was just a little hand wash, hand wax.
What, like you're going to take a Porsche
through a machine service?
I still gotta talk to you about my date!
What's that?
It's a list of things I need to do before the baby comes.
Oh, a big list.
Well, there's a lot of stuff to do.
I mean, there's a ton of things to get.
A baby monitor?
Yeah. That's so that you can hear the baby
when you're not in the same room.
I know what it is. This apartment isn't that big.
If that baby is awake, you'll know it.
Maybe it's not for this apartment.
Well, I mean, yours is even smaller.
Sorry, but it is.
How's your breakfast? Would you like some...
You know, thank God the human species has
a nine-month gestation period.
Can you imagine if we were rats,
and I was going to pump this thing out in, like, six weeks?
Isn't that scary?
No.
But you're scaring me.
Really?
No, no. Come on, don't you dare.
Don't I dare? Are you daring me?
Wh-What is with you?
I don't know! I don't know.
It's like a... a hormonal surge.
I can't sleep, I can't stop eating, I...
Maybe I'm nesting?
Do you think I'm...
No... I just think I need to get ready.
We still have plenty of time.
Yes, I know, you say that, but it's going to go fast,
so I think I don't want to jinx anything,
but maybe we should just look at some things.
I mean, not to buy,
but to do some comparison shopping
for later. You want to go shopping?
I want to go looking. For baby monitors?
Yes-- monitors, cribs, car seats...
maybe a little mobile of famous Croatian diplomats.
It's a joke.
Stat D five... half at 125 an hour.
You took out her tubes.
Yes.
That's a good sign.
Um, we pulled out the invasive monitoring lines
because she's not going to the Intensive Care Unit.
Oh, she's getting better.
The medicine must have...
No, no... she's not getting better.
So why did you unhook her? I don't understand.
If she's not getting better...
The hospital has limited resources
for our sickest patients.
Resources.
Beds, doctors, nurses...
You're talking about money.
It can cost up to $20,000 a day
to keep a patient in the ICU.
The most difficult decision we make
as doctors is deciding who will benefit
from critical care and who will not.
Oh, and you've decided my wife won't.
No, we will continue to care for your wife...
But she's not worth $20,000 a day.
She'll be admitted and given antibiotics.
Even though she needs a lot more than that.
We will... provide your wife
with the care that's best for her.
But not the best care.
Hey, Doc.
Are you playing me here?
What?
Are you stalling so your buddy's B.A.
drops low enough to squeeze by.
Because I can demand another doctor.
Hell, I can get a nurse to do this.
No, no, its nothing like that, all right?
Like I told you, I know this guy.
Yeah, yeah, we've established that.
Okay, look, his son works here as a volunteer.
He's a good kid trying to make something of himself.
I mean, how many teenage boys you know
volunteer at the hospital?
I just don't want him seeing his father like this.
Just give me a few minutes to get rid of him.
Then I'll do the blood draw myself, okay?
You got five minutes before I grab a nurse.
All right, deal.
All right.
All right, let's do this.
Hey, thanks for waiting, man.
Really appreciate it.
( sighs )
Did you see KJ?
Yeah, I sent him on a run.
All right, man, you're going to feel a little stick here.
You need to initial the vial.
Oh, could you hand me my pen?
Thanks.
There you go.
All right.
GALLANT: I think
you're going to like Rogan.
He's a crazy dude from Chicago.
Talks a mile a minute.
Knows more dirty jokes
than anybody I've ever met.
What happened to him?
Roadside bomb... took some shrapnel.
He was one of our supply truck drivers,
although he'd tell the female nurses
that he was a terrain transport pilot.
And what did you tell the nurses?
I told them I had a girl back at home.
Good answer.
So where's the party, man?
Mike... I figured
you'd have a nurse on each knee by now.
What, you losing your touch?
This is, uh, my wife, Neela.
Hello.
I got married.
Can you believe it?
We did it in a day.
They won't let me go back.
You're a doctor.
Can you talk to them, Mike?
Can you tell them
I need to go back.
I need you to help me.
Yeah, man, what... whatever you need.
Whatever you need.
Okay, we have Jell-O, yogurt, soup,
French fries,
and ice cream. Wow.
Looks like it comes from the bottom
of the healthy food pyramid.
More like the basement.
Uh, I'll stick with ice cream.
Okay.
Now, I got you vanilla
'cause the chocolate dispenser is broken, so...
That's okay. Chocolate gives me zits.
Yeah... it used to be French fries for me.
Listen, Zoe, um... your father's not at work
and the police are out looking for him.
So, are you in touch with your sister?
Um, we send e-mails
and I call her from Donna's house sometimes.
Okay, do you think you could stay with her?
I have no way of getting out there.
Let me deal with that.
Let's call Jen
and ask her if you can live with her, okay?
You probably wish you never met me, right?
No.
Although it would've been easier
if I'd met you four or five years from now.
So, crib, cradle, changing table...
Do you really need a special table
for changing a baby?
Why can't we change him in the crib?
What?
Stroller... we need two car seats.
Two?
Yes, one for your car, one for my car.
Oh, right.
Oh. right.
We need two of everything.
We need a crib for your place
and a crib for my place,
and a changing table for your place...
I can still... I can still change him in a crib.
Yeah, and what if she pees while you're changing her
and soaks the mattress?
Okay, so, if we have twins,
we're going to need to have four of everything?
I'm not having twins.
Uh, identical twins run in my family.
Are you kidding me?
What? I mean, chances are really small.
If your mutant Croatian seed causes me to have twins...
Look at it from the sunny side.
If we have a custody fight,
each one of us is gonna take a kid.
Identical twins.
Hey... exactly the same.
Got it. Yeah.
Morris needs help with an L.P.,
disimpactions still waiting in Curtain Three,
and I swear the kid in Curtain Two looks like measles.
My dislocated shoulder is still in the hallway
looking for love... Okay, wait, wait, stop, stop, stop.
At the very least,
you have to prioritize these for me
when it's this insane in here.
You're kidding, right?
It's dead in here today.
We haven't had a single trauma.
Dr. Dubenko.
Mr. Venema, what's this?
It's for my wife.
We'll see if Morris can do some of this.
He's not an attending.
No, Mr. Venema, this isn't exactly what I meant.
You said $20,000 a day for the ICU, right?
That's a check for $87,000.
That's all I have. It'll buy my wife
four days, right?
I can't take this.
Why not? It's a cashier's check.
It's not just about the money, Mr. Venema.
We can't put your wife in the ICU.
There are patients who need the ICU more than she does.
What are you saying?
There's not enough money to save my wife?
I'm terribly sorry, Mr. Venema.
I can't take your money and there's nothing more I can do.
I need you to sign off on a diverticular abscess.
What was that all about?
Nothing.
PRATT: So what's the verdict?
His blood alcohol came back negative.
That's what I've been telling you.
I've been doing this a long time.
I'm not usually wrong about these things.
Make sure you pay that ticket.
Thanks, man. I owe you.
You need some help.
You did help me, man. I appreciate it.
It won't happen again, I promise.
I know it won't happen again
because you're going to stop drinking
and get yourself in a program today.
A program?
You need some help, D.
Look, you almost hit a cop.
Hey, I got your truffles.
What are you doing here?
I was in the neighborhood.
Doing what?
I asked him to stop by.
Did you get something while you were out?
Yeah, I stopped by the food court in the Water Tower.
Okay, go check in at the admit desk.
See if they need you to make any lab runs.
And I'll take that.
I'll pick you up after work, okay?
All right.
Look, there's an AA meeting
every night at the community center where Olivia works.
Just go down there, okay?
Promise me. All right, I will.
All right? Yeah. I'll work something out.
All right.
Yo, Pratt, Pratt, Pratt.
Please, man, I need this, okay?
I haven't been with a woman in months.
I'm not giving you any tips on dating black chicks.
I'm not just asking you because you're black.
I m asking you because you're the coolest guy I know.
And you're my friend and...
And what?
It's just not easy for me when it comes to women,
especially once it gets going, because of my condition.
What condition? Stupidity?
No, I have... I have supernumary thelium.
What?
Morris, what...?
Wait, what are you doing, man?
You've got extra nipples.
Yeah, shh.
Red hair, porcelain skin and four nipples.
Do you know what gym class was like for me growing up?
"Hey, nipple boy.
"Here, here, little piggy.
Look, it's the Ugly Suckling."
I heard 'em all.
What, we don't knock?
On a curtain?
What are you guys doing with my patient anyway?
Nothing. Morris was just showing me his extra set of nipples.
Oh, my God, I can't believe
you just violated my doctor-patient privilege.
I'm not your doctor, Morris,
and you sure as hell ain't my patient.
Whoa, look at those.
That is freaky.
You should get them all pierced.
Wear them like chain mail.
Look, guys, I need your help.
I need some money.
How much?
Whatever you got. I'll cover it.
GALLANT: I walk into the supply tent one night, right?
And he's filling an inflatable sex doll with helium.
I look up and there's a bunch of them
already floating on the ceiling.
How or where he got them into the country,
I don't even know.
But in true Rogan fashion, he recruits me
and we let them launch at the first light.
( laughing )
A dozen naked sex dolls
floating off over the desert at dawn.
( laughter continues )
We're supposed to be at the apartment at 3:00.
Hey, man, uh...
Listen, I got to get going, okay?
Okay, Rogan?
I'll swing by in a couple of days.
Why do I have to do this?
Why can't you try it yourself?
Ah... here, turn around.
( laughing )
Just play with your toy.
Can I help you?
Oh, no, we're just looking.
SALESLADY: That's really cute, isn't it?
Yeah.
So, are you looking for a gift or is this for you?
It's for me... us.
We're having a baby...together.
Is this going to be your first?
Yeah.
It's got two bedrooms, two underground parking spaces,
washer-dryer, storage facilities
and there's a workout room in the building.
You don't like it?
How can I not like it?
I haven't even seen it yet.
Are you all right?
Yeah.
If you don't think Rogan's getting the best care possible,
maybe you could arrange
for one of the county neurologists to see him.
( sighs )
Yeah, uh...
It's not Rogan.
It's me.
I want to go back.
To the hospital?
To Iraq.
What?!
You're joking, right?
Michael, I know it's difficult seeing your friends and all
those soldiers like that, but you know going back
is not going to change what happened to them.
No, no, but I can help prevent other guys
from ending up like that... or worse.
Okay, okay, we'll talk about this later,
after you've had time to think about it.
I've already been thinking about it for weeks, Neela.
Without bothering to tell me?
Listen, I left people over there, okay?
People who need me.
Well, I need you.
Not like they do.
Oh, my God, Michael,
I can't believe we're having this conversation.
Mr. and Mrs. Gallant, right?
Yeah.
I'm Dorothy. Come in. Come in.
You're going to love this place.
It's perfect for newlyweds.
I understand your wife is a doctor, Michael.
That's exciting.
What do you do?
I'm, uh, I'm a doctor as well.
In the Army.
The Army! Really.
This place won't last long, so what do you think?
Why don't you kids take your time,
and call me after you've talked it over.
Just close the door behind you when you leave.
Wow, look at these.
If I get this big, I think I'm gonna kill myself.
Women look the most beautiful when they're pregnant.
You're such a liar.
No, I'm serious.
Oh, crap
What?
It's Debbie Dockins from the pharmacy.
Who?
Don't look. If she spots the two of us
in a baby store together, holding bags of stuff,
she's gonna tell everybody.
I don't even know who she is.
She knows who you are. I don't think so.
Oh, Luka, every woman who works in the hospital
knows who you are, trust me.
Okay.
Let's go.
I'm trying these on.
Uh... Her back's bothering her.
How long we going to stay in here?
Just until she leaves.
When will that be?
I don't know. Shh.
Don't "shh" me.
Shh. Don't shh...
Shh.
We're hiding in...
We should stop.
You started this one.
Hey, wait a minute! Hold it. Hold it.
Oh, no, no, no. What are you doing?
It's okay, Mr. Venema. It's okay.
No, it's not. I told you not to do this.
It's okay, Mr. Venema. We're moving her to St. Rafe's.
It's a private hospital.
They've agreed to treat her sepsis.
In the ICU?
Yes. Yes.
They have an excellent reputation
and I've already spoken with the attending there.
Who do I give the check to?
You, d..., They'll bill you.
Really?
How can I thank you?
Enjoy the time you have left with your wife.
You're a good doctor.
And a good man.
Okay, well, you should go,
because they're, they're, they're gonna have
a lot of forms for you to fill out there.
I hope that's homework.
It's not.
You need a ride home?
No, my dad's coming to pick me up.
He said he may be running a little bit late.
He's got some meeting.
Good. Well, you know, it's good that he called
to tell you he's going to be late.
Thanks for helping him out today.
I saw him with the cops.
Whoa, KJ. Wait.
It was a misunderstanding.
Always is.
You look like you need some help from me.
I'm looking for Archie.
Oh, well, what was he brought in for?
No, he works here.
I think he's in charge of everything
Tamara?
Hey. Hi.
I'm sorry. I know I'm way early.
No, no, no, it's, it's okay.
It's nice to finally meet you in person.
Wow. You, you're tall.
But, no, it's cool.
I-I, I like tall.
Oh, I'm sorry. This is, uh, this is my dawg Pratt.
What?
It's Greg.
Nice to meet you, Greg.
So, um, you want to hang out
in the doctors' lounge while I finish up?
Or I-I could take you on a tour of the place.
Oh, a tour would be nice. Great.
Yeah, but, Archie, I mean, what about
your supernumerary thelium?
It sounds serious.
Yeah, I can come back later
if you've got surgery or something.
Uh... no, no, it's...
not a... it's not a patient.
It's, uh...
It's me.
I'm, I'm sorry.
I-I don't want to waste your time.
I should have said something earlier,
but I didn't want to scare you off
and it's always awkward.
What the hell? You know...
I have extra nipples.
Okay? There I said it.
Excuse me?
Yeah. One, two, three, four. There you go.
Really?
I have... six toes on my left foot.
Get out.
Let me see.
You going to show me your nipples?
MORRIS: Oh, I like the way you think.
Okay, you'll need to remove your cast.
Any ER can do that.
Now, there's an electronic ticket
waiting for you at the airport.
It's an Alaskan Airways flight
that leaves at 7:30.
What about my clothes?
Oh, what about my school? Okay, do you have
the keys to your house? Yeah.
Okay, give them to me.
I'll pack up your stuff and send it to your sister.
Now, once you get to San Francisco
you need to contact your school, so they
can transfer your grades and stuff.
But if we do that, won't my dad be able to find me?
Have everything sent to me and I'll forward it.
Now, uh, here's some cash for the cab
and, uh, something to get you started.
Ray, I can't take your money.
Sure you can.
Besides, not all of it's mine.
I convinced some of the richer docs to pitch in.
( crying )
Hey. Hey, hey.
It's gonna be okay.
You're going to live with your sister,
and Frisco is a great city.
Come with me.
Zoe, You know I can't do that.
I'll be 18 in three years.
Yeah. Then you'll have forgotten all about me.
No, I won't.
MAN: Zoe!
Zoe, get in th... Zoe, honey, no, no, no, no, no.
Wait, wait, wait. Get in.
I just want to talk to you. Zoe, I just...
Come on, open... Open the door!
Zoe, I want to talk...!
Zoe! Zoe, wait! Zoe!
She's gone.
I'm going to kill you.
I don't think so.
First one was free, pal.
Now, your daughter's gone and she ain't ever coming back.
If you bother me or her again,
I'm just going to have to use my extensive medical knowledge
to mess you up real bad, you got that?
I thought you joined the Army
so that they'd pay for medical school.
I did. I did.
And you put your time in.
Yes, I put my time in, but there's more to it.
More to what?
Look, Neela, I don't expect you to understand.
Well, then explain it to me, Michael
because I really want to understand this.
You know, something happens over there.
I just...
I had a purpose over there.
My life had some clarity.
I just cannot abandon those guys.
But you can abandon me?
Look...
I understand there's a camaraderie
with those that you serve with
and I respect that, I do.
If you still feel the need
to experience that, you can volunteer
at the VA hospital.
It's not the same thing.
Neela, there is a war going on.
People might like to forget that,
but I can't.
And I can't...
I can't live with myself
if I don't go back.
Well, then, we'll both go.
I'll volunteer with an NGO or something.
Neela, it is too dangerous over there.
Oh, it's too dangerous for me, but it's okay for you?
What a load of crap.
Neela, I am a soldier, remember?
And you're also a husband-- remember that?
You asked me to marry you.
You looked into my eyes
and asked me to be your wife and to share a life together.
We took vows,
Michael, I mean,
what the hell was all that, a whim?
That was not a whim.
I thought I could do this, Neela.
I thought of nothing else
but coming home and making a life with you.
I have tried to make it work,
but I just...
( sighs )
I just can't stay here,
knowing what's going on over there.
Neela, I am sorry.
You...
You know how much that I love you.
You know, if you did...
you wouldn't do this.
And if you loved me, you would understand that I have to.
Well, maybe that's the problem.
I love you, but I still don't know you.
