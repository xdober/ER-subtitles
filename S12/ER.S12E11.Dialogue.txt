Previously on ER:
Your East Coast squeeze is here.
She's kind of a looker
in an interstate off-ramp kind of way.
I'm here now, baby.
( moaning )
Bobby hit me. What?
Broke a rib.
I'm sorry. I didn't know, but you didn't say anything.
Why didn't you go to the police?
He is the police.
A compass?
Seeing as how we always find each other.
Can we talk?
What?
I'm pregnant.
What are you doing?
Christmas was three weeks ago.
I figured it's time to put it away.
Leave it. I like it.
You want to be one of those people
dragging some dead brown tree out into the street
in the middle of April?
I like those people.
They don't give up easy.
I made this for Maggie when I was...
I think, six.
We were living in a motel: the Minnetonka.
Don't you have a search committee meeting this morning?
I could skip it.
We can talk some more.
No, you should go.
I have to be in soon, so...
I guess we haven't figured anything out yet.
Yeah, I really...
don't want to get into it again.
Have you made a decision?
Well, we don't even know what we are to each other.
No one ever knows that.
Oh, come on.
We've been friends for a long time.
Good friends. Yeah.
Been through a lot together.
That doesn't mean we could take care of a child.
It has to be your choice.
I know that.
Ground-level fall in the ambulance bay!
No head trauma, no LOC.
Okay, it's all right. I'm fine.
Complains of right hip pain, can't bear weight.
Would you stop it. I'm just trying
to be professional. It's annoying.
Whose job is to de-ice the entrance?
Just get back to work.
It's only a bruise. I'm fine. You know what?
I'm going to go find you a bed.
No, no, I don't need all that.
Acetaminophen OD-- should I give Mucomyst
before the level's back?
Dr. Weaver, can you look over...
( all talking )
WEAVER: I'm not even on today.
Guys, easy, easy.
Look, she had a nasty little slip on the ice,
so let's give her some space.
Okay?
Thank you.
All right, what?
What, what? What do you want?
I need a few weeks off.
Why?
My band got a recording deal.
We're going to L.A.
Back away from the gurney,
or I will impale you with my crutch.
Kerry...
Back off, Elvis.
Ah! This damn salt ruined my shoes.
Yeah, well, New York's been snow-free all year.
Why don't you go back there?
These are Jimmy Choos.
Timmy who, and why are you wearing his shoes?
Choos and they cost me
about 400 bucks.
A: Number one: you shouldn't be wearing shoes
that cost more than other people's rent,
and B: Number two:
it's January in Chicago. Get some damn boots.
Hey, let me tell you something, Vic.
You're not a morning person.
No, I'm not.
Hey, excuse me.
Can I get some more coffee please,
and some Splenda, about a fistful?
What?
Shut up.
All I'm saying is you're not really prepared
for winter here, are you?
So?
So?
So?
( chuckles )
So, so, so why don't you stay at my place today?
( laughs )
I want to see Michigan Avenue.
All right, fine, just don't buy it, will you?
I can shop if I want to here.
On whose credit card?
( groans )
( chuckles ) You're still worried about Bobby.
I told you
that I severed all ties with him.
Just because you severed all ties with Bobby
doesn't mean he severed all ties with you, okay?
He has no idea where I went.
No, of course not. He has no idea.
Of course, he would never think of you being with me.
He doesn't know where you are.
No, no.
He's a freakin' cop.
How hard you think that is, huh?
What, are you stupid?
How stupid do you have to be?
What?
Give me some money.
What for? For a cab. Give me some money.
Oh, come on. Don't do this.
Don't be ridiculous, okay? Just don't.
Give me the money.
Yeah, I need another 20.
Come on. Don't do this.
And you know what you should think about?
Don't touch me.
You should think about
getting into some meditation classes
or maybe some Pilates or something,
because you, Vic,
are getting very ugly.
And I mean that in the most metaphorical sense, okay?
Come on, don't walk away mad. ( laughs )
What? Now I got to go get myself some boots, you jerk-off.
Oh, come on.
Come back here. Jody?
I'm sorry, I'm having trouble clearing a bed.
You know, this really isn't necessary.
I'm sure I can get to my office.
Oh, you should let me examine you.
All right.
Just treat me like any other patient.
You sure? Yeah. Get me out of the hall.
Neela, let's run the board. I have to take my broken hip lady...
Hey! Not broken.
EMT Ted Cunningham, 23.
Lost his Shiley at the nursing home.
Found him cyanotic, put a 7-O in the neck.
Okay, Pratt, go with them.
WOMAN: He had a lot of mucus.
We tried to suction him, but his trach tube came out
and he turned blue.
You from the home? No, I'm his mother.
Ted, can you open your eyes?
He can't follow commands.
Okay, excuse us.
PRATT: NG tube and a #6 Shiley.
94 and 15 liters. He needs an NG?
You use it as a guide to change the airway.
How long has he been like this?
Two years.
Ever since the night he turned 21.
His friends took him to a bar and made him drink 21 shots.
On the way home, he stepped into traffic
and got clipped by a pickup truck.
You spend your whole life raising a kid right, and then
one... stupid night turns him into this.
LUKA: Where are you?
It's time to open the presents.
Just making sure.
Well, I think you can stop now.
We could find a way to make it work.
If that's what you want.
I don't know what I want.
I am 37 years old.
If not now, when?
You know how I feel about it.
Everything happens for a reason.
It scares me, Luka.
Having it or choosing not to?
Yeah.
PRATT: Pull the NG and bag him.
Abby.
Bag him.
Is he all right?
He should be much better now that he has a new tube.
Thank you.
PRATT: Sats up to 99.
What's Coburn doing here?
Oh. Kovac's got her down on this lady
with ovarian torsion.
Someone seems to have left this.
So... how's married life?
It's very nice, thank you.
We're looking for a place of our own.
That sounds exciting.
The army wants Michael to finish his residency
at a military hospital.
And where's the closest program?
Fort Hood, Texas.
I'm hoping he can end up somewhere not too far away.
Tenderness over the greater trochanter?
Yeah, it's probably just a contusion
from where I hit the ground.
I'm going to check your range of motion.
Ow!
Oh, God.
Pain with internal rotation.
You know. That's happened before.
I just need an ice pack for ten minutes,
and it'll stop.
And something for the pain, perhaps?
Percocet, Vicodin?
No. No, I have too much work to do.
800 of ibuprofen, and call for a hip series.
Well, I'll have to run it past my attending fir...
I'm sorry.
Hey, pull the curtain, please.
How's she doing?
A bit cranky at the moment.
Yeah, well, you'll soften her up for me, right?
What? For my TO request.
What do you need time off for?
Neela, do you know who Barry Ginsberg is?
Gynecologist on fourth floor?
No. No, he's a record producer,
a mogul, an idol-maker.
He took a listen to a couple of tracks
my boys laid down, and, bang, we are going to L.A.,
and we have a gig at the Key Club.
And if all goes well, we get to record a demo
at his studio in Venice.
Italy? California, on the beach.
Congratulations, Ray. That's really awesome.
Here, super-infected foot fungus in Four.
Uh, only thing is I'm going to need a little time off.
How much is a little?
Eh, just a month.
That's not a little.
Hey, can you check out this patient for me?
Amanda Ramsey, 15, presented with vague pain.
I'm sorry, I have to get some ibuprofen
and a hip series for Dr. Weaver.
Please? I'll trade you.
I didn't tell her yet.
Thanks a lot.
Amanda, I'm Dr. Rasgotra.
How much longer do you think it'll be?
'Cause I didn't mean to make a big deal.
I probably just need some Motrin or something.
We ran a test on your urine.
Do I have a bladder infection?
You're pregnant.
Did you know that?
You didn't tell my parents, did you?
They've been told that you were here, but that's all.
Who's the father?
Some guy from school.
Boyfriend?
No.
I can get our adolescent clinic
to come down and talk to you.
No, my parents won't like that.
There are a number of options.
Yeah, I can keep it, or put it up for adoption.
Or you could choose not to have it.
I could never do that.
It'd be against God.
They stabbed me in the heart!
PP Perkins, mugging victim. They stabbed me...
Stab wounds to the chest, arms and abdomen.
His name's PP? I got blood coming out everywhere!
He's only satting 82.
You guys need a hand? No, we're on it.
Chest tube in here. Come on now. Come on, let's move it!
Okay, we're gonna need to remove an ovary, Sara,
but that's why God gave you a spare.
It's gonna be fine. Um, prep her in two.
I should be up in... 15 minutes.
How's it going?
Oh, well, good. She's young,
and the other ovary looks good, so...
Uh, no, I-I meant...
Oh, "How's it going?"
Oh, well, fine. You?
Good.
I just got paged for an ultrasound.
Do you know anything about that?
Uh, no. No.
Um, but I remember hearing
that you started your own practice?
Yeah, yeah.
It's going, uh, very well, you know.
The only problem's the boss.
Ooh, what a bitch.
I'm the boss, Abby.
Right. ( laughs )
( laughs ): Now you're patronizing me.
No. I... um... I just...
I just, uh, might want to come and see you.
I need an OB.
( gasps ): Congratulations.
Wow. I had no idea.
I'll shut up.
Yeah. It wasn't something I expected.
Is it something you want?
I'm not sure
I'm at the right place
in my life for this, so...
So, you don't want to keep it?
Oh, I'm sorry.
Okay. I'm always prepared.
Yeah.
Thanks. ( sniffles )
Listen, um, I've got office hours every afternoon.
Just come by any time.
I can help you, whether it's prenatal care
or termination, whatever you decide.
Thank you.
And whatever you do, Abby-- it's gonna be
the right thing.
Thanks.
( quietly ): Oh, God.
Systolic's only 86.
Almost there. Get the thoraseal.
Okay, a little pressure now.
All right, so who really jacked you, PP?
It was some-some guys I know, man.
Sats coming up.
We was drinking by this fire in this alley.
Right. Must be some real good friends; they avoided
stabbing you in the heart, huh? Hey, Malik,
did somebody call the cops?
Yeah, they're on their way.
Don't call no cops.
I'm sure they're rushing right over right now.
No cops, man. BP's better: 110/75.
No cops? These guys could have killed you.
Yeah, I got problems, yo.
I got problems.
Cops only gonna make it worse.
I feel you, bro. Trust me, I feel you.
Then do me a solid, man.
Anything for you, PP. Anything.
More lube.
It's cold.
Oh, sorry about that.
( sighs ): Dr. Coburn.
I called OB.
AMANDA: Could there have been a mistake with that other test?
COBURN: Mm, I don't think so.
Here. You see this?
That's the heart beating.
( sighs )
It's about seven weeks old, I'd say.
They won't understand.
Your parents?
They'll say I've sinned.
I can help you talk to them if you want.
Can I have a minute?
You were in with a patient, so I thought it was best to just...
Yeah. It would be better if you presented to me first.
Well, either way, I had to call an OB.
She's 15 and scared.
Family on the way in?
They're very religious people.
Call me when they get here.
LOCKHART: How'd you do this?
Tried to hop a bus.
Did you slip on the ice?
I was skitching.
Fell off the fender.
Ah.
Might be easier just to pay the fare.
Do I look like I got surplus income to blow?
Can I get another 3-0 ethilon?
Were you, uh, on your way home?
I haven't been home in a while.
Since, like, May.
Well, your folks must be worried about you.
Yeah, they worry a lot.
Always wanting to know what I'm doing, what I'm up to.
Gets to be a real drag, you know.
Doesn't sound so bad.
I'm an independent spirit, you know?
I want to be on my own.
Do they even know where you are?
No.
Just left one day.
What if I don't know how to love it right?
KOVAC: Abby.
( Kovac sighs )
Maybe I'm not strong enough.
Being a parent makes you stronger.
And it breaks your heart.
You told me that.
That's not what I meant.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean...
No. Don't-Don't use that as a reason.
( exhales )
I'm sorry.
( sniffles )
What if I go shopping and leave it in the supermarket?
Don't worry. I'll do all the shopping.
( exhales heavily )
I'm afraid I'd mess it up, Luka.
( exhales loudly )
We won't.
Okay, um...
keep the wound clean and dry,
come back in a week to have the stitches removed.
That's it?
Yeah.
Unless you want to talk to somebody from social work.
Your daughter's right in here.
Mandy, are you okay?
I'm fine, Mom.
I'll, uh, leave you all to talk.
Could you stay?
Sure.
Mom...
Daddy...
something happened, and, um...
I'm real sorry.
What happened, sweetie?
We ran a test
and did an ultrasound.
Amanda's pregnant.
We're waiting for some blood results.
As soon as they arrive... That's fine.
There are a number of places
we can refer you to for counseling.
We'd like to be alone with our daughter now.
Thank you.
No free fluid on ultrasound,
waiting on surgery to evaluate.
Not anymore, Red. What have you got?
Morning, sunshine.
Who are you?
Clemente. Who are you?
I'm surgery. See the badge?
Oh, yeah.
You must be the bedside manner coach
I heard so much about.
Uh, multiple stab wounds-- stable after the chest tube.
Anything enter the peritoneum?
Uh, not sure. Ultrasound's negative.
Doesn't answer my question.
Hey, I got the cops out here.
Relax, relax.
I got your back.
If you can get a smile out of surgery here,
I'll pay for the date.
You're right on the cusp of sexual harassment, Clemente.
The cusp.
That would be a new position for me.
Hey, guys.
I'm the attending physician on this case.
Clemente? Yeah.
Now, the thing is, this dude is very sick.
He's out of it, completely out of it.
So, he's not gonna be able
to give a statement today, okay? I'm sorry.
Hold on a sec.
You're Victor Clemente?
Yeah. Were you listening to me?
He's not gonna be able to give you a statement. I'm sorry.
Easy... We're not here on your patient.
We're here for you.
MALIK: Dubenko's feisty gofer
is at it again.
What?
The Chief Resident from the Death Star--
she's down on a consult.
Albright?
MORRIS: He's hemodynamically stable
with no peritoneal signs.
So why'd you call me?
Look, missy, it's protocol, all right?
You didn't really just call me missy, did you?
Okay, look, the-the case meets trauma criteria.
Next time, call me when you know what you got in your hands.
Are you Dr. Albright?
He was stabbed in the belly.
I need to know if he needs surgical repair.
Neela Rasgotra. I heard you were here.
I wanted to catch you about doing a surgery elective?
Right.
Work up your patient.
Image the belly,
explore the wounds, figure out how deep they are.
If they enter the peritoneal
cavity, call me.
I'll be more than happy
to get involved.
One third of stab wounds enter the peritoneal cavity
and damage the viscera.
One third go in, and don't hit anything.
And one third...
are shallow and tangential.
The trajectory was suggested by the hilt mark of the knife.
He won't need surgery.
You should pay more attention to your interns, Red.
I'm an R2, actually.
Okay, R2.
Call me about that elective.
We might be able to work something out.
Ooh, hoo.
Parking violations. Come on, you got to be kidding me, right?
Okay. But you had some other problems back East, didn't you?
What kind of problems you talking about?
You left Newark General
under some very serious allegations.
I never... I never, never, never
compromised a patient's care.
Do you understand me?
I never... ( laughs ): Okay, okay.
Let's just get back to Mrs. Kenyon.
She had some issues... What do you want me to say?
Issues? What issues? She had no issues.
She was a nurse.
I'd ask her for 6-0 Vicryl, and she'd bring it to me.
No issues.
Can I go now? Thank you.
Not yet.
All right, you... all right, you do realize
that son of bitch hits her, right?
So, you have seen her? You realize that?
No, I haven't seen her.
But I can see what's going on here, and it's pretty low.
To sic you on me
'cause he can't keep his own wife happy.
That's pretty pathetic.
Right now, all we know is,
Mrs. Kenyon's a missing person who might be in trouble.
Well, she'll be in more trouble if you find her.
Meaning what?
Meaning, sometimes people go missing
because they feel safer that way.
My advice to you: stop looking for her.
Well, don't you go missing,
okay, Vic? 'Cause I want to talk to you.
Why would I go missing? Why would I go missing? Why?
Are you confusing me for one of your lowlife, fascist scumbags
you spend your days with?
Hey, you might want to settle down
before it gets embarrassing, huh?
You know, I hope this conversation doesn't throw me
off my game today, especially after all
the cops' lives I've saved,
I'd hate to be less than 100% when one of your brothers
comes in with a bullet through his belly.
I think we're done for now.
Take it easy.
( panting )
Hey, we got any loperamide in stock?
Yeah, I'm sure he has.
( sighs )
Well, I got you the good stuff.
Today was...
Hey. Oop, sorry.
It's turkey day in the cafeteria.
No.
No what?
Is the answer to your question.
Can I at least state my case first?
Okay.
This is big.
This is a big opportunity
for my band and for me.
And you never know
when you're going to get another shot like this
My recollection is that you were warned last year
about your commitment to this job.
Yes, I was.
And to your credit, you've done an excellent job
showing us that you want to be here. I do.
You're a good doctor.
Thank you.
We don't need to discuss this any further.
You're valuable, you're valued.
Conversation over.
Have you tried the stuffing?
It's great stuffing.
And, you know, I got you an extra piece...
Dr. Barnett. Look, Kerry...
Dr. Weaver.
Um...
Have you ever dreamed about something
without ever believing it would actually happen?
Because that's what this is.
I've...
This is so huge to me that if I couldn't do this,
I would seriously consider quitting.
Far be it from me to stand in the way of the next Springsteen
or K.C. and the Sunshine Band.
Resignation accepted.
What?
Why do you want to do surgery anyway?
I'm curious about it.
The hours suck,
the attendings are slave drivers,
and the residents stab each other in the back.
Oh, not like down here
where we're just one big, happy family.
What's wrong with you?
Ashlee Simpson get caught lip-synching again?
I think I just quit.
Quit?
To go to California with my band.
Oh, great. Yeah. No, bold move. I like it.
Keeping that music dream alive.
Nah, you'll love California.
Everybody-- Ray Barnett, rock god!
Morris, I've already sent my paperwork up to surgery.
Well, get it back.
I can't spare you, especially now,
with Ray on his way out.
If we're not fully staffed,
you're not going anywhere.
I don't care what Dr. Cruella says.
Um... 3:45.
That'll work. Yeah, thank you.
Ray's on his way out?
Yeah, just up and quit,
not going to let The Man keep him down.
I don't think he meant to.
Hey, guys?
Guys, guys, come here.
You know the girl I been hanging out with?
Jodie? Yeah, we love Jodie.
She taught me how to tie a knot in a cherry stem
using only my tongue. Really?
All right, come on, come on, guys.
Anybody ask for her? No.
You never saw her, okay?
And is anybody asks, the same goes for me.
What?
Pretend you never heard of me.
Lockhart, Pratt's bringing in a patient.
Get with him, okay? Okay.
He gets weirder every day.
Look, Morris,
you heard what Dr. Albright said...
So what? She's the chief resident upstairs.
I'm the chief down here.
You work for me.
Oh, come on. That's not fair.
Fair? What's fair?
Excuse me, Doctor?
Mr. Ramsey.
I can sign whatever I need to
and we'll get out of your way.
Would you like me to call anyone for further treatment?
Thank you. I think we'll arrange our own prenatal care.
Amanda decided to keep it?
The, uh... baby.
It's just that she's young,
and it was an accident.
No. No.
I don't believe in accidents.
Now, I know you may not understand this,
but it is God's will for her to have this child.
I only mean, you may want to consider the long-term effects.
And you might want to consider the spiritual effects
of what you're suggesting.
It's my job to make sure the patient understands
all the options available to her.
A human life has just been created,
and, I'm sorry, but anything that interferes with that
is morally indefensible.
MAN ( weakly ): Finished a cycle of chemo two days ago.
BARDELLI: Couldn't get an IV. He's too dry.
MARQUEZ: Pratt? OR needs an attending to sign off
on your pancreatic pseudo cyst.
Where's Clemente?
On the roof.
We getting a chopper patient?
No. He just says that his cell phone
gets better reception up there.
All right, place a subclavian and bolus him.
I'll be back. Okay.
Triple lumen tray and 1% lido.
He's tachy at 132.
Little bit cold here.
I was never the sickly type, you know?
Yeah?
Always very healthy.
Used to do triathlons, you believe that?
Me, too.
Really?
Smoking, drinking and watching TV.
You should stop that.
I have.
Six years ago,
I find out I inherited the Philadelphia chromosome.
Ran on my mother's side of the family.
I never knew.
Screwed by genetics.
LOCKHART: The first time,
I was panicked the baby would be bipolar.
And I'm not so sure I've changed that much.
KOVAC: Well, the chances are slim,
you know that.
Crossing the street is a risk.
If you let it get to you,
you'd never have children.
Nobody would.
Well, maybe some people aren't supposed to.
Well, I don't think you're one of them.
( sighs )
Yeah, well, you don't know what it was like...
with Maggie and Eric.
You're looking for reasons again.
And what are you looking for?
Someone to have a baby with?
Is that what you think?
Because if it is, then what the hell are we doing here?
( sighs )
Happy New Year.
A whole cascade of things have to happen to cause CML.
Philadelphia chromosome doesn't mean instant cancer.
No.
Just that you're born with a big strike against you.
As soon as you get this message, you call me, okay?
I want to talk to you.
Immediately. Right away.
Maybe you're trying me right now,
so I'm just going to hang up, and...
and you got to call me.
You going to jump?
It's not a trick question.
Yeah, sure, it's not.
Here, I need you to sign off on this.
What the hell you doing up here, man?
It's freezing.
Yeah, well, I got a very high core temp.
It's a Latin thing.
You want to talk or something?
No. Why would I?
I don't know.
You seem a little ragged.
Yeah, well, I just got
some chick trouble, that's all.
Then I'm your man.
Except I don't like to share.
You know, I heard you never stick anyplace.
Maybe people don't go to the mat for you
because they have no idea who you are.
All right.
All right, so there was...
there was this crazy nurse at my last hospital.
In Newark?
Yeah. She's just a piece of work,
and it just... just ended bad.
( scoffs )
It usually does.
So, you know, I came here...
I came here just to focus,
and stay on the straight and narrow, you know?
Sounds like a good idea.
Yeah... one would think.
Except it's easier said than done,
'cause this girl...
she's got my number, if you know what I mean--
and a very pissed-off husband.
( laughing )
Yeah.
See? I'm starting to like you more already.
Yeah.
Damn, so many patients.
God...
Don't you feel better now?
Not really, no.
Can't say that I do.
Type and Rh are back on Amanda. Oh.
Then we're done.
You off already?
Yeah.
I have a doctor's appointment.
Oh.
I'm going to see Coburn.
Coburn?
At her practice.
Uh...
I'll, uh, I'll get Clemente to cover.
It's okay. You're working.
No, I should come with you.
It probably would be easier if you didn't.
Hey...
Hey?
When I say I want us to keep it,
you don't like the way it sounds.
But anything else is a lie.
Luka? Neela's waiting for you to sign off
on the Ramsey girl.
KOVAC: Get Clemente to do it.
He's MIA.
I don't know what else to say.
Don't say anything.
Take one of these every day.
It'll help keep you and your baby healthy.
Okay.
Where are your parents?
My mom's making some calls,
and my dad had to go to a meeting.
Okay, if it makes you nauseous,
try taking it at night before you go to bed, okay?
This is some more information that might be useful.
And we got this for you
from the ultrasound.
( sighs )
I wish this didn't happen.
I wish I could make it go away.
Well, everything happens for a reason.
There was this party... at my friend Ginny's house.
And I drank some beer and I did some other stuff
with a couple of guys, and...
And I must have passed out in a bedroom because...
when I woke up...
my jeans were on the floor
and there was blood all over the sheets.
( sobbing ): I tried to change the covers...
RASGOTRA: Amanda...
were you raped?
I always thought the first time would be
with someone I loved.
Why didn't you say something?
I don't want this.
Please.
You need to explain to your parents what happened.
They'll understand.
You have to tell them.
I did tell them.
Mrs. Ramsey.
I'll call you back.
Amanda told you what happened to her?
Yes.
And you still want her to do this?
That baby can't be punished for how it was conceived.
It's not up to us to determine who gets to be born.
We're talking about a 15-year-old girl,
your daughter, who was raped.
Neela. You'd force her to carry this to term
and change the course of her life?
I-I wouldn't force her to do anything.
She believes the same things that we believe.
This is an inappropriate conversation.
Inappropriate?
She's terrified. She doesn't want to keep it.
Okay, let's take a walk.
Think for one minute
about what's in your daughter's best interests.
KOVAC: Neela!
You think it's in her best interest to kill the baby?
Because I can assure you
that in the eyes of God, it most certainly is not.
Excuse me.
Okay, leave these people alone now.
They've made a decision.
The parents have no legal rights.
The pregnancy emancipates her.
There's nothing else you can do.
That girl's head is so far twisted
she doesn't understand she has a choice.
She doesn't want an abortion.
She doesn't want to have the baby either.
Anyone can see that.
What about misoprostol?
It's used as an abortifacient all over the world.
She won't consent to that.
Just let it go, Neela.
You're the wrong person to talk to about this.
Excuse me?
I would like your permission to consult another attending.
Someone who's not Catholic.
Listen to me very seriously.
I'm a doctor first, above and beyond anything else.
And I don't let my personal beliefs
get in the way of a patient's best interests.
Ever!
Now give me that chart and move on to the next one.
I'm sorry.
It's just that there's got to be something that we can do.
You're done here.
KOVAC: Do you want to have this baby?
I have to.
Is it what you want?
No.
No, it isn't.
This is called a laminaria.
It goes into the cervix
where it absorbs water and swells, ( baby crying )
creating a larger opening.
( children laughing )
After that happens,
it's possible that the fetus might fall out.
Possible?
You might have a miscarriage.
Does it hurt?
A little.
There might be some cramping.
Is it a sin?
It's just a medical way we have of, uh...
giving God a chance to reconsider.
WOMAN: Abigail Lockhart?
Oh, my God! Nobody was out today.
I had a pick of the litter!
Hey, come on. You've got to leave.
Hey, what the hell is wrong with you? Hey!
Cops are on me. They're on my ass.
And why? Because your ... of a husband Bobby's
put out a missing persons report, that's why. He did?
Yeah. How long you think we got till he traces you to me?
How long you think before I'm walking around
with my testicles in a jar?
Vicky, Vic, Vic...
Ooh. I love you.
But sometimes you can be such a little faggot.
Oh, yeah? Mm-hmm.
Well, I'm gonna get a big boyfriend
who's gonna kick your maniac of a husband's ass.
How do you like that, huh?
Huh?! How do you like that?
Hey... ow!
You're ripping the leather!
Just quiet, will you? ( laughs )
Yeah, that's great.
This is just great.
You got to pay your tickets.
Just great, damn it.
Hey, Vic, what's going on?
Hey, X-Ray, how's it going?
So this must be Jodie, huh?
Who, her?
That's not Jodie.
Hi. Hi.
You know what's weird? I've parked here a lot of times, I never had a problem.
Yeah, that's really weird, huh?
But we're gonna take the el.
All right. Nice meeting you.
Likewise.
BRET: Yo, Ray.
Bret.
Hey, how was practice?
Thanks for meeting me, man.
Can we grab some coffee?
Yeah. So I took care of everything.
Schedule's all cleared up.
I thought we were gonna talk before you did anything.
Did something happen?
Don't tell me Ginsberg isn't interested.
No, it's still on.
Here's the thing, Ray-- you've been pretty busy
with this whole doctor thing lately
and kind of distracted, you know?
Oh, true, true.
But I'm 100% on board now, okay?
110, actually.
Well, we all got together and talked about it.
Who did?
The guys. This morning.
Kind of decided the band's got to make some changes.
Changes?
What do you mean changes?
You'll need to come back to have the laminaria removed.
Probably feel a little pain,
but nothing to worry about.
You can take ibuprofen. That should help.
"Before I formed thee in the belly,
"I knew thee.
"And before thou camest forth out of the womb
"I sanctified thee
and ordained thee a prophet unto the nations."
Jeremiah 1:5.
"Man was born of dust.
"It was only when God breathed life into Adam
that he became a living soul."
Genesis.
You're a Christian.
What do I tell my mom?
She'll think you're having a miscarriage.
And you will be.
All done.
You can take her home now.
Okay. Thank you, doctor.
Weaver's MRI results are back.
What happened?
Sorry?
What were you doing in there?
Taking care of the patient, Neela.
( dialing )
Hey, Abby, it's me.
Um... I guess I've missed you.
Um... nothing.
I'll... I'll see you soon.
Okay?
Advanced degeneration with a cartilaginous flap.
At least that explains the pain.
I've seen that kind of thing heal
with enough bed rest and physical therapy.
I've been putting this off for years.
Maybe it's time to face the music.
I'll need a total hip replacement.
Not necessarily.
Just when Henry's starting to run around like a crazy man.
How is he?
He's great.
You should see him.
He looks just like Sandy.
I went by your place,
but I figured you might come home this way.
I don't want everything we have
to come down to this one decision.
We can get past it.
You did what you had to do.
Doesn't mean we can't be together.
I didn't do it.
I couldn't.
I want to keep it.
I want us to have this baby.
