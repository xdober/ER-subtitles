Previously, on E.R.:
Who are you?
Victor Clemente. Your new attending.
And congratulations, Doc, you just killed me.
Look, I know what happened in Newark,
and I really do not want a repeat here, okay?
Hear you're getting out of here today.
You thought it stunk to work here.
Try being a patient.
Zoe. Yes?
Do you know what you're doing?
Yeah, I know what I'd like to do.
I'm your half brother. Good to meet you, man.
This is my wife Evelyn,
my daughter Jocelyn.
This is Greg...
my son.
You don't want to have anything
to do with me, but what about your little brother?
Oh, don't use him like that.
I'm trying here.
Then stop.
You getting ready for a roast?
We got to clean this place up.
Gallant won't be here for another three days.
Yeah, well, it's gonna take a week to disinfect.
I just want it to be nice for him.
He's been over there a long time.
Okay, come on, we're gonna be late.
Oh. Hi. I'm Zoe.
Yeah, I remember.
You have a cool place.
Thin walls, though.
Uh, sometimes you really get it going.
Yeah... Have you seen my, um...
toothbrush?
Sorry.
Keep it.
I have gum.
You're just leaving her here?
Why, you afraid she's gonna steal something?
She already took my toothbrush.
Don't worry, she'll lock up.
We gave her keys?
Look, it's different with Zoe.
There's something real between us.
Yeah. Real loud.
They wouldn't admit him because what?
Too young?
Yeah, we got a NICU, but it's...
not exactly S.O.P.
S.O.P.?
Standard Operating Procedure.
It's military talk.
Ah, that must mean you like him.
( laughs ): It's gonna take a little more than that.
All right, all right, but you owe me, man.
Lockhart. Abby.
Incoming. I need a room with a warmer
set up for an infant, miller one and a two-five.
Two-five? What's it, a preemie?
Yeah, but, uh, we got it. Thanks.
You can see it in his eyes.
It's starting to sink in on the poor sucker.
What is?
That he actually works here.
( chuckles )
This is a special case, needs to be treated on the DL.
You follow?
Is it your illegitimate love child?
Try to be cool, okay?
Nine-week-old with two days vomiting, diarrhea and fever.
Vitals? Tachy, couldn't get a BP.
How about a sat? Probe wouldn't stick to the fur.
Hey, easy, easy, easy.
Lockhart, this is Darwin.
That's... the ugliest baby I've ever seen.
Okay, folks, the good news is
the hospital has approved four-to-one ratios.
Finally. Now, that means
extra full-time equivalents
and zero, zero tolerance for excessive O.T.
Well, let's hope we have enough people to fill all those shifts.
DUBENKO: Sam, you got a haircut.
No, it's just high... lights.
Good morning, E.R. staff.
So it's true-- we're not alone.
EVE: What's going on?
Well, this device was designed
to offer remote surgical consults.
So, since I'm still at home recovering,
I thought I'd give it a test drive.
Okay, meeting's over.
Uh, nurses, nurses, uh, for the sake of the trial
I'm gonna need a few things.
Damn, I miss the Bronx. This is why I don't have cable.
How are you doing that?
I have a joystick in my lap.
That is too much information.
Sam, we're gonna be in sutures.
You need help?
No, that's okay, we got it.
Morning, Dr. Lockhart.
Some kid in triage asking for you.
Yeah, tell him to take a number.
He says he knows you.
( sighs ): Uh, yeah, um...
set him up in two, okay? Okay.
Haleh, walk with me.
You sure like to walk.
Remember that little chat we had?
No more O.T.-- I did what I promised.
( laughs ): You're picking up extra time by taking shifts in ICU.
Well, you never said I couldn't. Yeah, I also didn't say
you couldn't start flipping burgers around the corner,
or turning tricks in Lincoln Park.
Excuse me?!
It's overtime-- you know what I'm talking about.
I'm sorry-- it won't happen again.
Good boy.
Okay, his temperature's only 94.
I must have skipped school the day they taught monkey veins.
Word on the street is, you give good neonate.
Human neonate, Dr. Moreau.
Bet you didn't know that chimps and humans
share 96% of their DNA, did you?
I know-- it's fascinating.
So this is what happened, so Darwin's handler
calls me up and tells me that the vet's kind of nervous.
So he figures this little guy's best shot is here with me.
Oh, of course he does. Tachy,
carotid's weak. And this handler, he knows you because, what,
you went to clown school together?
How'd you guess? No, I'm serious.
I was at NYU while he was at Ringling Brothers.
I had kind of a... circus thing.
Okay.
We need access, Lockhart.
Right. Abby. I'm gonna try to find a transilluminator.
Is there anyone else we can trust? What are we doing?
I-I'm an attending-- I can't spend all day
in here with a chimp. I know.
So what are we doing?
Go, go, go, okay? Go, go.
Don't forget the knock, okay?
( whispers ): Please, go.
Hey, I heard you have a baby in there.
You need some help? No. I, uh... we got it.
Is it cute? Yes, it's a... hairy little monkey.
I love babies. And babies love me.
I just have a way with them.
Can you get me a transilluminator?
I'm like the wind. Thanks.
Oh, hey, Neela, um, do you have a minute?
We could use an extra set of hands. "We"?
Clemente and I have a-a patient.
Sure.
( sighs )
CLEMENTE ( quietly ): Come on, hurry up.
Transilluminator was MIA, but I...
Forget that, I got a 24 into the antecube.
Oh. Wait. What?
NEELA: Uh...
you two do realize that's a monkey.
Chimp, actually.
ABBY: 96% human.
Who knew?
So how'd this happen?
Aw, I was just horsing around.
Looks like you did a little bit more than that to me.
Got in a fight.
Where, at school?
Nah, at home.
With Dad.
Did he hit you?
Nah, man, he doesn't do that.
So what were you fighting about?
I always felt there was something going on
at my house I didn't know about.
Then I met you, and...
I got it.
It was like...
it was like a cloud was lifted.
But the cloud came back.
You mean 'cause I cut off Charlie?
Not just him, man, you cut me off, too.
I don't want it to be like that.
I mean, ain't we brothers?
( sighs )
This may be worse off than it looks.
( knocking )
Sounds like they need this room for an actual patient.
You know, another thing they share with humans
is a tendency to get sepsis as neonates, so...
( phone rings ) let's go with a CBC,
d-stick, cultures, portable chest
and 20cc's per kilo bolus. Oh, that's it?
No foley? No LP?
Tap might be jumping the gun,
but foley's not a bad idea.
Hold on... hold on a second.
( over speaker ): Hello, Dr. Clemente? Yes, Eve.
We're over in Trauma Two
with our friend Jessie, who has multiple fractures
from a fall. Yeah, yeah.
We were just wondering if it would be possible
for you to get your ass in here?
All right, all right, all right, all right.
Shake a leg, okay? 'Cause if this chimp
gets sepsis, he could crump at any minute.
And lock the door.
We should take the core temp.
I'm not sticking anything up this monkey's ass.
You know, if I had a nickel for every time I said that...
How about we flip for it? Fine.
Hey, Abby, the transilluminator's missing
a bulb, but I thought I'd give you
a little help with the sweet lit...
( gasps ): By all that is good
and holy, what diabolical spell
have you cast on this child?
Dr. Pratt, can you sign off on this chart?
Hey, who's it for? The kid in two
who got into it with his father. Wait. What?!
Social worker's in with him now.
You weren't supposed to do a chart! I had to do a chart.
No, no, no! It's not like that! Eve's strict with this stuff.
Suspicion of abuse-- I have to call them in. Damn!
Look, I don't need any help from you-- I'm fine. That's not how it looks.
Man, why do I got to go through all this with her?
I'm Dr. Pratt. Liz Dade, social work.
Yeah, can I talk to you outside for a minute? When I'm finished here.
Look, see, the thing is... I'm not finished yet.
Well, I think you should be.
Look, the nurse jumped the gun, okay? I know this family.
It's a stable home.
It's just an innocent argument.
The kid just got a little too steamed. Is that so?
Yeah. And nobody hit anybody?
I just got real mad at a chair.
( chuckles ): That's not gonna do it.
Okay, look, all right...
He's my brother.
Okay? His brother.
Yeah. Same last name, check it out.
Why didn't you just say so?
I'll do a follow-up phone call.
( screaming ) Sally!
SALLY: Tom Cruise? Retarded!
Sally. Sammy Sosa? Retarded!
( screams, groans )
Son of a... bitch!
Sam.
( laughs ): Ah. Um... yeah, I just...
No, that's all right.
How retarded was that, huh?
Listen, I overheard you talking to Inez.
Oh, yeah, sorry about that, Eve.
It's just sometimes she needs a little bit of guidance.
Oh, no, that's okay-- I'm actually really impressed.
You have fantastic interpersonal skills.
The younger nurses respect you,
the older ones trust you. Oh, thanks.
So I think it's time you moved up the ladder.
( chuckles ): What ladder?
Nursing administration.
I'm pretty happy doing what I'm doing.
Your job wouldn't change that much.
You'd help out with staff education,
implementing nursing policies and procedures.
Sounds like a lot of work. There'd be a big pay hike.
How big?
Shopping on Michigan Avenue big.
Well, if you put it that way...
( chuckles ) when do I start?
Right away. First thing I need you to do is fire Haleh.
Hold on. What?
Welcome to management.
Eve.
Is it done?
No.
Inez, How's that pulse ox probe working out?
Fine Okay.
I'm not going to fire Haleh.
Hey, management's a bitch.
Yeah, and not the only one.
You know, Haleh's been warned three times,
twice in writing.
She has?
With all the O.T. she's doing, we could hire two nurses
and still have enough for a wet bar
in the lounge.
Well, then let's counsel her.
Oh, yeah, you're confusing me with Oprah.
Dr. Clemente, did you send in this patient in sutures?
No, no, no. VIP.
What, he's the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama or something?
No, no, it's a privacy issue kind of thing.
Well, he still needs to be tracked. Give me a name.
Any name.
Darwin.
Darwin what?
Magilla.
Are you gonna need a NICU bed?
No, no, no, 'cause we'll be transferring him back
to the referring facility.
It's closer to where he lives
'cause the mom doesn't drive.
( clears throat )
I'm not doing it. I don't need the job that bad.
Either way, Haleh's gonna go.
But she's a great nurse.
You've never fired anyone before.
No.
All right, okay, it's a new skill.
It needs to be developed. We'll do it together.
What? Ah, cheer up It won't be so bad.
Now, listen, my EMT trainees are waiting for their 12-lead class.
I'll come find you after.
( knocking at door )
Hey.
Hey, you left the door open.
All right, so, Doctors, so what's the status report?
Heart rate's down.
He's on 100-percent room air.
Took eight ounces PO.
Oh, that's great.
Good little guy.
Good little guy.
All right, let's ship him out
before they put us all on a psych hold.
Shouldn't we keep him awhile?
Yeah, for observation. He's awfully young.
Guys, guys, it's just a bad viral GE,
that's all. We should recheck the cultures.
Yeah, well, I'm sure the vet can do that.
Well, he's gonna need another round of antibiotics.
Oh, I thought you didn't like monkeys.
I never said that.
And anyway, he's not a monkey.
Okay. Now, I don't know if I'm touched or if I'm nauseous,
but, you know what, we're done here, so DC the lock
and let's get a move on.
There's a giraffe out there clogging up triage.
12-year-old crushed under scaffolding at a construction site.
PRATT: What's your name, little man?
Barry. Is my pop all right?
PICKMAN: Chest injury,
respiratory distress, but vitals stable.
What happened to his father?
Everything fell on me.
Dad had an MI trying to dig him out.
Ray, that's you.
All right, I'll check on him, Barry.
PRATT: Okay, both lungs are up. Let's go.
Cardiac arrest during exertion.
All right, down time? Maybe 12 minutes.
Shocked him three times with epi and atropine. Okay.
Hold compressions.
Pulseless v-tach. Let's go! Let's go!
Okay, kiddo, deep breath now.
( takes deep breath ): It hurts.
Little bit of stridor here.
INEZ: Pulse ox 92.
Chest, c-spine, pelvis, CBC.
PICKMAN You hang in there, Bar.
Thank you, ma'am.
MORRIS: Chem 7, UA, type and screen.
500cc saline bolus.
Okay, Simon says squeeze my fingers, pal.
Good, man.
Now wiggle those toes for me.
PRATT: I'll be right back.
Oh, I didn't say "Simon says."
Shock again at 360.
( zap, beeping ) Sinus rhythm.
I got a pulse. Let's check a BP.
Man, it's hard to keep track of the Splenda in here.
Pupils sluggish but reactive.
All right, folks, let's hope for some neurological function.
( cell phone rings ) God....
( phone clicks off ) What, no response?
No. BP's 100 over 70.
His GCS is only 3, fellas.
Fellas, if we save the heart and lose the brain,
we might as well go home, huh?
Worsening respiratory distress in here.
PRATT: Okay, I'm coming.
BARRY: Pop!
Come on.
We need to paralyze and intubate,
six-and-a-half ET tube.
Yeah, hold on.
BARRY: Is he okay?
He will be.
Why's he so stridorous?
Uh... laryngeal injury?
No neck injury, no midline shift.
Okay, get me some lido and a tower clip.
You think the clavicle's displaced?
I think it's compressing the trachea.
He needs an airway right now.
Draw up etomidate and sux.
Don't push anything yet.
Pratt. So, Barry,
what's your dad building?
A dream house.
MORRIS: Oh, yeah?
It's for my mom.
That sounds nice, buddy.
Okay, buddy, you're gonna feel a little stick here.
( inhales deeply )
I'm helping.
Pratt, push the etomidate.
Oh, I just gotta get a good grip.
Okay. So, uh, Barry,
what kind of house is it?
A Craftsman.
( sharp groan )
ROBO-DUBENKO: Is he all right?
INEZ: Sats coming up, pulse is normalizing.
Vitals stable, tenderness over the lower ribs.
ROBO-DUBENKO: Get a CT abdomen and chest.
What's next door?
V-tach arrest. We got him back.
Is that a robot doctor?
Oh, yeah. We're very advanced here.
How's it going?
He's not waking up.
We got ROSC without RONF.
Come again?
Return of spontaneous circulation without return
of neurologic function.
The down time was over ten minutes.
Not good enough for brain cells.
Cath lab?
No, I don't think so.
Look, all he's got is a little ST depression.
I think ICU.
No, no, not yet.
We're gonna go with a portable chest and a cardiac echo.
What for?
Oh, a little ditty
I like to call "induced hypothermia."
Look, I'll be right back.
How you doing?
Me? Uh... I'm okay.
The board's not too backed up.
You need anything?
Uh... no, I'm good.
I kind of like this new energy.
You mean Eve?
She's tough, but it's gonna be good for all of us
in the long run.
Yeah, I hope so.
So, this new nurse manager's working out, huh?
She's a terrorist, Neela.
Zoe.
Hi.
Are you looking for Ray?
Oh, um, no. Actually, I was hoping you could help me.
Where did you get this thing?
I stole it from the last place I worked at.
Hey, but that's between us, okay?
How cold do you set it?
91 Fahrenheit. 33 degrees centigrade.
Which many consider dangerous.
What, we're decreasing his metabolism?
Yeah, only six percent per degree centigrade.
Look, it might get his brain started again.
What about the effect on oxygen demand in low-flow regions?
The studies show a 23-percent improvement
in neurologic outcome.
Yeah, I'm familiar with the literature.
Okay, okay, that's it. I'm done arguing with a television set.
It's believed to suppress radical formation...
Did you just call me a television set?
That's pretty funny.
This isn't a surgical consult, my friend.
It's believed to suppress radical formation...
Look, if you can't get out of bed and come into work,
then I don't see why we should have to listen to you.
...slow enzymatic reactions
and inhibit excitatory neurotransmitters.
It kind of burns when I pee.
It sounds like a bladder infection.
Oh, I figured.
You can get it from many things,
like having... sex... a lot.
Oh, I've been doing that.
Don't I know it.
Look, I hope you don't mind.
I just didn't want to ask Ray to do this, you know?
It's... fine.
I'll need a urine sample and run some tests,
but first, I'll need to get some information.
Okay.
Name?
Um, Butler, Zoe Butler.
Okay. Address?
1226 Parkington Road.
Okay. Date of birth?
December 12th... 1990.
Sorry?
December 12th.
No, I know, uh...
1990.
1990. So you're... 14 years old?
Almost 15.
( chuckling ): My birthday's coming up.
When will he wake up?
Soon, we hope.
He cheated.
On a business trip, with some lady from work.
When my mom found out,
she wouldn't let him come home for a month.
He lived in a hotel.
You know, parents make mistakes, too.
He's trying to make it up to her.
Is that what the house is for?
He wants everything back the way it was.
WOMAN: Barry.
Are you okay?
Yeah, Mom... I'm okay.
He's got some broken bones
and a small injury to his liver,
but we don't think he'll need surgery.
And Paul?
Your... your husband's had a heart attack.
His brain's been deprived of oxygen.
We're doing our best to help wake him up.
Excuse me.
What's the big hurry?
Zoe's here, she's in Exam Two.
She is?
Yes, she is.
Oh, and I almost forgot, she's 14 years old.
Shut up.
She was born in 1990, Ray.
What?
That's the decade immediately preceding
the one that we're in.
Are you for real?
Yes. And in prison math,
I believe 14 equals five-to-ten.
Where is she? Exam Two.
And here's the kicker, Jerry Lee--
your prepubescent penis pal has chlamydia.
I had no idea she was that young.
Young? She's still teething,
although, I don't know, maybe you enjoy that.
She didn't say anything. How was I supposed to know?
Take her out for coffee, converse with her a bit,
before you start boffing and handing out house keys.
I don't card my dates, okay?
( chuckling ): Oh, well, maybe it's time you started.
1990?
It was a very good year for chlamydia.
Hmm.
Why didn't you tell me?
I just thought it was a bladder infection
from all the sex we were having.
No. God, not that.
Why didn't you tell me how old you are?
You never asked.
You said you were a student.
I am.
In what? Ninth grade?
Eighth.
But I didn't think you'd like me if you knew.
Well, you know, you're right.
Because I also don't like courtrooms and prisons
and men named Hank who make me their bitch.
What is the big deal?
We like each other.
It's fun.
Wait, who's Hank?
Zoe, I'm going to give you
a prescription for doxycycline for the chlamydia.
And you're going to need to be tested
for a bunch of other STDs, okay?
Like gonorrhea, syphilis
HIV...
Sure, whatever.
And under the circumstances, no parental consent is required.
That's good.
Thank you.
Wonder who I got it from.
Not me.
Whoa.
How many other candidates are there?
Were we being monogamous?
He's starting to shiver.
All right, start 25 of Demerol, IV push.
His wife coming in?
Not just yet.
Sam, ready?
For what?
Haleh's in the family room.
Go ahead, I got this.
I'll push the meds.
Hey, wait a second. Wait a second.
Come on, do not do this. It's wrong.
You think I find this enjoyable?
Firing Haleh is going to send
a message to every nurse in this joint.
Joint? We're not in jail, Eve.
No, but it should feel like we are.
Haleh.
Is something wrong?
Well, we've had quite a few meetings about your overtime,
right, Haleh?
Uh-huh. And I've discussed
those meetings with Sam.
Right, Sam?
Yeah, I guess.
Haleh, uh...
you are a wonderful nurse,
and, um...
I'm sure you're going to continue to do great work,
but...
It's going to have to be at some other hospital.
Excuse me?
It's just that you've been warned three times
and, uh...
We're going to have to let you go.
You're not serious.
Is she serious?
You can report to HR tomorrow.
You can't do this.
Where you'll turn in your badge and collect your last paycheck.
Sam.
Haleh, I'm so sorry.
Just getting out?
Yeah.
I read some magazines.
I never realized the human esophagus
could be so complex.
Look, man, you know, I'm sorry about all this.
But you've got to understand that it's like this
because of the choices that Charlie made.
It's not on me.
Dad's a hard guy to figure.
I think maybe some stuff happened
that he never talked about.
Maybe so.
I think there's some stuff you don't know too, Greg.
Some stuff that...
maybe your mom didn't tell you the truth about.
Is that what he told you?
Yeah.
Radiology faxed down these results.
I just got here, Frank. What patient?
It's me, actually.
I had a mammogram last week.
It's normal.
Oh. Hey, congratulations.
Dr. Clemente, I'm out of here.
The kid in one is stable. You watching the dad?
Yeah, I'm on the case.
Frank, will you forward anything for me to my house?
Of course.
We're all really sorry, Haleh.
Thanks.
I'll try to come by for a visit...
when I'm up to it.
Take care.
Bye, Haleh.
What?
Nothing. Nothing. Nothing.
What happened?
Sam fired Haleh.
Screw you, Frank.
Eve fired her. I just...
Helped?
I'm sorry. That's the word on the street.
Eve's making a statement?
And all the words are dirty.
Lockhart.
Abby.
Code banana.
Our VIP's bouncing back.
Haleh.
Wait.
Haleh, I feel terrible about this.
Who covered for you all those times
your kid was in trouble?
How many shifts were you late
or had to leave early?
And now you're going to fire me for too much overtime?
For what, Sam?
A couple extra hundred bucks a month.
You calling her a liar?
I don't know who you mean.
My mother.
Isn't that what you said?
Slow down, son...
Don't you ever call me that.
Ever.
You want to talk about why you're upset?
I'm not one of those little Ceasefire punks
you've got convinced that you have wisdom.
Don't forget, I know you.
You're not a lesson or a role model for anybody, Charlie.
You don't know everything that happened.
How it all went down when you were little.
I don't want to talk about it.
Then why the hell you here?
You've already lost one son.
Don't make the same mistake with Chaz.
You come to give me advice?
Don't bring him into this, okay?
Don't talk to him about it.
He asked. He needed to know.
Know what?
Know what? How you spin it?
Some nonsense about a dead woman
who happens to be my mother?
She wasted her life away taking care of me
with no help from you-- nothing.
I tried to come back.
She wouldn't let me.
Look...
I can see we've both had rough days.
Let's not do this tonight.
Don't turn away from me.
You can come by the house some other time.
There's something of your mother's
I think you should have.
You've got something of hers?
It belongs to me and her.
Maybe it belongs with you now.
Whatever it is, I want it.
You hear what I said-- you can come by the house...
Right now!
Right now.
He started breathing hard again,
so I brought him right back here.
I thought you said he was okay.
He was, Alonzo, he was.
He looked great after the bolus.
He was drinking and playing.
Bag him. He's not moving air.
Maybe you should have kept him here longer.
No. No, he seemed buffed after the fluid.
We thought it was just dehydration.
I promised Cookie's owners he'd be okay.
Who's Cookie?
Darwin's mom.
She belongs to this super nice couple from Evanstan.
I also keep their llama.
BP's 66/25.
CLEMENTE: He's gone hypertensive
with a widened pulse pressure.
Sepsis.
Dopamine at ten mics.
He's, um... he's got a bacterial infection in his blood.
But you gave antibiotics.
Which ruptured the bacteria,
releasing endotoxins which can make things worse.
Suction.
I'm so sorry, man.
I thought he was doing too well to be septic.
Suction.
Okay, tube.
PVC's.
Maybe you can put him on a vent or something.
We're doing the best we can.
Okay, I'm in.
My God, I lost the pulse.
V-tac.
Please don't stop.
These people really love this little guy.
I think we should call it.
Charge it ten joules.
Starting CPR.
Don't you want to come in?
No.
You don't have your keys?
Hey.
Chaz, you okay?
Yeah, Dad.
I've got to get something for your...
for Greg.
Hey, what's up, man?
What's up, man?
I just went to go talk to him.
Because of me?
It's fine.
Why don't you come in?
Nah, I, uh...
EVELYN: Chaz, dinner's on the table.
My mom's mac and cheese.
I swear to God,
it's the best you ever tasted in your life.
Come on, man.
Hey.
I'm sorry.
Why, because I talked myself into liking some groupie
who turned out to be Hillary Duff with an STD?
I know you liked her.
I'm an idiot.
The bright side is, your urine dip came back
negative for chlamydia.
Oh, well, she must have gotten it
from another rock star she was partying with.
Probably one with a recording deal.
I should probably still swab you.
I used a condom, Neela.
Did you also use a dental dam?
Neela, your top secret baby is back.
Abby needs you in sutures.
Okay.
CLEMENTE: Going again. Clear!
Still v-tach. RASGOTRA: What happened?
I don't know. Just resuming compressions.
Septic shock. How long since the last epi?
Two minutes. You want another round of lido?
( sighs ): No.
Are you sure you don't want another round?
Yeah, no, he's been...
We been doing this for 35 minutes.
His brain's got to be fried. No, keep going.
He's been through enough.
I-I... we got to stop.
His heart's still beating.
That's more like a twitch.
It's not actually pumping any blood to his body.
S-So, that's it?
Just about.
He's fading.
Can I go get Cookie?
I'm sorry?
His mother.
If he's dying, she should be here with him.
Her baby was taken from her.
She needs to understand why.
Anybody says "next of kin," I'm gonna lose it.
I think you've already lost it.
Why? Because I tried to help a guy and it didn't work out?
Just game over, that's all. We're in it this far.
Why not let the mother in?
Because there's no need. That's why.
Well, there was no need to treat a chimp
in the first place, but here we are.
The chimp was sick. The mom is what?
She's a little depressed, maybe?
Well, it's the humane thing to do.
Okay, forget it, guys.
You guys are getting carried away with this.
Oh, come on.
You're the one that started this whole monkey business.
( whispers ): I didn't mean to say that.
Thank You, Lord, for the blessings
we are about to receive.
Look over those now who cannot be with us,
including the countrymen who fight to protect us
in an overseas war
founded on lies told to us by our government...
Jocelyn?
...and we welcome Greg, and thank You, Lord,
for bringing him into our home and family.
Amen.
Amen. Amen. Amen.
So, why do you have that walker, if you don't mind me asking?
Had a little fall, broke my hip.
Little? I was so scared
when I found her, I thought she was dead.
She was laying there... ( imitates gasping )
( laughing )
I still have a ways to go with my recovery.
And where'd you get your surgery?
County.
( sighs )
Must be downstairs.
It'll only take a minute.
Um... excuse me for a minute.
Why didn't you tell me about Evelyn?
That she was the one at County that day?
You know, maybe I could have helped.
You didn't seem in the mood for helping.
Here.
A bunch of things I sent your mother
that she sent back.
A few notes she wrote me, and...
and...
this.
An act of mercy--
her sending me that picture.
I don't even remember when this was taken.
I made mistakes, Greg.
I never denied it.
Got busted for some stupid, petty stuff
and went away for awhile.
Regretted it ever since.
But life is more complicated than you think.
RASGOTRA: No respiratory effect.
( monitor beeping slows )
Yeah, well, it won't be long now.
ALONZO: Is he in pain?
No.
( sighs )
I'm gonna give him another milligram of morphine,
just in case.
What? I just want to make sure he's comfortable.
( sighs )
Okay, I'm sorry.
No, no, let go.
( Cookie moaning )
( whispers ): Thanks.
( sighs ): GCS is up from four to 11.
He's blinking on command. Starting to move his fingers.
See? Sometimes you're good and then sometimes you're lucky.
Which one is this?
This is sometimes you're not sure.
( both chuckling )
MORRIS: We're waiting on ICU.
CLEMENTE: Good, good.
Hey, why don't you go bring his kid in?
Yeah.
Hi.
You know, patients come and go.
And, uh, some days, some of them don't even register to me.
So how is it that a hairy little chimp
crumps on the table and it's like...
Well, in any case it sounds like you'll forgive me.
For what? Well...
there's gonna be some kind of disciplinary...
suspension.
( chuckles )
What, did Eve find out?
She's not an animal lover.
More like an animal strangler, I'm guessing.
You know, it's funny, 'cause when I was a kid,
I-I always wanted a robot and a monkey.
That doesn't shock me.
No, no, I'm serious.
Me, too.
Well, I'm over it.
( chuckles )
CLEMENTE: Spontaneous eye movement--
that's a very good sign, Lockhart.
My name's Abby.
Yeah, I know.
( cell phone rings )
Jodi, Jodi, if you call me one more time, I swear to God...
No, you just got to stop that nonsense.
No, I'm not in New York.
Why would I tell you where I'm at?
Yeah, why-why would I tell you?
Yeah, because you're...
Every time tha...
You're the... Hey!
Hey! Hey!
( clattering )
( Jodi speaking indistinctly )
( sighs )
Sure are getting good at finding me.
Yeah.
I talked to Olivia.
This was our house.
I used to play out here.
She would watch me from the window.
So, you tried to come back.
She pushed you away.
She lied to you. She lied to me.
And, no, I didn't know any of it.
But the question is:
What did you do to make her hate you so much?
I got into trouble.
Maybe she felt she was protecting you.
When I got out of the pen,
I wanted us to be a family.
I was still a kid when she died. What about then?
( sighs )
I was living in Gary with Evelyn.
I came here to find you.
But they told me you had gone to Detroit
with your cousin's people.
So you gave up?
( sighs ): That was the biggest mistake of all.
But I had a second life
that I was trying to hold together.
I've done my penance.
I do it every day.
But there's only one person who I still need forgiveness from.
I hear you.
( sighs )
I hear everything that you say.
( sighs )
But you and me... we're here now.
None of that other stuff matters anymore.
Because even if the story's more complicated
than the one I spent the last 20 years believing...
you still were not there for me.
And I don't give a damn why or who said what.
Greg?
You were not... here.
Please listen to me.
And we can never change that.
We can fix it.
Never, man.
Never.
( sighs )
