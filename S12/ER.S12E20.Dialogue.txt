Previously on ER:
You sending me to Africa? I thought
you could use a change of perspective.
DEBBIE: Mouthwash? You gotta be kidding me.
You're a weird dude, Pratt.
So Debbie and Dakarai, huh?
Yeah, they're an item.
We're on our way to the Dumtala camp to help the sick people.
We are only here to help.
Generally, they do not hurt the doctors,
but one never knows what might happen.
( clamoring )
Welcome to Darfur.
( trucks rumbling )
( Dakarai speaking Arabic )
PRATT: Well, we got our problems.
You ever heard of Katrina?
If the US does not lead the way, who else will?
( Dakarai speaking Arabic )
Huh? Without international intervention,
nothing will change here.
Ask him if he's been taking the amoxicillin.
( speaking Arabic ) Listen,
even with intervention, a year after us being here,
the whole world will be screaming for us to get the hell out of Sudan.
Oh... Pratt, I expected so much more from you. Ahh.
Why? 'Cause I'm black?
No, because you are smart.
Yeah, well, but I'm also American. I did not realize
these things are mutually exclusive.
He says yes, he's feeling better.
Okay, good.
Listen, all I'm saying is that it's a lot more complicated
than that. Too many times
and way too quick getting in the middle of other people's fights.
Fine. When the solution does come to Darfur,
it is not going to be quick. Yeah, well,
where I'm from, gangs get into it all the time.
Sometimes all the cops can do is step back
and wait for it to end.
"Step back and wait."
You know, that sounds like an excellent foreign policy
where people are sitting and suffering.
Dakarai, stop ragging on my country, okay?
There's plenty of Americans helping out.
You see me here, right? Yes.
And quite frankly, I'm beginning to wonder why.
( sighs )
( speaking Arabic )
What?
She says the baby won't move.
Okay, just show me where.
And you are moving pretty fast for an isolationist.
They told you a brother was coming,
so you were expecting Marcus Garvey?
Don't think we have any more
in common than you and Carter. I don't.
In fact, I think Carter is more African than you are.
Ah. Assalamu alaikum.
Alaikum assalamu.
( continues speaking Arabic )
How long has he been like this?
Um...
Has he had fever? Diarrhea?
( speaking Arabic )
Baby no cry.
Yeah, he's too sick to cry.
Listen, we need to bring him back with us.
Look, your baby needs medicine.
We have to get him to the hospital.
( speaking Arabic )
Where is that other doctor?
Tired.
Tired?
Okay, wait right here.
Dakarai, what are you doing, man?
( retching ) Whoa! What the hell?
You all right?
Varices, varices getting worse.
( retching )
You told me your IV was for a little stomach virus.
Scarring in my liver.
Schistosomiasis when I was a child.
Damn.
Well, congratulations.
You just became the proud winner of a bed in tent #3.
( retching ) ( groans )
Rashida Fallad. She's 26 weeks pregnant,
and she has hepatitis E. Hepatitis E?
I thought our water was clean.
Mm-mm, they go outside the camp, drink from other sources.
It shouldn't be long now.
I think you're overreacting.
The mortality rate for hep E
isn't very high.
It is in pregnant women, especially in Darfur.
Over 30% of people who contract the disease will die.
Rashida.
Uh-huh.
Rashida.
Encephalopathy is worse.
She's pretty jaundiced.
Scleral icterus.
She's in hepatic coma.
Ask her if she's been eating or drinking.
( speaking Arabic )
Tell her that we've been giving her antibiotics and glucose
from an NG feeding tube.
What did she say?
She wants to know if...
if her daughter will die today or tomorrow.
Tell her I'm not sure.
She wants to know if we'll need the bed.
No, no, we can wait.
( speaking Arabic )
PRATT: Got a minute?
Mm-hmm.
So, this baby I brought in yesterday,
she's not doing so good.
I'm having trouble finding an IV site,
and this kid is getting pretty dry.
Stop trying to be so tough.
I am tough.
I'm just trying to look out for you.
I don't need a wife.
I've already had three.
Stephen, you feeling any better?
I don't want to be babied. I am fine.
Why don't you stay in bed a little longer.
I'm ready to work. You're having a paracentesis.
Don't be an idiot.
That's sound medical advice.
She has no bedside manner.
Will you talk to him?
Stay in bed until I sign off on your chart.
When? When I get to it.
DAKARAI: This is why people hate doctors.
He needed a paracentesis?
Took five liters off his belly.
Five liters?!
Had him on Lasix all night.
We had to limit his sodium. CARTER: Good.
The man shouldn't be working.
He shouldn't even be here.
Dr. Dakarai is very committed.
Uh-huh.
This is Mahdi, his mom and sister.
I'm Dr. Carter.
Can you tell her that we're gonna try
and give some fluids to her baby?
MAN: Dr. John!
They're bringing a man from outside.
They say he's been shot.
Okay, 20 gauge in the femoral,
and I want you to call me if you need me, okay?
CARTER: Ishaak?!
PRATT: What? His name is Ishaak.
( Ishaak groaning ) What happened?
We got two bullets to his chest and leg.
DAKARAI: Look, I'm going to help you.
No, we got it!
We handle gunshots differently here.
We know that. Get back in bed!
( groaning )
CARTER: I got an entrance wound, right chest.
Okay, belly seems clear.
Ishaak, you left the compound.
( grunts ): Just to the perimeter...
to help a family get water.
He's got a strong carotid.
Okay, try for that BP.
Men on horses--
they shot me.
Let me guess: Janjaweed.
Through-and-through, left calf.
100/60.
Why are you always where the trouble is?
I try to help.
Ishaak is a sheik.
PRATT: What do you mean-- like with a harem?
No, I mean like a leader.
He's recognized as someone
the other IDPs can look up to.
He's trying to make a difference.
He's trying to get people here.
Yeah, well, he should stop that.
Why say such a thing?!
Because it's making people want to kill him.
Give me two liters of saline wide open.
Okay, got a good vein in the antecube.
I'm going in with the 18.
Ishaak, we need to move you to town.
You need more surgery than we can do for you here.
I... I can't breathe.
We have the oxygen extractor?
ZAHRA: Yeah, on its way.
You treating a man with a gunshot wound here--
Ishaak Alazhari? Not sure-- I'd have to check with the doctors.
You can't just come in here like this.
As long as there's no violation, we'll leave.
( speaking Arabic )
DEBBIE: Officer, please.
Please wait outside. I'll look around for you.
We look for ourselves.
DAKARAI: You cannot be in here with those weapons.
You know the agreement
that the Alliance has with your government!
We'll go where we need to go and do what we need to do.
Look, the NGO rules apply even in Darfur.
Debbie.
Ishaak, this is oxygen that should help you breathe.
How are you doing, man?
Feeling pain when I breathe.
This man's been shot.
Yeah, that's right.
He's bleeding internally.
He needs immediate attention and transport
to a surgical facility.
Ishaak Alazhari, did you report this injury to my office?
Come on. He can do that later.
Without a Form 8, he's got no right to medical attention.
He's got to fill out a form first?
PRATT: It's not gonna help much if he's already dead.
No, no, come on. Wait a minute. Take it easy.
( all shouting )
PRATT: What are you doing?!
What the hell is the matter with you?
CARTER: He's gonna die if you do this.
OFFICER: He's guilty of a Form 8 violation,
which requires that all gunshot injuries be reported...
PRATT: He's here now!
Please don't do this!
DAKARAI: If you are going to do this...
Stephen! Wait, you can't just come in here shoving...
( Pratt shouts )
I'll send you a document re-clarifying
the Form 8 regulation, so this does not happen again.
Good day, Doc.
Okay, okay, let's see.
Damn!
How does that feel?
Feels like I got hit in the head with a rifle butt.
Better to be hit with one than shot with one.
You want something for the pain?
No, no, no, I'll be fine.
I've had hangovers worse than this.
Perhaps you should drink less mouthwash.
( sighs ) So what's going to happen to that guy they took?
Ishaak. They'll probably bring him back for treatment
when they are finished interrogating him.
He could be dead by then.
Oh, yes, I'm sure they are aware of that.
Hey.
You should go back to the compound.
No, I'm okay.
It's almost quitting time.
He's bradycardic, 58... 0.5 epi.
He's already had two doses.
He's not responding.
Because he's hypoxic and acidotic.
All right, give him another bolus and find me a bag mask.
Nope.
He'll turn around once the antibiotics kick in.
I can bag him through this.
By yourself? All night?
It could take days.
Pulse is down to 40.
I'm doing compressions.
Are we just going to watch him die?
No, that's what his mother does.
We have other patients.
That's messed up.
Would you please tell her that we're very sorry?
( speaking Arabic )
CARTER: Tell her that I know how difficult it is to lose a child,
that my own son died when he was very young in hospital.
She finds it hard to believe
that babies die in Western hospitals.
You should not have let them take him away.
We didn't have a choice.
Hey. This is Ishaak's wife, Sittina.
Hi. You treated my husband.
I tried, but they took him
because he didn't fill out some form.
No! They took him away because he tells people the truth,
that it is not safe to go back to the villages.
People listen to him. He...
Sittina?
You okay?
Maybe you should sit down.
Are you having contractions?
How far apart?
( screaming )
She's eight centimeters, 100% effaced.
She's definitely having this baby tonight.
It'll be dark soon.
Well, taking her back to the residential compound.
She can't have it here?
She can, but we can't stay with her.
There's electricity back at the compound.
The only place I am going is to the police station
( grunts ): to get my husband.
You want the police to deliver your baby?
( groans ): But Ishaak...
Let's worry about the baby first, okay?
I'll have Ibrahim bring the truck around.
Here you go. Grab the OB pack.
Here we go.
( panting )
Take it easy, nice and slow.
I got this.
You're late.
It's cinema night.
We're moving to the rec room.
Gregory wants us to watch Deuce Bigalow again.
See if you can keep everybody in there for a little while, all right?
Is everything all right?
Yeah, it'll be fine.
They turn the generators off in the compound at night.
The only power in the clinic is used for cold storage.
She would've had to deliver the baby alone in the dark.
Try and relax, huh?
You okay?
She's progressing very well.
She can probably start pushing within the hour.
Talking about you.
I am tired.
I've been on my feet all day.
You are not tired?
I am tired.
I'm tired of you lying to me. I'm tired of you ignoring
a life-threatening illness, which needs to be treated.
Hey, hey, I promise...
if I get any worse, I will do IV, diuretics
and sodium restrictions and I will dry out my ascites.
It's not good enough.
You need the procedure. Carter, what is it
he needs?
A transjugular intrahepatic portal-systemic shunt.
Yes, well, interventional radiology
is a little hard to come by
when we do not even have an X-ray machine.
Which is why you need to go to Khartoum or Nairobi.
And when I'm lying in bed for a month,
who is going to take care of my patients?
Don't know. Who's going to take care of them
when you're dead?
( sighs )
Long day, huh?
The only thing longer than the days out here are the nights.
I'm okay, Carter. Really.
Could have fooled me.
This is nothing.
It's my weekly ritual.
Only way to get through the pain and suffering
that surrounds this place is to...
allow myself a good cry every now and then.
I feel better already.
So this has nothing to do with Stephen?
Stephen makes me angry. He doesn't make me cry.
You tell me. You're a doctor.
What's gonna happen if he doesn't get treated?
His condition's gonna get worse.
It's already worse.
( vehicle approaching )
It's the police. Hide her.
What? Where?
CARTER: What's going on?
It's the police. We got to hide her.
( groaning )
Another contraction? Where?
Let's put her in the bathroom.
Are these the same men that took my husband?
I don't know.
Ask them. I want to know what they have done with him.
Just make sure you keep her quiet.
( screams ) Okay, okay... Just breathe.
( speaking Arabic )
What's going on?
He is searching for Ishaak's wife.
I told him come in the morning,
search the camp.
( speaking Arabic )
He thinks we brought her here.
No, we don't, we don't treat patients here.
I told him that.
( speaking Arabic )
Now he wants to search the house. No.
The housing unit-- that's off-limits.
( speaking Arabic )
Hey, come on, you guys.
Do you know what time it is?
Everybody's sleeping inside.
Okay, okay...
They're in the house.
( agonized scream )
You have to keep her quiet.
She's in labor.
Try to breathe through the pain.
Breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe...
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh...
( rap music playing )
Hey, what's up, fellas?
Whoa, whoa, sorry. I'm next.
And I don't think it's gonna leave a scar.
Thanks for asking.
( pounding on door )
( pounding, speaking Arabic )
Look, I've been standing out here for 20 minutes, okay?
DAKARAI: Pratt.
All right.
( music stops )
What the hell are you doing?! Get out!
Get out!
Your superiors are going to hear about this.
( panting )
Something is wrong.
( screaming )
Hang in there. Hang in there, Sattina.
You're doing great. I feel the head.
PRATT: I see thick meconium.
Deceleration, a long one.
How low?
Low.
Occiput's posterior.
We do not have time for the baby to turn.
Prep for a C-section?
Are you out of your mind?
All right, Sittina,
your baby is showing signs of very serious distress.
A vaginal delivery is gonna be too dangerous.
We need to do a Caesarean.
No, please... save it.
I'm going to put some anesthesia in your back.
You will lose feeling from the waist down.
Okay, come on. Ready?
Ishaak! Oh, Ishaak!
Give me some more counterpressure there, Pratt.
Yep. Debbie, will you get a blanket?
Okay, I got it.
Here we go.
( grunting )
Got it.
It's a girl, Sittina.
DAKARAI: Allah has blessed you
with a healthy child.
( baby crying ) SITTINA: Get her to my husband.
There's a lot of blood in the pelvis.
CARTER: All right, try a little uterine massage in there.
I am. I got no suction.
I can't see where she's bleeding from.
SITTINA: Ishaak?
I need some sterile four-by-fours, and keep them coming.
If they find out who we are, they will kill him.
Who you are?
We helped to form the HRD.
What's she talking about?
HRD-- it's a human rights group based in Khartoum.
"Human Rights for Darfur."
They will kill him if they know.
Please...
Oh, man, she's bleeding out.
This was a bad idea.
We've got no blood, no pressors, no pit,
no methergine.
What are we supposed to do now?
She needs a hysterectomy.
We'll bring her to a hospital in Alfashir.
It's too late to drive. She'll have to go tomorrow.
Because of a bunch of thugs on camels.
They also have trucks and guns.
Lots and lots of guns.
I think I can tie off the uterine arteries.
That'll buy us some time.
Give me some O-chromic
on the longest needle we got. Not enough time.
Couple of hours, her uterus will start to become ischemic.
That is the best chance that we got right now.
I grew up in Detroit.
I can be in Alfashir in two hours. You didn't even want
to bring her here. PRATT: I know,
and I made a mistake.
If we'd left her back there, she never would've
delivered safely-- baby would've died.
Slow down, Pratt.
Okay, the uterine arteries are tied off.
This is the only chance she's got, you know it.
She may not even survive the trip.
Yeah, but she's dead if she stays here.
If she dies making the journey,
well, at least we tried.
Okay. I'll go with you.
No, John,
you and Debbie should go to the police.
Find Ishaak.
You have a much better chance of getting him out of there.
He and I, we'll close,
and then we will bring her on to the hospital.
All right.
Okay.
Assalamu alaikum.
( speaking Arabic )
We'd like to see Ishaak Alazhari.
No.
You can't see him.
Why not?
He's under arrest.
On what charge?
He's been shot, he needs
medical attention. CARTER: I'm a doctor.
I would like to evaluate his medical condition.
How's she doing back there?
She is breathing.
What the hell is that?
Janjaweed.
We must go back.
Oh, we got a traffic jam.
If we stop, they will take the truck...
leave her to die,
or worse.
Okay. All right, then we don't stop.
Just cover her up and hold on.
Now, hold on, Dakarai!
Pratt!
Hold on!
( gunshots ) Look out!
Oh!
Get down, Dakarai!
( Sadig speaking Arabic )
Did you tell him that we work for the Alliance?
The Ramalah Camp.
Mm-hmm.
All right, look, is it money?
'Cause I can get some.
( speaking Arabic )
You must leave now.
Oh, no, I want... I would like to speak to your boss.
Very busy.
Should I tell him that you walked in
on this American woman while she was bathing?
Or should I tell the consulate
that an American woman's privacy was violated?
How much money?
DEBBIE: Ishaak? Ishaak, can you hear me?
I need to see him.
No, I need to go in there.
( coughs )
He's not responding.
He's dead.
The tire is flat.
Yeah. I think they hit the oil pan and the radiator, too.
She's getting pretty hot.
What is that?
Lasix for...?
Prozac for your driving.
How fast can a horse go with a rider?
I don't know, maybe 30 miles an hour.
Okay.
So, we'd be going 45 miles an hour
right before the, uh, tire blew out.
It's more like 50.
Okay, good.
Then we've got enough time.
For what?
To change the tire.
Maybe somebody in that village can help us out over there.
( scoffs ): Maybe...
Ah!
If there were somebody living there.
( groans )
You all right?
DAKARAI: Yes.
( engine shuts off )
( door slams )
( panting )
The people we treat every day... it is places
like this from which they come...
before the Janjaweed burn them out.
( panting ): Oh.
( horn honking )
He's got agonal respirations and a thready pulse.
He's alive? Barely.
Don't tell the police.
You ready to lift?
One, two, three, go!
All right, Zahra, I want you to get another IV started
and get him back on oxygen.
What can I do to help?
You can transfer a unit of O-neg out of the fridge,
and when she's done, you can squeeze in a liter of saline.
He's got decreased breath sounds on the right.
Possible hemo-pneumo.
He'd going to need a chest tube.
I'll get it. Where do you keep them? We don't.
Uh, we're going to have to improvise.
Get me a scalpel and a curved Kelly
and a... NG tube.
As soon as the blood that's compressing his lung
is removed, his pulse
should get stronger.
DEBBIE: What about the bleeding? Should stop.
If it doesn't?
Why don't you see if you can go radio Dakarai?
They should be in Alfashir by now.
Ow!
Do we have any extra water?!
DAKARAI: No.
What about saline?
Four liters.
Okay, toss me one.
Ah!
Yeah.
I got to say, this is the first time
I've ever given a bolus to a truck before.
( chuckles )
( shouting Arabic )
PRATT: Take it easy, man.
( shouting Arabic )
( speaking Arabic )
We just want to get her to the hospital.
Please tell him that.
I'm trying!
( speaking Arabic )
No!
( horse neighing )
( panting )
His friends will not be far behind.
If you try and save him,
we will never get away from here.
There is nothing you can do for him now.
Come on. Get up.
Come on!
Watch your step!
All right, go.
Oh! Oh, damn!
What?
The engine has seized.
We're going to have to hoof it.
We got to walk from here.
DAKARAI: I can't!
Why the hell not?!
I don't think I can walk,
and I will only slow you down.
I can't leave you here.
You have to. No way.
Why don't you leave me the rifle?
Then perhaps I can occupy his friends
while you get to Alfashir.
How far away's the city from here?
It is still several miles, but you can get there.
And you really think she's going to make it?
She will die if you don't.
You ever fire one of these?
I have never held a weapon.
PRATT: Just point and shoot.
Okay, Sittina.
We're going to go on foot patrol from here on in.
I'm going to give you a little something
for the pain, okay?
( speaking Arabic )
( speaking Arabic )
What... what the hell is she saying?
She called us angels.
I said there are no angels here.
Speak for yourself.
( gunshots )
( rapid gunfire )
You ever been to Mozambique, Sittina?
Hear they got great beaches there.
White sands, cool waters...
Yeah, I definitely got to get me to Mozambique.
( rumbling in distance )
( panting )
Okay.
Either those are the good guys,
and we're saved...
or they're bad guys, and we're dead.
Either way...
I'm done walking.
( groans )
Very sick.
That's right.
( speaking Arabic )
I tell him fast.
Good. You're English?
James Bond? 007?
( hums theme song ): Duh-duh-duh-duh.
Duh-duh-duh-duh. No.
American? Rambro?
( imitates gunfire )
Yeah. Rambro.
Good stuff.
Help me! Please! Please!
I need a doctor!
Please!
( strained grunting )
( Pratt speaking Arabic )
Please!
( breathlessly ): She needs saline, blood,
antibiotics and a surgeon.
Hurry!
( panting )
( baby crying )
Good stuff.
( quietly ): Yeah.
Good stuff.
( panting )
( panting )
CARTER: Ishaak's doing much better.
The bleeding's stopped.
That's good.
He keeps asking for Sittina.
No word yet.
Did you try the radio?
They stopped answering the radio hours ago.
Still...
There's no signal, John,
and I haven't resorted to sending smoke signals yet.
Okay.
Sorry.
Come on.
Let's go introduce him to his daughter.
PRATT: Whoa! Stop! Stop! Stop!
Careful! Careful!
( panting )
( panting )
( blowing )
( tapping object )
Come on. Let's go.
Let's go.
We had hoped to be back in our village before the child came.
To be born in this place--
it wasn't what we wanted for our child.
( baby fussing )
Now I can only hope that before she is grown up,
we can go back to our village.
( baby quiets )
( clears throat ): We tried calling the hospital in Alfashir,
but we haven't been able to find out anything yet.
She's there.
I'm sure of it.
ZAHRA: Dr. Carter.
Greg, you gave us quite a scare.
The van broke down.
Turns out even in Africa, cabs don't stop for a brother.
Sittina?
She's going to be okay.
They're working on her in town.
She should be able to come back in a few days.
( speaks Arabic )
You guys fixed him up pretty good.
Nice job.
Greg, where's Stephen?
He couldn't keep going...
and Sittina...
Tell me.
I left him on the road.
Where?
At a burned-out village.
I went back for him,
but by the time I got there,
I could tell the Janjaweed had been there.
They torched the truck.
Here.
I'm sorry.
We need to go out and look for him.
No, it's too late.
Be dark by the time we get there.
I'll take you out first thing in the morning.
PRATT: Debbie.
We didn't have a lot of options.
I mean, if we stayed, we'd all be dead.
He made me keep going.
You did what you had to do.
So did Dakarai.
Can you work?
Yeah, in a minute.
Okay.
Did you name her yet?
Yes.
Amala.
That's beautiful.
It means "hope."
( sighs )
( children chattering )
*
( indistinct conversations )
DAKARAI ( breathlessly ): Yes, it is good to see you.
( Pratt laughing )
( Dakarai panting )
After they had
burned the truck, I saw no reason to stick around.
( speaks Arabic )
( speaks Arabic )
Anyway, it was safer to walk.
Especially after all of your driving.
( both laughing )
Well, I'm glad you made it back...
You are well? I am now.
( both laughing )
Why didn't you go to Alfashir, you dummy?
They could've treated you there.
Maybe next week.
Ibrahim, let's take him to the clinic.
Tell Zahra to start him on lactulose and saline.
( chuckles )
Careful. Careful.
Careful.
PRATT: That's one stubborn son of a bitch.
CARTER: I know the type.
You know, Carter... ( sighs )
I know I got my way of being.
That damn sure doesn't mean I don't see or...
feel everything that's going on around me.
Tell you the truth,
I never wanted to be around this type of suffering.
I mean, who would?
But I am glad I came here.
I'm glad you came, too.
'Cause I sure as hell am not going to take the blame for that van.
Oh, gee, thanks.
It's okay. They'll take it out of your paycheck.
What do you mean?
We actually get paid for this?
Whoa! Hey!
Okay. Where we going?
( Pratt chuckles, boy chatters )
