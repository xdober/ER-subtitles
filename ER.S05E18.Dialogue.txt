PREVIOUSLY ON E.R.:
YOU DON'T NEED ME TO TELL YOU THIS
BUT IT'S OKAY FOR YOU TO MISS HIM.
HELL, I MISS HIM.
IT'S POSSIBLE THAT
HE MAY NEED SURGERY.
DO YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO MOBALAGE?
HE WAS TORTURED IN NIGERIA, RIGHT?
TURNS OUT MR. IKABO
CAME INTO THE COUNTRY ON A FORGED VISA.
HE'S AN ILLEGAL.
SEND HIM BACK TO NIGERIA?
THE I.N.S. WILL START A DEPORTATION HEARING.
YOU'LL NEED THE DOUGH IF YOU ACCEPT
THE CARDIOTHORACIC FELLOWSHIP.
TRACKING DOWN YOUR BIRTH PARENTS
IS NOT SOMETHING YOU SHOULD DO LIGHTLY.
YOU'RE WHAT?
I'M PREGNANT.
( knocking on door )
( knocking )
Woman: CAROL?
DOUG?
MOM.
YOU'RE STILL HERE.
HUH?
I KNOCKED BEFORE I USED MY KEY.
I THOUGHT YOU HAD LEFT.
I WAS JUST RESTING.
WHAT TIME IS IT?
UM... 8:30.
OH, MAN, I'M LATE.
WHERE'S DOUG?
HE LEFT.
I THOUGHT YOU WENT IN TOGETHER.
NO. NOT ANYMORE.
I HAD EXTRA HOLUBTCI FROM EVONNE'S SHOWER.
I KNOW HE LIKES IT.
ARE YOU...
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
YEAH, I'M FINE.
I'M FINE.
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU STAY HEALTHY
WORKING IN THAT PLACE.
HAVE YOU EATEN?
I'M NOT HUNGRY.
CALL IN SICK. I'LL MAKE YOU BREAKFAST.
MA, I'VE GOT TO GO.
LOCK UP WHEN YOU LEAVE, ALL RIGHT?
CAROL?
YEAH?
ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE OKAY?
I'M FINE.
WE'LL TALK LATER, ALL RIGHT?
I'LL CALL YOU.
WHY WAS IT RESCHEDULED ANYWAY?
OH, COME ON. YOU'RE KIDDING.
REESE, UH-UH. HERE. HERE YOU GO.
NO. I HAVE AN APPOINTMENT
WITH THE NEW SCHOOL FOR REESE.
THE ONLY HAVE OPEN HOUSE ONCE A MONTH
AND I'VE ALREADY MISSED IT TWICE.
TELL ROMANO YOU CALLED AND I WASN'T HOME.
YEAH. NO. HELLO. NO, NO, NO. I DON'T WANT...
DR. ROMANO.
NO. LISTEN. UH... I'M OFF THIS MORNING.
THE EARLIEST I CAN GET THERE IS NOON.
YEAH, I KNOW, BUT I CAN'T...
HOLD ON. HOLD ON.
REESE, NO! NO, REESE!
THIS IS NO. NO!
NO!
THAT'S NO.
HEY, HEY. HERE.
TAKE THAT.
PLAY WITH THAT.
YEAH. I'M SORRY.
I HAVE AN IMPORTANT APPOINTMENT, OKAY?
I CAN'T...
YEAH. YEAH.
ALL RIGHT.
I'LL BE THERE IN HALF AN HOUR.
JERK.
REESE!
NO, REESE. NOT YOUR HEARING AID!
NO, NO, NO, NO!
DAMN!
NO, NO, NO.
MR. DELUZ, TIME FOR YOUR MEDS.
Weaver: NEED SOME HELP HERE.
JUST A MINUTE.
NO, NOW. I NEED O2.
WE DON'T PROVIDE THAT HERE.
THEN I NEED SOME PILLOWS
TO HELP PROP UP HER HEAD TO HELP HER BREATHE.
OF COURSE.
SHE'S REALLY ALTERED.
IS THAT HER BASELINE?
NO. MRS. BRENNAN WAS AGITATED THIS MORNING.
I'VE GOT A P.R.N. ORDER FOR HALDOL.
SHE'S HYPOXIC.
HAVE YOU LISTENED TO HER LUNGS?
THAT'S NOT WHAT WE DO HERE.
WE'RE STRICTLY BOARD AND CARE.
YOU SHOULD HAVE CALLED SOMEBODY.
HER LUNGS ARE WET, AND SHE'S GOT PITTING EDEMA.
DR. DAVIS INCREASED HER LASIX
FROM 40 TO 80 MILLIGRAMS.
AND HE HASN'T SEEN HER SINCE?
WE'VE GOT TO PUSH I.V. MEDS.
LOOK, I'M A L.V.N.
I CAN ARRANGE FOR AN R.N. TO COME OUT TOMORROW.
TOMORROW? SHE'S IN CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE.
YOU CALL 911.
SHE'S D.N.R.
CALL 911 NOW.
YOU'RE NOT HER DOCTOR.
NO, I'M HER DAUGHTER.
GROUP THERAPY IN YOUR FIRST WEEK?
THAT'S WHAT MY INTERN SAID.
I OBSERVED MY FIRST TWO WEEKS OF PSYCH ROTATION.
I BELIEVE HE USED THE WORDS "SINK OR SWIM."
HE'S JUST TRYING TO SCARE YOU.
I'M NOT SCARED, I'M ACTUALLY GOOD AT THIS STUFF.
WHAT'S THAT... MENTAL ILLNESS?
SHUT UP.
SORRY I'M LATE. THAT'S OKAY.
NOW THAT YOU'RE OUT OF MANAGEMENT
YOU CAN SLACK OFF WITH THE REST OF US.
HEY, CAROL. HI.
SO, CARTER, WHERE DO YOU WANT ME?
OH, I DON'T KNOW. LET'S SEE...
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE THE HEMATURIA.
AFTER YOUR WORK-UP, WE'LL DISCUSS YOUR PLAN.
OKEYDOKE.
DID I MISS SOMETHING?
YEAH, CARTER IS SENIOR FOR THE DAY.
PART OF YOUR CHIEF RESIDENT APPLICATION?
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
FOR THE NEXT EIGHT HOURS
IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM, GO TO HIM.
PEACHY. GOOD LUCK.
YEAH, YOU, TOO.
JERRY, WHERE ARE ALL THE PENS?
I DON'T KNOW.
SOME IDIOT'S IDEA OF AN APRIL FOOL'S JOKE.
WELL, GO DOWN TO SUPPLY
AND STEAL A COUPLE, WOULD YOU?
AH!
I GOT YOU.
1.5 VOLTS IS PRETTY COOL.
REAL MATURE.
OH, COME ON, IT'S APRIL FOOL'S.
JERRY, I'D WATCH MY BACK IF I WERE YOU.
I'VE GOT AN ANXIOUS HEMORRHOIDS IN FOUR
AND A KID WITH A HIGH FEVER IN TRIAGE.
TALK TO DR. CARTER.
DR. GREENE?
HOW DID IT GO?
WE GOT A PROBLEM.
DID YOU GET MY AFFIDAVIT?
YEAH, THAT'S FINE
BUT I CAN ONLY GET THE CONTINUANCE
FOR PHYSICAL DISABILITY
IF MOBALAGE REMAINS HOSPITALIZED.
SHOULDN'T BE A PROBLEM.
UROLOGY STILL HAS HIM ON THE SURGICAL SERVICE.
I.N.S. CONFIRMED HE WAS BEING DISCHARGED THIS MORNING.
WHERE DID YOU GET THAT?
UH, ELIZABETH CORDAY.
THOUGHT YOU HAD AN OPEN HOUSE OR SOMETHING?
YEAH, WELL, WEINSTEIN PUSHED UP A LUNG RESECTION.
WEINSTEIN... THE CARDIOTHORACIC GURU?
YEAH, HE GOT TICKETS TO SOME COLLEGE BASEBALL GAME
SO REESE HAS TO STAY IN DAY CARE FOR ANOTHER MONTH.
YEAH. NO, IT WAS ONLY IN THERE FOR A FEW SECONDS.
I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE THE WATER DIDN'T DAMAGE IT.
REESE'S HEARING AID.
HOW MUCH?
DON'T ASK.
OKAY, I KNOW, BUT IS THERE ANY WAY TO TEST IT?
COME ON, PETER, WEINSTEIN'S READY FOR US.
YEAH, HOLD ON. I KNOW-- HEY!
I SAID, LET'S GO.
DON'T EVER DO THAT.
ARE YOU DEAF? I SAID LET'S GO.
I'M TRYING TO FIX MY SON'S HEARING AID.
ONE WORD, PETER-- NANNY.
I CAN THINK OF A WORD OF MY OWN.
GET OUT NOW, ELIZABETH.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
IN A FEW MONTHS, YOU'LL HAVE YOUR LICENSE
AND YOUR PICK OF FIFTH-YEAR RESIDENCIES.
OH, IT'S ALL RIGHT.
I THINK I FOUND A WAY TO LIMIT MY ROMANO EXPOSURE.
OH, YEAH.
WHAT'S THAT? GARLIC?
( chuckling ): TRAUMA SURGERY.
A FELLOWSHIP RUN OUT OF THE E.R.
IT WOULD START IN JULY.
I DIDN'T KNOW THERE WAS A TRAUMA FELLOWSHIP.
WELL, THERE WASN'T.
TRAUMA IS THE REASON WHY I CAME TO THE STATES
IN THE FIRST PLACE.
THE HOURS ARE BETTER
AND I'D HAVE SOME SEMBLANCE OF A NORMAL LIFE.
YEAH, WE GOT DISCONNECTED.
I'M THE ONE WITH THE HEARING AID...
ELIZABETH?
OH, MARK, I NEED TO SPEAK TO YOU.
THE I.N.S. CALLED ABOUT MOBALAGE.
I KNOW. DID YOU DISCHARGE HIM?
I DIDN'T VOLUNTEER ANY INFORMATION
BUT I COULDN'T LIE.
HE WAS AFEBRILE.
HIS WOUND WAS DRY, CLEAN AND INTACT.
DID YOU DISCHARGE HIM?
YES.
WHEN DID HE LEAVE?
I DON'T KNOW IF TRANSPORT'S TAKEN HIM DOWN YET.
IS THERE A PROBLEM?
WE'RE TRYING TO GET A PHYSICAL DISABILITY CONTINUANCE.
ON A PUDENDAL ARTERY BYPASS?
AS LONG AS HE WAS HOSPITALIZED
WE COULD AVOID A DEPORTATION HEARING.
NOW, HE'LL HAVE TO SEE THE JUDGE.
ONE LOOK AT THE SCARS
AND THE JUDGE WILL GRANT HIM ASYLUM.
IT DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY.
MOBALAGE HAS TO TESTIFY; DESCRIBE THE TORTURE.
ISN'T IT OBVIOUS?
APPARENTLY NOT TO THE GOVERNMENT.
THEY NEED A RECORD-- A SWORN STATEMENT.
WHAT, AND MOBALAGE REFUSES TO GIVE IT?
I DON'T THINK HE CAN.
AFTER HIS NAP, HE WAS A LITTLE UPSET.
I THOUGHT IT WAS A NIGHTMARE.
BUT HE WOULDN'T STOP CRYING.
TEMP'S 101.
NOW I CAN'T WAKE HIM UP.
IS HE ON ANY MEDICATIONS?
NO.
HAS HE EVER BEEN HOSPITALIZED?
NEVER. HE'S A HEALTHY KID.
HE COULD BE SEPTIC.
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
WELL, WE NEED TO TREAT HIM
WITH ANTIBIOTICS RIGHT AWAY
AND THEN PERFORM SOME TESTS
TO FIND OUT THE SOURCE OF THE INFECTION.
JERRY, IS TRAUMA ONE OPEN?
YEAH. YOU'RE IN EARLY.
AH, BE RIGHT BACK.
HEY, WHO'S THIS?
CRITICAL PATIENT. PULMONARY EDEMA.
I NEED A MONITORED BED.
B.P.'s BORDERLINE AT 95
AFTER HER FIFTH NITRO SPRAY.
YOU GUYS ARE ONLY SUPPOSED TO GIVE THREE.
I GAVE IT TO HER.
OH, YOU DOING A RIDE-ALONG?
SET UP A NITRO DRIP-- HURRY.
I DON'T WANT TO INTUBATE.
NO EXTRAORDINARY MEASURES.
BOARD AND CARE SAYS SHE'S A D.N.R.
SET UP BIPAP-- WE'LL GO FROM THERE.
HOW'S YOUR BREATHING, MA'AM?
I'M, UH... I'M, UH...
SHE'S ALTERED, CARTER.
ON MY COUNT-- ONE, TWO, THREE.
GENTLY.
CALL UPSTAIRS, SEE IF WE HAVE A I.C.U. BED.
LET'S GET SOME ADMIT LABS.
CHEST FILM, E.K.G., BLOOD GAS.
B.P.'s 100/75, RESPS 20.
TACHY AT 130.
SHE'S PRETTY GORKED OUT.
I CAN TAKE IT FROM HERE.
PUT IN A FOLEY-- WHERE'S MY 12 LEAD?
I'LL TAKE IT FROM HERE.
THIS ONE'S MINE.
I'M SENIOR FOR THE DAY, REMEMBER?
I'M RUNNING THE BIG BOARD.
SO, GO RUN IT.
OKAY.
Weaver: CAROL, WHERE'S THE NITRO?
I GOT TO CLEAR AN AIR BUBBLE.
OKAY, THEN GIVE HER ANOTHER SUB-LINGUAL SPRAY, NOW.
DR. SADOWINSKI IS AN EXPERT IN THESE KIND OF CASES.
I JUST WANT YOU TO MEET HIM.
BUT I'VE ALREADY TALKED TO YOUR PSYCHIATRIST.
BUT, TALK TO THIS ONE.
MOBALAGE, THEY WILL SEND YOU BACK.
HE'S NOT BEEN THROUGH ENOUGH?
KUBBY.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT EITHER.
I'M NOT AN IMMIGRATION EXPERT.
BUT I DO KNOW THAT YOU TELLING YOUR STORY
IS THE ONLY WAY THAT YOU CAN STAY.
LET ME JUST GET YOU A LITTLE TIME TO THINK ABOUT IT.
I'LL TAKE YOU DOWN TO THE E.R.
YOU'RE FEVERISH--
PULSE IS TACHY.
IF ANYBODY ASKS YOU
YOU'RE EXPERIENCING BELLY PAIN.
GO.
OKAY.
Romano: I NEVER IMAGINED FROZEN SPERM
WOULD BE A GOOD INVESTMENT.
Weinstein: IT'S TRICKY--
YOU'VE GOT TO BUY THE BEST.
GOOD OF YOU TO JOIN US, PETER.
SORRY, I HAD TO REARRANGE MY SCHEDULE.
OH, THAT'S ALL RIGHT; IN ANOTHER TEN YEARS
YOU GET TO SET THE SCHEDULE.
SO YOU ONLY INSEMINATE ARABIANS?
NO, THOROUGHBREDS TOO.
REMIND ME, I'LL GET YOU A BROCHURE.
YOU LIKE HORSES, PETER?
YEAH, YEAH.
YEAH, NEITHER DID I.
BUT THEY GOT A BIG UPSIDE
ONCE YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING.
YOU OUGHT TO KEEP THAT IN MIND.
THANKS.
DR. WEINSTEIN, YOUR OFFICE SAYS
A SALES REP FROM SYMATAC IS WAITING.
OH, DAMN, I FORGOT.
THIS GUY'S GOING TO COMP ME A NEW THORACOSCOPE.
OKAY IF WE PUSH THIS BACK TO 1:00?
YEAH, SURE, NO SWEAT.
OKAY, I'LL SEE YOU THEN.
END OF SHIFT?
OH, NO, JUST STARTED.
YOU?
POST CALL-- SIX HOURS TO GO.
FEELS LIKE THIS INTERNSHIP'S NEVER GOING TO END.
IT ALWAYS FEELS LIKE THAT.
THAT LOOKS REALLY GOOD.
I'M FAMISHED.
I JUST CAN'T EAT ANYTHING, YOU KNOW?
I'M TRYING TO KEEP SOMETHING DOWN, BUT...
HERE.
THANKS.
MORNING SICKNESS?
YEAH...
AND I'M REALLY, REALLY TIRED.
HAVE YOU SEEN YOUR O.B.?
YOU'VE NOT MADE A DECISION.
YOU KNOW, THREE MONTHS AGO, I WAS WORRIED
THAT I COULDN'T EVEN GET PREGNANT
AND NOW, HERE I AM, ALL ALONE.
I WANTED TO HAVE A BABY WITH DOUG.
I DON'T WANT TO BE A SINGLE MOTHER.
DO YOU HAVE TO BE?
I MEAN, HAVE YOU SPOKEN WITH DOUG?
I SEE ALL THESE PREGNANT WOMEN PARADING THROUGH HERE--
LOST, FRIGHTENED, NOT KNOWING WHAT TO DO.
OKAY, AND WHAT DO YOU TELL THEM?
I ALWAYS SAY, GO WITH YOUR GUT
'CAUSE MOST OF THE TIME IT'S RIGHT.
SO, WHAT DOES YOURS TELL YOU?
Greene: I NEED SOMEBODY
FROM SURGERY ON BOARD.
YOU DISCHARGED MOBALAGE
SO ACCORDING TO BOUNCE-BACK RULES, HE'S YOURS.
I KNOW, BUT THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH HIM.
MMM, THE INCISION LOOKS A LITTLE ERYTHEMATOUS
AROUND THE SUTURES.
COULD BE A WOUND INFECTION.
MARK...
I DON'T NEED YOU TO TAKE HIM UPSTAIRS RIGHT AWAY.
JUST SIGN THE READMIT ORDERS
AND WE'LL OBSERVE HIM DOWN HERE IN THE E.R.
YOU WANT ME TO FALSIFY HIS CHART.
JUST TRYING TO BUY HIM SOME TIME.
HIS LAWYER'S ALREADY ON HIS WAY TO SEE THE JUDGE
TO TELL HIM HE'S BEING READMITTED.
YOU'RE ASKING ME TO LIE, TO SIGN MY NAME TO A LIE.
I'M ASKING YOU TO HELP HIM.
( sighing ): GIVE IT TO ME.
THANK YOU.
HEY, MARK, THINK I CAN GET YOU TO SEE A COUPLE PATIENTS?
IN A SECOND, CARTER.
JERRY, DID YOU STEAL MY STETHOSCOPE?
NOPE. HAVEN'T SEEN IT.
WHY WOULD SOMEBODY PICK THAT ONE
OUT OF ALL THOSE PENS?
'CAUSE IT'S SHINY.
MALIK, I NEED POSTURAL VITAL SIGNS
ON BED THREE AND...
YOU CAN DISCHARGE MR. DUDLY.
COME ON, JERRY, I NEED IT.
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK I TOOK IT?
AW, COME ON, MAN.
STEALING STUFF?
WHERE'S THE CREATIVITY IN THAT?
Weaver: THERE HAS TO BE A CONTACT PERSON
FOR THE BOARD AND CARE.
NO. HER FEES ARE PAID FOR OUT OF HER PENSION.
THANK GOD YOU FOUND HER.
SHE WAS TOTALLY ABANDONED.
SH-SHE WAS GOING TO DIE THERE, ALONE.
SOMETIMES THEY'RE GONE BEFORE WE FIND THEM.
CAN YOU DO A MORE EXTENSIVE SEARCH--
FIND OUT WHERE SHE'S FROM, ANY OTHER CHILDREN, MAYBE...
MAYBE FIND MY FATHER?
SURE, I'LL CHECK IT OUT.
PAGE ME IF YOU NEED ANYTHING.
THANKS.
IS THAT YOU, CLAIRE?
NO, MY NAME IS KERRY.
YOU WERE HAVING TROUBLE BREATHING
SO WE HAD TO BRING YOU TO THE HOSPITAL.
HOSPITAL?
NOW, DON'T WORRY.
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE
VERY GOOD CARE OF YOU, I PROMISE.
OH.
ATIVAN'S ON BOARD, BUT HE'S STILL TACHYCARDIAC.
OKAY, LET'S ADD A BLOOD AND URINE TOX SCREEN.
COULD HE HAVE INGESTED ANYTHING--
UH, SOMETHING FROM THE MEDICINE CABINET MAYBE?
NO. I DON'T THINK SO.
I THOUGHT IT WAS AN INFECTION.
YOU DON'T USUALLY GET DILATED PUPILS WITH MENINGITIS.
B.P.'s UP TO 170/90.
Carter: ANYTHING, UM...
COLD MEDICINE, NICOTINE, BUG SPRAY?
ALL THAT STUFF'S PUT AWAY.
YOUR HOUSE IS CHILDPROOFED?
NO.
I-I ONLY HAVE HIM EVERY SO OFTEN.
HE SLEEPS IN MY ROOM.
OH, MY GOD.
WHAT? THE DRAWER WAS CLOSED.
WHAT WAS IN IT?
THERE ARE DIFFERENT TREATMENTS
FOR DIFFERENT TOXINS.
IF I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE INGESTED
HE COULD DIE.
IT WAS ONLY, LIKE, HALF A GRAM.
HALF A GRAM OF WHAT?
COCAINE?
GET DR. GREENE.
N.G. TUBE, ACTIVATED CHARCOAL.
START I.V. ESMOLOL
50 MIKES PER KILO PER MINUTE.
SIR, YOU MIGHT WANT TO WAIT OUTSIDE.
NO, I WANT TO BE WITH HIM.
THIS IS GOING TO BE MESSY.
THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
HALEH. OUT...
NOW.
Women and children: * ...ON MY THUMB *
* WITH A KNICK-KNACK PADDY-WHACK *
* GIVE A DOG A BONE
* THIS OLD MAN CAME ROLLING HOME *
* THIS OLD MAN
* HE PLAYED TWO

* GIVE A DOG A BONE
* THIS OLD MAN CAME ROLLING HOME *
* THIS OLD MAN
* HE PLAYED FOUR...
Weaver: NO.
I NEED AN I.C.U. BED, YEAH.
SHE NEEDS AGGRESSIVE DIURESIS.
I THOUGHT A BETA BLOCKADE WOULD DO IT.
SHE IS NOT STABLE ENOUGH FOR TELEMETRY.
IT WAS A GOOD PICKUP, THOUGH.
HEY, DR. WEAVER, DID YOU HEAR ABOUT THIS ONE?
GUY LEAVES HIS COCAINE
WHERE HIS THREE-YEAR-OLD CAN FIND IT.
DID YOU CALL D.C.F.S.?
OH! WHAT THE HELL?
JERRY. JERRY.
DR. GREENE...
MOBALAGE IS ASKING FOR YOU.
IS DR. SADOWINSKI HERE?
YES, BUT MOBALAGE WANTS YOU THERE.
HE TRUSTS YOU.
Haleh: RED-BLANKET BABY.
SOME SCHIZOPHRENIC DELIVERED IN THE STREET.
CARTER, YOU GOT IT?
UH, SURE, YEAH.
GIVE ME A HAND?
Mobalage: I DON'T KNOW.
THERE WAS A HOOD OVER MY FACE.
( chair sliding )
WERE YOU FRIGHTENED?
I THOUGHT I WAS ABOUT TO DIE.
THEN WHAT?
THEY TOOK YOU TO A CELL.
YES.
WHAT KIND OF CELL?
IT WAS COLD.
WHAT DID IT LOOK LIKE?
I DON'T KNOW, SIR.
THEY KEPT THE HOOD ON YOUR HEAD?
YES.
THEN WHAT?
THEY CAME AND GOT YOU?
( sighs )
HOW LONG BEFORE THEY CAME BACK?
MOBALAGE...
WHAT HAPPENED NEXT?
I CANNOT TELL YOU.
WHY?
'CAUSE I DO NOT REMEMBER.
Woman: WHERE'S MY BABY?
SHE'S IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET
HOLDING THE NEWBORN BABY.
IT WAS STILL WET WITH AMNIOTIC FLUID.
B.P.'s 140/90.
HOW MUCH BLOOD LOSS?
UH, ABOUT A PAD SINCE WE FOUND HER.
START AN I.V. CALL O.B.
OKAY, GOOD BREATH SOUNDS.
NO. NO. WHERE-WHERE'S MY...
HOW DID SHE CUT HER FOREHEAD?
SHE MUST HAVE FALLEN ON THE SIDEWALK.
DID THEY FIND THE PLACENTA?
SHE SAID A DOG ATE IT.
OKAY. IRRIGATE THIS SCALP LAC.
GET ME A SPECULUM.
I'LL DO A PELVIC.
HEY, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE
WHERE IS MY BABY? WHERE?
I'LL GO CHECK ON HIM RIGHT NOW, ALL RIGHT?
OKAY?
( whimpering )
LET'S GIVE HER FIVE OF HALDOL, I.M.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
HOW'S THE MOTHER?
SHE NEEDS HER HEAD SUTURED
AND I'M GIVING HER HALDOL.
HOW'S IT GOING?
MOTTLED AND LETHARGIC INITIALLY
BUT WE'RE WARMING HIM UP.
GOOD COLOR. GOOD TONE. PULSE 140.
LOOKS FULL TERM.
Hathaway: WHAT IS THAT?
IS THAT A GARBAGE TIE?
AT LEAST SHE KNEW TO CLAMP IT OFF.
GIVE ME AN UMBILICAL CLAMP AND SOME BETADINE.
YOU GOING TO DO A HEEL STICK?
YEAH. WHERE ARE THE 22-BUTTERFLIES?
TRY THE PEDES ROOM.
OKAY, LET'S GET A NEWBORN SCREEN
AND A CAP GAS.
SHE STOLE MY BABY.
GIVE HIM BACK TO ME.
HONEY, YOU HAVE TO GO BACK IN AND LIE DOWN.
NO.
HALEH, CALL SECURITY.
YOU CAN'T HAVE HIM.
HE'S MINE.
YEAH, WE'RE JUST TAKING CARE OF HIM.
CAN I HOLD HIM?
NOT RIGHT NOW.
WE'RE GOING BACK IN THE OTHER ROOM.
WE'RE GOING TO STITCH UP THAT CUT
ON YOUR FOREHEAD
AND THEN YOU CAN COME BACK IN AND SEE HIM
I PROMISE, ALL RIGHT?
I LOVE MY BABY.
I KNOW. I LOVE
MY BABY. YEAH, OKAY.
NO!
( metal clattering )
GIVE HIM BACK TO ME!
GIVE HIM TO ME!
COCO, YOU HAVE TO LET GO NOW.
NO, CAN'T HAVE HIM. HE'S MINE!
LET GO, COCO... NO. NO.
HELP!
NO! NO!
HE'S MY BABY! OUT. GET HER OUT.
COME ON. COME ON. NO!
HE'S MY BABY!
YOU... NO!
YOU CANNOT HAVE HIM!
HE'S MINE!
TAKE IT EASY. NO!
NO!
ANY SIGNS OF TRAUMA?
NO. HE SEEMS OKAY.
( Coco continues crying )
ARE YOU OKAY?
YEAH.
( whispering ): OKAY, SWEETIE.
HEY, KERRY, YOU GOT A MINUTE?
IF YOU WANT TO WALK WITH ME.
I WAS WONDERING, WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO
WITH OUR STERNAL SAW STUDY?
WELL, AS SOON AS I FINISH
COMPILING THE DATA I'LL PASS IT ON TO YOU.
I WAS THINKING
MAYBE WE SHOULD WRITE A PAPER TOGETHER.
OH. I ASSUMED
YOU'D WANT TO WRITE YOURS SEPARATELY.
WHY WOULD YOU THINK THAT?
DIFFERENT SPECIALTIES, DIFFERENT JOURNALS.
COME ON. IT WAS A JOINT STUDY.
IT SHOULD BE A JOINT PAPER.
I THINK IT'S BETTER SUITED
FOR AN EMERGENCY MEDICINE JOURNAL ANYWAY.
SURE. PETER, THAT WOULD BE GREAT.
OKAY, I'LL CALL YOU.
HEY, KERRY, YOU KNOW, I HEARD THAT THERE MIGHT BE
A SURGICAL TRAUMA FELLOWSHIP RUN OUT OF THE E.R.
DID ROMANO TELL YOU THAT?
NO. WHY?
UH, CONFIDENTIALLY
WE'RE TRYING TO GO AROUND HIM.
OH. YEAH, WELL, THAT MAKES SENSE.
SO, IS IT AN OPEN APPLICATION PROCESS?
ANSPAUGH'S TAKING IT TO THE BOARD NEXT WEEK.
ARE YOU INTERESTED?
UM, I MIGHT BE, YEAH.
OKAY, I'LL LET YOU KNOW.
THANKS.
YOU SAID HE HAD TO STAY ADMITTED.
I HAD HIM READMITTED.
BUT THE JUDGE SUSPECTS WE'RE STALLING.
I'LL TALK TO THE JUDGE.
GOVERNMENT PROSECUTORS ARE COMING TOMORROW
TO TAKE A DEPOSITION.
OFF THAT, THE COURT WILL REVIEW
AND MAKE ITS DECISION.
HE WON'T BE ABLE TO TELL THEM ANYTHING.
IF HE WANTS TO STAY IN THE COUNTRY, HE'LL HAVE TO.
HE DOESN'T REMEMBER.
ANYTHING?
THE ABDUCTION, NOT THE TORTURE.
THEY MUST HAVE SEEN POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS BEFORE.
PEOPLE CLAIM IT ALL THE TIME.
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.
WE HAVE PHYSICAL EVIDENCE.
LOOK, I'M NOT ARGUING THEIR POSITION.
I'M SIMPLY TELLING YOU WHAT THE REALITY IS.
WITHOUT A SWORN STATEMENT
SPECIFIC TO THE TORTURE, IT CAN GO EITHER WAY.
HOW'S THE BABY DOING?
BLOOD GLUCOSE IS GOOD-- UP TO 68.
HE'S IN THE NURSERY EATING LIKE A CHAMP.
GOOD. HOW WE DOING IN HERE?
SHE'S THROWING P.V.C.s.
DON'T WORRY. SHE'S GORKED OUT.
HOW LONG? WHAT?
HAS SHE BEEN THROWING P.V.C.s?
I DON'T KNOW. I JUST TOOK IT DOWN.
YOU SHOULD HAVE CALLED ME.
SHE'S D.N.R.
I'M WORKING ON AN I.C.U. BED FOR HER.
DID HER FAMILY CHANGE THEIR MIND?
NO. THERE ISN'T ANY FAMILY.
OH. WELL, THAT MAKES IT EASIER.
LESS COMPLICATED.
JERRY, WHY IS THAT FREQUENT FLYER STILL IN FOUR?
UH, HE'S WAITING ON A CAB.
FOR 55 MINUTES? I NEED THE BED.
CARTER, DR. GREENE TOLD ME TO TALK TO YOU.
MAKE IT FAST.
TIME CLOCK'S BROKEN. I CAN'T PUNCH IN.
CALL ADMINISTRATION.
THEY SAID I CAN'T START WORKING
UNTIL THEY FIX IT.
NOTE THE TIME ON YOUR CARD.
THEY WON'T LET US DO THAT.
CLOCK IN UPSTAIRS THEN.
I CAN'T. A DIFFERENT SYSTEM.
AHA! NICE TRY.
APRIL FOOL'S?
YOU BLEW IT.
SORRY. HE WAS GETTING MAD.
CHUNY, I THOUGHT BETTER OF YOU.
MALIK PUT ME UP TO IT.
YEAH, BLAME THE BROTHER.
HERE, HAVE A PEN. THANKS.
YOU WANTED TO SEE ME? WHAT'S WITH C.T.?
I GOT THREE PATIENTS UPSTAIRS IN A HOLDING PATTERN.
CRASHED ON US. COMPUTER GUY'S WORKING ON IT.
HOW LONG? FOUR HOURS.
FOUR HOURS?!
YOU SERIOUS?
HAVE YOU KNOWN ME NOT TO BE SERIOUS?
OKAY, JERRY, THAT'S IT.
WE'RE CLOSED TO NEURO TRAUMA.
UH, I'LL CALL WEAVER.
NO, DON'T CALL WEAVER.
I'M SENIOR FOR THE DAY.
C.T.'s DOWN, CLOSED TO NEURO.
WHATEVER YOU SAY, BOSS.
WE GOT ANOTHER ONE.
FOUR-MONTH-OLD FEMALE-- HIGH FEVER, COUGH.
OKAY, I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.
SAM, DON'T GO ANYWHERE.
I MADE NEED A WET READ ON A CHEST FILM.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
WE NEED TO MASSAGE YOUR UTERUS
TO HELP SHRINK IT.
IT CLOSES OFF ALL THE BLOOD VESSELS?
THAT'S RIGHT.
I READ THAT.
I'M SORRY.
I DIDN'T MEAN TO ATTACK YOU.
I-I GET CRAZY WITHOUT MY MEDS.
I UNDERSTAND.
HOW'S MY BABY?
HE'S DOING GREAT. HE'S IN THE NURSERY
AND THEY'RE TAKING GOOD CARE OF HIM.
BUT HE'S HEALTHY, RIGHT?
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH HIM?
NO, NO, NO. HE'S PERFECT.
I WENT OFF THE DRUGS FOR THE PREGNANCY.
I KNOW.
I DIDN'T WANT THEM TO HURT HIM.
I KNOW.
I THOUGHT ABOUT IT.
I KNEW WHAT I WAS DOING.
I KNEW I WAS TAKING A RISK.
THAT I COULDN'T GET OUT OF CONTROL
END UP ON THE STREET, BUT IT WORKED.
I MADE IT.
YOU GOT LUCKY, BUT IT'S NOT OVER.
I CAN GO BACK HOME.
I'LL STAY ON THE MEDICATION.
I KNOW THAT I HAVE TO.
NOT FOR ME, FOR HIM.
COCO, WE'RE NOT TALKING
ABOUT A MONTH OR SIX MONTHS OR A YEAR.
YOU CAN'T EVER STOP.
I WON'T. I LOVE HIM ALREADY.
I LOVED JUST THE IDEA OF HIM.
THAT'S ALL THAT REALLY MATTERS, RIGHT?
THEY'LL LET ME KEEP HIM, WON'T THEY?
WE'LL SEE.
NO, NO!
THEY CAN'T TAKE HIM AWAY FROM ME.
PLEASE, PLEASE.
HI, MY NAME IS LUCY KNIGHT.
I'M A STUDENT DOCTOR.
HOW ARE YOU FEELING?
MICHAEL, STOP IT.
BE STILL.
YOU WANT A FOURTH TUBE.
MIGHT AS WELL.
FLUID LOOKS PRETTY CLEAR, THOUGH.
THAT'S GOOD?
YES. IF IT'S A REALLY BAD INFECTION
THE FLUID CAN BE KIND OF CLOUDY.
WE'LL STILL NEED TO SEND THESE TUBES TO THE LAB.
MICHAEL!
YOU GOT A SECOND?
YEAH. BE WITH YOU IN ONE MINUTE.
HOLD HIM STILL.
OKAY, I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
GRAM STAIN AND CULTURE IN ONE.
GLUCOSE AND PROTEIN IN TWO AND CELL COUNT IN THREE.
WHAT DO WE GOT?
YOU TELL ME.
WHAT'S WRONG WITH THIS PICTURE?
UH... THOSE RIB FRACTURES?
FOUR. ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR.
ANY SIGNS OF ABUSE?
I DIDN'T SEE ANY ECCHYMOSES.
BRUISES HEAL ON INFANTS PRETTY QUICKLY.
HUH.
CHUNY?
YEAH.
CAN YOU GET D.C.F.S. ON THE PHONE
AND CALL SECURITY TO CURTAIN TWO?
I WANT A FULL BONE SURVEY--
SKULL SERIES, LONG BONES, THE WORKS.
LET'S TAKE THEM NOW BEFORE THE INQUISITION.
( baby crying )
MRS. LEASON, THERE'S A LITTLE PROBLEM
WITH THE CHEST X RAY.
WHAT KIND OF PROBLEM?
JUST A LITTLE FUZZY. SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN MOVING.
BUT WE NEED TO TRY AGAIN.
CAN I GO WITH HER?
IT'S ACTUALLY BETTER IF YOU STAY HERE.
I SAID STOP IT!
YOUR SISTER IS SICK!
MRS. LEASON, TAKE IT EASY.
I'M FINE.
WHAT'S THIS?
WE DISCOVERED SOME OLD FRACTURES
THAT LOOKED LIKE THEY MAY BE THE RESULT OF SOME TRAUMA.
WHAT?
BY LAW, I'M REQUIRED TO REPORT THEM.
I THOUGHT YOU SAID THE X RAY WAS FUZZY.
WE NEED TO DOCUMENT A COMPLETE SET.
DOCUMENT WHAT?
HOW DID MICHAEL BREAK HIS ARM?
HE FELL OFF THE BED.
A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE DEPARTMENT
OF CHILD AND FAMILY SERVICES
IS GOING TO COME AND TALK TO YOU.
THE HELL THEY WILL.
I'M LEAVING.
NOT WITH YOUR CHILDREN.
I BROUGHT MY BABY TO YOU
BECAUSE SHE IS SICK.
AND NOW YOU WANT TO TAKE MY CHILDREN?
SHE DOESN'T LEAVE WITH THIS ONE.
MAKE SURE SHE DOESN'T GO NEAR RADIOLOGY.
I'LL CALL THE POLICE.
YOU CALL THE POLICE!
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT!
YOU CANNOT DO THIS!
YES, I CAN.
Kubby: THEY LET MOBALAGE LIVE
FOR PEOPLE TO SEE HIM BROKEN.
TO SET AN EXAMPLE.
WHY?
WHAT DID HE DO?
HE WROTE A SHORT STORY.
THEY SAW IT AS A CALL FOR REVOLUTION.
WAS IT?
I DIDN'T KNOW HE WAS A WRITER.
HE'S AN ENGINEER, BUT HE WAS A ROMANTIC TO ME.
NOT AS YOU SEE HIM TODAY.
HE WAS WARM AND FUNNY.
ENERGETIC.
KUBBY, I NEED TO KNOW THINGS ABOUT THE TORTURE.
ANYTHING THAT COULD HELP SPARK HIS MEMORY.
WE DON'T SPEAK OF IT.
YOU MUST KNOW THE SORT OF THINGS THAT THEY DID.
YOU CAN SEE THE SORT OF THINGS THEY DID.
I WAS THINKING MORE OF WHERE? HOW LONG? WHEN?
DETAILS.
I CANNOT GIVE YOU DETAILS.
I WISH I COULD.
WHEN WILL WE HAVE TO GO?
YOUR VISA'S VALID.
IT'S ONLY MOBALAGE.
WHEN WILL WE HAVE TO GO?
I DON'T KNOW.
THANK YOU.
FOR WHAT?
YOU'VE BEEN VERY KIND.
I WANT TO HELP HIM.
SO DO I.
HEY, KERRY.
HEY.
I WAS CHECKING VITALS ON MRS. BRENNAN.
CHART SAYS YOU PUSHED SOME LIDOCAINE.
THAT'S RIGHT.
DID HER D.N.R. STATUS CHANGE?
"DO NOT RESUSCITATE"
DOES NOT MEAN "DO NOT TREAT."
YOU TREATED AN ARRHYTHMIA.
YEAH, THAT'S NOT RESUSCITATION.
SO YOU WON'T INTUBATE?
CAROL, SHE'S MY PATIENT AND I'LL MAKE A JUDGMENT CALL
IF IT COMES TO THAT. EXCUSE ME.
A JUDGMENT CALL?
ISN'T THAT A LITTLE HYPOCRITICAL?
WHAT?
DOUG MADE JUDGMENT CALLS--
WHAT HE THOUGHT WAS BEST FOR HIS PATIENTS.
DOUG CREATED HIS OWN PROBLEMS.
YOU DIDN'T HELP MUCH.
IS THAT WHAT YOU THINK?
IS THAT WHAT YOU THINK-- THAT I DROVE HIM OUT OF HERE?
NO. BUT I KNOW YOU WANTED HIM OUT.
OH... I AM NOT GOING TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION WITH YOU.
HE NEVER WENT AGAINST...
NO, THIS IS DIFFERENT. HOW, KERRY?
HOW IS THIS DIFFERENT?
SHE IS MY MOTHER.
MRS. BRENNAN...
MRS. BRENNAN IS MY MOTHER.
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?
I DON'T KNOW.
I WAS ADOPTED.
AND I HIRED...
I HIRED THIS PRIVATE DETECTIVE TO FIND HER.
I NEVER IMAGINED IT WOULD HAPPEN LIKE THIS.
I...
I DIDN'T EXPECT TO FIND AN OLD WOMAN.
I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT SHE WAS PROBABLY
SOME SCARED TEENAGER WHO COULDN'T KEEP ME.
I...
I THOUGHT THAT I WOULD HAVE MORE TIME
HAVE SOME KIND OF MEANINGFUL CONVERSATION, ASK HER QUESTIONS.
BUT THE MINUTE I FIND HER, SHE'S DYING.
KERRY, I'M SO SORRY.
IT'S NOT YOUR PROBLEM.
SHE'S HEMOCULT POSITIVE.
CRIT'S DOWN.
I'M GOING TO CALL FOR A G.I. CONSULT
YOU KNOW YOUR WAY AROUND A RESECTION, PETER.
DO A LITTLE MORE HOMEWORK NEXT TIME.
WE KEEP HIM PRETTY BUSY. WANT TO GET COFFEE?
NO, THANKS. IF I LEAVE NOW, I CAN MAKE THE THIRD INNING.
ALWAYS A PLEASURE, GENTLEMEN.
YOU BET. TAKE CARE.
( quietly ): SEE YOU LATER. YOU JERK.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT.
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION.
NO... I SHOULD BE MORE PREPARED.
AH, GO HOME. SEE YOUR MUNCHKIN.
HIS NAME IS REESE.
OH, LIKE REESE'S PIECES-- CUTE.
HEY.
HEY.
HOW'D IT GO?
OH, FINE, I GUESS.
NOT EXCITING ENOUGH FOR YOU?
NO, IT WAS... INTERESTING.
WHY DID YOU FEEL THE NEED TO POACH MY MEAGER AMBITIONS?
WHAT?
I SPOKE WITH KERRY WEAVER ABOUT THE STATUS
OF THE TRAUMA FELLOWSHIP.
SHE TOLD ME THERE MIGHT BE A SELECTION COMMITTEE.
THAT THERE WAS OTHER INTEREST.
WAS THAT YOU?
I MENTIONED SOMETHING.
PETER, I TOLD YOU IN CONFIDENCE.
I WOULDN'T HAVE SAID ANYTHING IF I THOUGHT FOR A SECOND
YOU'D TRY AND STEAL IT FROM ME.
( sighs )
IT'S ALREADY YOURS?
IT WAS MY IDEA.
I BROUGHT IT TO GREENE AND WEAVER.
I'M SORRY; YOU DIDN'T TELL ME THAT.
PETER...
LOOK, I DIDN'T SAY I WANTED IT.
I WAS JUST ASKING.
OH, WELL, THEN.
LET ME KNOW WHEN YOU DECIDE.
I'LL GO AHEAD AND PLAN MY LIFE.
ELIZABETH, IT'S NOT LIKE THAT.
YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST THAT...
I DON'T KNOW-- YOU KNOW, THINGS AREN'T WORKING OUT RIGHT NOW.
I DON'T LIKE CARDIOTHORACIC.
OH, WHAT? SO TRAUMA'S A BACKUP?
NO. I JUST THOUGHT THAT THIS MIGHT MAKE SENSE, YOU KNOW?
I CAN'T SPEND THE NEXT FIVE YEARS
BEING SOME KIND OF INDENTURED SERVANT.
I-I NEED TIME FOR REESE.
OH, NOW THAT'S LOW. WHAT?
I KNOW YOU LOVE YOUR SON
BUT DON'T USE HIM AS AN EXCUSE TO SCREW ME OVER.
YOU KNOW WHAT? TAKE IT.
I DON'T WANT IT-- I'LL FIND SOMETHING ELSE.
NO! I DON'T WANT YOU TO FORFEIT IT TO ME!
IF YOU WANT IT, BY ALL MEANS, YOU GO FOR IT.
I'LL STILL GET IT.
HOW ARE THOSE FILMS COMING?
COME IN.
YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO SEE THIS.
WHOSE IS THIS?
I DON'T KNOW-- IT'S BEEN HERE ALL DAY.
I'VE BEEN LOOKING EVERYWHERE FOR THIS.
28 DIFFERENT FRACTURES TOTAL.
NOT ALL CALCIFIED.
BILATERAL HUMERUS, LEFT FEMUR...
RIGHT TIB FIB, LINEAR INVOLVEMENT OF THE SKULL...
GEEZ, WHAT DID SHE DO TO THIS KID?
WE SHOULD GET A HEAD C.T.
THERE'S SOME PLEURAL SCARRING.
POSSIBLY A SPONTANEOUSLY HEALED PNEUMOTHORAX.
WAIT A MINUTE. WHAT IS THIS?
NON-DISPLACED FRACTURE OF THE EIGHTH RIB.
I THOUGHT, UH...
THERE WERE ONLY FOUR RIB FRACTURES.
THERE'S FIVE HERE.
YOU SURE THIS IS HERS?
YEAH, I TOOK A WHOLE NEW SET.
WHERE'S THE OLD ONE?
SAME TECHNIQUE?
YEAH.
SO WHERE'S THE FIFTH FRACTURE?
THERE ISN'T ONE.
WHAT, IT HAPPENED IN THE E.R.?
DID YOU PRESS ON HER CHEST?
I HELD HER DOWN TO DO THE L.P.
COULD BE OSTEOGENESIS IMPERFECTA.
UH... I DID IT?
THEIR BONES BREAK LIKE GLASS.
OH, MAN...
OH, MAN... I WENT RIGHT TO ABUSE.
I DIDN'T EVEN... I DIDN'T EVEN THINK ABOUT O.I.
DID YOU ALREADY CALL SOCIAL SERVICES?
YEAH, COPS ARE DOWN THERE TALKING TO THE MOTHER RIGHT NOW.
WELL... HONEST MISTAKE.
BETTER TO BE SAFE, RIGHT?
YEAH, HOW DO I GO FROM "SORRY I ACCUSED YOU"
TO "YOUR DAUGHTER'S GOT A TERRIBLE DISEASE"?
YOU SHOULD PUT ON A JACKET.
IT'S STILL A LITTLE NIPPY OUT HERE.
YEAH. I'M READY FOR SPRING.
I GOT YOUR PAGE IN THE CAR
I FIGURED I'D JUST SWING BY-- HOW IS SHE?
UH... SHE'S DYING.
I GOT SOME PRELIMINARY INFO FOR YOU.
WANT TO HEAR?
CATHY BRENNAN.
SHE WAS A STEWARDESS BACK IN THE DAY
THEY CALLED THEM STEWARDESSES.
UH, MARRIED LATE, TWO YEARS AFTER HAVING YOU.
NOT TO YOUR FATHER. I'M STILL WORKING ON THAT.
DIVORCED SIX YEARS LATER.
ONE CHILD-- A DAUGHTER, CLAIRE.
DIED IN A CAR ACCIDENT IN HER MID-TWENTIES.
ARE YOU OKAY?
DID YOU KNOW THAT HER BLOOD TYPE WAS O-POSITIVE?
WE DON'T USUALLY GET THAT KIND OF INFORMATION.
YEAH, I HAD TO TYPE HER BLOOD
BECAUSE I WAS GOING TO PUT HER IN THE I.C.U.
SHE... SHE DIDN'T WANT THAT.
BUT SOMEHOW I THOUGHT I HAD THE RIGHT.
THAT'S A NATURAL REACTION.
I'M "AB."
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE FOR THAT WOMAN TO BE MY MOTHER.
ARE YOU SURE?
IT'S BASIC HEMATOLOGY-- "A" PLUS "B" EQUALS "AB."
THERE'S NO "O" IN THE EQUATION.
I'LL CALL MY GUY IN THE COUNTY CLERK'S OFFICE.
HE STOLE A PEEK AT THE FILE.
HE MUST HAVE RUSHED, READ IT WRONG.
YOU SHOULD BE MORE CAREFUL.
THE INFORMATION IS THERE-- I CAN GET IT.
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO QUIT, ARE YOU?
IT'S MY FAULT.
YOU SHOULDN'T LET IT UNDERMINE YOUR RESOLVE.
YOU'RE FIRED.
Lucy: HEY, CARTER.
HI. HOW MANY PATIENTS DO YOU HAVE?
ONE-- I FINALLY GOT A GOOD CASE.
A PARANOID SCHIZOPHRENIC HAD A BABY.
YEAH, I KNOW. I WAS THERE.
OH, GREAT. HOW'S SENIOR-FOR-A-DAY?
NOT OVER YET.
LUCY...
YEAH?
HAVE YOU CALLED YOUR RESIDENT ABOUT COCO YET?
UH, NO, I HAVE TO COMPLETE
A COMPREHENSIVE MENTAL STATUS EXAM.
I'M PRESENTING HER AT CHIEF ROUNDS.
WELL, YOU NEED TO CALL YOUR RESIDENT-- NOW.
WHY? IS SOMETHING WRONG?
LOOK, COCO'S HAD OVER 12 ADMISSIONS.
SHE'S DEALT WITH A LOT OF DIFFERENT PSYCHIATRISTS.
I BET.
SHE FEELS YOU'RE TOO INEXPERIENCED.
A SCHIZOPHRENIC THINKS I'M NOT QUALIFIED?
WELL, SHE'S ASKED FOR SOMEONE ELSE.
CAN SHE DO THAT?
SHE'S GOT A LOT AT STAKE, LUCY, YOU KNOW?
SHE'S WORRIED. JUST CALL YOUR RESIDENT.
HEY, DR. GREENE.
CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING?
SURE, JERRY.
WHAT DOES IT MEAN IF YOUR PISS TURNS BLUE?
JUST OUT OF CURIOSITY?
MY PISS IS BLUE. DARK BLUE.
( laughing ): SOMEBODY GOT YOU.
OH, MAN.
HOW COULD THEY CHANGE MY BODILY FLUIDS?
HAVE YOU EATEN ANYTHING THAT YOU DIDN'T MAKE?
BROWNIES IN THE LOUNGE.
MMM.
OH, MAN, IT'S NOT TOXIC, IS IT?
IT'S PROBABLY METHYLENE BLUE.
LET ME KNOW IF IT STARTS BURNING.
BURNING?
( chuckling )
JUST KIDDING, JERRY. YOU'LL BE FINE.
WELL... HOW LONG AM I GOING TO PEE LIKE THIS?
MMM, DAY OR TWO.
EH, SOMEONE'S GOING TO PAY.
TOLD YOU TO WATCH YOUR BACK.
( water splashing )
( labored breathing )
( moans softly )
YOU'RE HERE.
YOU CAME BACK.
THAT'S RIGHT.
CLAIRE?
CLAIRE?
YES.
I LOVE YOU.
I LOVE YOU, TOO, MOM.
( labored breathing )
( moans softly )
( whispers ): IT'S OKAY.
IT'S A BATHROOM.
YEAH, IT'S JUST A BATHROOM.
THREE STALLS...
URINALS...
COUPLE OF SINKS.
BUT FOR A LONG TIME...
I HAD TROUBLE EVEN COMING IN HERE.
I USED TO DREAM ABOUT IT.
IT WAS MY NIGHTMARE.
I WAS STANDING RIGHT HERE AT THE SINK.
SOMEONE HAD JUST LEFT.
I WAS WASHING MY FACE.
SUDDENLY, I FEEL A PAIN SHOOTING THROUGH MY SKULL
AND I REALIZE...
THAT MY HEAD HAS HIT THE PORCELAIN
AS I'M CRASHING INTO THE MIRROR.
MY MIND IS ONE STEP BEHIND.
SOMEONE'S ATTACKING ME.
I END UP ON THE GROUND HERE...
AND HE'S GONE.
SO I CRAWL OUT...
AND I TRY TO STAND UP
AND HE'S ON ME AGAIN
AND HE'S KICKING AND PUNCHING AND KICKING
AND THIS SHARP PAIN SHOOTS THROUGH MY HAND
AS HE STOMPS ON IT.
I CAN STILL FEEL IT.
I'M LYING THERE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FLOOR...
I CAN'T STAND...
I CAN'T TALK...
I JUST KEEP THINKING...
WHY DIDN'T I DO ANYTHING?
WHY DIDN'T I FIGHT BACK?
YOU CANNOT FIGHT BACK.
YOU CANNOT MOVE.
THERE'S NO WINDOW THERE.
ONLY A BRIGHT LIGHT IN THAT CORNER.
SOMEONE LIES OVER THERE.
YOU KNOW HIM.
A FRIEND.
HE'S DEAD.
THERE ARE VOICES...
A SCREAM FROM OVER THERE.
A CHAIN...
YOU HANG FROM A CHAIN
RIGHT HERE.
RIGHT HERE.
THERE IS LAUGHTER.
A FIRE OVER THERE.
THEY HEAT THE LONG BLADE.
OH...
HOLD IT TO YOU...
IT BURNS.
YOU CANNOT BREATHE.
IT COMES AGAIN, HARDER.
LONGER.
YOU SMELL IT.
YOU SMELL YOUR OWN FLESH BURNING.
DEATH.
I WISH FOR DEATH.
BUT MY WIFE...
MY FAMILY.
MY FAMILY...
HI.
HI. CAN I HELP YOU?
YEAH, I WAS HOPING TO CATCH DR. McLUCAS.
SHE LEFT FOR THE DAY. ARE YOU A PATIENT?
YES. CAROL HATHAWAY.
IS IT AN EMERGENCY?
NO, UM... I JUST NEED TO SEE HER.
UH, CAN I MAKE AN APPOINTMENT?
SURE. WHAT'S IT FOR?
I'M GOING TO HAVE A BABY.
