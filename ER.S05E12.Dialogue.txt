PREVIOUSLY ON E.R.:
YOU WANT TO CATCH A MOVIE TOMORROW NIGHT?
OKAY.
YOU ACTUALLY APPLIED
TO THE SPACE PROGRAM?
MY SECOND YEAR OF RESIDENCY.
TONIGHT'S DINNER IS SEMIFORMAL
SO, UH, ANY SLINKY BLACK NUMBER WILL DO.
SO YOU WANT ME TO CONDUCT A STUDY AT COUNTY GENERAL
AND THE DRUG IS FOR THE TREATMENT OF FRACTURE PAIN?
MM-HMM. COMPARING IT AGAINST ACETAMINOPHEN WITH CODEINE.
WHAT'S YOUR SON'S MEDICAL CONDITION?
A.L.D.-- ADRENOLEUKODYSTROPHY.
HOW OLD IS HE? EIGHT. WHY?
THEY USUALLY DON'T MAKE IT PAST THE AGE OF TEN.
THIS MUST BE RICKY.
I'M CAROL. HI.
YOU KNOW, I COULD'VE JUST TAKEN LUCY OUT FOR A PIZZA.
THAT'S WHAT ALL MY RESIDENTS DID FOR ME
WHEN I FINISHED A ROTATION.
NO. IN MY DAY, RESIDENTS ALWAYS
HAD THEIR STUDENTS OVER FOR A MEAL.
MAKES FOR BETTER MENTORING.
THAT'S WHY I INVITED PETER BENTON TO JOIN US.
SURE. DR. BENTON'S COMING?
HE WAS YOUR RESIDENT.
NOW LUCY'S WORKING WITH HIM.
IT'S MUCH MORE CIVILIZED...
( blender whirring ) JOHN, NO!
I THOUGHT THE PEPPERS WENT IN THE BLENDER. NO, NO, NO, NO.
NO. WE WANT SEPARATE COLORS FOR THE SAUCE.
GOOD SAVE. YEAH. YOU COOL AND PEEL THEM FIRST.
WHY DON'T YOU SEED THE PERSIAN CUKES?
YOU KNOW, IT'S FUNNY...
I'M ACTUALLY GOING TO MISS HAVING LUCY AROUND.
THAT'S HOW IT WORKS.
THE INSTANT STUDENTS KNOW ENOUGH
TO BE OF USE, THEY MOVE TO ANOTHER ROTATION.
OKAY. LENGTHWISE, LENGTHWISE.
OOPS. YEAH.
LIKE THIS, AND THEN YOU SEED THEM. OKAY?
YOU KNOW, EMERGENCY MEDICINE
MAY NOT BE A BAD CHOICE FOR LUCY.
WELL... SHE MIGHT FEEL DIFFERENTLY
AFTER SHE HAS HER SURGICAL ROTATION.
YOU KNOW WHAT? WHY DON'T YOU...
WHY DON'T YOU CHILL THE PINOT GRIGIO?
IN THE, UH... IN THE FREEZER?
KEEP YOUR DAY JOB, CARTER.
( chuckling )
LET'S SEE HOW YOU HANDLE THESE.
GOT IT? ALL RIGHT. LET'S DO IT.
YOU HAVE ANY INSIDE INFORMATION ON THIS NEW DRUG?
THIS STUFF REALLY WORKS WELL FOR HIM, HUH?
IT'S AMAZING. AARON BROKE HIS ARM A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO.
THE PAIN WAS EXCRUCIATING.
BUT THIS-- I'D LIKE TO BUY STOCK IN IT.
"THIS" MAY JUST BE ACETAMINOPHEN WITH CODEINE.
NO WAY. I KNOW THAT SOME PATIENTS IN THE STUDY
AREN'T GETTING THE WONDER DRUG
BUT AARON IS, AND IT'S REMARKABLE STUFF.
THEY REALLY KEEP YOU DOCS IN THE DARK?
IT'S A DOUBLE-BLIND STUDY, SO YOU'LL HAVE TO GET
YOUR INSIDER TRADING FROM SOMEBODY ELSE.
SEE YOU IN THREE WEEKS.
SEE YOU IN THREE WEEKS.
JEANIE CALLED. SHE'S GOING TO BE LATE.
PROBABLY STUCK IN THE SNOW.
SHE OVERSLEPT-- HAD A LATE NIGHT.
I WISH WE'D OVERSLEPT.
WE ARE GOING TO KICK START THE A.M.
WITH A WAKE-UP CALL FROM MY MAIN MEN--
HETFIELD AND HAMMETT.
IT'S REALLY COMING DOWN OUT THERE.
I DIDN'T EXPECT TO SEE YOU TODAY. THE CLINIC'S CLOSED.
( "Master of Puppets" playing ) OH, I ORGANIZED A SEMINAR ON S.T.D.s
AND CERVICAL CANCER-- KIND OF LIKE A GAB SESSION
FOR THE WOMEN IN THE COMMUNITY.
OH, THAT'S A GREAT IDEA.
IS THAT METALLICA?
LYNETTE, YOU'RE A METALHEAD?
YOU KNOW THIS TUNE?
YEAH, 'CAUSE IT'S BANNED IN MY HOUSE.
I THOUGHT THAT, YOU KNOW, WOMEN SHOULD KNOW MORE
ABOUT SCREENING AND PREVENTION.
OH, ABSOLUTELY. I WISH I COULD PAY YOU OVERTIME.
OH, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
I SCORED SOME GRANT MONEY TO PAY FOR IT.
REALLY? UH-HUH.
IT'S GOING TO RUN THROUGH THE CLINIC?
YEAH. I GOT LUCKY.
CAUGHT SOME DRIBBLES OFF THE GRAVY TRAIN.
MARK...
I THOUGHT THAT WAS YOU.
HI, DONALD.
LISTEN, I GOT YOUR, UH, MEMO ABOUT THE NASA OFFER.
YEAH. OPPORTUNITY JUST CAME OUT OF THE BLUE.
IT'S A FULL YEAR OF TRAINING IN HOUSTON?
IT COULD BE 18 MONTHS IF THEY DELAY THE LAUNCH.
DON'T DO IT. WHAT?
WELL, I MEAN, OBVIOUSLY, DO WHAT YOU MUST
BUT I WISH YOU WOULDN'T.
YOU KEPT ME AWAKE LAST NIGHT.
I KEPT YOU AWAKE?
I DO NOT WANT TO RUN
THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT WITHOUT YOU.
WHAT'LL IT TAKE TO GET YOU TO STAY?
UH, FULL TENURE, EFFECTIVE TODAY.
( chuckling )
WELL, I PROBABLY CAN'T SWING THAT
BUT I, UH, I COULD PUSH UP YOUR ELIGIBILITY
CONSIDER YOU IN OH-TWO.
2002?
'AUGHT TWO? IS SOMEBODY GOING TO TELL US
WHAT TO CALL THE FUTURE
OR IS IT EVERY MAN FOR HIMSELF?
YOU'D CONSIDER ME FOR TENURE IN THREE YEARS?
WE NEED YOU.
THINK ABOUT IT.
I THINK I'VE FOUND MY NICHE-- PULLING DRAINS.
JUST MAKE SURE YOU GET THE PENROSE AND NOT THE T-TUBE.
PULL THAT, IT'S NOT A PRETTY SIGHT.
AH, MISS KNIGHT, I SEE YOU FOUND YOUR WAY TO DR. CORDAY.
ABSOLUTELY. ALL THE PRE-OP LABS
WERE IN THE CHARTS WHEN I ARRIVED.
I NEARLY KISSED HER.
OH, NONE OF THAT-- NOT UNLESS I GET TO WATCH.
I INSISTED THAT YOU GET A DECENT STUDENT.
I KNEW THAT YOU COULD USE SOME BACKUP WITH THE SCUT.
AND I LIVE FOR SCUT.
IF MS. KNIGHT ACTUALLY HELPS YOU
GET FINISHED EARLY, I'D LIKE YOU TO ASSIST
THIS AFTERNOON ON A CHOLEDOCHOJEJUNOSTOMY.
CHOLEDOCHOJEJUNOSTOMY? WELL...
YOU CAN SAY IT.
WOULD YOU LIKE TO DO IT?
I'M WAITING FOR THE OTHER SHOE TO DROP.
NO CATCH. YOU'VE SUFFERED ENOUGH.
I STARTED THE GROUNDWORK TODAY
TO SEE IF WE CAN'T GET YOUR FELLOWSHIP REINSTATED.
YOU DESERVE IT.
WELL, I'LL BE DAMNED.
SO SHOULD I FEEL SPECIAL
OR DOES HE STARE AT EVERYONE'S BREASTS?
NO, ONLY THE FEMALES-- AS FAR AS I KNOW.
IF IT'S GOOD FOR THE CLINIC...
IT'S YOUR CLINIC. YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO KNOW
WHAT GRANTS ARE APPLIED FOR IN ITS NAME.
LYNETTE DOES HAVE GOOD IDEAS.
YOU ARE THE BOSS. YOU SAY YES OR NO.
( music by Propeller Heads playing )
WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?
OUR NEW MUSIC PROGRAM.
YOU CALL THAT MUSIC?
I TOLD YOU TO START WITH ERYKAH BADU.
IT'S FOR THE PATIENTS IN CHAIRS.
MUSIC HELPS PEOPLE HANDLE THE STRESS OF WAITING.
I THOUGHT YOU WERE GETTING READY TO D.J. A PARTY.
THAT'S JUST A COINCIDENCE.
SOMEBODY SIGNED OFF ON THIS.
WHO SIGNED OFF ON THIS?
DR. LEE. JERRY, THERE IS NO DR. LEE.
THERE NEVER WAS A DR. LEE.
IS THAT SIREN IN THE MUSIC
OR IS THERE AN AMBULANCE PULLING UP?
IT'S IN THE MUSIC.
HEY, WE COULD USE SOME EXTRA MUSCLE OUT HERE.
JERRY, TURN THE MUSIC DOWN AND GIVE CONNIE AND ME A HAND.
OH, BOY, GIRD YOUR LOINS-- 36-YEAR-OLD WOMAN
FOUND DOWN AT THE SCENE OF A KITCHEN FIRE.
( grunting ): THIS IS ONE BIG WOMAN.
PROBABLY ANAPHYLAXIS.
HER MED-ALERT BRACELET SAID PEANUT ALLERGY.
GAVE HER TEN OF VALIUM AND TUBED HER.
DON'T PULL UNTIL WE GET A GOOD GRIP.
SHOULD I GET ANOTHER GURNEY?
YEAH, A DOUBLE-WIDE AND A WINCH.
Oligario: I HOPE THE WHEELS DON'T SNAP.
Greene: TRAUMA ONE.
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.
CAN I HELP YOU WITH SOMETHING?
Pickman: THE SECOND VICTIM IS FRED DANZIGER.
I'M FINE, DOC. SHORT OF BREATH.
HE SINGED HIS MUSTACHE PUTTING OUT THE FLAMES.
THESE PARAMEDICS OVERREACT.
IT'S THE FIRST CALL THIS WEEK
WHERE SOMETHING WAS ON FIRE
AND SHE DRAGS ME AWAY AT THE DROP OF A HAT.
SHE COULD BE RIGHT, OKAY?
SINGED FACIAL HAIR COULD MEAN A BURNED AIRWAY.
CHUNY... LET'S PUT FRED ON A PULSE OX
AND GET A CHEST X RAY. YOU BET.
I REALLY HAD TO FORCE HIM TO COME IN HERE.
THIS NEW POLICY SUCKS.
ADDING PARAMEDICS TO FIRE TRUCKS?
YEAH, AND THE GUYS RESENT IT.
THEY'RE FIREFIGHTERS, SO THEY BLAME ME
FOR HAVING TO ANSWER SO MANY MEDICAL CALLS.
NOBODY LIKES CHANGE. YOU DID THE RIGHT THING.
SO YOU PASSED OUT AND TOOK A FALL?
( labored breathing ): ANGIE... FOUND ME.
ANGIE YOUR HOME HEALTH AIDE?
SHE WAS.
THEY BURN OUT FAST WITH ME.
DID YOU SEE MY CHART?
YES, SIR. PANCREATIC CANCER AND METS TO THE LIVER.
I KEEP HOPING THAT "END STAGE" MEANS
IT... CAN'T GET ANY WORSE.
THE NAUSEA PRETTY BAD?
YEAH.
OKAY. WE'RE GOING TO HYDRATE YOU
SEE IF THAT HELPS.
WOULD YOU LIKE YOUR OWN ROBE BACK ON?
IT CAN GET PRETTY CHILLY IN HERE.
DID... DID ANGIE CALL MY SON?
I CAN FIND OUT.
IS THAT YOURS?
TEN YEARS AGO...
I KICKED MY SON OUT OF THE HOUSE OVER THIS STUFF.
NOW I DEPEND ON HIM TO GET IT FOR ME.
HELPS WITH THE NAUSEA?
DO YOU HAVE TO TAKE IT?
TAKE WHAT?
MS. MEREDITH, CAN YOU OPEN YOUR EYES.
SHE'S BEEN UNRESPONSIVE SINCE THE VALIUM.
PULSE OX IS 99%.
CAN YOU IMAGINE LUGGING AROUND ALL THIS FAT?
DIDN'T STOP HER FROM HITTING THE UDON NOODLES AT 9:00 A.M.
DOES RADIOLOGY STOCK A EXTRA...
( grunting ): EXTRA LARGE?
BETTER CALL THE VET SCHOOL.
OKAY, EVERYBODY, SETTLE DOWN.
MS. MEREDITH, YOU'VE HAD A BAD ALLERGIC REACTION
SO YOU HAVE A TUBE IN YOUR MOUTH
HELPING YOU TO BREATHE.
BP's 90/60.
LET'S START DOPAMINE AT FIVE MIKES PER KILO.
HOW MANY KILOS?
YOU WANT A CALCULATOR?
WHAT DO YOU THINK-- 275 POUNDS?
OH, I'LL TAKE THE OVER.
Carter: HEY, WERE YOU LOOKING FOR ME?
YEAH, CARTER.
UH, CONNIE, START HER AT 750 MIKES.
LET ME KNOW HOW SHE DOES.
YOU'RE GOING TO BE FINE.
WE'VE GOT IT UNDER CONTROL.
I WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW
THAT AS PART OF YOUR WORKLOAD
YOU'RE GOING TO TEACH PATIENT-DOCTOR CLASS
TO SECOND-YEAR STUDENTS.
PATIENT-DOCTOR CLASS?
YEAH. STUDENTS PRACTICE H&P's ON SIMULATED PATIENTS.
NO, I REMEMBER. YOU USE BAD ACTORS TO COME IN
AND PRETEND LIKE THEY'RE SICK. I HATED IT.
YEAH, WELL, WHY IS THAT?
I DON'T KNOW, 'CAUSE IT'S FAKE.
EVERYBODY KNOWS IT'S FAKE.
THE STUDENTS KNOW IT'S FAKE.
IT'S A WASTE OF TIME.
YEAH, WELL, STARTING TOMORROW
YOU'RE GOING TO LEARN TO HATE IT ALL OVER AGAIN.
IT'LL SHARPEN YOUR TEACHING SKILLS.
HEY... DID, UH, LUCY GIVE ME A BAD EVALUATION?
LUCY GAVE YOU A FAIR EVALUATION.
I'LL PUT THE TEACHING GUIDE IN YOUR BOX.
PATIENT COLLAPSED PUSH-STARTING A CAR.
SLURRED SPEECH AND RIGHT-SIDE WEAKNESS
SUGGESTING? RESOLVED IN 30 MINUTES.
A T.I.A.-- DR. CORDAY ORDERED
A DOPPLER ULTRASOUND OF HIS CAROTID ARTERIES.
WHICH DEMONSTRATES WHAT?
A 50% LESION ON THE LEFT SIDE.
IS THIS A SURGICAL CANDIDATE?
WELL, HE'S PRETTY OLD.
HOW OLD? YOU SAID HE WAS PUSH-STARTING A CAR.
HE CLAIMS NOT TO KNOW HIS EXACT AGE.
YEAH, WELL, WASN'T YOUR CIVIL WAR IN THE 1860s?
ACCORDING TO MR. BARNES, HE'S ROUGHLY 140.
ELIZABETH, DID YOU GET MY MESSAGE? IS NOW A GOOD TIME?
I'M NOT SURE. YEAH. GO AHEAD.
MS. KNIGHT AND I CAN HANDLE THIS.
PETER, 8:00 TONIGHT, RIGHT?
I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN MAKE IT.
Weaver: YEAH. WE NEED TO COMPILE OUR STERNAL SAW DATA BY TOMORROW.
MR. BARNES, WHAT ARE YOU DOING OUT OF BED?
I ASKED YOU TO CALL ME CHARLEY.
SIR, YOU HAVE TO STAY IN YOUR GOWN
SO DR. BENTON CAN EXAMINE YOU.
MM-HMM. IS THAT YOU?
I DON'T MEAN
NO DISRESPECT, BUT WHEN YOU GET TO BE MY AGE
AND YOU LOLL AROUND IN BED, THEM RHEUMATOIDS KICK IN
AND PRETTY SOON, YOU CAN'T MOVE AT ALL.
UNFORTUNATELY, YOU HAVE BLOCKAGE IN YOUR NECK ARTERY.
IT PUTS YOU AT RISK FOR A STROKE.
NO, NO, NO, I CAN'T HAVE THAT.
TOO MANY PEOPLE COUNTING ON ME.
Lucy: CHARLEY HELPS THE OLDER PEOPLE
IN HIS NEIGHBORHOOD.
AND THE CHILDREN.
I MEAN, 'CAUSE THEY NEED SITTERS
THOSE PEOPLE WORKING ALL DAY.
ARE YOU, UH... HER TEACHER?
AT THE MOMENT.
THEN YOU KNOW
YOU AND I, WE HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY
TO PASS ON WHAT LIFE HAS TAUGHT US.
CAN YOU, UH, FIX ME UP?
WELL, THERE IS A SURGICAL OPTION
BUT I'D HESITATE TO USE IT ON SOMEONE...
WELL... SOMEONE YOUR AGE.
OH, YOU AIN'T NEVER SEEN A PATIENT MY AGE.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY-- I CAN'T BE KILLED
'CAUSE I GOT A CONJURE ON ME.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS.
OF COURSE YOU DON'T...
'CAUSE YOU ARE A MAN OF SCIENCE.
HOW ELSE ARE YOU GOING TO EXPLAIN
MY BEING ALIVE AT ALL, WHEN EVERY OTHER BODY--
ALL THE ONES FROM SLAVERY TIMES--
DONE DIED 50 AND 60 YEARS AGO?
MS. KNIGHT, WHAT WOULD YOU SUGGEST?
I'D CALL A PSYCH CONSULT.
IS THAT THE DOC FOR LOONIES?
( laughs )
UH... YES, SIR.
YES. YES, IT IS.
UH-HUH.
HE'S OUTRAGEOUS.
HE CAN BE TASTELESS.
HE CERTAINLY LIKES TO THROW HIS WEIGHT AROUND
BUT, UH...
SO YOU CAN'T CORROBORATE ANY INSTANCES OF...
OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT?
IT'S A VERY, UM...
IT'S A VERY AMERICAN THING, IF I MAY SAY--
THIS PENCHANT FOR TURNING PERSONAL ISSUES INTO LAWSUITS.
THE HOSPITAL'S HOPE, OF COURSE, IS FOR ME
AS OMSBUDSPERSON, TO ADDRESS PROBLEMS
AND AVOID LAWSUITS.
ONE HAS TO BE THICK-SKINNED WORKING AROUND DR. ROMANO
BUT, UH, YOU ROLL WITH THE PUNCHES, DON'T YOU?
WHOEVER IS COMPLAINING MAY BE TOO FRAGILE
TO PRACTICE MEDICINE AT ALL.
HER IDENTITY IS CONFIDENTIAL
UNTIL I CAN ASSESS IF ANY ACTION IS WARRANTED.
IT'S A DELICATE BUSINESS.
RARELY DO I HEAR THE KIND OF SLAM DUNK
WHERE DR. SO-AND-SO MADE OVERT SEXUAL ADVANCES.
SHE DECLINED, AND THEN HE EITHER FIRED HER
OR CUT HER FUNDS.
RIGHT.
UH, KERRY...
HMM?
IS ROBERT AWARE OF THIS COMPLAINT?
HE DOESN'T KNOW WHO CAME TO ME, ALTHOUGH, HE COULD FIGURE IT OUT
SINCE MY FIRST RESPONSE
IS TO PREVENT THE PARTIES FROM WORKING TOGETHER.
I SEE.
IT'S MY FAULT.
I LET IT GO ON TOO LONG.
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.
I'M GOING TO START A LINE.
Ross: JOI, WHAT'S GOING ON?
REMEMBER RICKY? HE HASN'T HAD A BOWEL MOVEMENT IN THREE DAYS.
JOI GOT WORRIED WHEN HIS TEMP SPIKED TO 101.
OH, MY GOD, I LET HIM GET SEPTIC.
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN ABLE TO DISIMPACT HIM BEFORE.
YOU DISIMPACT HIM AT HOME?
YEAH. I USUALLY USE A GLOVE AND VASELINE
BUT I COULDN'T DO IT THIS TIME.
THE MORPHINE'S MADE HIM CONSTIPATED.
WHY IS HE ON MORPHINE?
HE'S HAVING PAIN FROM CONTRACTURES.
THAT'S WHAT I THINK.
RICKY STOPPED SPEAKING ABOUT A WEEK AGO.
I'M SORRY.
HE STILL OPENS HIS EYES SOMETIMES.
AND IS THE MORPHINE WORKING FOR THE PAIN?
I DON'T KNOW.
OH, GOD...
IT'S ALL RIGHT. I GOT IT.
I'M SORRY.
IT'S JUST...
I...
I KNOW, I KNOW.
AFTER EVERYTHING HE'S BEEN THROUGH
I FALL APART OVER THIS.
IT'S OKAY, IT'S OKAY.
I KNOW.
Woman: WHEN WE GOT
TO MICHIGAN AVENUE, HE JUST PASSED OUT.
HOW LONG AGO
DID HE HIT HIS HEAD? FOUR HOURS.
HE WAS FIXING A FLOOD LIGHT OVER OUR GARAGE
AND THE LADDER SLIPPED, BUT HE SEEMED OKAY.
HE JUST HAD A HEADACHE.
WHENEVER YOU HAVE A HEAD INJURY
IT'S BEST TO CALL THE PARAMEDICS.
I DID CALL.
PARAMEDICS DIDN'T SHOW UP?
NO, THEY CAME
BUT JIM SEEMED OKAY.
THEN THERE WAS A FIRE SOMEWHERE AND THEY GOT CALLED AWAY.
JERRY'S GOING TO SHOW YOU WHERE YOU CAN PARK YOUR CAR.
JERRY, I WANT YOU TO CALL DISPATCH.
FIND OUT WHICH UNIT RESPONDED
TO THE HAGGERTYS' CALL.
DONE.
RICKY'S RESTING.
HIS FEVER IS DUE TO AN EAR INFECTION.
THEY'RE TREATING IT WITH ANTIBIOTICS.
OH, THANK YOU, CAROL, FOR EVERYTHING.
OH, SURE. DR. ROSS WILL BE
OUT HERE IN A MINUTE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT IT.
YOU ALWAYS SEE ME WHEN I'M SUCH A WRECK.
I USUALLY COPE MUCH BETTER.
WELL, SOMETIMES COPING TOO MUCH CAN DRIVE YOU CRAZY.
I MEANT TO SEND YOU A THANK-YOU NOTE.
THE RESPITE CARE HAS BEEN WONDERFUL.
OH, GOOD. DID YOU GET TO YOUR DAUGHTER'S RECITAL?
HMM, AND I HAD THE WORKER COME BACK ANOTHER TIME
JUST SO I COULD TAKE A BATH.
GOOD FOR YOU.
YEAH. WE HAD SOME GREAT NEWS LAST WEEK.
MY DAUGHTER'S BLOOD TEST CAME BACK.
SHE'S NOT A CARRIER.
OH, THAT'S A RELIEF.
OH, THANK GOD. SHE'LL NEVER DO THIS TO HER KIDS.
JOI? UH, WE'RE GOING TO KEEP HIM HERE
UNTIL HIS FEVER COMES DOWN.
I'LL SEE YOU BEFORE
YOU GO, OKAY?
DOES THIS MEAN WE HAVE
TO REDUCE RICKY'S MORPHINE TO PREVENT
THIS HAPPENING AGAIN, OR...?
WELL, THAT'S ONE THING WE COULD DO.
THIS WAS THE HARDEST PART WITH MICHAEL.
I LOST RICKY'S OLDER BROTHER TO A.L.D.
THREE YEARS AGO.
RIGHT.
AND NOW, HE CAN'T
TELL ME IT HURTS.
SOMEHOW IT'S WORSE
TO SEE HIM SUFFERING.
WELL, LET ME CHECK.
THERE MAY BE SOMETHING ELSE WE CAN DO FOR THE PAIN.
OKAY.
OKAY.
I'M IN.
HYPERVENTILATE HIM.
B.P. 160/90.
PULSE 60. MANNITOL'S IN.
MRS. HAGGERTY, YOUR HUSBAND HAS A BLOWN PUPIL.
I'M WORRIED THE BLEEDING IN HIS SKULL
COULD BE PUTTING PRESSURE ON HIS BRAIN.
C.T.'s READY.
WE'RE GOING TO GET A HEAD C.T. TO FIND OUT WHAT'S GOING ON.
MALIK, TAKE MRS. HAGGERTY TO CHAIRS.
CHUNY, CALL NEUROSURGERY DOWN HERE RIGHT AWAY.
OKAY.
ELIZABETH.
I WAS AFRAID YOU WEREN'T GOING TO BE JOINING US.
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO IT.
YOU DON'T SEE A CHOLEDOCHOJEJUNOSTOMY EVERY DAY.
WHEN THEY SHUFFLED
THE SURGICAL SCHEDULE YESTERDAY
I WAS AFRAID I WAS GOING TO MISS OUT.
SORRY ABOUT THAT.
THE RESIDENT LET THE PATIENT EAT AND WE HAD TO POSTPONE.
IT'S A PROBLEM SOMETIMES WITH RESIDENTS ROTATING IN.
THEY'RE EITHER NOT UP TO IT OR THEY SIMPLY DON'T CARE.
WHO WAS THIS RESIDENT?
THIRD YEAR FROM THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT.
UH, DOYLE.
MAGGIE DOYLE?
THEY THINK VERY HIGHLY OF HER DOWN THERE.
I BELIEVE SHE'S BEING CONSIDERED FOR CHIEF RESIDENT.
PICKINGS MUST BE PRETTY SLIM THIS YEAR.
I'VE ALWAYS FOUND HER TO BE EXTREMELY CAPABLE.
HUH. I UNDERSTAND SHE MAKES A LOT OF WOMEN
UNCOMFORTABLE.
ANYWAY, THIS IS GOING TO BE NIFTY.
UH, THE ULTRASOUND SHOWED STONES
IN THE COMMON BILE DUCT DISTAL TO THE SPHINCTER OF ODDI.
NO KIDDING.
I'M TELLING YOU, MY WHOLE TEAM IS TIED UP IN THE O.R.
I'M TELLING YOU SOMEONE NEEDS TO SCRUB OUT AND JOIN US.
WELL, THAT'S WHY YOU HAVE TO WAIT.
LOOK AT THE SIZE OF THAT BLOOD CLOT.
IT'S COMPRESSING HIS BRAIN.
EVERY SECOND COUNTS.
CHUNY, SHAVE THE SCALP.
MALIK, OPEN THE BURR HOLE TRAY.
YOU CAN'T DO BURR HOLES IN THE E.R.
WELL, YOU'RE NOT GIVING ME ANY CHOICE, ARE YOU?
WHAT SIZE GLOVES
DO YOU TAKE?
I AM NOT COMFORTABLE WITH THIS.
WE CAN'T WAIT
WITHOUT RISKING PERMANENT BRAIN DAMAGE.
WELL, I'LL TRY AGAIN TO GET SOMEONE DOWN.
NUMBER 12 BLADE.
PULSE IS DOWN TO 55.
SELF-RETAINING RETRACTOR.
THIS IS A BIG MISTAKE.
PRESSURE'S UP TO 180/95.
THAT'S THE CUSHING RESPONSE.
HE'S GOING TO HERNIATE
UNLESS WE RELIEVE THE PRESSURE.
PERIOSTEAL ELEVATOR.
MY CHIEF CAN BE DOWN
IN 20 MINUTES.
TOO LONG.
HUDSON BRACE AND PERFORATOR.
I CAN SEE THE SKULL FRACTURE LINE.
Oligario: A.B.G. IS BACK.
pH 7.51, pC02 25, p02 IS 350.
THAT'S WHAT WE WANT.
OKAY. I'M READY FOR THE BURR HOLE.
CAN'T YOU WAIT A FEW MINUTES?
KEEP THE IRRIGATION COMING.
I NEED TO SEE WHAT I'M DOING.
PLEASE?
NOT TOO DEEP.
IT'S OKAY.
I'M THROUGH THE INNER TABLE.
OKAY. THERE'S THE CLOT.
I NEED A DURAL SUCTION CATHETER.
PULSE UP TO 170.
B.P.'s 140/70.
Oligario: PUPILS ARE EQUAL.
THAT'S MORE LIKE IT.
WET STERILE GAUZE.
LET'S GET HIM UP TO THE O.R.
I'LL ALERT THE TEAM.
TELL THEM TO TAKE THEIR TIME.
HEY, DR. GREENE.
NICE JOB. ALL RIGHT.
( all applauding )
HEY, MARK, GOT TIME FOR A QUICK QUESTION?
YEAH, SURE.
HOW DO I ACCOUNT FOR A BROKEN CONTAINER
IN THE FRACTURE STUDY?
ONE OF THE VIALS BUSTED?
YEAH. THE POWDER SPILLED IN THE ENVELOPE.
I'D JUST MAKE A NOTE OF IT.
IT SHOULDN'T BE A PROBLEM.
WE HAVEN'T ENLISTED AS MANY PATIENTS AS ANTICIPATED.
WE PROBABLY WON'T USE ALL THE SAMPLES THEY SENT.
YOU GOING TO MAKE YOUR LECTURE?
ISN'T THE GUY FROM NASA AT THE MED SCHOOL TODAY?
OH, RIGHT. I ALMOST FORGOT.
( music blaring )
MRS. HAGGERTY, YOUR HUSBAND HAS BEEN STABILIZED
AND SENT UP TO THE O.R.
WHAT?
JERRY.
UH, YOUR HUSBAND HAS BEEN SENT UP
TO THE SURGICAL FLOOR, SO I'M GOING TO FIND
SOMEBODY TO TAKE YOU UP THERE.
I'LL TAKE HER UP.
DR. GREENE STABILIZED YOUR HUSBAND.
HE'S DOING FINE.
JERRY, DID YOU FIND OUT WHICH PARAMEDIC UNIT
LEFT MR. HAGGERTY WITH A BRAIN BLEED?
YEAH. DISPATCH SAID IT WAS
AN ENGINE COMPANY THAT WENT OUT
AND DORIS PICKMAN WAS THE PARAMEDIC ON BOARD.
OH, BOY.
YEAH. THEY SAID THAT THE DEPUTY CHIEF
WILL TAKE CARE OF IT FROM HERE.
I DON'T WANT HIM TO HANDLE IT.
LISTEN. CALL DISPATCH BACK AND TELL THEM
OKAY. THAT I'M GOING TO FOLLOW UP.
OH, AND JERRY, IF YOU PUT THAT MUSIC BACK ON, YOU'RE FIRED.
I'M SORRY IT'S TAKING SO LONG.
BUT SINCE WE PUT MY FINGERTIP ON ICE
IT'LL BE OKAY, RIGHT?
LIKE I TOLD YOUR DAD, THERE'S A POSSIBILITY
WE WON'T BE ABLE TO REATTACH.
DON'T TELL ME YOU'RE STILL WAITING ON PLASTICS.
YEP. I CALLED AGAIN.
THEY SWORE HE'S ON HIS WAY.
HEY, DID YOU FIND
ANOTHER CANDIDATE FOR THAT FRACTURE STUDY?
NO. JUST RECORDING A BROKEN CONTAINER.
IS HE A PLASTIC SURGEON?
NO. I'M SORRY.
YOU THIRSTY? YOU WANT SOMETHING TO DRINK?
MY DAD'S GETTING ME A COKE.
OKAY. IT SHOULDN'T BE THAT MUCH LONGER NOW.
DID YOU FIND MY SON?
HIS OFFICE SAID HE WAS OUT ON A SALES CALL
AND HE'S NOT PICKING UP HIS CELL PHONE.
WE'LL KEEP TRYING.
THANK YOU.
IS THE ZOFRAN HELPING THE NAUSEA?
NO.
I'M GOING TO ASK THE DOCS TO ADD REGLAN.
DON'T BOTHER.
THEY... THEY DON'T WORK.
ANY CHANCE YOU COULD...
WHEEL ME OUTSIDE FOR SOME FRESH AIR?
MR. ACKERMAN, I CAN'T TAKE YOU OUTSIDE
TO SMOKE MARIJUANA.
MAYBE WHEN YOUR SON ARRIVES, HE CAN HELP YOU OUT.
I'M REALLY SORRY.
DON'T BE.
I'M PROBABLY NOT ABLE TO INHALE ANYWAY.
THE NEUROMUSCULAR RESPONSE CAN BE STUDIED
SINCE THERE'S NO GRAVITATIONAL FORCE IN THE USUAL Z-AXIS
FROM HEAD TO TOE.
GENTLEMAN IN THE BACK.
WHAT ARE THE APPLICATIONS OF THIS STUDY?
THE LOSS OF MUSCLE TONE IN MICROGRAVITY
IS AN ISSUE THAT SCI-FI MOVIES HAVE LARGELY IGNORED.
COSMONAUTS WHO SPEND MONTHS ON THE MIR MISSION
HAVE TO BE CARRIED FROM THEIR SPACECRAFT UPON RETURN.
NOW, I'D LIKE TO KICK OFF THE Q & A
WITH A QUESTION TO YOU:
WHAT IS IT THAT INTERESTED YOU IN THE ASTRONAUT PROGRAM?
I ASK, BECAUSE A LOT OF CANDIDATES WILL ADMIT
TO CHILDHOOD DREAMS OF ADVENTURE
THE ADRENALINE OF TAKEOFF, THE VASTNESS OF SPACE.
SIR-- THE DOCTOR
WHO JUST WALKED IN-- WOULD YOU CARE TO RESPOND?
WELL, UH, FOR ME, IT WAS PRETTY MUCH, UH, ADVENTURE
YOU KNOW, THE ADRENALINE OF TAKEOFF
VASTNESS OF OUTER SPACE.
( all chuckling )
WELL, THANK YOU FOR YOUR CANDOR, DOCTOR...?
MARK GREENE.
AH! DR. GREENE.
DOUG LOWREY WANTED ME TO LOOK YOU UP.
DR. GREENE MAY BE JOINING US AS A PAYLOAD SPECIALIST.
BUT THE REAL PICTURE OF YOUR SCHEDULE
SHOULD YOU MAKE IT ON A MISSION
IS ONE OF ROUTINE.
IN TRAINING, YOU'LL SPEND AN ENTIRE YEAR
REPEATING THE SAME DAILY TASKS
FOLLOWING CHECKLISTS, ADAPTING TO A REGIMEN.
EVERYTHING YOU DO IS DICTATED BY THE GROUND CREW.
YOU FOLLOW A PRECISE, MINUTE-TO-MINUTE ITINERARY.
THERE AREN'T EVEN WINDOWS IN THE MID-DECK ...
I'M SORRY TO DISTURB YOU, DR. GREENE.
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO.
I-I KNOW I SCREWED UP REALLY BAD
BUT THE GUY SEEMED FINE AT THE SCENE
AND WHEN THE ENGINE GOT THE FIRE CALL
THE GUYS WERE ALL SO JAZZED.
I TOLD THE WIFE TO BRING THE GUY IN. DORIS, SLOW DOWN
UM, HOW'S MR. HAGGERTY?
HE HAD AN EPIDURAL HEMATOMA, BUT HE SHOULD BE OKAY.
THE DEPUTY CHIEF PULLED ME OFF ACTIVE DUTY.
THEY'RE GOING TO START A FORMAL INVESTIGATION.
WHAT?! HE'S WORRIED ABOUT BAD PRESS.
YOU KNOW, "FIRE ENGINE LEAVES AN ACCIDENT SCENE"?
THAT'S A MEDICAL ERROR. I SHOULD MAKE THAT CALL.
MAYBE I WAS INFLUENCED BY THE FIREFIGHTERS.
I KNEW THEY REALLY WANTED TO GET TO THAT FIRE
AND I KNOW THAT SHOULDN'T CLOUD MY JUDGMENT
BUT AN INVESTIGATION IS GOING TO RUIN MY RECORD.
TAKE A BREATH. I'LL SEE WHAT I CAN DO.
WILL YOU?
I'LL CALL THE DEPUTY CHIEF NOW.
COME ON, DOC.
I'M NOT GOING TO DO THAT.
ROLL UP YOUR SLEEVES.
I WON'T ARM WRESTLE WITH YOU
OVER WHETHER YOU CAN HAVE SURGERY.
OH, YOU SCARED TO?
YEAH. YEAH, YEAH, I AM.
WELL, I WANT THE SURGERY.
THAT'S ALL THERE IS TO IT.
AND THAT ONE DOCTOR CALCULATED
THAT I WAS FIT IN THE HEAD.
THAT'S BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T BOTHER TO MENTION TO HIM
YOU THOUGHT YOU WERE AT APPOMATTOX.
THERE WAS ANOTHER DOCTOR WHO ALSO SAID MY F.E.V.1
WAS OVER 120%.
NOW, I THINK THAT'S DARN GOOD.
THEY CLEARED YOU PHYSICALLY FOR SURGERY.
SEE, NOW YOU'RE GIVING ME THAT SECOND-RATE PILL IDEA.
I KNOW YOU THINK
THE MEDICAL TREATMENT ISN'T THAT CONVINCING
BUT I'VE GOT TO USE MY BETTER JUDGMENT.
NO, YOUR JUDGMENT NEEDS TO PUT YOUR ARM NEXT TO MINE
CLASPING MY HAND
AND WE WILL ARM WRESTLE
BECAUSE YOU'LL FIND OUT
THAT OLD CHARLEY'S NOT AS WEAK AND PUNY AS YOU THINK.
I NEVER SAID...
I DON'T THINK YOU'RE PUNY.
BUT YOU DON'T BELIEVE I CAN'T DIE.
MM-MM. DON'T BELIEVE THAT ONE, EITHER.
WELL, I'LL GIVE YOU SOMETHING YOU CAN BELIEVE: THIS.
PUT YOUR ELBOW RIGHT HERE. COME ON.
MR. BARNES, COME ON...
LISTEN, IF YOU DON'T GIVE A MAN HIS MEASURE OF RESPECT
AND YOU DON'T BELIEVE HIS HISTORY
THEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A FIGHT.
( laughing )
NOW, COME ON.
DON'T MAKE YOUR ELDER BEG.
COME ON, HUH? HUH?
GO.
COME ON!
DR. BENTON...
THERE IS AN O.R. AVAILABLE.
HEY, HEY, HEY...
DON'T HUMOR ME NOW.
( groaning )
OH, BOY...
( grunting )
( chuckling ): YOU WIN.
NAH...
( laughing )
YOU WIN.
ALL RIGHT, GO AHEAD. BOOK THE O.R.
( both laughing )
IT'S GOING TO TAKE A LITTLE WHILE TO WORK THE KINKS OUT.
BUT I KNOW DORIS PICKMAN. I WORK WITH HER DAY TO DAY
AND SHE DESERVES TO BE COUNSELED, NOT PUT ON A DESK.
NO, NO, NO, THIS IS MY JOB, AND...
IS DOUG ROSS AROUND?
UH, TRY ADMIT.
CHIEF DEPUTY MEAD, PLEASE.
IT'S MARK GREENE AGAIN.
DOUG.
HEY, HEATHER, THEY LET YOU OUT OF THE LAB, HUH?
OH, I MAKE SPECIAL DELIVERIES
FOR SOME CUSTOMERS.
WE GOT THE TOXICOLOGY RESULTS
ON THAT POWDER YOU BROUGHT IN.
YEAH, GREAT.
IT'S NEGATIVE FOR CODEINE. MM-HMM.
IS THAT ALL YOU NEEDED?
THAT'LL DO IT.
WHEN I HEARD YOU HAND-CARRIED IT
I THOUGHT, WELL, MAYBE YOU WERE...
BACK IN THE MARKET, HMM?
ME? UH, NO, I...
DOUG, UM, I CALLED THE HANDIVAN FOR THE ABBOTTS
AND JOI SAID YOU WERE GETTING HER A PRESCRIPTION.
OKAY. I'M ON MY WAY.
NICE TO SEE YOU. SEE YOU LATER.
MM-HMM. RICKY'S TEMP IS 98.8...
WHICH IS GOOD.
YOU KNOW, BACK THERE, THAT WAS... NOTHING, RIGHT?
HUH? YEAH. ( laughing )
HEY, KERRY, I'M AFRAID
LYNETTE HAS APPROPRIATED THE LOUNGE.
YEAH, I GUESS THE STAFF
WILL HAVE TO GOSSIP SOMEPLACE ELSE FOR AN HOUR, HUH?
YOU KNEW ABOUT IT?
YEAH. SHE SHOWED ME HER PROPOSAL LAST WEEK.
I THINK IT'S A GOOD AREA FOR THE CLINIC TO GET INTO.
I KNOW YOU CAN TELL IF HE'S CHEATING, BUT...
HOLD ON. YOUR MAN DON'T TAKE A SHOWER
BEFORE HE LEAVES THE HOUSE
BUT HE DOES TAKE ONE WHEN HE GETS HOME?
HELLO? HE'S CHEATING.
TARA'S RIGHT. THE NUMBER OF PARTNERS YOU HAVE AND HE HAS
CAN DEFINITELY PUT YOU AT RISK FOR CERVICAL CANCER.
PUT YOU AT RISK FOR BEING A DAMN FOOL, TOO.
( all laughing )
Hathaway: THE OTHER RISK FACTOR IS HOW YOUNG
YOU WERE WHEN YOU STARTED HAVING SEX AND IF YOU SMOKE.
THAT'S RIGHT.
UH, THIS IS CAROL HATHAWAY.
SHE RUNS THE CLINIC HERE.
NICE TO MEET YOU ALL.
OH, CARRY ON.
I THINK IT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT TOPIC TO BE INFORMED ABOUT
AND, UM, PLEASE FEEL FREE
TO COME AND SEE US AT THE CLINIC ANYTIME.
THANKS, CAROL.
MY APOLOGIES FOR THE DELAY. I'M DR. BAKER.
HI. JEANIE BOULET.
THIS IS DONNA.
HER FATHER SHOULD BE BACK SOON.
THIS IS THE X RAY, MS. BOULET?
YES. I DID A DIGITAL NERVE BLOCK WITH MARCAINE.
MM-HMM. AMPUTATION IS MIDWAY
THROUGH THE DISTAL PHALANX.
WE'LL NEED TO RONGEUR AND DO A V-Y FLAP.
YOU CAN PUT IT BACK ON, RIGHT?
NO. NOT WITH A CUT AT THIS LEVEL.
THE BLOOD VESSELS ARE TOO SMALL.
DID YOU EXPLAIN TO HER?
I TOLD HER IT MAY BE A POSSIBILITY.
MM-HMM.
BUT YOU GUYS PUT ARMS AND STUFF BACK ON.
THAT'S TRUE.
IF YOU HAD CUT YOUR FINGER AT THE BASE
WE'D HAVE BIGGER ARTERIES TO WORK WITH.
FOR THIS, WE'LL TRIM DOWN THE BONE
AND CREATE A FLAP
OVER THE DEFECT.
YOU MEAN I'LL HAVE A STUMP?
MAYBE WE SHOULD TALK TO DONNA'S FATHER.
YES. IF WE CAN GET A TRAUMA ROOM
I'LL DO THE PROCEDURE RIGHT AWAY.
DON'T WORRY, DONNA.
WE'LL MAKE YOU A SMALL PROSTHETIC TIP.
( "Space Oddity" playing )
I'M JUST SAYING, MAN, OLDIES ARE PLAYED OUT.
PEOPLE LIKE THE CLASSICS MIXED IN.
NOT ONES YOU CAN'T DANCE TO.
YEAH. I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO LOSE THEM.
JERRY, WHAT IS THIS?
YOU SAID YOU WANTED THE RAP TURNED OFF, RIGHT?
NO, ACTUALLY, I SAID WE NEEDED
A DESK CLERK HERE, NOT A D.J.
FINE. IT'S GONE.
IT'S NO MORE. FOREVER GONE.
YOU KNOW, WHAT POSSESSED YOU TO PICK THAT PARTICULAR SONG?
I DON'T KNOW. JUST INSTINCT, YOU KNOW?
I'M JUST GOING WITH THE FLOW.
UH-HUH.
MY MOM USED TO PLAY THIS ALBUM ALL THE TIME
WHEN I WAS A KID.
IT WAS ALWAYS, LIKE...
THE ULTIMATE FREEDOM--
YOU KNOW, LEAVE GROUND CONTROL BEHIND
AND JUST FLOAT AWAY.
ESCAPE? YEAH.
IT WAS COOL.
HEY, THE FOLKS IN THE WAITING AREA
WANT TO KNOW IF YOU COULD PUT BOWIE BACK ON?
JERRY, DO WHATEVER YOU WANT, OKAY?
JUST... USE YOUR BEST JUDGMENT.
ALL RIGHT, NOW, YOU GIVE THIS TO HIM
EVERY SIX HOURS, IF NEEDED.
YOU DON'T WANT TO EXCEED FOUR DOSES IN 24 HOURS.
YOU CALL ME IF IT ISN'T WORKING FOR HIM.
WATCH YOUR HEAD.
WHY DIDN'T THE GENETICS CLINIC
SUGGEST THIS MEDICATION?
WELL, IT'S BRAND-NEW.
IT'S STILL PART OF A CLINICAL TRIAL.
WE'VE HAD A LOT OF LUCK WITH KIDS WITH FRACTURES.
IT'S PERFECTLY SAFE FOR RICKY.
IT MIGHT GIVE HIM SOME RELIEF.
DO I NEED TO FILL ANY OF THIS OUT?
HMM? I WOULDN'T BOTHER.
HE'S NOT A CANDIDATE FOR THE STUDY.
HERE YOU GO, OKAY?
YUP. THANK YOU.
TRAUMA TWO IS OPEN.
ARE YOU FREE TO ASSIST ME?
I INSIST ON IT.
YOU BLEW BY THAT 12-YEAR-OLD GIRL
LIKE SHE WAS A MINOR ANNOYANCE IN YOUR BUSY DAY.
YOU SAID... THERE'S A PARENT HERE TO GIVE CONSENT.
YES.
FIND HIM, PLEASE.
I'LL EXPLAIN THE PROCEDURE.
I'LL DO THAT.
Lucy: I CAN'T BELIEVE
I GET TO SCRUB IN ON MY FIRST DAY.
YEAH, WELL, THAT'S THE BEST WAY TO LEARN.
READY FOR MASKS?
CHARLEY ATTRACTED QUITE A CROWD
IN THE WAITING ROOM.
DOES ANYONE KNOW WHERE HE'S FROM?
THEY SAY HE'S LIVED IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD FOR YEARS.
THAT CAR HE WAS PUSH-STARTING?
REGISTRATION EXPIRED IN 1956.
HE HAD ALL THESE TERRIBLE STORIES...
WHAT ARE THE FIRST TWO BRANCHES OF THE INTERNAL CAROTID?
THE OPHTHALMIC ARTERY
AND THE POSTERIOR COMMUNICATING.
OKAY. THAT'S IT. YOU'RE READY.
LET'S GO.
GOWN AND GLOVE MISS KNIGHT.
SHE DOESN'T KNOW THE ROPES.
HOW WE DOING, DR. RIGGS?
JUST ABOUT TO PUT HIM UNDER.
Benton: AROUND THE TABLE, KEEP YOUR HANDS
IN FRONT ABOVE YOUR WAIST.
DON'T REACH FOR ANYTHING UNLESS TOLD.
IF I HAVE AN ITCH? TELL THE NURSE WHERE TO SCRATCH.
( alarm sounds )
WHAT IS THAT? DR. RIGGS?
HE'S BRADYING DOWN.
ALL RIGHT. ATROPINE.
ONE MILLIGRAM ONBOARD.
HIS BLOOD PRESSURE'S DROPPING.
DAMN. HE'S IN V-FIB.
LUCY, GRAB THE CRASH CART NOW.
I'M STERILE.
IT DOESN'T MAKE
A DIFFERENCE. CHARGE TO 200. AMP OF EPI.
LET'S MOVE. COME ON.
CLEAR!
ASYSTOLE.
START COMPRESSIONS.
EPI AND ATROPINE ONBOARD.
RIGHT. WHAT'S THE RHYTHM?
GOT AN IDIOVENTRICULAR RHYTHM.
HE'S GOT A FAINT PULSE. LUCY, GET A B.P.
CAN HE STILL HAVE SURGERY?
NO. LET'S GET HIM A ROOM IN THE I.C.U.
HEY.
HOW LONG TILL SPRING?
I THINK THIS IS THE SHORTEST DAY OF THE YEAR, ISN'T IT?
UH, NO, THAT'S DECEMBER.
WE'RE WAY PAST THAT.
I MADE UP MY MIND. I'M NOT GOING TO HOUSTON.
REALLY?
IT'S AN OLD DREAM.
YOU COULD HAVE FOOLED ME.
I THOUGHT YOU WERE READY TO BLAST OFF.
I REALIZED...
I DIDN'T WANT TO GO.
( chuckling ): I DON'T WANT TO GO ANYWHERE.
THIS IS WHAT I DO.
THIS IS WHERE I BELONG.
YEAH.
LOST THAT OLD RESTLESSNESS, HUH?
I GUESS, YEAH.
MM-HMM.
COMING IN?
YEAH.
COME ON IN. IT'S COLD.
Hathaway: WHAT UPSETS ME IS THAT YOU
WENT OUT OF YOUR WAY NOT TO INVOLVE ME.
WHY WOULD I DO THAT?
MAYBE YOU KNEW I WOULD OBJECT.
OBJECT TO WHAT?
I NOTICED THAT ALL THE WOMEN WHO ATTENDED
WERE AFRICAN AMERICAN.
YEAH. THAT'S RIGHT.
THE CLINIC'S FOR EVERYONE, LYNETTE.
WELL, I DIDN'T EXCLUDE ANYONE.
WHERE DID YOU ADVERTISE?
BUT I DO HAVE A SPECIAL INTEREST
IN AN UNDERSERVED POPULATION THAT IS PARTICULARLY AT RISK.
LATINAS ARE EVEN MORE AT RISK THAN AFRICAN AMERICANS.
OUR DEATH RATE IS HIGHER.
VIETNAMESE WOMEN HAVE EVEN MORE STATISTICS.
CAROL, TO GET WOMEN TO CONSIDER
CHANGING THEIR SEXUAL HABITS
THEY NEED TO FEEL OPEN.
WOMEN TALK MORE FREELY AMONG THEIR OWN.
WELL, THEN, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO HOLD MORE SEMINARS
THAT TARGET OTHER POPULATIONS.
LOOK. I DID THIS ON MY OWN TIME
OUT OF MY OWN INTEREST.
I UNDERSTAND THAT
BUT I CAN'T HAVE YOU PULLING AGAINST ME.
IF YOU WANT TO CONTINUE WORKING IN THE CLINIC
YOU NEED TO ADJUST YOUR PROJECT
TO INCLUDE OTHER PEOPLE.
WELL...
I GUESS YOU'VE GIVEN ME SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT.
A COUPLE MORE STITCHES
AND THE "Y" IS CLOSED. SEE?
MM-HMM.
WHAT KIND OF MUSIC DO YOU PLAY, DONNA?
UM... FOLK AND CLASSICAL.
SOME ROCK.
WELL, MS. BOULET IS RIGHT.
MORE FIVE-O NYLON, PLEASE.
THE PROSTHETIC WILL TAKE SOME GETTING USED TO
BUT, WITH TIME, YOU'LL BE ABLE TO PLAY JUST FINE.
WHAT ABOUT COMPUTER GAMES?
NO. THOSE YOU'LL NEVER BE ABLE
TO TOUCH AGAIN.
YOUR DAD PAID ME TO SAY THAT.
CUT, PLEASE, JENNY.
IT'S JEANIE.
SORRY, MS. BOULET.
HONEST, I OWE YOU MY FIRSTBORN.
DO THAT AND YOU'RE ON A DESK.
REALLY, YOU SAVED MY CAREER.
I GAVE YOU A CHANCE TO TURN IT AROUND.
WE'LL WORK OUT A COUNSELING SCHEDULE NEXT WEEK, OKAY?
GET BACK OUT THERE.
THANKS. WHERE'S JERRY?
I THINK WE'RE IN BETWEEN SETS.
ACTUALLY, I WAS TAKING REQUESTS.
HEY, YOU OFF?
YEAH. WHY?
THAT POOR GUY IN EXAM TWO
WANTED TO SAY GOOD-BYE TO YOU.
OH, MR. ACKERMAN? PANCREATIC CANCER?
HE'S GOING TO HAVE TO STAY THE NIGHT.
NOBODY CAN PICK HIM UP UNTIL TOMORROW.
MS. ABBOTT, ARE YOU STILL WAITING FOR THE HEALTH BUS?
OH, NO. HE'S HERE. WE'RE ALL LOADED UP.
I JUST HAD ANOTHER QUESTION FOR DR. ROSS.
DR. ROSS IS IN A MEETING.
IS THERE SOMETHING I CAN HELP WITH?
HE GAVE SOME NEW MEDICATION TO US.
AND I FORGOT TO ASK
IF IT'S ALL RIGHT TO TAKE IT WITH ROBAXIN.
MY SON HAS A.L.D.
AND HE HAS A FRACTURE?
NO, BUT HE WAS IN PAIN
AND DR. ROSS THOUGHT THIS MIGHT HELP.
WELL, WHERE'S YOUR STUDY ENVELOPE?
HE SAID WE DIDN'T NEED TO BOTHER WITH THAT.
DR. ROSS DID.
SINCE MY SON ISN'T ACTUALLY A CANDIDATE FOR THE TRIAL.
I SEE.
I HEARD YOUR SON COULDN'T MAKE IT.
( moans )
OKAY.
YOU NEED THIS?
PLEASE.
( coughing )
NEVER MIND.
OH, GOD.
AGAIN?
HEY. DOUG STILL UPSTAIRS?
I DON'T KNOW.
WELL, I'M HEADED HOME.
MARK, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT A BOY WITH A.L.D.?
RICKY ABBOTT?
WHY WAS HE GIVEN MEDS FOR THE CLINICAL TRIAL?
HE WASN'T. DOUG WOULDN'T DO THAT.
LOOKS LIKE HE DID.
MARK...
TALK TO DOUG.
I'M SURE THERE'S AN EXPLANATION.
YEAH.
MS. BOULET, I WANTED TO THANK YOU
FOR ASSISTING ON THE FINGER FLAP.
NOT AT ALL.
AND FOR REMINDING ME
TO TAKE TIME WITH OUR YOUNG PATIENT.
I DON'T DO WELL WHEN I GET BEHIND SCHEDULE
BUT THAT'S NO EXCUSE.
YOU WERE RIGHT AND I THANK YOU.
YOU'RE WELCOME.
I WAS WONDERING IF, BY ANY CHANCE
YOU'D BE FREE TO JOIN ME FOR AN OPENING
AT THE ART INSTITUTE THIS EVENING.
THIS EVENING?
I REALIZE IT'S SHORT NOTICE
BUT IT MAY BE INTERESTING:
RAGHUBIR SINGH, AN INDIAN PHOTOGRAPHER.
I'M AFRAID I DON'T KNOW THAT MUCH ABOUT ART.
I'M AFRAID I DON'T CARE MUCH ABOUT ART
BUT I PROMISED MY WIFE, WHO DIED A FEW YEARS AGO
THAT I'D KEEP UP OUR MEMBERSHIP
AND NOT BECOME A TOTAL PHILISTINE WITHOUT HER.
I'M SORRY TO HEAR THAT YOU LOST YOUR WIFE.
AND MY PARTNER.
JENNY AND I HAD A PRACTICE TOGETHER FOR 15 YEARS.
HER NAME WAS JENNY.
MM-HMM.
NURSE, YOU'RE AN ANGEL.
CALLED FOR A CONSULT?
YEAH. SELF-INFLICTED KNIFE WOUNDS.
QUITE A FEW OF THEM.
MR. MICHAELS GAVE ME A LITTLE SUTURING REFRESHER.
SHE'S MY ANGEL.
THAT IS NOT WHAT HE WAS CALLING ME BEFORE THE HALDOL.
BELLY SEEMS BENIGN, NO BLOOD IN URINE
BUT THESE TWO NEEDED TWO-LAYER CLOSURES.
GOOD BOWEL SOUNDS.
BELLY'S SOFT.
I WANTED TO MENTION TO YOU
I'VE BEEN HAVING A PROBLEM WITH DR. ROMANO.
UH... YEAH. KERRY SPOKE WITH ME THIS MORNING
WITHOUT ACTUALLY SAYING IT WAS YOU.
I'M SORRY I DIDN'T ASK
BEFORE DRAGGING YOUR NAME INTO IT.
WELL, I DON'T THINK I CAN BE OF ANY HELP.
( patient snoring loudly )
THERE'S NO SIGN OF ANY INTRA-ABDOMINAL BLEED.
HE'S GOT ANOTHER ONE ON HIS BACK.
WE'LL HAVE TO LIFT HIM.
YOU KNOW, I WAS HOPING
THAT ROMANO WOULD COOL IT
IF I CONFRONTED HIM.
BUT INSTEAD, HE THREATENED
TO BLAST ME ON MY EVALUATION.
YEAH. YOU GOT HIM?
DR. ROMANO CAN BE VOLATILE.
YEAH. YOU MEAN
HE'S A MEAN-SPIRITED, LITTLE POWERMONGER?
THAT, TOO.
WELL, THE KIDNEYS LOOK FINE, AS WELL.
WHORES! WHORES! WHORES! I WANT TO DIE!
OH, THERE'S
THE MR. MICHAELS
I KNOW AND LOVE.
LOOK, UM... ROMANO-- HE LIKES TO PUSH THINGS TO THE LIMIT.
GUESS HE THOUGHT ANYTHING GOES WITH THE GAY CHICK.
I JUST HOPE YOU'RE NOT, UM... GOING OUT ON A LIMB.
HE'S A STAR.
SELF-RESPECT IS A BITCH.
KERRY! KERRY, DO YOU HAVE A MOMENT?
MARK NEEDED TO TALK TO ME.
YOU'RE ON YOUR WAY OUT?
HOW ABOUT I BUY YOU BREAKFAST TOMORROW?
THAT SOUNDS LIKE MORE THAT A MINUTE.
I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT YOUR INQUIRY
AND I MAY HAVE SOME THINGS TO ADD.
OKAY, I'LL CALL YOU.
WE'LL SET SOMETHING UP. GREAT.
THERE SHE IS-- MINNESOTA FATS.
I WAS AFRAID I'D MISSED YOU.
HEY, REGGIE.
HEY. YOU ARE GOING TO GIVE ME A CHANCE
TO WIN MY MONEY BACK TONIGHT, RIGHT?
I CAN'T PLAY POOL TWO NIGHTS IN A ROW.
IT'S BAD LUCK.
IT'S BAD LUCK TO PLAY ONE NIGHT AGAINST YOU.
WHERE DID YOU LEARN TO CLEAR A TABLE LIKE THAT?
SIGN OF A MISSPENT YOUTH.
SO WHAT DO YOU SAY WE GET A BITE TO EAT?
ACTUALLY, I HAVE OTHER PLANS FOR TONIGHT.
SOMETHING A NEW FRIEND CAN BARGE IN ON?
AN OPENING AT THE ART INSTITUTE.
UH... SAY NO MORE.
I'LL CATCH YOU ON THE WEEKEND.
OKAY.
I AM SO PISSED.
I ALMOST WENT STRAIGHT TO ANSPAUGH.
WHAT THE HELL WAS DOUG THINKING?
IT CERTAINLY WASN'T ABOUT COUNTY.
IF WE WERE EXPOSED FOR BREAKING PROTOCOL
ON A FEDERALLY FUNDED TRIAL...
THEY'D CUT OFF RESEARCH MONEY AND MEDICARE PAYMENTS FOR YEARS.
NOT TO MENTION THAT IT'S AGAINST THE LAW.
THEY BROUGHT ME THE STUDY.
I GOT HIM ON BOARD.
MARK, GIVEN THE IMPLICATIONS
I DON'T THINK WE HAVE ANY CHOICE BUT TO HANDLE THIS INTERNALLY.
COVER IT UP.
MM-HMM.
ANSPAUGH FINDS OUT, HE HAS TO REACT.
NICE POSITION HE PUT US IN, HUH?
MARK, DO YOU HAVE THE KEY TO THE PAIN STUDY CABINET?
DOUG, WHY DON'T YOU COME IN AND TAKE A SEAT?
ANY CHANGES?
WILL HE WAKE UP?
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
HIS BRAIN WAS DEPRIVED OF A LOT OF OXYGEN
DURING HIS CARDIAC ARREST.
MM-HMM. AND OLD FOLKS DON'T USUALLY COME BACK
WITH FULL FUNCTION AFTER HYPOXIC INSULT.
IT'S A WAIT-AND-SEE.
HE COULD LIVE LIKE THIS FOR A WHILE.
FOREVER. WELL, ACCORDING TO HIM.
WHAT'S HIS GLASGOW SCORE?
AN EIGHT.
NO SPONTANEOUS EYE-OPENING
NO SPEAKING
RESPONDS ONLY TO PAINFUL STIMULUS.
EXCUSE ME.
I'M SORRY, I JUST DIDN'T EXPECT THIS.
OH, WELL. NEITHER DID I.
SHOULD I GO TELL HIS NEIGHBORS?
NO. I'LL DO IT.
Ross: AND THEN TO TOP IT OFF, HE GOES TO
KERRY WEAVER INSTEAD OF COMING TO ME.
BUT YOU GAVE JOI THE MEDS?
YEAH. MARK SAID HIMSELF
THAT HE WASN'T GOING TO USE ALL THE SAMPLES.
THAT'S NOT THE POINT, THOUGH, IS IT?
WHAT IS THE POINT?
THAT BREAKING RESEARCH PROTOCOL
COULD DAMAGE THE HOSPITAL'S FUNDING.
MMM.
SO YOU-- YOU AGREE WITH HIM.
YEAH. I... I SEE THEIR POINT.
YOU KNOW HOW SICK THAT KID IS.
YEAH.
BUT THAT DECISION COULD HAVE A MUCH LARGER IMPACT.
ALL RIGHT. THE HOSPITAL IS ONLY AT RISK
IF SOMEONE GOES OUT OF THEIR WAY TO REPORT ME
AND BELIEVE ME
IT KILLS KERRY WEAVER NOT TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY, DOUG.
YEAH.
DOUG, DON'T WALK AWAY.
DOUG.
