PREVIOUSLY ON E.R.:
SOMEONE'S DOWN!
WE HAVE TO WAIT FOR THE AREA TO BE SECURED.
WE SHOULD NOT BE OUT HERE!
YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO SMOOTH THINGS
OUT BETWEEN THE E.R. AND PARAMEDICS.
YOU'RE MY NEW INTERN.
I JUST GAVE YOU AN ORDER.
I WASN'T AWARE THAT REESE
HAD A HEARING PROBLEM.
MY SON IS MY BUSINESS.
AND I'M NOT INTERESTED
IN CONTINUING AS INTERN CHIEF.
MY BEARD IS STUCK.
I WOULDN'T HAVE ASKED SO MANY QUESTIONS
IF YOU HAD TOLD ME WHAT YOU WERE DOING.
WELL, I'M SORRY THAT YOU THOUGHT
IT WAS YOUR BUSINESS TO ASK ME.
CARTER?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
( reggae music playing )
( blender whirring )
( music playing loudly )
HEY! MORNING, CARTER!
THAT'S GRACE JONES.
AH.
HEY, I DIDN'T WAKE YOU UP, DID I?
I MEAN, YOU'RE ON AT 7:00?
UH... YEAH...
BUT NO... NO PROBLEM.
GOOD. YOU SETTLING IN DOWN THERE?
YES, I LIKE IT.
YOU HAVE A VERY INTERESTING
CD COLLECTION.
WHAT?!
YOU HAVE A VERY ECLECTIC CD COLLEC...
( music volume decreases )
THANKS.
YOU KNOW, ANYTHING
YOU WANT TO LISTEN TO, JUST ASK ME.
DON'T EVER TOUCH IT
ON YOUR OWN, THOUGH.
I MEAN, I'VE RENTED TO A LOT OF STUDENTS
SO I HAD TO MAKE THAT A RULE.
CARTER...
LET ME MAKE YOU ONE OF THESE, MAN.
OH...
IT WILL SLING-SHOT YOU INTO YOUR DAY.
YEAH. YOU'RE IN A REALLY GOOD MOOD.
I AM JUST... I'M SO GLAD
TO BE 100% FOCUSED ON MEDICINE.
HEY, CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING?
SURE.
DO YOU FIND IT EASY TO EVALUATE OTHER PEOPLE'S WORK?
HMM, TIME TO GRADE YOUR STUDENT, HUH?
UH-HUH. I WORRY ABOUT BEING TOO HARSH.
DOES SHE DESERVE TO BE JUDGED HARSHLY?
I WANT TO BE FAIR.
LUCY HASN'T GOTTEN OFF TO A GREAT START
THIS YEAR, CLEARLY...
BUT SHE'S SMART
AND SHE'S WILLING TO WORK HARD.
SO I THINK MAYBE I SHOULD GO EASY
AND GIVE HER A CHANCE TO TURN THINGS AROUND...
( music plays louder )
GO ON. KEEP TALKING.
( blender whirring )
Audia: ONE OF THE STRIPPERS?
Zardo: YEAH, I'M SAYING, "CAN'T YOU COVER THAT?"
I THOUGHT I'D COME FOR A RIDE-ALONG THIS MORNING.
IT'S MORE FUN THAN THE HOSPITAL, ISN'T IT?
HE LIKES IT OUT THERE ON THE FRONT LINES.
EITHER THAT OR WE NEED CLOSER SUPERVISION.
SOMEBODY'S GOT TO KEEP AN EYE ON YOU, MORALES.
HEY, DOC, RIGHT HERE.
OH, BY THE WAY...
CAN I CRASH HERE TONIGHT?
MY BUILDING'S BEING FUMIGATED.
YOU HAVE TO ASK THE CAPTAIN.
IT SHOULDN'T BE A PROBLEM, THOUGH.
YOU CAN SLEEP ON ONE OF THE BARCALOUNGERS.
WHO PAGED ME?
I GOT AN 87-YEAR-OLD MAN
WITH ASCENDING CHOLANGITIS FOR YOU.
YEAH, WELL, I STOPPED TAKING ADMITS AT 6:30.
WHY DIDN'T YOU PAGE TODAY'S ON-CALL TEAM?
THE GUY CAME IN WHILE YOU WERE STILL ON CALL
AND DR. ROMANO SPECIFICALLY ASKED FOR YOU.
( sighing ): HOW SICK IS HE?
HE'S SEPTIC, INTUBATED
HYPOTENSIVE AND IN RENAL FAILURE.
NO, NO, NO! THIS CAN'T BE HAPPENING.
LOOK, I HAVEN'T HAD SO MUCH AS A NAP IN THE LAST 24 HOURS.
ROUNDS ARE ABOUT TO START.
I HAVE TO TAKE A SHOWER-- I SMELL BAD
AND YOU'RE GIVING ME A PATIENT WHO'S SICK AS A DOG.
LOOK, WHAT DOES THAT SAY?
WHAT DOES THAT SAY? 6:38.
I'M NOT ON CALL!
HE'S IN CURTAIN THREE.
HEY, WE'VE ALL BEEN THERE.
( whispering ): SHUT UP.
"TONY BROADWAY"?
IS THAT A GREAT PORN STAR NAME OR WHAT?
CAROL, WANT TO KNOW YOUR PORNO STAR NAME?
WHAT?
TAKE YOUR MIDDLE NAME
AND THE NAME OF THE STREET YOU LIVE ON.
LIKE MINE WOULD BE "ANTHONY BROADWAY--
TONY BROADWAY."
YOU GOT THAT MIXED UP, JER.
THAT WOULD BE YOUR ROMANCE NOVELIST NAME.
EXCUSE ME.
YOUR PORNO STAR NAME WOULD BE YOUR PET NAME
WITH YOUR MOTHER'S MAIDEN NAME.
LIKE MY PORNO STAR NAME WOULD BE "NIBBLES McGEE."
( laughing ): NIBBLES. THAT'S A GREAT PORNO NAME.
MINE WOULD BE "FLUFFY FLOREZ."
WHAT IF YOU DON'T HAVE A PET?
USE ONE THAT YOU HAD WHEN YOU WERE A KID.
NIBBLES. THAT IS A GREAT NAME.
I DON'T THINK THAT'S RIGHT, JEANIE.
SO, CAROL, WHAT WOULD YOURS BE?
OH, MINE WOULDN'T WORK.
HEY, JERRY, HAVE WE GOTTEN A PACKAGE
FROM LAKESIDE MEDICAL SUPPLY?
THIS EARLY?
IT'S SUPPOSED TO ARRIVE "FIRST OVERNIGHT."
TELL ME AS SOON AS IT GETS HERE.
KERRY, HAVE YOU GOT A MINUTE?
I NEED TO PREPARE THESE ATTENDING SCHEDULES
AND I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE COMPUTER PROGRAM DOWN HERE.
EPSKED? IT'S A SNAP.
JERRY CAN TAKE YOU THROUGH IT.
YOU CAN'T GIVE ME A HAND?
WELL, I GOT A LOT OF PATIENTS.
DR. ANSPAUGH, GOT A WOMAN ON FIVE-THREE
WHO'S COMPLAINING ABOUT HER BILL.
SAYS SHE WAS CHARGED FOR PROCEDURES THAT WEREN'T DONE.
WHY ARE YOU TELLING ME?
BECAUSE THOSE CALLS GO TO THE CHIEF OF EMERGENCY SERVICES.
OR THE INTERIM CHIEF.
TELL HER YOU'LL PULL HER CHART
REVIEW THE BILL AND CALL HER WITHIN TWO DAYS.
"AND I DON'T KNOW HOW I'M SUPPOSED TO LEARN
"IN THIS KIND OF HOSTILE ENVIRONMENT.
"OUR RELATIONSHIP HAS TURNED COMPLETELY ADVERSARIAL
"AND IT'S NOT GOOD FOR THE PATIENTS.
DR. CARTER, WE NEED TO TALK."
HEY, LUCY, IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?
HMM?
YOU WERE TALKING TO YOURSELF.
NOT THAT THAT'S A BAD THING, BUT...
ACTUALLY... DO YOU THINK I SHOULD SIT DOWN
AND TALK TO DR. CARTER?
WELL, IT DEPENDS ON HOW DIRECT YOU WANT TO BE.
YOU DON'T WANT TO BE CONFRONTATIONAL FROM THE GET-GO.
YOU DON'T WANT HIM TO BE DEFENSIVE.
RIGHT.
I WOULD DO IT OVER A MEAL.
OH, LIKE A CHAT.
I LIKE THAT; THAT MAKES SENSE.
OH, DAMN. UM...
HEY, LUCY?
HMM?
COULD YOU GET ME A TAMPON
FROM THE THINGY, PLEASE?
OH, I GOT ONE HERE.
DAMN IT.
THERE YOU GO.
THANKS A LOT.
PETER, I'M SORRY I'M LATE.
I WAS IN THE E.R. WITH AN ADMISSION
YOU NEED TO SEE RIGHT AWAY.
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?
87-YEAR-OLD-MALE, SEPTIC WITH ASCENDING CHOLANGITIS.
HE'S ON MEZLO AND FLAGYL.
I GOT HIS PRESSURE UP WITH HIGH-DOSE DOPAMINE.
WELL, HE'S TOO SICK FOR OPEN SURGERY.
WE'LL DO A PERCUTANEOUS DECOMPRESSION.
I BOOKED THE O.R. ALREADY.
SO, BUSY NIGHT LAST NIGHT, HUH?
OH, GOD, HORRIBLE.
12 ADMISSIONS, PLUS THIS ONE.
I GOT AN ABDOMINAL AORTIC ANEURYSM
STAB WOUND TO THE CHEST
FALL FROM A SECOND-STORY BALCONY.
THEY JUST KEPT COMING.
I USED TO WORK 36-HOUR SHIFTS AS AN INTERN BACK IN ENGLAND
BUT THIS IS MAKING ME REALIZE HOW LONG AGO THAT WAS.
ALL RIGHT. SO I'LL TAKE HIM DOWN AND WE'LL ROUND AT 8:00, OKAY?
LOVELY. THAT GIVES ME ENOUGH TIME FOR PRE-ROUNDS
AND, UH... A SHOWER.
OH, YOU KNOW, UM, I BUMPED INTO
DAVID KOTLOWITZ AN HOUR AGO.
HE'S A TERRIFIC E.N.T.
HE'S DONE A LOT OF WORK WITH COCHLEAR IMPLANTS.
DID YOU TELL HIM ABOUT REESE?
NO, NO. I JUST TOLD HIM
I HAD A FRIEND IN NEED OF STRAIGHT TALK ON THE SUBJECT.
ELIZABETH, DON'T FEEL THE NEED
TO SOLICIT MEDICAL ADVICE ON MY BEHALF.
I WORKED WITH KOTLOWITZ BEFORE.
THAT'S THE ONLY REASON I BROUGHT IT UP.
IF YOU'D RATHER I HADN'T...
YEAH, I'D RATHER YOU HADN'T.
FINE. FORGET ABOUT IT.
WHAT IS THAT, A STERNAL SAW?
OH, YES, IT IS.
WHAT IS IT DOING DOWN HERE?
MY MIDLINE THORACOTOMY PROPOSAL SAILED
THROUGH THE HUMAN SUBJECTS COMMITTEE.
NOBODY TOLD ME.
YEAH, WELL, I'M CERTIFIED TO USE IT
SO WE'RE UP AND RUNNING.
I THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO SIT
AND TALK THIS THING THROUGH
BEFORE IT GOT UNDERWAY.
SURGEON'S USE IT ON ODD DAYS
E.R. DOCS GET IT ON EVENS.
YOUR TURN'S TOMORROW!
( whirring )
HEY, I WAS...
HEY, BAD NEWS. HMM?
WE'RE STILL NOT PREGNANT.
I GUESS WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO REDOUBLE OUR EFFORTS.
YEAH, BUT THEY SAY IF YOU DO IT MORE THAN THREE TIMES A WEEK
WE GET DIMINISHING RETURNS.
YOU KNOW, LIKE RE-USING THE SAME TEA BAG.
THAT'S A ROMANTIC IDEA.
IT WASN'T VERY ROMANTIC, WAS IT?
DOUG... EXCUSE ME.
I'VE GOT A LETHARGIC FOUR-MONTH-OLD
HASN'T BEEN EATING.
YOU BETTER COME SEE HIM.
OKAY.
YOU OKAY?
YEAH, YEAH.
OKAY.
THE BABY'S NAME IS SUN; IS HE KOREAN?
ACTUALLY, IT'S SUN.
HIS MOM'S A LITTLE DIFFERENT.
MM-HMM.
ALL RIGHT, MRS. EVERLY, I'M DR. ROSS.
CAN I TAKE A LOOK?
PLEASE. I DON'T KNOW WHAT WENT WRONG.
HE DOESN'T WANT TO NURSE.
OKAY, WE'LL FIGURE IT OUT.
HEY, YOU HIS BIG SISTER?
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
SKY. HELLO, DOCTOR.
WELL, HELLO, SKY.
SUN AND SKY, HUH?
SHE SAID HE WAS FINE UNTIL A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO.
AND THEN I NOTICED HE WASN'T NURSING SO WELL.
MM-HMM. DO YOU HAVE HIM ON ANY SOLID FOODS OR FORMULA?
OH, NO, ONLY MY MILK.
MY BREASTS ARE, LIKE
ENGORGED WITH HIM NOT EATING.
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME HE POOPED?
OH, MAN. WHEN?
YESTERDAY MORNING.
MM-HMM, YOU SURE?
YES, I HAVEN'T CHANGED HIM SINCE THEN.
WE'RE GOING TO HYDRATE HIM.
WE'LL GIVE HIM 50cc's
OF D5 QUARTER NORMAL SALINE.
WE HAVE TO DO SOME BLOOD TESTS.
I NEED YOUR CONSENT
TO DO A SPINAL TAP.
YOU'RE GOING TO STICK A NEEDLE INTO HIS SPINE?
WON'T THAT HURT?
WE'LL SEDATE HIM; HE WON'T FEEL PAIN.
MA, IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY.
DO YOU REALLY THINK SO, HONEY?
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK, OKAY?
LET'S GET A C.B.C., CHEM 20 AND BLOOD CULTURES.
ARE YOU ABLE TO ASSIST WITH THE L.P.?
SURE, BUT HOW ARE YOU GOING TO SEDATE HIM?
PROPOFOL, I'M GOING TO GO THROUGH PEDES I.C.U. AND GET IT.
GENERAL ANESTHESIA? HAVE WE DONE THAT BEFORE IN THE E.R.?
THERE'S A FIRST TIME FOR EVERYTHING.
I'LL TAKE THE PROPER PRECAUTION.
Woman: HOW COULD YOU?!
Man 1: YOU'RE NOT HELPING WITH THE YELLING.
Man 2: THERE'S AN AMBULANCE OUT FRONT.
DON'T OPEN THAT DOOR.
Woman: GET AWAY FROM ME!
OPEN UP!
Woman: GET AWAY FROM ME!
YES, HELLO.
WE GOT A NINE-ELEVEN CALL OF A MALE
WITH A BLEEDING HEAD INJURY.
SHE SHOULDN'T HAVE CALLED...
GET IN HERE, FOR GOD'S SAKE!
WHERE'S THE INJURED MAN?
THIS IS NOT AN EMERGENCY.
HE'S IN HERE.
EVERYTHING'S FINE.
I DON'T NEED TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL.
WHAT IS YOUR NAME, SIR?
RICHARD WEINGARTEN.
HE LET THIS LUNATIC DRILL A HOLE IN HIS HEAD.
I'M AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN.
WHY DON'T YOU LET ME TAKE A LOOK AT THAT.
I'M ALL RIGHT.
OKAY, JUST SIT DOWN HERE, SIT DOWN.
WHAT ARE YOU ASHAMED OF?
OH!
WHAT HAPPENED HERE?
WELL, IT'S CALLED "TREPANATION."
IT'S A CENTURIES-OLD
PRACTICE.
IT'S A LEGITIMATE MEANS
OF INCREASING BRAIN-BLOOD VOLUME.
I HAD MINE DONE IN AMSTERDAM, 1968
IT WAS LIKE GOD LIFTED A WEIGHT FROM MY SHOULDERS.
THIS IS A SURGICAL DRILL.
WE'RE GOING
TO THE HOSPITAL.
YOU CAN'T TAKE ME AGAINST MY WILL.
I'VE STUDIED THIS FOR YEARS.
I DIDN'T EMBARK ON IT LIGHTLY.
LET US AT LEAST PUT A BANDAGE ON
AND GET A BLOOD PRESSURE.
OKAY, SIR, JUST SIGN THIS.
IT SAYS YOU REFUSED TREATMENT.
GO TO THE RIG AND GET SOME SALINE.
COME ON, RICH, WE DID IT.
YOU DID IT...
THE INTERNET!
THAT'S WHAT STARTED THIS WHOLE THING!
FOR GOD'S SAKE, LAURA...
GET HER OUTSIDE!
ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?!
NOW!
I DON'T WANT TO GO!
I CAN SEE THAT YOU'RE AN INTELLIGENT PERSON.
I DON'T WANT TO TAKE YOU ANYWHERE AGAINST YOUR WILL.
I HAD TO DO SOMETHING.
ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT, OKAY.
IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE YOU PENETRATED THE DURA.
ALL I WANT TO DO IS PUT A STERILE DRESSING ON
TO CLEAN THE WOUND, OKAY?
I'M GOING TO LEAVE YOU SOME SALINE
AND A SUPPLY OF GAUZE
SO THAT YOU OR YOUR FRIEND CAN KEEP IT CLEAN.
I FORGOT TO BRING ANY GAUZE.
HMM.
YEAH, I'VE HELD ENOUGH SCREAMING BABIES TO KNOW.
THAT'S WHY THEY HAVE TO BE SEDATED.
DOUG... WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
YOU CAN'T ADMINISTER PROPOFOL TO AN INFANT.
WELL, YOU'VE BEEN DOING IT UPSTAIRS FOR TEN YEARS.
YOU'RE NOT AN ANESTHESIOLOGIST.
I DIDN'T THINK YOU'D HAVE A PROBLEM WITH IT, ALEX.
WELL... WELL, I DO.
I HAVE HIM ON A CARDIAC MONITOR, A PULSE OX, DYNAMAP AND I HAVE
A CRASH CART STANDING BY.
YOU CAN NOT JUST MAKE UP POLICY AS YOU GO ALONG.
I'M HERE TRYING TO PREVENT PAIN.
DO WHAT'S BEST FOR THIS LITTLE BOY.
IF YOU WANT TO DISCUSS POLICY
THEN LEAVE AND WE'LL DO IT LATER.
WE WILL.
DR. CARTER, YOU WANT TO GRAB SOME LUNCH LATER?
LET'S SEE HOW THE DAY GOES.
CAN YOU TELL ME ABOUT THIS PATIENT
WITH DYSURIA IN CURTAIN THREE?
30-YEAR-OLD MALE WITH PAIN ON URINATION FOR THREE DAYS.
A U.A. IS NEGATIVE FOR WHITE CELLS...
CHLAMYDIA.
DID YOU DO A SEXUAL HISTORY?
YEAH, HE'S ONLY HAD TWO PARTNERS IN THE LAST YEAR
AND HE USED CONDOMS.
( scoffs ): SO HE CLAIMS.
SEND OFF A DNA PROBE AND TREAT EMPIRICALLY.
WHAT'S THE TREATMENT FOR CHLAMYDIA?
DOXYCYCLINE B.I.D. OR A ONE-TIME DOSE OF ZITHROMAX.
VERY GOOD.
BUT I REALLY THINK YOU SHOULD...
HI. I'M DR. CARTER.
HEY.
I NEED TO ASK YOU, DO YOU ALWAYS USE CONDOMS?
UH... PRETTY MUCH, YEAH.
THERE'S TIMES RECENTLY WHERE YOU HAVEN'T?
WELL, ONCE OR TWICE, MAYBE, YEAH.
THAT'S ALL IT TAKES.
WE'RE GOING TO GIVE YOU SOME ANTIBIOTICS.
I BELIEVE YOU HAVE A VERY COMMON INFECTION CALLED CHLAMYDIA.
WHAT, V.D.?
A SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASE.
WH-WHOA, SHE DOESN'T THINK SO.
HE ALSO HAD CONJUNCTIVITIS
AND POLYARTICULAR ARTHRALGIAS OF THE KNEE AND ANKLE.
MR. BUSSEY, WOULD YOU EXCUSE US FOR A MOMENT?
HE WAS IN MEXICO AND HAD DIARRHEA.
THE SYMPTOMS ARE CLASSIC FOR REITER'S SYNDROME.
YOU COULD'VE INCLUDED THAT IN YOUR PRESENTATION.
I TRIED TO, BUT YOU CUT ME OFF.
ALL YOU HAD TO SAY WAS, "I THINK IT'S REITER'S."
YOU WOULDN'T LET ME, YOU'RE ALWAYS...
I'M ALWAYS DOING WHAT, LUCY?
LIKE RIGHT NOW, YOU'RE GETTING DEFENSIVE.
YOU DON'T EVEN HEAR ME.
SO, WHAT'S THE TREATMENT FOR REITER'S SYNDROME?
INDOMETHACIN.
WELL, WE CAN STILL SEND OFF A CHLAMYDIA PROBE.
NO, YOU'RE RIGHT, IT'S REITER'S.
PROPOFOL IS IDEAL FOR USE IN THE E.R.
THIS IS ABOUT HOW POLICY IS MADE.
...AND IT WEARS OFF WITHIN FOUR...
DON'T YOU THINK A DOCTOR SHOULD BE TRAINED IN THE USE...?
WE'VE GOT A GUNSHOT WOUND TO THE CHEST COMING IN.
THE SAW IS STERILIZED IN TRAUMA ONE.
WE NEED TO BE READY TO GO IN CASE THIS GUY QUALIFIES.
YOU'LL BE DOCUMENTING TEN CRITICAL TIMES.
THE CLOCK STARTS WHEN?
SOON AS THE PATIENT ENTERS THE TRAUMA ROOM.
DON'T THEY NEED TO HAVE A CARDIAC ARREST
TO BE IN THE STUDY?
THIS GUY SOUNDED OKAY.
THESE PATIENTS CAN DETERIORATE EN ROUTE.
46-YEAR-OLD MAN SHOT IN THE RIGHT CHEST WITH A BB GUN.
HEMODYNAMICALLY STABLE.
A BB GUN?
THE PUNK WHO SHOT ME NEEDS TO BE PUT UNDER THE JAIL
TEN YEARS OLD, OR NO TEN YEARS OLD.
LET ME UP OFF OF THIS.
I CAN WALK.
DOESN'T LOOK LIKE HE NEEDS A THORACOTOMY.
NOPE. HE JUST NEEDS A TETANUS SHOT AND A BAND-AID.
YOU CAN FOLLOW ME, SIR.
YOU WANT TO TURN RIGHT AROUND
OR CAN WE HANG FOR A LITTLE BIT?
NAH, TAKE TEN MINUTES.
HEY, CAROL, WHAT'S GOING ON?
UM, JUST DOING A QUICK BLOOD DRAW.
UH, SO, HOW'S THE CLINIC GOING TODAY?
OH, I JUST LOVE PRENATAL DAYS.
TAKES ME BACK TO MY O.B. ROOTS.
WHY DON'T YOU LET ONE OF THE NURSES DO THAT?
'CAUSE I WAS TRYING TO BE DISCREET.
THEN LET ME DO IT.
IT'S KIND OF HARD TO STICK YOURSELF.
THANKS.
WHAT KIND OF LABS YOU NEED?
JUST A, UH, A C.B.C.
CHECK IF I'M ANEMIC.
OH. I ONLY ASK BECAUSE IF YOU'D LIKE
I CAN RUN THE RESULTS THROUGH THE CLINIC.
BE MORE PRIVATE.
THAT'S A GREAT IDEA.
UM...
LISTEN, WHAT I'D REALLY LIKE IS TO CHECK MY HORMONE LEVELS.
OH, OKAY.
INFERTILITY WORK-UP?
I DON'T WANT TO DISCUSS IT IN DETAIL. NO OFFENSE.
I WASN'T TRYING TO GET IN YOUR BUSINESS.
IT WOULD BE REALLY GREAT IF YOU COULD RUN IT THROUGH THE CLINIC.
OKAY. THANKS.
( sighing )
MARK, I'M GLAD I CAUGHT YOU.
I'VE HAD TO MOVE THINGS AROUND ON MY SURGICAL SCHEDULE.
THE INTERVIEW WITH DR. LEE HAS BEEN PUSHED TO 1:30.
IS THAT GOING TO BE A PROBLEM?
NO, IT'S FINE.
HAVE YOU LOOKED AT HER C.V.?
YEAH, IT'S PRETTY IMPRESSIVE.
IF SHE'S HALF AS IMPRESSIVE IN THE ROOM
SHE JUST MIGHT BE OUR NEXT CHIEF.
AND NOT A MOMENT TOO SOON.
DR. GREENE, I DIDN'T THINK YOU WERE GOING TO BE AROUND
TILL THIS AFTERNOON.
I WAS ON A PARAMEDIC RIDE-ALONG.
WE BROUGHT IN A PATIENT.
YOU, UH, FINISH YOUR STUDENT EVALUATION YET?
I THOUGHT I HAD TILL THE END OF MY SHIFT.
UH, NO BIG DEAL.
THIS AFTERNOON'S FINE.
I MEAN, I WROTE ONE.
I WROTE AN EVALUATION FOR LUCY
BUT I TORE IT UP 'CAUSE I WANT
TO BE FAIR.
YOU'RE PUTTING SOMETHING ON PAPER
THAT'LL IMPACT THE REST OF HER LIFE.
JUST EVALUATE HER WORK.
JERRY, WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
I'M TALKING ABOUT YOUR PORN STAR NAME.
YOU TAKE YOUR PET'S NAME
AND YOU PUT IT TOGETHER WITH YOUR MOTHER'S MAIDEN NAME.
TRY IT. LIKE, MINE IS REX VOYTEK.
OH, I KNOW THAT GAME.
BUT IT'S YOUR DRAG NAME, NOT YOUR PORN NAME.
DRAG NAME? YEAH, IT'S THE NAME
OF YOUR PET AND THE STREET YOU WERE BORN ON.
I DON'T THINK SO, DUDE.
RU PAUL HAD IT ON HER SHOW.
LEAVE SOME CRUMBS FOR THE REST OF US.
WHO ARE YOU, THE COOKIE POLICE?
YOU'RE WELCOME TO HAVE SOME
BUT I BROUGHT THOSE IN FOR THE DOCS AND THE NURSES.
SO, THEN YOU'RE THE COOKIE FAIRY?
Oligario: OH, NOW, WAIT A MINUTE.
IT'S BAD ENOUGH YOU RAID THE ICEBOX
ALL THE TIME. NOW YOU WANT TO CALL NAMES.
CONNIE, YOU BEGRUDGE US A FEW BOTTLES OF JUICE?
NOT LIKE YOU GUYS EVER BRING ANYTHING IN.
YOU SHOULD THANK ME FOR EVERY COOKIE I KEEP
FROM GOING DOWN YOUR FAT SNACK HOLE.
YOU JUST KEEP TALKING, MORALES.
HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON?
THAT ONE'S GOT A PROBLEM.
YOU ANTAGONIZING MY COLLEAGUES?
HE CALLED YOSH A FAIRY.
I CALLED HIM THE COOKIE FAIRY.
IT WAS A DUMB JOKE.
A REAL DUMB JOKE.
READY TO HEAD BACK?
Greene: YEAH, LET'S GO.
I GOT NO PROBLEM HIM BEING A BONE-SMOKER.
I WAS JUST JOKING WITH HIM LIKE I WOULD WITH ANYBODY.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
WRITE THE DISCHARGE ORDERS ON GARDNER AND WOOTTON
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.
BED CONTROL LIKES TO HAVE THEM BY 12:00 NOON.
YES, DOCTOR, I AM AWARE OF THAT.
HEY, DON'T GO THERE.
I TOLD YOU I WAS GOING TO HAVE A HARD TIME
SEEING YOU AS MY INTERN, RIGHT?
IT'S COMPLICATED FOR A LOT OF REASONS, ISN'T IT?
DR. CORDAY, MR. FRYBUSH'S CREATINE IS MUCH HIGHER.
THANK YOU, KASS.
SHOULD WE CALL A RENAL CONSULT?
YEAH, THIS GUY NEEDS DIALYSIS.
SO, DID YOU EVER GET THAT SHOWER?
UH, NO. CAN YOU TELL?
WELL, GO AHEAD.
I'LL COVER SICU.
PETER, I DON'T WANT SPECIAL TREATMENT.
YOU TURNING DOWN A SHOWER?
LOOK, I'VE GOT A LOT OF WORK TO DO.
OKAY, HAVE IT YOUR WAY.
I'VE GOT TO GO FIND WEAVER.
SHE'S JUST ITCHING TO CUT SOMEBODY
WITH THAT SAW.
GOING OUT TO THE ROACH COACH ON MY BREAK.
YOU WANT SOMETHING?
YES. A TRIPLE ESPRESSO.
THANK YOU, KIT.
ELIZABETH, HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO SCRUB IN
ON A BILATERAL ADRENALECTOMY?
OH. I APPRECIATE THE OFFER, BUT I'M POST-CALL.
I'VE GOT TO FINISH MY WORK, AND QUITE FRANKLY
I HAVE TO CATCH UP ON AN HOUR'S SLEEP.
A CASE LIKE THIS COMES ALONG ONCE IN A BLUE MOON.
I'M UP TO MY NECK IN E.R. ADMINISTRATIVE GARBAGE
BUT I'M NOT PASSING THIS UP.
WELL, IT'S BEEN A WHILE SINCE MY LAST ADRENALECTOMY.
IT'LL BE FUN.
I'LL DO THE RIGHT, YOU DO THE LEFT.
I CAN GET DR. KENNEDY TO COVER YOUR SERVICE.
JEANIE, THE EVERLY BABY'S SPINAL TAP
CAME BACK NEGATIVE FOR MENINGITIS.
WHAT DO YOU THINK'S GOING ON?
COULD BE A LOT OF THINGS. WE GOT TO TALK TO THE MOM AGAIN.
YEAH. MAYBE I COULD TAKE SKY OUT OF THE ROOM.
SHE DOESN'T REALLY NEED TO HEAR ALL OF THIS.
GOOD IDEA.
HER MOM LEANS ON HER A LOT, DON'T YOU THINK?
PRETTY SMART KID, THOUGH.
YEAH.
OKAY. HEY.
WHAT DID YOU FIND OUT?
WELL, THE SPINAL TAP WAS NEGATIVE
SO I HAVE TO ASK YOU SOME MORE QUESTIONS.
MAYBE JEANIE AND SKY COULD TAKE A WALK.
I DON'T WANT TO BE WORRIED ABOUT HER WANDERING ALL OVER.
I'D RATHER STAY HERE WITH MOM.
OKAY. CAN SHE HELP ME PUT SOME TOYS AWAY
WHILE YOU AND DR. ROSS TALK?
YOU MIND HELPING ME?
I DON'T MIND.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK, MOM.
SEE WHAT TOYS WE CAN FIND, HUH?
OKAY, WE NEED TO SEE IF WE CAN FIGURE OUT
WHAT THE CAUSE OF SUN'S DETERIORATION IS.
NOW, HAS HE HAD POLIO VACCINE?
OH, GOD, POLIO!
BUT HE WAS VACCINATED.
IS THAT 100% EFFECTIVE?
DO YOU HAVE A DOLL AT HOME, SKY?
NO.
I HAD ONE.
THOSE ARE FOR BABIES.
I'M A BIG GIRL.
Ross: I TALKED TO A PEDIATRIC NEUROLOGIST.
HE WANTS TO RUN A TENSILON TEST
TO RULE OUT INFANT MYASTHENIA GRAVIS.
THERE IS A RISK INVOLVED.
IT CAN CAUSE AN ARRHYTHMIA
WHICH IS AN IRREGULAR HEARTBEAT.
AFTER THE ADRENAL VEIN
WE'LL WORK OUR WAY AROUND THE MEDIAL
AND INFERIOR EDGES OF THE GLAND.
CUT, PLEASE.
AND ANOTHER TIE.
ELIZABETH, CUT.
ELIZABETH?
SORRY. YES.
YOU REALLY DO NEED A REST.
WHY DON'T YOU STEP OUT?
NO. I'M FINE.
GO TAKE A NAP.
I'M SORRY I DRAGGED YOU ALONG.
DR. GOODMAN?
HEY, DR. WEAVER, CAN I RUN SOMETHING BY YOU?
YEAH, MAKE IT QUICK.
20-YEAR-OLD MAN WITH APHASIA AND RIGHT ARM WEAKNESS.
C.T. SCAN WAS NORMAL.
SPINAL FLUID IS CLEAR.
I'M THINKING VASCULITIS OR M.S.?
INTERESTING. SEND OFF A SED RATE
AND A COMPLEMENT LEVEL ON THE C.S.F.
ALSO, LOOK AT THE DIFFERENTIAL.
THERE MAY BE SOME ZEBRAS YOU HAVEN'T CONSIDERED.
OKAY. HEY, YOSH, IS THAT LUCY'S PALMTOP?
I LOVE THIS LITTLE THING.
SHE LET ME BORROW IT.
CAN I USE IT?
WHEN YOU'RE DONE.
I'M DONE.
HERE YOU GO.
YOU KNOW HOW TO WORK IT?
YEAH, LUCY SHOWED ME ONCE.
( beeps )
Knight: I'd hoped to avoid this
but things haven't improved
and I don't know how I'm supposed to learn
in this kind of hostile environment.
Our relationship has turned completely adversarial
and it's not good for the patients.
OUCH.
Dr. Carter, we need to talk.
Dr. Carter, we need to talk.
BY THE TIME WE LEAVE THE HOUSE
THIS CRAZY BASTARD LETS DR. GREENE
LOOK INSIDE THE HOLE IN HIS HEAD WITH A PENLIGHT.
UNBELIEVABLE.
I THOUGHT I'D SEEN IT ALL.
SO, THE DOC WRITES HIM OUT A SCRIP FOR ANTIBIOTICS.
THE GUY THANKS US FOR COMING.
YEAH. I'VE GOT A WAY WITH RANTING LUNATICS.
I AIN'T KIDDING, MAN, YOU DO.
HEY, WHAT'S UP, GUYS? WHAT'S UP?
WE'RE ALL HERE.
YOU'RE NOT ON TODAY.
TRUTH IS, THEY'RE HERE
BECAUSE WE GOT YOU A LITTLE SOMETHING.
YOU LIKE IT?
THAT'S GREAT.
YOU'RE ONE OF THE GANG NOW.
YEAH, ALMOST.
ALMOST?
WELL, THERE'S SOMETHING EVERY PARAMEDIC GOES THROUGH
AND WE THINK IT'S ONLY APPROPRIATE
THAT YOU DO, TOO.
HOW MANY PATIENTS HAVE YOU BROUGHT IN
STRAPPED TO A BACKBOARD WITH A C-SPINE COLLAR?
THOUSANDS?
UH, WHAT DO YOU HAVE IN MIND, GUYS?
COME OVER TO THE POOL TABLE, AND WE'LL SHOW YOU.
SEE, AS A PART OF OUR TRAINING
WE ALL GET ON THE BOARD OURSELVES
YOU KNOW, TO SEE HOW IT FEELS.
SO, YOU WANT ME TO LIE DOWN ON THE BOARD.
HEY, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
WE ALL DID IT.
YEAH, IT COMES WITH THE COAT.
OH, AND YOU GOT TO DROP YOUR PANTS.
NO, HE DOESN'T!
FORGET ABOUT THAT PART, GUYS.
HOLD STILL.
YOU KNOW, I DO HAVE TO, UH, GET BACK TO THE HOSPITAL.
THEN DON'T FIGHT.
ALL YOU GOT TO DO IS LIE DOWN.
RELAX, GUYS. BACK OFF, MAN.
LET HIM DO IT ON HIS OWN.
YOU WANT ME TO LIE DOWN ON THE TABLE?
YES.
THERE YOU GO.
YOU OKAY?
PERFECT. FINE.
GET HIM!
( all yelling )
HEY, DON'T FIGHT.
CUT IT OUT, GUYS.
GET THE SHOWER!
Greene: STOP IT!
STOP IT!
COME ON, TAKE IT EASY, DOC.
HEY, GUYS, GUYS, GUYS, COME ON.
LET HIM UP.
OH! LET HIM UP.
WE WEREN'T GOING TO HURT YOU.
MUCH.
IT'S ALL OVER FOR NOW.
IF YOU WAS A PORN STAR?
THAT GAME IS TIRED, MAN.
I GOT THE BEST EVER: "SATAN MONROE."
YOUR MOTHER'S MAIDEN NAME IS SATAN?
CAROL, I NEED YOU.
WHAT'S WRONG?
23-YEAR-OLD WOMAN COMPLAINS
OF SEVERE RIGHT LOWER QUADRANT PAIN.
PREGNANCY TEST IS POSITIVE.
A POSSIBLE ECTOPIC.
WHAT'S HER NAME?
MARIA JONES. FIVE PREGNANCIES
TWO LIVE BIRTHS, TWO ABORTIONS.
Hathaway: HI, MARIA.
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF YOU, OKAY?
IT HURTS. IT HURTS.
ALL RIGHT.
( groaning ): OH! OH...
LET'S GET A C.B.C, BETA H.C.G., CHEM 20.
OH...
TYPE AND CROSS TWO UNITS
AND START A LINE OF SALINE.
OW!
DID YOU DO A PELVIC?
COULDN'T DO A GOOD ONE.
SHE'S IN TOO MUCH PAIN.
SHE SAID I'M PREGNANT.
IS MY BABY OKAY?
OKAY.
OH! OH...
LET'S DO AN ULTRASOUND WHILE WE'RE AT IT.
OH...
( sobbing ): IT JUST HURTS SO BAD.
OKAY, YOU'RE GOING TO BE FINE.
YOU'RE GOING TO BE FINE.
SORRY I'M LATE.
WE WERE JUST ABOUT TO START WITHOUT YOU.
DR. LEE, MARK GREENE.
I'M SORRY IF I HELD THINGS UP.
I'LL TRY NOT TO TAKE IT PERSONALLY.
YOU'VE BEEN VERY FLEXIBLE
WITH YOUR TIME TODAY AND WE APPRECIATE IT.
I'M HAPPY TO BE HERE.
LET'S GET RIGHT TO IT.
THREE YEARS AS ASSOCIATE CHIEF.
EXCELLENCE IN CLINICAL TEACHING AWARD
TWO YEARS IN A ROW.
HOW DO YOU THINK YOU CAN IMPROVE OUR DEPARTMENT?
WELL, RIGHT AWAY YOU COULD BENEFIT
FROM AN EIGHT-BED OBSERVATION UNIT FOR 23-HOUR STAYS.
PAID FOR HOW? WE'RE A CASH-POOR COUNTY HOSPITAL.
THAT'S EXACTLY WHY YOU NEED IT.
Anspaugh: TELL US MORE.
WELL, I SET UP A UNIT LIKE THAT IN ATLANTA
AND IT SAVED THE HOSPITAL $2 MILLION A YEAR
IN UNNECESSARY ADMISSIONS.
Anspaugh: WHAT KIND OF PATIENTS ARE WE TALKING ABOUT?
LUCY, TAKE THIS.
WHAT IS IT?
YOUR EVALUATION.
IT'S BLANK.
YOU FILL IT OUT SINCE YOU THINK I'M SO ADVERSARIAL
AND KEEP BETTER TRACK OF THIS
BEFORE SOMEONE WALKS AWAY WITH IT.
DID YOU LISTEN TO MY PRIVATE NOTES?
YOU'RE SO SURE I WAS GOING TO GIVE YOU A BAD EVALUATION
YOU'RE ALREADY PLANNING A COUNTERMOVE.
WHAT'S WITH THAT "HOSTILE WORKPLACE"?
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW IT WAS TIME FOR MY EVALUATION.
OH, PLEASE. WHY'D YOU WANT TO HAVE LUNCH TODAY?
TO GET THINGS OUT IN THE OPEN.
WELL, THEY'RE OUT IN THE OPEN.
NOW, WHY DON'T YOU FILL THAT OUT
AND LET'S SEE HOW FAIR-MINDED AND OBJECTIVE YOU CAN BE.
HOW LONG WILL MY BROTHER AND MOM BE UPSTAIRS?
NOT MUCH LONGER.
SO WHAT WAS THE NAME OF THE DOLL YOU USED TO HAVE?
BABY.
WAS BABY A BOY OR A GIRL?
SHE WASN'T A BOY OR A GIRL
BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T HAVE A PENIS OR A VAGINA.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
LETTING HIM LICK THE SPOON.
DO YOU EVER LET YOUR LITTLE BROTHER LICK THE SPOON?
SOMETIMES, WITH THINGS THAT HE LIKES.
LIKE WHAT? YOGURT?
SUN DOESN'T LIKE YOGURT.
WHAT DOES HE LIKE?
LOTS OF THINGS.
DOES HE LIKE HONEY?
YOUR LITTLE BROTHER
LICKS HONEY OFF OF YOUR SPOON SOMETIMES?
HE LIKES IT.
OKAY. HEY, SKY
LET'S GO FIND YOUR MOM AND DR. ROSS, OKAY?
OKAY.
I LIKE THE IDEA OF THE OBSERVATION UNIT.
GOOD.
A VERY GOOD PRESENTATION.
THANK YOU.
I'D BE HAPPY TO GIVE YOU A WALKING TOUR OF THE E.R.
NO, THANKS. I DON'T NEED TO BE HAND-HELD
BUT I DO WANT TO WALK AROUND AND GET THE LAY OF THE PLACE.
I'LL CATCH UP WITH YOU BEFORE YOU LEAVE.
IT'S A PLEASURE. MM-HMM.
MARK, DO YOU LIKE HER?
SHE'S GOOD.
YOU DIDN'T SAY MUCH.
I DIDN'T THINK YOU WERE VERY IMPRESSED.
I'D LIKE TO CONTINUE THIS MEETING
IN A LESS FORMAL SETTING.
I'M GOING TO SEE IF DR. LEE IS AVAILABLE FOR DINNER.
WOULD YOU BE ABLE TO...?
I CAN'T TONIGHT. I'M, I'M SORRY.
EXCUSE ME, DR. ANSPAUGH.
( sighs )
ARE YOU FEELING BETTER?
A LITTLE BIT.
GOING TO THE BATHROOM HELPED, HUH?
MAYBE IT WAS JUST GAS PAINS.
WELL, YOU HAVEN'T HAD ANY BLEEDING, WHICH IS GOOD.
MMM, FURTHER ALONG THAN WE THOUGHT.
LOOKS LIKE 15 WEEKS.
I WASN'T EVEN TOTALLY SURE I WAS PREGNANT.
LOOK.
CAN-CAN YOU TELL?
IS IT A BOY OR A GIRL?
I CAN'T SAY FOR SURE.
IT LOOKS LIKE A GIRL.
AFTER HAVING TWO BOYS, THAT'D BE PRETTY NICE, HUH?
MM-HMM.
WELL, I DON'T SEE A PENIS
BUT YOU CAN'T ALWAYS TELL ON AN ULTRASOUND.
YOU'LL HAVE TO COME BACK TO THE CLINIC FOR A FOLLOW-UP.
MAKE SURE SHE STAYS HEALTHY.
MM-HMM. I'LL DO THAT.
COME ON, CORDAY.
( sighs wearily )
PULL YOURSELF TOGETHER.
JUST A FEW MORE HOURS TO GO.
OKAY.
HEY, ELIZABETH. CAN YOU DO ME A FAVOR?
CAN YOU WATCH THE SERVICE?
I'VE GOT TO HAVE A SIT-DOWN WITH DR. KOTLOWITZ.
REALLY?
YEAH. I RAN INTO HIM.
I, UH... ACTUALLY, I, UH, WENT LOOKING FOR HIM.
PETER, THAT'S TERRIFIC.
YES, GO, GO.
I CAN COVER SERVICE.
THANKS.
DR. CORDAY, I NEED ORDERS ON A NEW ADMISSION.
I'M NOT IN THE MOOD FOR ANY JOKES.
NO. MR. RAMOS IS BACK.
RAMOS?
FEM-POP BYPASS?
I DISCHARGED HIM YESTERDAY.
HE'S BACK WITH A WOUND INFECTION
AND A PRETTY BAD ASTHMA ATTACK.
YOU KNOW THE BOUNCE-BACK RULES.
YEP, I KNOW. HE'S MINE.
HE'S ON CONTINUOUS ALBUTEROL.
HELLO, MR. RAMOS.
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT YOUR LEGS, SHALL WE?
I WAS HOPING YOU WOULD BE HERE TODAY.
WELL, WHERE ELSE WOULD I POSSIBLY GO?
I ASKED THE MOTHER IF SHE'D GIVEN THE BABY ANY FOOD.
I GUESS I WAS TALKING TO THE WRONG PERSON.
THE BABY'S THE LUCKY ONE; WE CAN TREAT BOTULISM.
BUT WHAT DO WE DO TO HELP SKY?
SHE'S GOING TO BE FINE.
HER MOM'S DRAINING ALL THE CHILDHOOD OUT OF HER.
AS MUCH NEGLECT AND ABUSE AS I SEE, SKY'S OKAY.
YEAH, A LITTLE GIRL NEEDS TO BE A LITTLE GIRL, THOUGH.
YEAH, THAT'S TRUE.
HEY, GUYS.
OKAY, NOW, UM...
YOU CAN'T GIVE SUN HONEY
'CAUSE HIS STOMACH CAN'T DIGEST IT, ALL RIGHT?
SO, YOU HAVE TO PAY ATTENTION
TO THAT 'CAUSE HE'S A BABY.
YOU CAN GIVE HIM BOTULISM IF YOU DO IT, OKAY?
HE'S MAXED OUT WITH A PRESSURE OF 65.
SYSTEMIC RESISTANCE IS 3,500.
LET'S START LEVOPHED.
DR. CORDAY, I NEED YOU OVER HERE.
MR. RAMOS IS PRETTY TIGHT.
OKAY.
OW! OOH!
YOU OKAY?
YEP, YEP. I'M FINE.
HOW MUCH ALBUTEROL?
20 AN HOUR.
HE'S HAD SOLUMEDROL?
125 IN THE E.R.
OKAY. I'LL PUSH SOME MAGNESIUM.
MAGNESIUM?
YEP. IT RELAXES THE SMOOTH MUSCLES OF THE BRONCHIOLES.
SECOND LINE AGENT.
DR. CORDAY, CAN YOU LOOK AT MR. FRYBUSH?
GIVE ME FIVE MINUTES, OKAY?
HEY, CARTER, EXPLAIN THIS EVALUATION TO ME.
IF THINGS WERE GOING THIS BAD, YOU SHOULD HAVE COME TO ME.
DO YOU HAVE SOMETHING PERSONAL AGAINST THIS GIRL?
( chuckling ): WHERE WAS THAT...?
I WANT TO SEE YOU AND LUCY
AND WE'RE GOING TO FIGURE THIS OUT.
FIND HER AND THEN FIND ME.
CAN I HANG ON TO THAT?
NO.
Ross: SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE IN A GOOD MOOD.
CAN YOU DO ME A FAVOR?
I NEED A PLACE TO CRASH TONIGHT.
MY BUILDING'S BEING FUMIGATED.
DO YOU THINK CAROL WOULD MIND?
ARE YOU KIDDING? COME ON OVER.
SAVE ME A FEW BUCKS.
SURE THING. GLAD TO HAVE YOU.
THANKS.
HE'S SET UP FOR ANOTHER FOUR HOURS OF CONTINUOUS.
OKAY.
MAGNESIUM'S ON BOARD.
HOW ARE YOU FEELING, MR. RAMOS?
DIZZY.
WHOA, WHOA. WHAT'S HAPPENING?
MAYBE HE'S HYPOXIC.
HOW MUCH MAG DID YOU GIVE HIM?
TWO GRAMS SLOW I.V. PUSH, 40cc's.
40cc's OF 50% MAG SULFATE?
NOT 50%-- FIVE PERCENT.
NO. DR. CORDAY, YOU GAVE HIM 50%.
OH, MY GOD.
OH, MY GOD, YOU'RE RIGHT.
I'VE GIVEN HIM A LETHAL DOSE.
HE'S NOT BREATHING.
NUMBER EIGHT E.T. TUBE!
HE'S BRADYING DOWN-- HEART RATE'S 30.
TWO GRAMS OF CALCIUM GLUCONATE.
PUSH AN AMP OF ATROPINE.
BAG HIM. PREP FOR AN I.J.
I'LL FLOAT A PACEMAKER.
LOST THE PULSE. WE'RE IN P.E.A.
I'LL START CHEST COMPRESSIONS.
7-1/2 GLOVES AND AN EIGHT FRENCH CORDIS INTRODUCER.
( panting )
THE COCHLEAR IMPLANT IS NOTHING SHORT OF A MIRACLE
AND THE TECHNOLOGY KEEPS IMPROVING.
YEAH. I'M IMPRESSED BY WHAT I'VE READ.
NO, DON'T READ. TALK TO PEOPLE WHO HAVE IT.
TALK TO PARENTS OF THE CHILDREN.
I CAN GET YOU IN TOUCH WITH A NUMBER OF PEOPLE
WHO'VE FACED EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE FACING.
GREAT. I MEAN, I'VE ALREADY HEARD AN EARFUL
FROM THE OPPONENTS, SO...
THE FANATICS.
YEAH, WELL, THEY'VE GOT THEIR AGENDAS.
THE LEVEL OF PASSION WITH WHICH THESE PEOPLE
WILL ATTACK YOU, IT'S, UH, IT'S BIZARRE.
SOMEBODY ACTUALLY USED THE WORD "GENOCIDAL."
SAID I WAS TRYING TO ERADICATE DEAF CULTURE.
WOW. DEAFNESS IS NOT SOME ALTERNATIVE LIFESTYLE
AND THE PEOPLE WHO CLAIM IT IS, I MEAN, THEY'RE BEYOND REASONING WITH.
LOOK, THE THING I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IS
WHY MAKE AN ARGUMENT AGAINST HEARING AND SPEAKING?
HONESTLY, YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK?
I THINK IT COMES DOWN TO LAZINESS.
I THINK A DEAF PERSON CAN FUNCTION IN THE HEARING WORLD
BUT SOME PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO DO THE EXERCISES
AND ALL THE DRILLS THAT IT TAKES.
IT'S YEARS OF HARD WORK.
YEAH, BUT THEY HAVE THE ENERGY TO ATTACK ME AND OTHER DOCTORS.
SO I SAY, THE HELL WITH THEM.
YOU DO NOT, DO NOT STAND IN MY WAY
WHEN I'M TRYING TO HELP A PERSON TO FUNCTION.
HMM. WOW.
WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME HOW YOU REALLY FEEL?
( chuckling )
ANYWAY, ANYWAY, ANYWAY
YOU BRING IN YOUR SON
AND WE'LL SEE IF HE'S A CANDIDATE.
SO, UH...
( clears throat )
YOU WORK CLOSELY WITH DR. CORDAY?
ACTUALLY, SHE'S MY INTERN.
AH. SHE TOLD ME ABOUT
THE FALLOUT SHE HAD WITH ROCKET ROMANO.
OH, YEAH.
DO YOU KNOW IF SHE'S SEEING ANYBODY?
I'M JUST WONDERING.
ACTUALLY, UH, I'M PRETTY SURE SHE'S INVOLVED WITH SOMEBODY.
OH, WELL, I'M NOT SURPRISED.
OH, WELL.
THANKS.
ALL RIGHT. YOU BET. ANYTIME.
GIVE ME A CALL.
UH, CHECK, PLEASE.
SYSTOLIC, 60 PALP.
COME ON, COME ON, COME ON.
WE'VE GOT CAPTURE.
TURNING THE RATE DOWN TO 80.
DID YOU PAGE DR. BENTON?
DONE. PULSE IS STRONGER.
GOOD.
PUPILS ARE FIXED AND DILATED.
COULD BE THE ATROPINE.
THAT OR HE STROKED OUT. WHAT HAPPENED?
I INADVERTENTLY GAVE HIM ENOUGH MAGNESIUM
TO CAUSE A CARDIAC ARREST-- 20 GRAMS.
OH, NO.
I LOOKED AT THE LABEL.
I THOUGHT IT SAID FIVE PERCENT, BUT IT WAS 50%.
BUT I LOOKED AT THE LABEL.
HEY, I GOT YOUR BLOOD WORK BACK.
OH, THANKS, LYNETTE.
PROGESTERONE LEVEL'S NORMAL.
THAT'S GOOD NEWS, RIGHT?
MEANS YOU OVULATED.
YEAH, EXCEPT I'VE BEEN TRYING
TO GET PREGNANT AND I HAVEN'T.
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN AT IT?
COUPLE MONTHS.
COME ON. GIVE YOURSELF AT LEAST SIX MONTHS
BEFORE YOU START WORRYING ABOUT IT.
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT. I'M CRAZY.
MAYBE YOU GUYS NEED TO INCREASE YOUR SEXUAL ACTIVITY.
HOW OFTEN DO YOU, YOU KNOW, DO THE "DO"?
WHAT?
OOH, SORRY. AM I BEING INDISCREET?
YEAH.
CAROL, WHAT'S THE DEAL?
I WENT IN TO SEE YOUR RULE-OUT ECTOPIC.
SHE'S DRESSED AND READY TO LEAVE.
MARIA JONES? YEAH.
SHE PULLED HER I.V.?
HEY, MARIA, WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
I'M FEELING BETTER, NURSE. I'M GOING HOME.
YOU CAME IN HERE IN SO MUCH PAIN
I COULDN'T EVEN EXAMINE YOU.
BUT I'M BETTER NOW.
WAIT. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE EVERYTHING IS OKAY
WITH YOU AND THE BABY.
JUST LET THE DOCTOR LOOK YOU OVER.
WHAT'S THE HURRY?
LOOK, I JUST WANTED TO KNOW
IF IT WAS A BOY OR A GIRL.
AIN'T NOTHING WRONG, SO WHY WORRY ABOUT IT?
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT!
YOU WERE FAKING THOSE ABDOMINAL PAINS?
GIRL, ARE YOU CRAZY?
BUT YOU SAID YOU WEREN'T EVEN SURE YOU WERE PREGNANT.
WHY WOULD YOU LIE AND CAUSE ALL THAT DRAMA
JUST TO FIND OUT IF IT'S A BOY OR...
OH, NO. ARE YOU GOING TO ABORT THIS BABY?
CAROL! WHAT? LET GO OF ME!
SHE'S HAD TWO BOYS AND TWO ABORTIONS.
ARE YOU GOING TO GET RID OF IT
BECAUSE YOU THINK IT'S A GIRL?
IT'S MY BABY AND I'LL DO WHAT I WANT WITH IT.
THAT ULTRASOUND IS INCONCLUSIVE!
IT COULD BE A BOY!
LADY, TAKE YOUR HANDS OFF ME
UNLESS YOU REALLY WANT TO FIGHT ME.
STEP AWAY. CAROL, LET HER GO.
GIRLS AIN'T NOTHIN' BUT TROUBLE ANYHOW.
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?!
WITH 20 GRAMS OF MAGNESIUM?
I MAKE NO EXCUSES. IT WAS A GRIEVOUS ERROR.
WHERE WERE YOU DURING THIS MISADVENTURE, DR. BENTON?
I WAS OUT OF THE HOSPITAL ON A PERSONAL MATTER.
IT WOULDN'T HAVE MATTERED
EVEN IF HE HAD BEEN IN THE HOSPITAL.
YOU LEFT YOUR INTERN UNSUPERVISED
AND NOW THIS PATIENT MAY HAVE SUFFERED HYPOXIC BRAIN INJURY.
I STOPPED BY THE UNIT.
MR. RAMOS' EYES ARE OPEN AND HE'S RESPONDING TO COMMANDS.
YOU ARE NOT TO LEAVE THE HOSPITAL WHILE ON DUTY
AND YOU ARE NOT TO LEAVE YOUR INTERN UNSUPERVISED.
I KNOW IT'S HARD FOR US ALL TO VIEW ELIZABETH AS AN INTERN
BUT AS A CONSEQUENCE
WE'VE OPENED UP THIS HOSPITAL TO ENORMOUS LIABILITY.
I'LL SPEAK TO RISK MANAGEMENT AND THE HOSPITAL ATTORNEYS.
THEY'LL DETERMINE
WHAT INFORMATION TO RELEASE TO THE FAMILIES.
DON'T EITHER OF YOU DISCUSS THIS WITH ANYONE.
COULD WE GET TOGETHER TONIGHT
AND NOT TALK ABOUT THIS?
I HAVE TO PICK UP MY SON FROM, UH, MY SISTER'S HOUSE.
RIGHT.
YOU JUST NEED TO GET A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP.
HMM...
I DIDN'T FILL OUT THIS EVALUATION, DR. GREENE.
WHO DID? SHE DID.
WHY DID SHE?
BECAUSE HE TOLD ME TO.
I TOLD YOU TO GIVE IT TO ME, NOT TO HIM.
NO, YOU DIDN'T.
OKAY, WAIT.
DON'T TALK TO EACH OTHER. TALK TO ME.
MARK, I JUST WANTED TO KNOW HOW SHE THOUGHT SHE WAS DOING...
BEFORE I MADE MY FINAL ASSESSMENT.
I TRIED TO PUT MYSELF IN HIS SHOES AND BE CRITICAL.
HE HANDED ME THIS FORM AND SAID, "FILL IT OUT"
AND I ASSUMED THAT MEANT TURN IT IN.
HOW COULD SHE ASSUME THAT?
THAT MAKES NO SENSE.
THAT'S PART OF HIS PROBLEM-- HE GIVES INCOMPLETE DIRECTIONS.
OH, I GIVE INCOMPLETE DIRECTIONS.
NAME A TIME. JUST ONE?
TELL HER TO NAME A TIME WHEN I MEDICALLY GAVE...
DEFENSIVE.
OKAY. TALK TO EACH OTHER.
DON'T TALK TO ME.
WHATEVER THIS IS, I CAN'T FIX IT.
WORK IT OUT, BOTH OF YOU.
Anspaugh: KERRY, I NEED TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT THE VARIANT X RAY INTERPRETATION REPORT.
PLEASE DON'T BLOW ME OFF THIS TIME.
SORRY, DON. THERE'S A TRAUMA COMING IN
POSSIBLE CANDIDATE FOR THE THORACOTOMY STUDY.
I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT WAS UP AND RUNNING.
STAB WOUND TO THE LEFT CHEST.
HAD A PULSE IN THE FIELD INITIALLY.
GAVE HIM EPI, 1,500cc's OF SALINE
AND SHOCKED HIM TWICE FOR V-TACH.
PERFECT CANDIDATE. LILY, GOT THE STOPWATCH?
RIGHT HERE.
DO YOU MIND IF I TAG ALONG?
NOW. START THE TIMER. HERE WE GO.
ON MY COUNT-- ONE, TWO, THREE.
HANG TWO UNITS OF O-NEG ON THE RAPID INFUSER.
GET TYPE SPECIFIC AS SOON AS YOU CAN.
TEN BLADE. LET'S GO.
GOOD BREATH SOUNDS BILATERALLY.
7-1/2 GLOVES.
OKAY. SKIN INCISION IS COMPLETE.
MARK THAT TIME.
SAW, PLEASE.
( loud buzzing )
STERNAL RETRACTOR.
GOOD JOB.
I NEED A PURPLE TOP.
PULSE OX 85.
MARK THE TIME.
SUCTION, PLEASE.
PICKUPS AND METZ.
LOOKS LIKE BLOOD IN THE PERICARDIUM.
FIRST HEMOGLOBIN IS 9.2.
OKAY. PERICARDIUM IS OPEN. MARK THE TIME.
AND I'VE IDENTIFIED A STAB WOUND TO THE LEFT VENTRICLE.
WHAT ARE WE AT?
42 SECONDS.
TAKE OVER INTERNAL COMPRESSIONS.
TAMPONADE THE WOUND. TWO-O SILK.
LOOKS LIKE ONE HORIZONTAL MATTRESS SHOULD DO IT.
TWO UNITS ARE IN.
HANG ANOTHER TWO.
HOW'S THE HEART FEEL, DON?
STARTING TO FILL.
GET THE PADDLES READY.
OKAY. CARDIAC INJURY IS REPAIRED.
MARK THE TIME.
V-FIB.
CHARGING TO 20, AND CLEAR.
SINUS RHYTHM.
CARDIAC ACTIVITY IS RESTORED.
RECORD THE TIME.
I'VE GOT A PULSE.
EXCELLENT JOB, KERRY.
( laughs softly )
DR. GREENE.
DR. LEE.
FINDING YOUR WAY AROUND?
YES. THANKS. I WANTED TO ASK YOU--
I DIDN'T FEEL I WAS CONNECTING WITH YOU DURING MY INTERVIEW.
IS THAT A CORRECT ASSESSMENT?
HOW DO YOU MEAN?
WELL, I'D LOOK OVER AT YOU AND WONDER
"AM I MAKING MY BEST CASE HERE?"
IT WAS A GOOD INTERVIEW.
BECAUSE I LIKE THIS DEPARTMENT
AND I WANT THIS JOB, AND I DON'T MIND SAYING
I'M ONE OF THE BADDEST E.R. BITCHES OUT THERE.
IF I DIDN'T MAKE MY BEST CASE DURING THE INTERVIEW
I'D LIKE TO TRY AGAIN RIGHT NOW.
CAN I GRAB A SODA AND SIT DOWN WITH YOU?
YEAH. SURE.
CALL ME WHEN HE'S IN RECOVERY.
Weaver: THANK YOU.
DON, I... I HAVE SOMETHING TO CONFESS.
OH?
FOR A WHILE, I-I FELT RESENTMENT
WHEN IT BECAME CLEAR I WASN'T YOUR CHOICE
TO RUN THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT FULL TIME.
WELL, IT'S NOT THAT YOU WEREN'T QUALIFIED, KER...
HOLD ON. NOW I AM SO GRATEFUL
TO BE PUTTING ALL OF MYSELF INTO MEDICINE
AND I WANT YOU TO KNOW
THERE ARE NO LINGERING HARD FEELINGS ON MY PART.
WELL, I MUST SAY, I COULD SENSE THE BAD FEELINGS
AND I DID WISH
THERE WAS SOMETHING I COULD DO ABOUT IT
BECAUSE I VALUE YOUR FRIENDSHIP.
HOW'S THE JOB SEARCH GOING?
WE INTERVIEWED A WONDERFUL WOMAN--
AMANDA LEE OUT OF ATLANTA.
I DON'T KNOW HER.
WHY DON'T YOU JOIN US FOR DINNER?
I'D LOVE TO HEAR WHAT YOU THINK OF HER.
DON, I'M TRYING
BUT I'M NOT ALL THE WAY THERE YET.
THANKS.
ISN'T IT A LITTLE WEIRD LIVING WITH ONE OF YOUR BOSSES?
NO. WE GET ALONG OKAY, PLUS IT'S A BARGAIN.
ALL I HAVE TO DO IS A LITTLE YARD WORK, CLEAN OUT THE GUTTERS--
DO THE STUFF THAT SHE CAN'T HANDLE.
UH-HUH.
MMM...
ROXANNE, IF YOU MAKE ME FORGET THIS DAY
I WILL OWE YOU THE BIGGEST FAVOR.
LOUSY DAY, HUH?
MY MED STUDENT IS DRIVING ME CRAZY.
LUCY.
THERE'S SO MUCH THAT I WANT TO TEACH HER...
UH-HUH.
AND IT'S JUST NOT HAPPENING. MM-HMM.
AND I DON'T THINK I'M A BAD TEACHER. NO.
AND I DON'T EVEN THINK SHE'S A BAD STUDENT. NO.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I CAN SAY ONE GOOD THING ABOUT LUCY.
SHE'S NOT HERE.
OH, YOU MAKE A GOOD POINT.
MM-HMM.
I DIDN'T MEAN TO PUT YOU TO WORK.
OH, NO, MARK. DON'T BE SILLY.
THIS IS GOING TO BE NICE.
OH, MAN.
YOU WANT SOME MORE?
NO, NO. IT WAS GOOD, THOUGH.
( crying )
HEY, HEY, HEY. WHO'S MAKING ALL THAT NOISE?
WHAT'S UP, MAN? HUH?
COME ON. LET'S GET READY TO GO, HUH?
COME ON. SAY GOOD-BYE TO AUNT JACKIE.
JACKIE, WHO GAVE HIM THIS PHONE?
OH, IT'S A TOY, PETER.
IT'S A CUTE SHAPE AND HE LIKES IT.
YEAH, WELL, HE PROBABLY SAW YOU ON IT ALL DAY.
HEY, HEY.
I'M SORRY.
YOU KNOW, WE WENT TO A SURGEON TODAY.
I'M JUST TRYING TO DO WHAT'S BEST FOR REESE
AND I FEEL LIKE I'M IN THE MIDDLE OF A BATTLEFIELD.
THE MORE INFORMATION I GET, THE LESS I KNOW WHAT TO DO.
I DON'T REALLY HAVE ANYBODY TO TALK IT OVER WITH.
WELL, WHAT ABOUT CARLA?
YEAH.
SHE... SHE'S LOOKING FOR ME TO TAKE THE LEAD ON THIS THING.
I CAN'T BE GOING BACK AND FORTH WITH IT OVER WITH HER.
YOUR GIRLFRIEND'S A DOCTOR.
WHY CAN'T YOU TALK WITH ELIZABETH ABOUT IT?
HEY... HEY.
PETER?
HEY. COME ON.
PETER.
COME ON. HEY.
