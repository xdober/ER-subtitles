Previously on ER:
Church?
Yeah, my niece is getting baptized.
I have to hold her.
Oh, you're the godfather.
You know, tenure means financial security.
Tenured attendings need to demonstrate
the ability to carry their own weight.
You mean bring in grant money.
We would be interested in covering the construction cost.
The entire thing?
I had a gig.
Screw your gig! Medicine isn't a day job.
The chief resident in a busy urban ER.
We're not giving it to him though, right?
We're considering it.
Are you out of your mind?
( groaning )
( sighing )
Hi.
Mm, hey.
Whatcha doing down there?
I don't know.
Get back up here.
Oh, man, I can't.
I want to, I do, but I gotta jam.
What, you got gigs during the day?
Different gig. I'm a doctor.
( chuckling ): Oh, yeah, right.
No, really.
I am, I work at County,
and I'm looking at a 12-hour shift
that starts in 29 minutes, so...
You want some?
Better than coffee.
Still, I gotta pass.
Oh, 'cause you're a doctor?
( snorts )
Pretty much, yeah.
That's one sucky day job you got.
Hmm...
Ha! That's what I'm talking about, baby.
Yeah? What you know about that?
Shut up and listen to this.
Man, you ready to go to school, baby?
You ready to get an education?
Now show me something. Okay.
( grunting )
Hey, yo...
who you bringing to that party tonight?
What party?
You serious?
Darnell's 30th, man.
Aw, man...
Oh, let me guess: you too busy.
Hey, I wouldn't be out here at 7:00 in the morning
whipping you ass if I wasn't.
You ain't been back in a while, man.
Hey, like you said,
I'm a busy man.
Okay...
Doc Ain't Got Time for My Friends--
I make this shot, you're dragging
your sorry ass to that party tonight.
Yeah, right, like that's gonna happen.
Okay. Come on, show me something.
Come on. It's crunch time.
Don't be a bum out there.
Show me something.
Crunch time, baby.
Game over.
KOVAC: Hey, Sam.
SAM: Yeah?
Out of shaving gel.
Uh, bottom drawer on the right.
Um...
Alex, move it! Carpool's here.
You find it?
Um, still looking.
It's all the way in the back.
What?
The shaving gel.
You almost done in here then?
Yeah, go ahead if you need to.
Oh, nah, I can wait.
( knocking )
She in?
Uh, let me check.
Make sure these QA files get to Anspaugh ASAP,
and I need five copies of this budget, collated.
Oh, and call Surgery again, tell them I'm still waiting
for their M&M data and I'm not happy about it.
Yes, ma'am.
This coffee tastes like crap.
Doesn't anyone change filters around here?
Sorry. New assistant.
Good help, you know?
Hard to find.
So, um, the formal announcement will come out later today,
but I wanted to tell you the news myself.
You've been awarded tenure.
Seriously?
Yup. Congratulations.
Wow.
Wow, that's great.
I just, I wasn't expecting it until next year or so.
Nonsense, you've earned it.
Well, thank you, Kerry. That means a lot to me.
Sure. I still have some other notifications to make today,
so if you could just keep this on a need-to-know basis.
After all, you got the next 30 years
to gloat about it, right?
( music playing )
What, you don't like that station?
It's fine.
You feel okay today?
Yeah. Why?
Well, you were in the bathroom a long time.
No longer than usual.
So was it positive or negative?
Negative.
Were you going to say anything?
I... was worried. I checked. I was wrong.
What is there to say?
What, you'd rather I was pregnant?
I'd rather you didn't keep secrets.
Yeah, that's funny, coming from you.
What's that supposed to mean?
You've seen all of my dirty laundry.
I barely know a thing about you.
That's not true.
You don't talk, Luka.
About what? About anything.
How am I supposed to know
when you're being honest when you don't talk?
About what? I'm not the one
who lied about a pregnancy test.
I didn't lie. Yeah, fine, you omitted.
Like you don't?
What? What? What do I omit?
Your past.
Your family.
I should check traffic.
( sighs )
Uh... Neela.
Cat litter ingestion, uncontrollable drooling.
Drooling? Yep. Either that
or a butt abscess on a 300-pounder, your choice.
Drooler, thank you.
Labs are back on Mr. Busto.
All right, hang 500 of Levaquin.
And Eugene Bradley's here complaining about pain again.
Here without a parent.
Morris, see what this kid's deal is today.
Bet it's the same as last month--
"My pills don't work, Doc."
Or last week, "I lost the bottle."
There's always, "When the pain's this bad, I gotta have my IV."
We can't blame him, really.
His disease has made him narcotic-dependent.
AKA an addict.
No, there's a difference.
And we take complaints here seriously, so go.
Isn't it Abby's turn to treat this turkey?
Abby's at some family thing with Jake.
Looks like it's your turn, big guy.
RAY: TMJ's going out on NSAIDS, five-year-old
gastro tolerated the PO challenge and gram stain's
negative on the knee effusion,
home and ortho follow-up.
Gonna start calling you "The Closer," man, all right.
Hey, kid over there? Sickle cell.
Little bit of pain, here without his mother.
Get his story, call the Heme Clinic,
give them a heads-up.
If it's non-emergent, send him home.
Sure.
Anyone ever tell you you got a cruel streak?
Hey, have you seen Lewis around?
No, she's hiding out.
Uh, but congrats, by the way.
Associate Professor of Emergency Medicine--
nice ring to it.
How did you, um...
Uh, just...
Who's "CoryB123"?
Uh, just someone on my IM buddy list.
Uh, a celebration is in order, yeah?
Yeah, well, it's not exactly official yet...
"JerrBear99..." so keep it quiet
and off the Internet.
Good news needs to be shared.
My mom's at work, but she told me to come.
Well, it's a good pulse,
minimal swelling, it doesn't look that bad.
But unfortunately,
we can't treat you without her consent.
I brought a note from her.
Unless it's an emergency, we need the real deal, man.
Look, it hurts really bad this time.
Real bad, you know?
What are you taking for it?
Morphine, but most of the time the pills are just a waste,
and my mom says I probably need an IV.
Mm-hmm, okay, well, I tell you what I'm going to do.
I'm going to get you a couple of taxi vouchers.
Yeah, you're going to go home,
you're going to take your pills
and you're going to stay off your feet.
Now if you're still in pain when your mom gets home, have her bring you back.
Then I'm just gonna have to wait again.
And you just ask for Dr. Barnett.
Bring you right in, okay?
CARTER: You getting organized on us?
These two shelves, free samples,
those two cabinets have all been alphabetized,
benzos and narcotics here and actually locked up.
If only I could do this with my kitchen.
What's going on?
Nothing.
Has Kerry found you yet?
No, I haven't seen her. Why?
'Cause they're making the tenure announcements today.
And you're not the only one getting it.
What?
When did this happen?
Just now.
No, I mean, when did you apply?
Are you surprised?
No, of course not.
Of course you get tenure. You're great.
I just thought you said you were going to wait a couple years.
Yeah, well, they kind of encouraged me to apply early.
Really?
They didn't encourage me to apply at all.
Well, she's probably been trying to find you all morning.
Well, I've been in here busting my ass.
Yeah, 'cause you're dedicated to reorganizing the drugs.
Or is it because you're avoiding Morris?
Complaining of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea....
right flank pain... Flu. It's the flu.
( groans )
All right, I'll tell him.
Give the patellar fracture
a shot of Toradol.
I can't stand hearing her whine anymore.
Isn't Toradol contraindicated
since she's going to the OR?
Um, if you're busy, I can find Dr. Pratt.
Morris?
Stay here. Don't move.
I'm here for you, okay, buddy?
What up, Chief?
Uh, we need to talk.
Okay, if this is about
the lady who refused a pap smear...
You're the new Chief Resident.
Oh, my God. Oh...
This is fantastic.
Thank you, thank you.
Thank you, thank you, Dr. Lewis.
Wait until my old man hears about this.
He will eat his words! However, it is on a provisional basis.
Slacker, ha! There'll be a three-month probation period,
during which you'll receive additional training. I knew my presentation
on the Circadian... I'll be your supervisor for that.
I could feel the roo... Morris, are you listening?
It is so gratifying to see that, that
meritocracy is alive and well at County.
That hard work is rewarded
and that an individual's ability
is valued over politics, wealth
and the proverbial old boy's club.
( grunts )
Right.
You start today.
Yes. I do.
Yeah.
Hey, Jerry, do I have any messages?
Nope. Are you sure?
Have I ever given you reason to doubt me?
ER.
Kitty litter connoisseur
given Benadryl, drooling stopped.
Suggested she get a dog instead.
Hey, Pratt, some guy on line one.
Says the party's at 8:00 and that ball had too much bounce.
Tell him a bet's a bet.
Excellent as always, Neela.
Pleurocentesis going upstairs,
need you to sign off.
Hey, whatever happened with Eugene?
Sickle cell kid? Sent him home.
Really? Then what's he still doing here?
Morris didn't tell you, huh?
Tell me what?
Eugene's a frequent flyer.
Yeah, the kid knows how to work the system.
Hey, Morris. Hang on, kiddo.
Can I have your attention, please?
Uh, I am very proud to announce that effective immediately,
I am your new Chief Resident.
This is a joke, right?
What? You didn't want it.
Explosion and fire in apartment house.
16 casualties,
seven critical, two minutes out.
Okay, okay, nurses...
restock the trauma rooms, med students
find an intern,
docs at the ready--
everybody move out.
I wonder what Abby's gonna say when she finds out about this.
ABBY: ...Jesus Christ.
ALL: Amen.
Amen.
PRIEST: Do you reject Satan and all his works
and all his empty promises?
I do. I do.
Do you believe in God, the Father almighty,
creator of heaven and Earth?
I do. I do.
You all right?
Do you believe in Jesus Christ...
( clears throat )
Do you believe in Jesus Christ
his only Son, our Lord,
who was born of the Virgin Mary
was crucified, died
and was buried, rose from the dead,
and is now seated at the right hand of the Father?
JAKE & OTHERS: I do.
Do you believe in the Holy Spirit,
the holy Catholic Church,
the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins,
the resurrection of the body,
and the life everlasting?
I do. I do.
( baby crying )
SAM: Out of my way, please.
Nurse, five of morphine, normal saline, liter bolus.
What's open? Did you just call me "Nurse"?
Let's check for an H and H and move him to Trauma Two.
Gross deformity of the right ankle. Hey, Doc!
I'm kind of busy, dude. But I can't walk.
Oh, he's smart. That makes it an emergency.
Uh, Haleh, I need a wheelchair.
Looks like we have a non-ambulatory "sickler" here.
For Eugene?
Says he can't walk.
You're the doctor.
Give me an IV, CBC,
retic, one liter of saline and two of MS, okay?
Thanks, man.
OLBES: Coming through!
( sobbing ) Ray, what are you doing?
We've got multiples rolling in.
What's her story? Marilyn Bracken, 40,
minor burns and multiple lacs to the face
I shouldn't have been there! arms and belly.
Was she altered at the scene?
Yeah, but no evidence of head trauma.
Smoke inhalation?
Pulse ox 100%, can't do any better than that.
Lungs are clear.
( sobbing ): What the hell is wrong with me?
Heart rate's up to 130. It was so dumb!
Pretty tachy, internal hemorrhage?
LEWIS: No blood in Morrison's.
Hang in there, Marilyn. Tension pneumo?
No, good breath sounds.
She's still satting at 100.
Cardiac contusion?
No sign of
any chest trauma, EKG looks normal.
I give up, what do we got?
We don't know.
Multifocal PVCs.
( sobbing ): I didn't mean it... Perfect.
100 of lidocaine, 100% non-rebreather.
BP's down to 80/60.
Not bleeding, lungs are up.
No sign of head trauma.
No cardiac history.
Respiratory rate's up to 40.
No tamponade.
Pressure's dropping.
What are we gonna do?
LEWIS: We don't know.
Ready with the etomidate and sux.
Could this be spinal shock?
No, she's still moving all extremities.
Systolic's down to 65.
Maybe she's allergic to latex. No, no, just...
Okay, let's step back and start over.
Airway.
Breathing. Respiratory rate's
up to 60-- we need to intubate her.
( all talking at once ) Repeat CBC. What else?
Wait, hold the meds. That's venous blood? Yeah.
Chuny, did you hit an artery? No, no way.
LEWIS: No, it's cyanide toxicity.
Retinal arteries and veins are bright red.
Open an antidote kit. She ingested cyanide?
It's released when things like PVC,
polyurethane foam, and polyester wadding burn.
Amyl nitrate pearls. Got 'em.
Usually cyanide toxicity is fatal at the scene.
10cc's of sodium nitrite,
then 50cc's of sodium thiosulfate.
Okay, let's just give it a minute for the meds to kick in.
Do I just keep bagging? BP's 90/60.
She's good.
Cool catch.
( sighs ): Ah... Okay.
Uh, let's keep her 100% non-rebreather.
Send off for an RBC and...
cyanide plasma level.
Uh, excuse me.
Thought you couldn't walk, man.
Had to pee.
What else am I supposed to do?
Well, you could stop playing me, for one thing.
Nah, man, it's different.
I'm serious. I need to be here.
Uh-huh. The IV helped.
That's why my foot feels better.
Give me your arm.
( gasps ) Okay, you got your fix.
Now, go home. Man, it's different.
I'm serious. I need to be here.
I need to take care of patients with real problems,
so go home and take your meds, okay? I can't. I'm all out.
All right.
MS Contin, 20 pills.
Go get your refill from hematology, okay?
It's just gonna be bad, I know it.
I am starting to lose my patience, Eugene.
Just let me stay for one night, please, one night.
No.
Nicely done. Thank you very much.
You have some cuts on your chest, arms, hands, some bruising.
Remarkable, considering your fall.
I jumped.
Oh.
Can you feel me touching your leg here?
You're not pressing hard, right?
HALEH: Pratt, Kovac wants to know if you're almost done.
We're getting slammed out here.
Tell him we'll both be right there.
He's got lateral lower-extremity numbness.
Motor exam's limited by his pain.
H-Hey, what are they saying?
They're just discussing possible diagnoses.
Contusions, lacs and all four limbs move.
You're making this more complicated than it needs to be.
He also had some partial saddle anesthesia.
DTRs are intact. No sensory level deficit.
Motor and sensory loss is usually incomplete
with cauda equina syndrome.
X ray's back. Good. Maybe now I'll get
some respect around here. Anthony, your roommates aren't here, but that
doesn't mean they're not at a different hospital.
When did you see them last?
C-spine's clear.
And, oh, look at that--
bilateral calcaneal fractures.
I made my way to the window,
and I told them, I was, like, "Follow my voice."
Look at this, compression fracture
of L-1. I saw flames.
He broke his back.
Doesn't mean there's cord involvement.
ANTHONY: I felt 'em, you know? I'll call CT.
I didn't want to die, okay?
WOMAN: Need some help here.
KOVAC: Another one from the fire?
Yup. Megan Nesbitt, home alone.
Partial-thickness burns to hands and forearms.
Good radial pulses.
How old are you, Megan?
12.
Pretty young to be home alone.
One percent with that epi.
Let's buffer with bicarb.
How are you feeling, Marilyn?
Where's-where's my purse?
She still altered? Is it here? Is my purse here?
All right, you need to sit back.
We're gonna numb and suture these cuts, okay?
Ow, ow.
Ma'am, you remember what happened to you?
I was in the lobby, I-I was leaving, and...
What time is it?
There was an explosion? 12:45.
On the first floor?
I have to go home.
My husband travels.
I should be there when he gets home.
All right, just calm down, Marilyn.
Ow! Ow!
Your apartment building was very badly damaged during the fire.
( panting ): That's not where I live.
MARILYN: Oh.
It's okay to cry, Megan.
I know it hurts.
First and second-degree, nothing circumferential.
Titrate two to four of MS.
We'll debride after that.
So you were home by yourself, huh?
That must have been pretty scary.
I'm used to it.
Okay, Megan,
you have some bruising on your belly,
so I'm gonna look at it with something called
an ultrasound.
Reached the parents yet?
Jerry's calling them.
They're at the mall with Logan.
No blood in the abdomen,
but we'll still need consent for a CT.
Yeah, Jerry's on it.
Is that a problem?
Nope.
Ready?
Mm-hmm.
Jake, how's my favorite cousin?
Patrick, how are you? Good.
Hey, this is, uh, Abby.
Abby, yes, hello. Hi.
Care for some whiskey?
Uh, no, thank you.
Look, dear, it's Jake and Abby.
Well, she's a tiny little thing, isn't she?
Allow me to present my aunt and uncle, Eileen and...
Call us Aunt Eileen and Uncle Liam.
Okay. ( laughs )
So, are you divorced or never married?
Uncle Liam, we're-we're...
We're gonna go sit down.
We'll catch up later, yeah? All right.
Nice to meet you.
EILEEN: Nice to meet you.
Oh, there's a seat.
Okay. Hi. WOMAN: Hi.
WOMAN #2: Hi.
Did you get the sodas?
Oh, yeah, I put them down when I shaking someone's hand.
I'll-I'll... I'll go get 'em.
I'll go get 'em.
Sit down. I'll go get 'em.
WOMAN: Hi.
ABBY: Hey.
Hi.
Hi.
I'm Grandma Mary.
We're so glad you could come today.
Oh, thank you. Me, too.
We've heard so much about you.
Good things, I hope.
Oh, Jake goes on and on.
( laughs )
Abby this.
Abby that. You were a nurse.
Now you're a doctor.
But he never mentioned any children.
I don't have any.
I had Eamon here when I was 35.
Cousin Grace had her first at 40.
Don't worry, Abby. You've got time.
( laughs )
I met him online.
I'm almost done numbing.
Well, I never actually met him.
Oh, God, I hope he's okay.
So you never...
( laughs ): Oh. I got lost.
Found myself looking at one of those floor maps.
You know, "You are here."
Okay, 30cc syringe and a splash guard to Dr. Lewis.
4-0 nylons and open ten pack.
This is wrong. Dropped her BP.
It's really, really wrong. CARTER: 80 systolic.
Check her lungs.
She had equal breath sounds and no evidence of chest trauma.
Blast wave from an explosion can still collapse a lung.
Okay, let's up the dopamine to 20 mikes.
Dr. Lewis, Dr. Weaver.
LEWIS: Oh, great.
Now she's calling me? Can you
tell me where it's hurting you?
My stomach.
LEWIS: Repeat the hemocue. Why didn't you get me?
She just wants you in her office at 7:00.
Okay. Uh, let's get a repeat chest.
Why so late?
No life.
MARQUEZ: Repeat hemocue 13.4.
Okay, so no blood loss.
MARQUEZ: Temp's 101.
CARTER: She could be septic
from the belly.
She's got some guarding on the right.
No. We need to look for another source.
The blast could've put a piece of glass
right into her intestine.
There's nothing on X ray.
These are all superficial.
Can I get, uh, 3.375 of Zosyn, please?
I've irrigated all the lacs.
Do you want me to probe all 30 of them to prove it?
Yeah.
Okay, this one's superficial.
I'm telling you, there's nothing deeper than the subq.
( groans )
Ow.
What happened?
Something cut me.
Your parents are on their way in.
Did-Did you tell them I almost died?
No.
C-Could you?
Megan, is everything okay with you and your folks?
I guess.
How about your little brother?
Half.
My mom got married again.
Could you at least
tell them I got hurt,
like, really, really bad?
JERRY: Sam...
those guys you wanted me to check on,
uh, the jumper's friends?
Thank you, Jerry.
You are all done.
Why don't you get some rest, and I'll be back soon, okay?
I think we should get Social Services involved
with Megan.
Family here yet?
No, but she is in a weird space.
Well, she just went through a traumatic event.
Might be problems at home.
Is that what she told you?
No, but her parents left her all alone
while they went shopping.
Well, we've done the same with Alex.
I just think that she's...
Sam, the girl was in a fire.
Give the family the chance to deal with that
before pushing a social worker on them.
Two sets of cultures prior to antibiotics,
and start another line of saline,
titrate the dopamine to a MAP of 90.
Free air. Glass shard punctured her colon.
Why didn't it show up on the X ray?
Must have been unleaded glass.
Only heavy metals show up on X ray.
Dr. Carter, your father's returning your call on line two.
Oh. Excuse me.
Oh, by the way, congratulations.
I heard you got early tenure.
Yeah. Thanks.
Dr. Lewis, how's the finger?
Oh, sore. So is my arm.
MARQUEZ: Tetanus hurts. What can I say?
Rapid HIV test on Mrs. Bracken came back negative.
Thank God for that.
I hope this means in the future,
you'll leave any deep probing to the surgeons?
Call the OR. Tell them we're on the way up.
Did Dr. Weaver make the surgical tenure announcements?
Yeah, first thing this morning. Why?
I was just wondering
when she was gonna work her way down here.
Well, I hope the ER fares better than Surgery.
We only got one slot. Oh.
I'm sure it will, though.
Dr. Lewis? Yeah.
Uh, could you order a Social Services consult
on Megan Nesbitt?
Uh, Kovac's patient?
Yeah.
Uh... we just disagree on how to handle it.
Oh, you guys fighting?
Lack of money, sex, communication?
The last one.
Yeah, there's a lot of that going around here today.
Where is he? Who?
Luka.
No. What are you doing?
My job.
Come here.
( sighs )
Sam thinks that Megan Nesbitt
needs a Social Services consult.
You went over my head?
You totally blew me off.
Okay, despite working here 12 hours a day,
this isn't your home.
This is a workplace.
It's an emergency room-- my emergency room.
So, if you're having trouble,
you should see a couples therapist,
and if you can't do that, you should work separate shifts.
Does that make sense?
Yep. Yep.
And as far as a consult goes, uh...
just call them because the parents
will probably get here before they do anyway.
RASGOTRA: I took the clavicle fracture
out of a figure-of-eight
and put him in a sling and swath.
All your fault, by the way.
What? Morris as chief resident.
If you'd taken the job, we wouldn't be living this nightmare.
His first day and already a mutiny.
Personally, I'm ready to keelhaul him.
CARTER: I'll try back.
MRSA abscess. Allergic to sulfa.
Um, clindamycin.
Two words: voice mail.
( exaggerated laugh )
What's all that?
Friends of mine bugging me to go out with them tonight
and party after a long 12-hour shift.
That's the problem with the non-medical types:
they don't get it.
BARNETT: Dodged the admission of Eugene Bradley
in complaining of foot pain...
Par-tay at Ike's tonight-- bossman is buying--
but don't get used to it. Who's on board?
Half the time the medical types don't get it.
Ray?
Other plans.
Neela?
The Apprentice is on.
Pratt?
I'm busy.
Dr. Carter?
Hmm?
Oh, um...
ALL: * Happy Tenure to you
* Happy Tenure to you...
Don't I get a cake?
ALL: * Happy Tenure, Dr. Carter
* Happy Tenure to you.
( cheering and laughter )
Thank you. Thank you very much.
( all cheering and whooping )
Excuse me. They said my wife was in a fire?
It's just down here.
She responded very well to the cyanide antidote.
Both her blood pressure and her pulse normalized.
Good, good.
A piece of glass shrapnel from the blast, however,
may have perforated her bowel.
She's gonna need surgery, maybe a colostomy.
Oh, God...
Which hopefully will be temporary.
I don't understand.
I'm sorry? How this happened.
From what I was told, there was an explosion, followed by...
You... We're just going over here.
...followed by a fire.
We live in Tinley Park.
Wh-Why was she at some apartment in the city?
I don't know.
She told me she had a dance class.
I'll tell you what, why don't you have a seat right here.
I know she's alone a lot.
My... job...
We fight about it.
Yeah...
Listen, let me go see if I can...
Can I talk to her?
Um... you probably wouldn't be able to...
Well, then, can you tell her something?
Yep.
Tell her...
that I'm here.
Okay.
Susan, how long have you been standing there?
Not long.
Sorry I'm early.
I know you wanted to talk to me later.
Oh, sit down.
Guess there's no point in rushing to tell me
I didn't get tenure.
I'm sorry, I've just been incredibly busy.
Mm.
You want to at least tell me why I didn't get it?
There were a number of factors:
significant budget cuts,
your lack of published materials...
The criteria are complicated.
How about I simplify it for you?
I've been an attending for seven years--
that's two more than Carter--
I've been an outstanding doctor,
a dedicated teacher and a committed chief.
No one's refuting your abilities as a clinician or teacher
and, yes, you do an excellent job
running the department...
Which is where you want me to stay
until, of course, you can replace me.
I don't follow.
The ER runs smoothly.
That's one less thing for you to worry about.
That's ridiculous.
Because if I was tenured,
I might work less shifts in favor of doing research,
and you might actually have to give a damn
about the first floor of this hospital.
Did you honestly think your interest
in an academic track would be taken seriously?
What?
That you could wait
until your seventh year as an attending
to start aggressively pursuing grants?
I've brought in some grants.
$75,000!
By now you should've hit at least a million.
The university
depends on grants to cover your salary.
That's not only unacceptable for a physician seeking tenure,
that's embarrassing.
So forget excellence, forget performance...
just write a check to build a new wing.
This hospital is in the business of staying open.
We have to make our choices accordingly.
Mm.
Finger dislocation's at X-ray,
and shrimp allergy needs a recheck after subq epi.
So why tell me?
Well, because if I don't leave now,
my band can't make its Evanston gig.
And that's my problem how, exactly?
Neela, I dispo'd ten patients in the last hour.
You get to pop a finger back in place. Please?
Fine, but you're cleaning the bathroom this week.
All right, deal.
With actual cleaning products.
MARQUEZ: Banker's hours, huh, Ray?
I'm like an ATM, babe. Do business 24/7!
Hey, yo, yo!
Taxi!
Hey! Ah, hey, taxi!
Damn it.
Eugene?
Wh-Wh... What are you doing?
Okay, you need El fare?
Here we go.
Well, it's getting pretty late.
Mom's gonna worry.
She's still at work.
Eugene, you need to go home now.
We are not going to admit you.
They're not going to give you any more drugs.
You need to go home now.
Man, I ain't going back.
I can't.
Why not?
He'd be there.
Who?
Her boyfriend.
Your mom's?
Okay.
So, the two of you don't get along?
He just does stuff.
Stuff like what?
I just need to get some Dilantin.
Where is...
Whoa, did somebody alphabetize these?
Yeah, believe it or not.
Why don't you just say it?
Say what?
You're mad.
I'm not.
Right. Didn't bother you one bit that I went over your head?
See, that's what I'm talking about.
What?
You won't tell me how you feel.
Because it's fine.
It's not fine, Luka. If it were fine,
you wouldn't have avoided touching me
when I squeezed past you just now. What?
You... you bury your feelings.
You pretend that they're not there,
or that you don't have them.
I have feelings, but I don't need
to share them every five seconds.
And I don't need to share them here, okay?
Sorry to interrupt, but Megan says she's in a lot of pain.
Uh, give her another four of morphine.
Fine.
Just try four of Zofran.
How's your cake?
It's good. It's unexpected.
They should've waited.
They could've had a cake for both of us.
Snack cake?
No, thank you.
What's wrong?
I didn't get tenure.
What?
Wait. Susan, who got the slots if you didn't get it?
Slot. Singular. That'd be you.
I am so sorry.
Yeah, they gave me the usual drivel about budget cuts and...
No, no, no, no. They've always had
more than one tenure slot.
Well, till now. Too bad it was the year you applied.
What do you mean by that?
Just... nothing. No, what do you mean by that?
You saying I didn't earn it? That my funding
of the outpatient clinic got me tenure?
No, don't, don't put words in my mouth.
I have worked my ass off here for 11 years, you know.
Yes, yes... I've brought in grants,
I've published, I taught... Yes, I know you have.
I never asked for this.
You never wanted it, Carter.
You never did.
This is my home.
This is where I started.
This is where I want to stay.
And I get the feeling that half the time,
you would rather be anywhere but here.
Yeah, I thought so.
Iron chef in three needs a non-occlusive dressing,
then he can go.
How about you?
You gonna go?
You don't give up, do you?
Car's outside.
Give me trouble, you're riding in the trunk.
All right, give me two minutes.
Don't try sneaking out the back.
Jerry, what's open?
Thought you'd be covering
"Smells Like Teen Spirit" by now.
Anything in exam two?
We got one free bed. What are you doing?
Admitting him.
I can see that.
The question is, why?
Chuny. Yeah?
Can you get Eugene here settled in?
Oh, sure.
You want to come with me?
He was raped.
This will make you feel better.
I know her.
She lives in my building.
Her burns are minor.
She going to be okay, like you.
She used to bring food to the guy next door.
He was weird.
Had all this stuff stacked up.
He's probably dead, isn't he?
Your neighbor?
I don't know.
I was the one who called 911.
Smart girl.
They didn't come as quick as I thought they would.
I thought if I called them before I did it...
I tried to put it out,
but it got too big...
( baby crying )
Honey, are you okay?
Mommy... Mommy...
It's okay. It's okay. ( baby crying )
Shh...!
It's okay.
It's going to be okay. It's going to be okay.
( baby crying )
Now how do you get an Irishman up on the roof, huh?
You tell him the drinks are on the house.
( laughing )
There's a man from Kerry
comes into the bar with a pig under his arm.
The bartender says...
Whoo. Here you go.
Thanks, lady.
Hey.
Hey.
Her name's Abby.
Sorry, Uncle Jake.
All right, get out of here.
Get out of here.
They're cute.
A little loud.
You have to be.
You got to raise your voice in a clan this big.
How am I doing?
Let's see, uh...
with 99 percent of the votes in,
( laughter ) it appears that you are a keeper.
Who's the holdout?
Aunt Cecilia.
I think you lost points
when you told her you weren't sure
if there's a heaven or a hell.
Well, I'm not.
Doesn't bother me...
I'm a pick-and-choose Catholic myself.
Doesn't work that way. Yeah, it does.
"Honor thy father and mother."
"Thou shall not kill." A given.
"No premarital sex." "No birth control."
Not so much.
Hey. ( chuckles )
( laughs )
Pretty overwhelming, huh?
But in a good way.
( laughter )
Do you want to hear something kind of stupid?
I'd love to.
I never imagined there were families...
like this.
You're really lucky.
( laughter ) Yeah.
Having said that...
Yes?
I'm really, really ready to go home.
Okay. Okay.
WOMAN: There you are.
And to think I was gonna leave
'cause there wasn't any real men here. What's up, baby?
Mm... Give me some sugar.
Nice to see you.
'Bout damn time you got your fine self here.
How you doin'? Where you been anyway?
You know, just working out,
all around, I ain't goin' nowhere.
Mmm. Uh, keep moving.
Sorry, ladies, he'll be right back.
Yeah.
( Pratt talks quietly )
( laughs ): Yeah, yeah.
Look who's here.
Oh! Oh!
( laughing )
Holla at your boy. Oh, man.
Happy birthday. Now shut up.
( all talking )
What's up, baby? What's up?
What's up?
What are you talking about?
Where the chicks at?
I see you standing here by yourselves.
Where the chicks at?
Just get Mrs. Grayber started on Compazine.
Yeah. Haleh?
Need an ankle series on Joanna McVay in Three.
Sure thing.
Just let me know how she's doing, okay?
What's Eugene still doing here?
Dr. Barnett admitted him.
Ray, your band's on two.
They're backstage, and you're late.
Tell 'em I'll be right there.
Yes, no, I realize that but... Ray.
No, no... Uh, hold on. Yeah?
Yes?
You dispo patients faster than a speeding bullet,
and not in a good way.
And now that we're slammed,
you dump a known drug- seeker on the next shift
so you can get to your next gig on time.
I tried to warn him.
It's a bit more complicated than that.
You know what? You want to be a rock star,
that's cool, go for it.o
But play weddings and bar mitzvahs
to make ends meet.
Because medicine is not a hobby,
or another way to pay the bills,
or Plan B in case you don't sell a million records.
It's what you want to do, or not.
She didn't mean for the fire to get so big.
She just wanted the firemen to come.
Pretty desperate for her parents' attention.
I think she just felt shut out, you know?
Now she needs to live with even more pain--
three people dead, more wounded.
Social worker said she's going to juvey.
12 years old.
Sad.
Yeah.
Why is it that we can talk about anything other than us?
I don't know.
I think Lewis is right.
I think we need help.
Mm. Good?
No, man. I'm good.
Hey, man, thought you had the job
at the print shop, man. What happened?
Downsized, man.
Gotta get a new job soon.
Teesha says I get in her way being home,
mess up her routine.
I know-- be a doctor.
( all laughing )
Yeah, if Greg's one, how hard can it be?
Right? Right? Right, right, right, right.
Man, what time is it?
Man, I gotta get up in the morning.
Hey, yo, check this out.
Look at that. Yo! Yo, man, what you doin', man?
Put that away, man.
Oh, man, come on, man.
What? That loaded?
Hell, yeah, it's loaded.
Stop playin', man. Don't be wavin' it around.
Let's get back to the party, man.
What you doin'?
This the real party right here.
Remember back in the day
when we shot all those lights out on the bridge?
Yeah, I remember that. That was a long time ago.
( gunshot ) Oh!
What are you doin', man? Chill!
I think this fires a little bit crooked.
I think that's the problem.
Nah, you're drunk, man. That's the problem.
( gunshot ) Oh, come on, man.
I'm 30, man. The last thing I need...
Put that away, man.
Do you want to get arrested? Put that away.
Oh!
Man, chill! That's nice.
Y'all just jealous. No, man, you stupid, man.
Stupid. Come on. Let's haul ass.
Let's haul ass, man.
( talking indistinctly )
How you doing?
Listen, I... ( sighs )
I really wish you'd told me.
Or, uh...
that I'd asked.
You tired?
No.
Okay.
Why don't I stay here
till your mom gets here?
You a musician?
Not tonight, man.
Oh, yeah.
You know what, babe?
Weaver and the tenure board
can kiss my big, white,
semi-hairy ass.
( laughs )
I shouldn't have got my hopes up.
Our hopes up.
It's okay. We're going to be fine.
I just had all the money spent--
buy a house,
start a college fund for Cosmo,
take a damn vacation.
Baby, we'll figure it out.
( sighs )
You know what's funny?
I really wanted this.
I know.
I know you did.
I know.
( sighs )
Hello?
Kem?
Nothing. Nothing's wrong.
Oh, not much.
I got awarded tenure today.
Thank you. Thank you.
No, no, it is. It's very nice.
It's very nice.
We will. We will have to celebrate it sometime.
Really?
( chuckles )
You serious?
How's the clinic?
( laughs )
Oh. Oh, they must've loved that.
I miss you, too. Yeah.
