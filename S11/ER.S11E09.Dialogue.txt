Previously on E.R.:
How's your dad doing?
Okay.
Got a nurse for him 16 hours a day,
and then from 11:00 to 7:00 it's just me.
What happened there, doctor?
That was your patient.
No, it's a trauma.
No medical record number yet, thanks.
Don't say please and thank you to the blood bank,
and don't let the boys bully you.
I wa... I wasn't letting the boys...
You play with your hair when you're nervous.
Want to get some dinner?
Thanks. I have plans already.
Okay.
Not with anyone, if that's
what you're wondering.
Not a problem.
You abandoned that kid.
My shift was over.
He was counting on you.
I had a gig.
Screw your gig! Medicine isn't a day job!
DR. CHEN: Jing-Mei!
Jing-Mei!
( speaks Chinese )
( speaks Chinese )
( glass shatters )
Papa?
Papa?!
( panting )
Come when I call you.
Why do you do this?
( speaks Chinese )
( speaks Chinese )
( speaks Chinese )
Please?
Papa, I can't.
( speaks Chinese )
( speaks Chinese )
Jing-Mei.
Okay.
Okay.
I promise.
So how come your brother's staying with you?
Your parents live in Winnetka.
Ben's in the Peace Corps.
My parents are always bugging him
to get a real job.
That sounds familiar.
If I can just get the sofa bed.
They're checking to see if we have it in stock.
All right. Thanks.
You the youngest?
No, oldest.
Ben and my little sister Tess.
She's a junior partner in my dad's firm.
I wonder who the favorite is.
Hmm. Do you have siblings?
My brother died when I was 11.
I'm sorry.
We have the sofa bed in stock,
but only in moss green, not black.
All right, green's fine.
Can you deliver it today?
On Christmas Eve?
Mm-hmm.
I could probably tie that to the roof of the car.
You think?
( scoffs ): It's why you brought me along,
isn't it? A little brawn?
We'll take it. I'll go pay.
I'll go find some rope.
Meet you at the checkout.
All right, thanks.
Can you say anything? Can you talk?
Okay, you're choking,
so I'm going to do this really hard, okay?
( gasping ): Mom!
( speaking Farsi )
No, no, it's okay.
I was actually helping her.
She was choking on the little piece.... I'm a doc...
I think we should get out of here.
What happened?
I saved that little girl's life.
What's he saying?
Uh, "thanks"?
We did it when I was a kid.
No way. Gifts get opened on Christmas morning.
( chatter )
I did it when I was a kid.
No way. Gifts get opened on Christmas morning.
Tell Dr. Lewis we'll be back
for more as soon as we can.
Where are you taking them?
Harold Washington Library on State Street.
The library?
They keep opening up public buildings
until everybody's in.
If Alex opens a gift tonight...
No, it's cheating if you open a gift the night before.
Then he won't be so desperate to get up,
which means he'll sleep in,
which means we get to sleep in.
Oh, okay.
Plus it's just fun.
Is that a trick so you can open your gift tonight?
( chuckles )
Robert Sanders, 42.
Syncopal episode at home.
Hit his head on a chair on the way down.
Mr. Sanders, I'm Dr. Kovac.
190/100.
110 and 130. Glucose 125.
I can't get a sat.
It's too cold to read.
You guys need some help?
So it seems. Increased work breathing,
crackles bilaterally.
Wife's a few minutes behind us.
Gonna be below ten degrees tonight.
Merry Christmas.
Excuse us, please.
You have to keep this pathway clear.
Medical history? Read it and weep.
Get out of the way now.
Okay. "Systemic lupus erythematosis."
Diagnosed 20 years ago.
"Dialysis-dependent renal failure."
I dialyzed yesterday, two hours.
"Coronary artery disease."
Yeah, come on. Okay, let's go.
"Hypertension, Hepatitis "C."
And a partridge in a pear tree.
Sorry. I'm a handful.
Hey, Morris, stop eating.
We got a hundred people in the waiting area.
Louis already loaded me up.
Pratt, is your CVA out of trauma one?
ICU just called for him.
Sats correlating at 89.
Okay. Crank up the O2.
Abby, I have six charts for you.
I haven't even taken my coat off yet.
Oh, Carter, stay on with DHS.
You have to pound them to pick up the homeless.
Right. Squeaky wheel.
Yeah, it'll calm down soon enough.
If they're not in by midnight, they'll be frozen.
Susan, you guys going to be around tomorrow?
Oh, yeah. Well, I'm on at 3:00, but we'll be hanging till then.
You should bring Henry by.
Oh, I will. I got something for Cosmo and I want
you to see Henry in his Santa suit.
You got a headache?
No, I got a backache.
I was helping a friend move a couch.
Who else is on with me?
Uh, Chen, but she's running a little late.
It's becoming a habit.
Merry Christmas.
Oh, my God.
Did you just re-gift this right in front of me?
Yep. I'm your Secret Santa. Enjoy.
He's an established rheumatology patient,
followed by Dr. Scheer.
Spear, not Scheer.
I'm the wife-- Carol Shoup-Sanders.
It's Jared Spear.
Sorry, that's Spear-- Dr. Spear.
Can you touch your chin to your chest?
I have a complete file
of Robert's medical history right here.
Yeah, and his pulse ox is borderline.
We can order his records.
Believe me, you'll prefer mine, more concise.
Honey, let them work.
Tilt your head all the way back.
You need my help.
You just don't know it yet.
Uh, no, he needs to be admitted.
Let's sit him up.
We're gonna make you more comfortable, Mr. Sanders.
Robert.
Okay, how long was he unconscious?
47 seconds.
What happened before that?
I stood up from the dinner table...
He felt short of breath and dizzy.
Any chest pain?
No. No.
Rheum's not coming in.
Dr. Spear? He was unavailable.
They said the primary complaint sounded cardiac
so we have to give him nitrates and call Cardiology.
We have a great cardiologist, Dr. Knauth. K-N-A-U-T-H.
Shouldn't somebody be writing this down?
Another shelter van's here. Let's go.
I'll take the first 20 people.
62-year-old male.
Lives under a bridge says he's having chest pain.
Get him registered and check a 12 lead pulse ox
and take a chest film.
Diagnosis: hunger, cold aftercare, food, warmth.
Hey, Jake Scanlon, fourth year.
Transferred from Creighton.
Hey, Jake. This guy knows if he says "chest pain"
he'll be here for 16 hours
and he'll get a tray of food.
So let me do you a favor.
Listen up, everyone.
The vans are here to take you all
to the Holiday Inn.
That is right. Thank the Mayor.
There'll be plenty of food, and remember,
it's all good at the Holiday Inn.
Liar.
It's working. Only the sick ones are staying
Don't give him any credit.
Very good. Trick the needy.
What? It's a holiday, and they're going
someplace that's like an inn.
All right, man, get in the van.
You about ready? We got to pick up
Alex in about 20 minutes. Yeah.
Hey, Abby, is that a cardiology on Mr. Sanders?
Yeah. I'm on hold. But you guys go.
I'll present to Carter or Chen.
Thanks, Abby.
Sure?
Well, you've been on
since 7:00 this morning.
Somebody should have Christmas.
Yeah, Alex is pretty excited.
Alex or you?
Go ahead. We're fine. We're fine.
Thanks.
Hi, I'm calling about patient Robert Sanders.
Abby, is Kovac still here?
Admit.
Yeah, cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema.
Luka.
Hey, I have a lupus patient for you
in trauma one. Sanders.
No, no, I can't stay.
I'm just here to pick up meds for my dad.
Look, I know it's a lot to ask,
but can you cover my shift?
It's Christmas Eve.
I know. I'll do New Years.
Ready, Freddy?
I'm sorry. I can't cover for you.
It's a family emergency.
I wouldn't ask otherwise.
Are you serious? For tonight?
Come on.
It's my first
Christmas with Sam and Alex.
I can't help you this time. I'm sorry.
Dr. Chen, this is Margaret.
She'll be temp clerking this evening.
Hi. Nice to meet you.
Not a big fan of the yuletide.
Oh, is Lewis still here?
Headed towards the exit as am I.
Merry Christmas.
Yeah. Merry Christmas.
What does that mean exactly?
What, Merry Christmas?
You could at least examine him before you blow me o...
Okay, BNP, fine.
Happy Holidays to you, too.
Never get sick on Christmas.
Hey, did you call Psych?
Yes. I suggested they bring Kibble.
Okay. And you can go home.
Med students don't have to work holidays.
I volunteered.
That's twisted.
Next year I'm inventing a family
so I don't have to work on Christmas.
( chuckles )
What did Dr. Knauth say?
Cardiology thinks it's a kidney problem.
How's the breathing, Mr. Sanders?
Hanging... in there.
Dr. MacPherson's our kidney guy.
Right, he's on call tonight.
I thought I told you to go home?
BP 195/105, heart rate 115, resps 30, sats 93.
CBC, troponin, chem seven and Cards suggested BNP...
What the hell is that?
B-type natriuretic peptide.
I will double-check the dosage on that.
Can you get me started on the other stuff
and get me a suture kit for the head lac.
You got it.
What'd you say your name was?
Jake.
Jing-Mei, I am sorry about your dad, I really am,
but I've been cutting you breaks for weeks.
I know and I appreciate it.
This'll be the last time.
Oh, man. There is no way I can get anyone
to cover tonight. It's impossible.
Susan, please.
I hate to be hardcore, but I can't.
Can you stay?
I have a baby
and a guy who's been watching him 24/7.
And I just worked a 14-hour shift.
No, I can't.
Maybe Carter can handle it, He's got Abby and Morris.
We are inundated with homeless
from the city roundup.
I know.
We're already understaffed.
Jing-Mei, please, you have to understand.
I do. It's okay.
Good. Thank you.
I'm sorry, Susan.
I quit.
* ...Merry Christmas and a happy new year... * And so the holiday begins.
Happy, happy, joy, joy, everyone. * ...to you and your kin
* Good tidings for Christmas... *
Nine-year-old auto versus ped.
Thrown ten feet to the pavement, transient LOC, hit and run.
Mom? Right here, honey.
Confused and agitated.
What's his name?
Harry.
Hey, Harry, I'm Dr. Carter.
We're going to take good care of you., all right? Hey, Ray.
I'll get Neela. My shift's over.
Neela's backed up. I got a plane to catch.
I'm not asking!
One, two, three.
Large bore IV and 500 of saline wide open.
What happened? Car hit him.
Came out of nowhere.
He's got a weak femoral-- was he thrown?
Diffuse ecchymosis on the chest.
He was outside.
I parked the car and Harry was
getting out when we got hit.
Harry flew up in the air.
Mattie! Systolic's 77.
You guys are okay, though, right?
You're not hurt? We're okay.
Paramedics checked us.
Tenderness and crepitus over the chest wall bilaterally.
What's that mean?
That means he has multiple rib fractures.
Mom, it hurts.
Baby, I'm here. Okay, CBC.
Type and cross for four,
head, chest and belly CT,
trauma panel and a femoral line.
Pulse is up to 138.
Okay, rush the blood bank.
He could be anxious or bleeding out.
Bleeding out?
It's okay, Mattie.
We'll take care of your brother, okay?
Why don't we take Mattie for a little walk? I want to stay here.
Can I stay here? I'll set her up
in the family room.
Come on, Mattie. Let's go, hon.
Dr. MacPherson, this is Lockhart again in the E.R.
I'm calling about Robert Sanders.
I know his wife can be a pain in the ass,
but tonight I think he has a real...
problem, and he, uh, he needs dialysis
and call me back.
Abby, take this thyromegally and be well.
As you can see, I have a par-tay to attend.
Where you going?
Well, not that you would know about it,
but I'm going to the Player's Ball at the Peninsula.
Kanye West is performing,
Twister, the whole Rockefeller...
Hello.
Hey, uh, I'm looking for a doctor.
Well, that would be me.
How can I help you?
I'm looking for Dr. Morris.
Morris. No, see, what you need is...
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, hey, hey!
...somebody who has experience and...
Hi, hi, glad you could make it.
Come on, I'll show you around.
Bye.
Bye.
She's with Morris?
Chen just quit. Where's Carter?
Quit what?
The hospital. Where's Carter?
I think he's in Trauma Two. Quit for good?
Who? Is she all right?
Oh, I don't know. She's burned out, and we're screwed.
I can't believe it.
Chen.
Your, uh, Secret Santa gift.
From you? No. Found it in the doctors' lounge
with your name on it. What's up with Chen?
I don't know, she's not answering.
Rats, Lice and History?
Ooh, that's a good one.
Someone really likes you.
I got a Pez dispenser.
Hey, I'll see y'all later.
Happy Christmas. Bye.
Hey, I got a 39-year-old IDU.
Narcotic withdrawal.
I'm dying. This guy needs detox.
Exam Two. Point one of clonidine.
Hey, what are you doing?
This is a publicly funded hospital,
and this is a, an illegal religious artifact.
Well, it's Christmas.
So?
So...
Put it back.
Sharps back. Pericardiocentesis needle.
Systolic's 82 on one liter.
Carter, Chen just quit.
Harry, you're going to feel a little pressure.
She quit?
RAY: Heart rate's trending up.
Yeah, that's the tamponade limiting contractions.
You got to up the rate to compensate.
What's that mean?
Uh, there's blood around his heart.
Dr. Carter will relieve it.
PVC's. Yeah, I know.
I'm in, but I'm not getting anything.
Lift up his head a little bit.
Chuny, close to trauma and refuse
to board any more homeless.
Good idea-- did you get a whiff of triage?
How can people stink so much
in cold weather? Oil of wintergreen on a mask,
or breathe through your mouth.
You're not staying?
There's blood's in there, but it's either clotted
or it's collecting posteriorly.
I can't get it with a needle.
Page CT Surge.
Oh, I'll get Neela.
If I leave now, I can still make my plane.
You can forget about your plane.
I promised my mother.
Your mother?
Look, somebody's got to stay.
I'll page Surgery.
Ask for an echo-guided
pericardial window.
Hey, Carter, do you have a minute?
Yeah.
Titrate the dopamine to a systolic of 90.
Keep paging CT Surge.
All right, Harry's stable,
and Dr. Barnett is here.
Apparently.
My lupus patient--
pulmonary edema's worse, and his pressure sucks.
Can you take a look? Sure.
So, Chen quit?
What was it, her dad?
Yeah. I'll go home, have dinner with Chuck
and Cosmo, sing a couple of carols, come back.
Chuck's been cooking a turkey all day.
My dad's there... All right, all right, go home.
If we get busy, I'll call you, otherwise, stay home.
Thank you, thank you. You're amazing. Thank you.
Come be amazing over here.
I'll check in later.
Did you, uh, call his primaries?
Rheum says he's too sick for them, call Cardiology.
Cards says it's not his heart, call Renal.
Renal says he's just had dialysis,
it's not their problem.
BP's dropping, 88/59.
Stop that BNP drip and lower his head.
Yeah, I tried that-- he desats.
Hard to breathe. Carol?
She's going to come right back.
Abby, you give nitro paste and BNP drip?
Give two vasodilators, and his pressure'll bottom out.
Well, you try getting three specialists
on the phone on Christmas Eve.
You're his doctor.
Ah, he's got crackles in the apices.
You have Renal coming in to take off the fluid?
No.
What do you mean, no?
He was dialyzed yesterday, so Renal thinks
there's another explanation for the edema.
What do you think it is?
I think he got half his usual dialysis time
because they were jammed
for the holidays, ate a salty dinner
and flooded his lungs. So...?
So I'm waiting to hear
from MacPherson, the Renal attending.
Dr. Agbo from Surgery's here.
Agbo? I've never heard of him.
You know, junior fellow, sweaty palms.
Nobody wants to be here tonight.
Including me.
Okay, why don't you call
Dr. Renal Mac Whatshisname again,
and remember that nobody knows
what your patient needs right now better than you do.
Sats only 88.
Uh, put him on a non-rebreather.
That should help. I'll be right back.
Okay?
These are Robert's medical records.
Listen, um, about today on the phone...
Pain-in-the-ass that I am,
I walked them down from Records myself.
Otherwise, you would've received them tomorrow.
Now, will you look at my file?
Hey.
What are you doing here?
Heard a crazy story about you quitting.
Can I come in?
Uh, you know, thanks, Greg, but I'm fine.
Thanks for coming by.
( man speaking Chinese )
( Chen speaking Chinese )
Hey, you need some help?
Yeah, give me some Ativan, please.
How much?
Two milligrams.
Papa.
What happened at work today?
Sometimes he's cooperative and lucid.
Sometimes he's like this.
Sundowning.
Sundowning?
It's too nice a word for it.
( Chen speaking Chinese )
Give me my pants, please.
PRATT: You know you got
a lot of Ativan here.
Potassium, too.
Jing-mei, what are you doing?
Talk to me! What's going on?
MOTHER: What's he doing?
He's going to try and relieve
the blood accumulating around the heart.
Is that the pericardium? Yep.
Ten blade and pickups to me.
Watch over my boy.
Let's give them a little more room to work.
McAlpin catheter and a 60cc syringe, quickly.
Whoa, a hundred ccs right there.
Keep him safe, Lord, I beg you.
Another 60cc syringe, quickly.
Hey, man.
Uh, Dr. Agbo?
Maybe I nicked a vessel.
CARTER: All right, give me some sterile eights.
BARNETT: PVCs...
Bigeminy.
Pull the catheter back.
AGBO: I can get it.
It's my fault. I'm sorry, I didn't mean it.
( shrieking ): Shut up, Mattie!
Hey!
Mrs. Price,
take your daughter outside right now.
No, no, I want to stay with my son.
I said pull that catheter back.
AGBO: The blood will just reaccumulate...
Get out of the way, get out of the way.
V-tach! Crash cart.
CARTER: Catheter is out.
Charged to 100. Clear. Just wait, just wait.
Normal sinus.
All right, 3-O on a needle driver.
That's good, right?
That's good?
Dr. Carter...
Neela, can you take this little girl
to the family room, page Social Services
and then stay with her
until they get here. No.
( sobbing )
( sniffles )
Feeling better?
A little.
Don't lie, Robert. He's not better. Look at him.
BP's stabilized.
119/85. Pulse down to 115.
He's had lupus cerebritis?
Two years ago.
It calmed down after a steroid burst.
Okay, I'd like to get a head scan
to make sure the cerebritis isn't back
and that there's no internal bleeding
from the fall-- I have a discharge,
and then I'll take you. I can take him.
Do you know where it is?
Mm-hmm. Can his wife come with us?
Sure. Thanks.
Put him on a portable monitor and O2
and call me if you have questions.
Okay?
Mm-hmm. Okay.
RASGOTRA: Would you like to color?
You excited about Santa coming tonight?
Why not?
Santa's not coming for me.
Mattie, that's not true.
Hey.
I thought you had a plane to catch.
Hey, Mattie, how you doing?
You know, when I was a kid,
I used to fight with my brother all the time.
Did he get hurt?
Yeah, he got hurt. I got hurt.
Kids get hurt sometimes
by accident.
I was mad at him for not playing with me,
so I threw his book out, and he went to get it and got hit.
Mattie, it's not your fault that Harry got hurt.
It is. I tried to help him, but I couldn't.
I had to go get my mom.
Your mom wasn't there?
She was at work.
You and Harry were alone in the car?
We live in the car.
Don't tell my mom.
I'm not supposed to say that.
My father's a doctor.
He knows what he's asking.
( sighs ): Without the G-tube and IV, he would've died weeks ago.
Oh, so now life-saving technology is bad?
If someone doesn't want it.
How do you know he doesn't want it?
He's not even in his right mind.
After he sleeps, he's lucid.
Each time, every day, he begs me to help him.
Removing the support's not enough.
I-It would take him days to die of dehydration,
and he'd be in misery.
Put him in a nursing home.
What, so he could be somebody else's problem,
someone who doesn't know him or love him?
He won't even know that he's there.
( sighs )
You're not Chinese.
Oh, so it's Chinese
to euthanize your elders?
It's Chinese to respect them.
There you go.
You should go.
I don't want you here.
You've been through a hell of a lot this last year.
You need a break.
Put him in a home for a month so you can catch your breath.
I can't.
We fight to save lives every day.
You know, we literally bust our asses
to give people a few more hours of living.
You're a doctor.
You can't just cross that line like it's nothing.
Quality of life is the only measure that matters.
My proud father is lying in his own feces,
he can't eat without vomiting, can't sleep.
He knows what he's asking for
and he knows he can get that from me.
If you weren't a physician, you couldn't do this.
But I am, and I can.
Why haven't you done it up till now?
If he's been asking so much?
Because you know deep down inside,
it would haunt you for the rest of your life.
Why haven't you done it yet?
Maybe I don't have the courage.
It's over. Christ is born.
It's only midnight?
Feels like 4:00 in the morning.
Margaret, if you turn off these lights one more time,
I'm going to beat you to death with a fruitcake.
This is totally Loser's Christmas.
Give that back you little minx...
Okay, Rudolfo, can you blow
like you're blowing out candles on a birthday cake?
Too many cold.
Does it hurt to breathe in?
MARGARET: Lockhart, your lupus patient's coding in the scanner.
All right. Uh, Neela, chest film and O2.
Got it.
Hey.
Hey. It was cool what you did with that little girl,
telling her about your brother.
Yeah, I think it helped...
although I don't actually have any siblings.
Why does that not surprise me?
So Social Work's got Mattie.
Carter says I can go.
Can I sign out Harry to you?
I thought you already missed your flight.
I'll go standby.
Don't want to disappoint Mom on Christmas.
CAROL: Do something!
CT TECH: BP's 83 over 50. Cycle the dynamap.
What happened?
Central line got caught
when we moved him and it pulled out.
Bleeding won't stop.
Not with lupus-associated coagulopathy.
Heart rate's dropping.
ABBY: Okay. 8-O and a Mac two. Now.
Ma'am, please step back and let us help your husband.
Put pressure right here.
Don't check it, don't let go.
Sats 68.
Yeah, he's hypoxic, I get it, thanks.
Oh, God. Please don't let it be tonight.
I'm sorry.
Tube. ( alarms )
Pulse 64.
I'm not ready for him to die.
I'm in.
Sats coming up.
Run, don't walk, to the blood bank,
get four units of oh-neg,
have them start working on type specific.
I'll meet you in the trauma room.
He's stable?
He needs blood and fluids.
We're gonna have to start another central line.
Can we get an attending to do it?
I put in lines all the time.
He's been put through enough.
I want a surgical attending.
He's moving in the right direction.
He's gonna spend the night in here tonight
until an ICU bed opens up.
You were at work when this happened?
We've been living in the car
since I left my husband three weeks ago.
It wasn't bad when the kids were
in school, but since Christmas vacation started...
You left them in the car?
I got to work.
It's okay, Mama.
Can their dad help?
He's a violent guy.
I could take it, but he was starting
in on Harry, so, I...
CARTER: Yeah, we're a little
concerned about the amount of strain
that you've been under.
I didn't want Mattie saying how it was
'cause I don't want anyone taking my kids.
We're not homeless people.
I got a job.
This is just temporary.
I can help you find a place
to stay until you get on your feet.
We tried the shelter.
It isn't safe for the kids.
No, this isn't a shelter.
It's a house for families fleeing domestic violence.
It's safe.
( crying ): Thank you.
I'm sorry that I yelled at you, honey.
Don't be scared of me, okay?
I'm sorry, Ma.
No, you didn't do anything wrong.
( crying ): Come here.
( crying )
So, what do you think?
I think the bad guy's the hit and run driver,
not the mother,
and this lady needs a break.
Cafeteria's serving up a holiday feast.
Better get up there. Hey, Morris...
Ooh. ( Raphaella giggling )
Burgers probably would have been safer.
Oh.
Speaking of which, though,
I'm a little hungry.
You want to get something to eat?
Just lost my appetite.
Dr. Carter,
phone call from Africa. Kim somebody.
Catch you later.
Hello.
Hi.
Um, I'm not doing anything.
I'm just working.
No, it's too cold to snow here. Maybe tomorrow.
( Mr. Chen groaning )
( sighs )
Shh.
It's okay.
Huh?
Huh?
It's okay.
( speaking Chinese )
No, no, it's okay. No.
Calm down. No, don't worry.
I'm not gonna hurt you.
( speaking Chinese )
No, no, no, no.
Four of Ativan?
I add five of Haldol when he's like this.
( grunts )
( speaking Chinese, weeping ) Okay, calm down.
( speaking excitedly in Chinese )
What is he saying?
To let him go.
( crying )
( speaking Chinese )
Shh, shh.
( speaking Chinese )
I'm sorry.
( Mr. Chen crying )
JING-MEI: I'm sorry, Papa.
( both crying )
MORRIS: Okay. Now, squeeze. Hmm.
Hold on. RAPHAELLA: Uh. No wait.
MORRIS: Hold on. Both hands, both hands.
MORRIS: Let go of my hand.
( Raphaella giggling )
MORRIS: Let go... ( both laugh )
And squeeze the trigger.
( giggling ): My hands are shaking.
MORRIS: Hey!
RASGOTRA: Hi.
Hi.
Um, Neela, Raphaella Greenberg.
Are you a medical student?
Um, I-I'm his girlfriend.
HIPPA?
Patient privacy?
Stapling is nothing.
This guy's totally out of it.
This is so wrong.
( sighs )
I'll staple, you watch.
Hmm.
MALIK: Security! Security!
Somebody get Security!
MARGARET: Give me a reason.
Give me a reason, you, give...
Whoa, whoa, stop it, stop it. Whose patient is this?
RAGGOTRA: Mine. Hi, Mr. Beidermeier.
BEIDERMEIER: I need help.
All right, get Security to cuff him to a bed, huh?
And get him on a monitor until we can figure out what he took.
Okay. Should have let him OD.
Come on, up, up.
That's the Christmas spirit. Yeah.
Back to bed, Mr. Beidermeier.
At least have him arrested.
What's your name again?
Margaret.
Margaret, we're good here.
( breathing heavily )
Crap!
LOCKHART: Got a flash.
Guidewire.
Didn't you come in
because the wife wants you to do this?
Not her call.
I like to make a small nick with an 11 blade.
She's afraid Abby might kill her husband.
I don't think she will.
( sighs )
Okay. Catheter.
Tachy at 110, B.P. 94/79,
sats 86.
Yeah, and that's
as good as he's gonna get until he's dialyzed.
His lungs are swimming in fluid.
DUBENKO: Nice.
Threading easily. Good.
Thank you for coming in.
It's my job.
Yeah. Well, you want to admit him to your service?
All his other docs are blowing me off.
Ah, Santa Claus is coming to town.
Okay, removing the introducer, 10cc syringe.
You know, legally and morally, they have to come when you call,
or they can lose staff privileges.
Oh, really. I don't think
they've heard the news about all my power.
Oh, they're aware, they're aware, all right.
They like to take advantage of submissive interns.
I'm not submissive.
Nice return. I know.
DUBENKO: Like many interns, and,
well, many females, you incline yourself
toward popularity and equate it with success.
Well, when an ER doc is popular,
someone's losing out,
and it's usually the patient.
All this guy has is you.
Infusing well.
Needle driver.
All right, well, good job.
Really good job, Abby.
I'll-I'll finish up.
Yeah, go.
Go out there and do what you have to do.
And by the by, did you, um, get the book?
Rats, Lice and History?
You're my Secret Santa?
Yeah, I'm quite excited to discuss it with you.
The chapter on the influence of louse and vermin epidemics
on political and military history
and the relative unimportance
of generals is outrageous.
Uh, 4-oh silk.
Submissive.
Not a word I would use to describe you.
Okay.
Time to get unpopular.
Look, uh, I take full responsibility
for what happened with Sanders.
You didn't do it, the Tech did.
And I should not have sent a student to CT.
I want you to send me, okay?
It won't happen again.
So, what'd you learn from all this?
Always go home when you tell me.
Hi, is this the dialysis tech?
Yeah, I know it's 2:00 a.m.
I'm sorry to wake you.
MR. CHEN: Jing-Mei...
( speaking Chinese )
Mm.
( continues speaking Chinese )
Hmm?
( soft groaning )
What did he say?
He thanked me.
Said I was a good daughter.
You are.
You want me to do it?
( sighs )
( soft moaning )
( breathes in deeply )
( exhales )
( groans )
( soft groaning )
( inhales, groans )
( shallow breathing )
Ba ba, wo ai ne.
( quiet crying )
Lab called on Vivadee Sanito.
The coags were QNS.
Okay. And, uh, Betty Muldoon was admitted to Medicine.
Can I get a cab voucher? Huh?
I don't think we're quite ready to discharge you, Mr. Claus.
Dialysis for patient Sanders.
You want me to...?
No, no, I got it. Thank you.
Hi. Thanks for coming in.
Double overtime on holidays.
But I just did Robert Sanders yesterday.
Yeah, he's, um, he's fluid overloaded.
MacPherson call in orders?
Well, I spoke to him on the phone.
What did he want?
Usual... the standard... run.
2K bath, 35 bicarb, pull off a couple liters.
Two or four hours?
Uh, I'm not sure about that.
I'll give him a call.
Well, actually, you know, Dr. MacPherson
very specifically said he did not want to be disturbed, so...
He wouldn't come in?
( sighs )
He wouldn't come in.
( chuckles )
What a ..., but I need orders.
(sighs): Okay.
Okay, well, do you think you could get started,
and then call him?
Sure.
Thank you. All right.
Thank you. You're welcome.
MacPherson ordered dialysis?
Uh...
No... I did.
You? You can't order...
Thank you.
Merry Christmas.
Hmm.
MARQUEZ: Tetanus up to date.
I was putting a sled together,
and I sliced myself on the metal runners.
Well, it doesn't look too bad to me, Mr. Rotolo.
Santa's got to get home, Doc, know what I mean?
Me and Mrs. Claus have things to take care of
before the kids wake up.
Won't take long.
You feel that? Yeah.
Feel that? Yeah.
Excuse me, Dr. Carter,
uh, when you have a minute?
Sure. Um, irrigate, open up a suture kit.
I'll be right back.
I have something for you.
Um, but I haven't wrapped it, and it's at home...
Liar. But my birthday's in two weeks.
"Mildred"?
Ooh, sorry. Mildred didn't show.
I was giving out a bunch of these.
Just a little something.
So, how was your phone call?
It was good. She's good.
Oh, yeah, very handy.
For, uh, hooking up the VCR.
Right, yeah.
Oh...
Yeah. You look like an old-fashioned doctor.
Well... I am an old- fashioned doctor.
Okay.
Okay. Okay. Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.
Ho, Ho, Ho. Merry Christmas.
RAPHAELLA: We got sliders. Yes.
You will never be more loved than you are at this moment.
Oh, I could eat about three dozen of these.
Hi. Hi.
So is this the little homeless boy?
Should we treat as inpatient?
Is he hypoxic?
No.
Tolerating POs?
Yeah.
Then he only needs PO antibiotics.
And a warm bed.
I'll call the Pedes team.
Hi, Rudolfo.
Hello, doctoras.
Hi.
You got a chimney?
I'm sorry, honey, what?
How's Santa Claus going to find me
if you don't got a chimney?
LOCKHART: You don't need a chimney.
Santa sees everything-- he'll find you.
But you'll have to go to sleep before he comes, all right?
LOCKHART: Good night.
Thank you.
Do you think Dad has a present for his son?
Doubt Dad's got enough for their breakfast in the morning.
I guess Santa Claus better come up with something.
Jumbo mart? Do you have any cash on you?
No. No.
Jing-Mei?
It's been over an hour.
You okay?
I'll call the mortuary in the morning.
What are you going to do after that?
( sighs heavily )
Well, I have to go to China
and bury my father next to my mom.
Deal with his estate.
Bum around,
maybe visit the village where they were born.
Meet some relatives.
I don't know.
I'm pretty tired.
Well, you know,
if there's anything I could do.
I mean it-- anything.
Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you for...
( crying ) It's okay. Come here.
Come here.
( crying )
Where are we going?
Ho, Ho, Ho, and a jolly old soul.
Sikhs don't have Christmas.
I grew up in England
with Old King Wenceslas, Boxing Day,
and a family tradition of anonymous kindness.
Where'd you get that key?
Wendall from Social Work.
( whispers ): I have a plan.
A sly and cunning plan?
Give these toys and books to the homeless kids in the ER.
Oh...
Stealing from the bad-off to give to the worse-off.
And we buy new stuff tomorrow in the after-Christmas sales.
A belated gift for the Child Life Department.
Do we have ribbons or-or paper?
We can steal bows
from the decorations in the cafeteria.
WOMAN: * O holy night
* The stars are brightly shining *
* It is the night
* Of our dear Savior's birth
* Long lay the world
* In sin and error pining
* Till He appeared
* And the soul felt its worth
* A thrill of hope
* The weary world rejoices
* For yonder breaks
* A new and glorious morn
* Fall on your knees
* O hear
* Hear the angels singing
* O night divine
* O night
* O holy night
* O night divine.
What's up? Hey, I thought you'd be in Miami by now.
O'Hare's a mess. No seats until tomorrow.
Miami? I thought your mother was in Philadelphia.
Hey, it's snowing. Come on.
Hey, if it's snowing, that means it's warming up.
You knew he was in Miami?
He's got a girlfriend that lives there.
I worked his shift because he gave me
some sob story about his mother.
Barnett, you back already?
I can't stay away. ( grunts )
Ah... I love it.
Does snow get polluted?
MacPHERSON: Where's Lockhart?
Dr. MacPherson.
I didn't authorize dialysis
for Sanders and you started it without my approval.
I want to speak to your attending.
Uh...
your patient was drowning.
He needed emergent dialysis.
You're an attending, on call,
I covered your ass.
You can't just deceive attendings
when you don't agree with them.
Well, if you report me for working the system,
I'll report you for abandoning your patient.
Go, Abby.
See you inside.
Ouch! Miami?
CARTER: Come on, let's get back to work.
This is Jing-Mei Chen.
I woke up this morning
and found my father had passed away in the night.
Yes, he's been very ill.
Well, actually his physician is here.
He can sign the death certificate.
Mm-hmm.
Thank you.
It's 2753 West Cedar Drive.
