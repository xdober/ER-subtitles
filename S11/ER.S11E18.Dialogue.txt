Previously on ER:
I was thinking
that maybe we shouldn't be quite so together here.
Uh, I thought everybody already knows.
I didn't tell anybody.
Dad's taking me to Florida.
You can take whatever you want, I don't care.
He's not going anywhere with you.
We'll catch the whales in the Fall, kiddo.
I'm going the other direction.
What?
( sobbing )
I know what you want me to say and...
and I can't say it, okay?
But things with Wendall didn't work out.
Oh. I'm sorry.
Yeah, it's weird.
She's actually not really even speaking to me.
( chuckles )
Oh, my God!
What? What?
You have to get up! Get up! Get up!
What, what, what?
7:32. Yeah?
Rounds are at 8:00.
I hit the snooze.
No, you shut the alarm off.
Sorry.
What are you doing?
I thought you were going to go home
and change into some other clothes.
No, it's okay.
No, it's going to look weird. No, it won't.
Yes, you're back in the ER now.
People will think that...
What are they going to think?
That I don't do my laundry?
That I sleep in the park?
PRATT: Donde esta Abby?
What? Abby needs to take a few pass-ons.
Ella esta tarde-- "she's late."
Brushing up on your Spanish, huh?
Helps me relate to the community better.
Oh, yeah? What's her name?
Okay, one left.
Asthma going to the ICU. Needs an art line.
I got it.
Meaning that...?
I'll take care of it.
So you'll teach the residents how to do it?
Absolutely.
That's the board.
Alex has soccer after school.
I thought maybe you could drop him off.
Isn't the carpool picking him up?
Yeah, but you know,
he needs to work on his corner kick.
He's still pretty mad at me.
Well, think of it as an ice-breaker.
Maybe we should give it a little more time, huh?
I'll see you tonight.
All right. Have a good nap.
Morris!
Sorry!
I came in to work on our manuscript revisions.
Yeah, we'll see if I have the time.
They're due by 5:00 P.M.
Today?
Yeah. We don't want to miss the deadline.
You two are publishing?
"Oligoanalgesia in Long Bone Fractures:
A Retrospective Review."
Accepted in the Annals next month
if we can make a few changes.
Some substantial changes.
Why don't you go to the Doctor's Lounge and get started?
I'll be right in.
Consider it done.
( quietly ): You're working with Morris?
Yeah, you know, he's thorough,
good with statistics...
And the only resident desperate enough to write it up?
You got it.
Doctor Lewis, I was wondering how you'd feel
about letting me run a trauma today.
Do you think you're ready for that?
Well, in a couple of months I'll be an R-2
supervising the interns.
I thought it might be good to get some practice.
ZADRO: Hypothermia and syncope.
All yours.
Elena Tobajas, 39,
passed out at the Immigration Building.
Tachy at 120. She's cold.
Some kind of a protest.
You need to call Benjamin Coe. He's my lawyer.
What?
Don't do anything until he's here.
CBC, chem panel, EKG, a liter of warm saline,
O2 at two liters and get a rectal temp.
What are you doing?
We're going to give you some warm I.V. fluid.
Don't do that.
It will help. No.
What?
I'm on a hunger strike.
They want to deport my son.
Elena, you're cold
and dehydrated.
Maybe now the INS will give us a new hearing.
Do you know the risks of refusing our care?
Do you know that you could go into a coma and die?
I don't want to lose my son.
Okay, cancel all the orders.
No fluid bolus?
No labs, no EKG?
You heard her. Nothing.
JAKE: No one is going to remember what I was wearing yesterday.
People notice.
Watch out.
( laughs )
Are you all right?
Yep.
Morning, Jake.
Hey, Liza.
How's the ER?
Good. This is Abby, my girlfriend.
Liza's the night clerk on surgery.
Hi. Hi.
We're kind of late.
Oh, me, too.
Hey, stop by sometime.
Did you say, "girlfriend?"
What?
Nothing. Takes me right back to junior high.
( chuckles )
What do you want me to call you?
How about introducing me as "Abby?"
You don't want people to know we're going out?
We're late.
Look, this is important.
Well, let's just talk about it later?
Yeah. Yeah, I guess it can wait.
You look ridiculous.
What was I supposed to do?
They only had small and extra large.
What's up, homie?
Buenos tardes.
Sorry about being late.
Nice scrubs.
You know, you two
should coordinate your outfits every day.
Yeah, it's cute.
Maybe we can find you matching stethoscopes.
Victim of assault for Abby,
and low blood sugar for your boy toy.
Okay, all right, all right.
It's rough when everyone knows you're an item.
That could work. What?
"This is Abby. She's my item."
96.1.
Do you want a warm blanket?
Please. I'm thirsty.
Some orange juice?
Only water.
Elena?
Amigo.
I'm Benjamin Coe, from Legal Aid.
I'm Dr. Lewis.
How's she doing?
Malnourished and dehydrated. Heading for a coma.
Maybe we'll see some movement now.
This should finally get the INS to grant us a new hearing.
Her son's an illegal alien?
"Undocumented immigrant."
They can just send the kids back
without their parents?
Elena has her green card. She came here in '89.
Her brother brought Santiago up through Mexico seven years ago.
How'd the INS get involved?
Santiago got into trouble--
attempted robbery.
They locked him up for two years in Juvie.
Once he did his time,
they transferred him to Immigration.
He won't last in El Salvador.
The police there round up gang members.
Sometimes they get beaten to death,
sometimes they just disappear.
If he goes home, they'll kill him.
I brought her durable power.
What's that?
It says that she's competent to start a hunger strike
and refused nutrition even if she's unconscious.
We can't even give her an I.V.?
That would be felony assault.
If you try to treat her, I'll call the police.
CARTER: We need a kitchen.
Well, the staff break room
can accommodate a refrigerator and...
No. I mean a commercial kitchen.
The HIV daycare program should be able
to provide a hot lunch.
I'll mention that to the architect.
So, John, if you're okay, we're ready
to go to contractors for bid.
I'm thinking $150 million is in the ballpark.
That's a nice ballpark.
A leadership gift from the Carter Foundation
would help to get the ball rolling,
and we've drawn up a list of potential corporate donors.
We were hoping that you could make some calls
on the hospital's behalf.
No, thanks.
Your personal involvement
would be very useful in contacting...
We weren't happy with the idea of corporate sponsorship,
so we would be
interested in covering the construction cost.
The entire thing?
Plus an endowment
to supply the Center's annual budget
to treat uninsured patients.
This is an incredibly generous offer.
We would appreciate a naming opportunity.
Of course. Do you have some suggestions?
I do, actually.
But I would like to discuss it further
with a few family members first.
To the side...
up and down.
How many times did you get punched?
Just once.
Then he grabbed her purse.
Where did this happen?
Wabash. 23rd.
It wa-wa-was near the corner.
Did you file a police report?
What's the point?
They might catch the guy.
We didn't get a good look at him.
Okay, I'm going to take you to X ray.
Want to look this way?
Can-can I stay with her?
Uh, no, I'm sorry.
Chuny, maybe Rebecca would like some coffee.
Can I have tea?
Sure. You want to come with me?
Stay out of trouble, sweetie.
Okay, Roberta, I just have
a couple more questions for you.
Birdy. Everybody calls me Birdy.
Um, who do you live with?
Just my sister and me.
Been that way for 50 years.
Is there anything you want to tell me?
Like what?
Like, sometimes people are injured by their friends
or their family members.
It was a kid. Just some punk.
Are you sure?
You feel safe at home?
Of course.
Okay, I'm going to order your X rays.
I left a voicemail for the caseworker at the INS.
When she calls back, can you talk to her?
And say what?
Hey, Frank? Hold on.
Just tell them how sick she is.
Doctor Lewis, I converted the tables to a TIFF file.
You removed the P-values?
Oh, crap.
Morris, they want the differences expressed as relative risk.
I'll be back.
Well, page Social Work again.
I need a facial series in 4-B.
For Birdy? You know her?
She and her sister panhandle out on Wabash.
I give them a buck once in a while.
It's a travesty what we let happen to the elderly.
Hey, Wendall, I have a consult for you.
The hunger-strike lady?
Oh, yeah, that's mine. Sorry. Elena Tobajas?
Yeah, I read about her. You did?
She was in the newspaper a few weeks ago.
Something about trying to get asylum for her son.
A few weeks?
I had pancakes for breakfast.
I'm starving already.
I don't know what to say, John.
Well, I've been looking for some time
for the right thing to donate to.
Seemed only fitting.
Have you thought about any future role
in the Outpatient Center?
Yeah, I'd like to sit on the board,
and I suppose I might see a few patients.
But you'd agree it'd be better
to recruit someone with more experience as director?
Definitely.
Yeah, I don't want to run the place, Kerry.
Too much paperwork.
Good. I've identified
four outstanding candidates.
Oh. Well, I'd be happy to look over their C.V.'s,
but I've actually been talking
to Todd Becker.
Todd Becker from Stanford?
Well, he's at Columbia now
and he's set up a network of clinics in Harlem
and the South Bronx.
He'd be perfect.
Why are you are doing this?
He'd be a great director.
No, I mean the whole thing,
the center, the $150 million.
What's going on?
The city needs it.
There's no prevention, there's no primary care.
The whole system's broken.
Well, that's not new. Why now?
Because for 11 years I've been here
patching up these people who fall through the cracks
and it hasn't been enough.
I want to do more.
Doctor Carter,
tier two trauma. MVC?
Fell down a flight of stairs.
Chest and hip pain. Good vitals.
Okay, why don't you guys get started?
I'll be right there.
So you'll send me that file?
What's that?
The guy from Columbia?
Todd Becker.
You're going to love him, Kerry, I promise.
Hey. Hi.
How are you?
I'm okay.
I'm going to finish an eval
before Psych gets here.
RAY: Trauma panel, C-spine, chest and pelvis.
Type and cross for two.
PRATT: You fell down the whole flight of stairs?
From the very top.
Was there carpeting?
Cement.
I slipped while I was mopping.
Pulse ox 92.
Decreased breath sounds here.
What's this going to cost?
That's what insurance is for.
I don't have any.
Worker's comp will cover it.
I'm a temp.
Once a month, they pay me $50 to clean the warehouse.
Well, you're at County, we'll take care of you.
Could you put your right leg down, please?
I-I can't.
Looks like posterior hip.
I should go home and rest.
It just feels like a bruise.
Mrs. Graham, you have a collapsed lung,
your hip is out of joint
and you could be bleeding internally.
I'm okay.
Jake, chest tube on the left. Got it.
Ray, you take the hip.
Ten of etomidate.
Please, just-just-just take all this stuff off of me.
Ma'am, ma'am...
Listen, there's been
a head trauma, she's not thinking clearly.
Yes, I am. No, you're not.
Keep going.
You'll thank us later for this, ma'am.
WENDALL: I spoke to Psychiatry.
They support her competency to refuse nutrition.
Even if she's unconscious?
Even then.
So we're all in agreement?
No treatment, right?
Dr. Lewis, she's seizing!
RASGOTRA: Probably hyponatremia.
You need to let this happen.
Her only intake has been water.
Her serum sodium is too low.
Got a good vein here.
What are you doing? Keeping her alive.
She doesn't want to be treated.
Sam...
A patient takes an overdose,
we tie them down against their will
and pump their stomach.
But we're gonna let this woman die?
Yeah, what's the difference?
She isn't suicidal, she wasn't depressed.
She's motivated by her desire
to achieve an end,
not by a desire to kill herself.
Same outcome. We have to respect her autonomy.
We have a duty to act in her best interest.
Heart rate's up, poor air exchange,
and she's getting dusky. Dr. Lewis?
What do you want to do?
How about oxygen? Nothing.
Five liters.
Dr. Lewis...
It's a comfort measure, it won't save her life.
Go ahead. We may not like what she's doing
but she has the right to do it.
How long can this go on for?
RASGOTRA: After 30 minutes
there's a very high risk of brain damage.
Ah, she's bleeding.
Oh, God.
Can somebody find out if the INS has called?
She bit her tongue. Yankauer.
What is that? Stop!
Ativan, two milligrams.
Neela!
We have a legal document
stating that she did not want
to be treated for the consequences of her fast.
Neela, out of the room.
It could've saved her life.
Thank you. You're off the case.
Your sedative's going to wear off in about two minutes.
32 French.
It won't budge.
Keep going.
( groans )
I can't get this.
Try the Whistler technique.
I, uh, don't know that one.
All right, your arm goes under the bad knee, over the good one.
You stabilize the ankle with your right hand.
Okay to pass the chest tube?
Check the tract and wait.
Chuny, would you come over here and help me with this?
Matter of fact...
I'll stabilize the pelvis.
Ray, get in the position I was just in.
Okay.
I can feel lung tissue. She's starting to wake up.
( groans ) Okay. Listen...
Your arm's a lever.
Stand up straight and the femoral head
will slip over the acetabular rim.
Was that it?
I heard a pop.
You got it.
Good job, Pratt. Ray.
All right, let's fix her lung.
There's some resistance.
Give it a little more muscle.
Hey, man.
Nice.
What are you doing?
Pull your pants up.
Sterile gloves.
That's a bummer.
Dr. Pratt, do you think you could, uh...?
Hell no.
Ray?
No, I need to do a post reduction exam.
Chuny?
That would be sexual harassment.
Okay, all right, thank you very much, everybody.
Oh-silk, please.
LOCKHART: Yes, Roberta and Rebecca
Chaddock, all in-patient...
records and ER visits for the past year.
Thanks.
Anybody to present?
Uh... yes.
Elder assault, possible abuse.
Social services on it?
Um... yes, and I'm reviewing all the old charts.
Abby, I'm all yours.
I was just filling in Dr. Carter.
I can come back.
No, that's okay.
Um, why don't you two go see the patient,
and you can bring me up to speed later.
Okay.
My head hurts.
Yeah, that's from the seizure.
Elena, I don't know how much longer
your body can take this.
Do you have to do that again?
We're trying to respect your wishes...
But I would hate for you to do this unnecessarily.
It's not unnecessary if it helps save Santiago.
What if they don't give you a hearing?
You really want your son to have to live with your death
on his conscience?
I wasn't there when he was little.
My husband was killed in the war, so I came here.
I sent Santiago money for seven years.
When he was 12, I got tired
of waiting for the papers to come through.
He was old enough,
so my brother Alfonso snuck him in.
You've done everything you could.
You don't have to do this, let us treat you.
I'm so tired.
We'll let you rest.
I can't believe she has to go through with this.
She's a mother trying to save her son.
I'd throw myself in front of a train for Cosmo.
Ella esta en el coche afuera.
Y... ella esta embarazada y ya, ya viene!
Where's Chuny?
Ahorita, señorita, ahorita, por favor.
Que me ayude. Mi esposa... esta afuera en el coche.
Ella esta en trabajo.
Okay, all right. We need a BOA kit.
His wife's having a baby?
( cries )
Habla ingles, senora?
Ai...!
Voy a examinar, okay?
Should I get a gurney?
She's crowning.
We need a bulb syringe and some towels.
( groans ) Okay, now push it for me, mama.
Okay? Come on, push it.
Push...
Uh... puta.
Come on, puta.
Puta.
( cries ) Come on, puta.
Eh?
Que llamo mi esposa?!
What? Que llamo mi esposa?!
Esta mi esposa... puta! What the hell you doing, man?!
You crazy?! Get off me! Llamaste mi esposa puta!
Respire.
Va a empujar... ( men yelling )
What the hell is the matter with this dude?
"Puje" means push.
You said "puta."
What's that mean?
You called his wife a whore.
Okay, here we go, honey.
Calmate.
Hey, Dr. Lewis.
I'm just getting coffee.
Chuck's on line two. Sounds like Cosmo's sick.
With what?
No, I'm at the hospital now.
Okay, I'll take it in the lounge.
I've got the doctor right here.
Wait, wait, I prepared the new bar graphs.
Morris, this is not a good time.
We got four hours before we have to turn it in.
Did you include the 95% confidence intervals?
Catch me later.
Hey, Chuck.
She'll be right with you.
Any vomiting?
He's alert, good eye contact?
Okay, okay, well, just call me when his fever comes down.
Okay, listen, I gotta go.
All right, bye. Bye, bye, Chuck.
I've got the INS.
This is Dr. Lewis.
Yes, I am.
She's dying.
No, but there's something you can do--
you can give her son a new hearing.
She may not make it another day.
Thank you.
Sure.
I know she didn't want to be force fed,
but I gave her Ativan.
Ativan doesn't have any calories.
Would you shock an end-stage cancer patient with a DNR?
What you did was every bit as wrong.
She was suffering.
She was unconscious.
I couldn't just watch her die.
Then you should have left the room.
It doesn't seem right.
It's not.
It's just the rules.
Pre- and post-reduction hip.
No fracture.
And the lung's expanded nicely.
Good.
What happened to you?
Had a rough delivery.
Hip lady's labs.
Crit's okay?
Yeah, but calcium's 12.4.
What caused the bump?
It's a long differential.
But the top two causes are...
Hyperparathyroidism.
And cancer.
Yeah, you see these rib fractures here.
There's lesions underneath
that may have weakened the bone.
Metastases.
But that isn't where the malignancy started.
No. You have go to back
and find the site of the primary tumor.
( sighs ) Damn.
That sucks. She's a nice lady.
Yeah. I hear that's a risk factor for cancer.
Looks like the nose is slightly cracked.
And the knee is bruised. Nothing serious.
Oh, she's a tough one.
You two have been mugged several times in the past year.
Occupational hazard.
How come you have to panhandle?
Because they aren't hiring at Hooters.
( chuckles )
I'm serious. It's dangerous.
Don't tell me you haven't been smacked in here.
What about Social Security?
We have rent and heating bills,
electric, medications...
Maybe we should have Adult Services make a home visit.
Again?
They went out last summer.
The place was pretty messy.
Well, we would've cleaned it up
if we knew they was coming.
You didn't have much food in the cabinets.
We like to eat out.
Is there anything we can do to help you?
We do just fine.
I could request another home visit.
Suit yourself.
I'll be back with your discharge instructions.
Yes, ma'am.
TAGGART: Still tachy at 120
She can have some more water.
Dr. Lewis,
navicular fracture has his thumb spica.
That the hunger strike lady?
Yeah.
There's got to be a better way.
She's got no money, no political influence.
This is it.
Ortho clinic in a week.
You got it.
She should at least get to see her son.
They know she's dying, maybe they'd let him visit.
Maybe he can get her to eat.
It's worth a shot.
He'd better get here fast.
Thyroid feels good.
You say I've got holes in my bones?
In two of the ribs.
I should drink more milk.
I need to do a breast exam next.
What for?
The bone lesions could've been caused by spread of a tumor.
You mean cancer?
Possibly.
Have you felt this before?
A mass?
Upper outer quadrant. Five centimeters.
Five?
When did you first notice it?
Couple years ago.
Why didn't you see a doctor?
I've been fine.
They could've caught this before it spread.
Surgery might not be as effective
at this advanced stage.
You want to cut me?
I don't think so.
An operation might be part of the treatment plan.
Where are my clothes?
Whoa. Okay, take it easy, take it easy.
You're all hooked up.
I never should have come here. You have to stay.
I don't want you cutting into me.
Okay. Relax. Relax, please. No!
No! It's okay.
You don't cut into cancer.
We're not going to. I know what happens.
Settle down. You cut cancer, it spreads.
Mrs. Graham. It spreads...
and you die.
( cries ) Okay.
Okay, wound check in two days.
We'll see you then.
Thank you, Doctor.
Bye-bye.
Hey, hold on.
Um, why don't you guys try to have a nice dinner tonight.
You are so sweet.
Was that a 20?
No wonder your patient satisfaction scores are so high.
Are you waiting on a run?
Sort of.
Later. Yeah.
Boxers would stick out more.
It could be tighty-whities.
Thong.
Maybe Abby can settle this.
Settle what?
Boxers or briefs?
Actually goes commando.
( chuckling )
A hunger strike?
It's been 41 days.
Damn. All I heard was she was protesting.
She's weak-- lost a lot of weight.
Can't you make her eat?
That's why you're here.
Do you want to go in?
Elena...
Elena?
Someone's here to see you.
Mami. Que tal?
Santi. Mijo. Mi vida.
Take a step back.
Is that necessary?
He's still in custody.
TAGGART: Can you give them a minute?
Long as he keeps his distance.
¿Como estas, mijo?
I'm okay.
I haven't seen him in six months.
How long can she last?
It's hard to know.
A few days at most.
You should be helping her.
We're trying.
No, you're not doing anything.
You're doctors. You're supposed to help.
Mami...
please let these people help you.
People still think that about cancer?
It's an urban myth.
No, not to her. To her, it's a reality.
It's superstition.
Yeah, well, there's no screening,
no early detection in her community.
She only sees friends who are diagnosed late in the disease.
All right, look, check this out: a guy with colon cancer--
he comes in, he presents with bowel obstruction.
Gets surgery, mets are everywhere.
They do a colostomy, they close him back up...
He's dead in six months.
Exactly.
And all his friends say, "he was fine until he got the surgery."
How are you doing, Mrs. Graham?
Have you had the chance to think about what we discussed?
I don't want no surgery.
They just put a thin needle into the lump
and pull out some cells.
What happens then?
Well, based on the findings,
we can recommend the appropriate treatment.
Like what?
You know, that really depends on the tumor.
Could be radiation, could be chemotherapy...
No, I don't want that.
Look, I'm sorry, ma'am,
but is this about money?
You know, because with cancer,
you qualify for state aid.
It's not about money.
Look, if the biopsy shows a certain kind of tumor
your options are very good.
You could take medication once a day
and survive for years.
You're telling me I got cancer in my bones
and all I got to do is take a pill?
If it's the right kind of tumor.
I'll take the pill then.
Okay, good, but first we have to do the biopsy
and make sure it'll work.
No. No needles. No surgery.
I've had it for two years
and I've been doing fine.
We can't help you if you don't let us.
Who's going to help me get to the doctor all the time?
Going to stay with me when I'm spitting up all night?
Who's going to help me up the stairs
when I'm too weak to walk?
Who's going to do that? You?
Why do you want to kill yourself? To save you.
She needs food.
We know that. Then feed her.
Give her a sandwich or something.
She wouldn't eat it.
You can force it down her throat.
Santi, please.
I don't need your help. I can take care of myself!
Where can we put him?
TAGGART: Family room. Bring the van around.
You say you want to help
and all you do is mess up everything.
Don't talk like that.
You should have just forgot about me!
I was better off in El Salvador!
TAGGART: I'm sorry.
Hey... Hey!
What is your problem?!
She's the one with the problem.
She's doing this for you!
Well, I never asked her to.
Come here.
You know what? Maybe we will force-feed her.
Because your getting deported sounds
like a pretty good idea right now.
I'll go back home. I don't care.
So you want to die?
Look, it's not like she says, I had a good life there.
She ruined everything.
She wanted you to be together.
Right, yeah, she worked two jobs.
I hardly know her.
She wanted a better life for you.
Oh yeah? You think it worked out?
She loves you.
She isn't doing this for me.
She's doing this because she feels guilty.
Just let her go if that's what she wants.
No. You don't mean that.
Sure I do.
Just let her die.
( knocking )
You have Mueller's chart?
Oh, yeah.
Sorry, I'm doing three consults....
That's all right. I just need to co-sign it.
You want to grab some lunch?
I, uh...
I have to get up to the unit.
Dinner?
I don't know.
Look, I feel bad about everything.
Me, too.
I'm sorry.
You know, I'm really good
at getting in my patient's heads.
I wish I'd been able to figure out
what was going on in yours.
I have to get up to the ICU.
There's a family waiting.
You left some stuff at my place.
I could bring it by sometime.
I can come by tonight and pick it up.
Okay.
Just leave 'em bag on the front steps.
Sure. If that's what you want.
Thanks.
Doc, think she'll eat now?
Probably not.
Too bad. She'll die,
and the kid will probably still get deported.
What about the hearing?
Not sure if it will change anything.
We'll see what my boss says.
Thanks for your help.
Can't say we didn't try.
Dr. Lewis, Elena's unresponsive.
I checked the Internet.
45 days.
For what?
IRA prisoners in Belfast.
They started dying 45 days after fasting.
How long she been going?
Forty-one.
Oh, Sam, a paramedic's on the MICN.
Hey, okay.
I made all the revisions, rewrote the abstract
and conclusion.
Morris, I can't deal with this right now.
We got an hour, okay?
If you just look it over, I can e-mail right away.
We'll make the deadline.
Look, it's important to me, too. I'm sorry.
Dr. Lewis, wait... May I call you Susan?
No.
I need this publication for my chief resident application.
Trust me, Morris, it's going to take
a hell of a lot more than that.
Convert the chest tube to a Heimlich valve.
Call for an ambulance
and have a visiting nurse drop in on her tomorrow.
You're sending her home?
We need to put a little bit more pressure on her.
I just tried.
Not very hard.
Well, we can't force her.
Yeah, but we can help her.
Maybe in a couple days
she'll change her mind and reconsider it.
If she goes home, she's not coming back.
We're respecting her wishes. That's the first step.
Then maybe She'll get into oncology.
Or she's lost to follow up.
This lady doesn't have a primary care doctor.
She doesn't feel comfortable with the medical system.
That's what's making it tough.
I'm feeling a lot better.
The beta-blockers kicked in,
so your heart rate's down.
Cool.
Overactive thyroid can cause glaucoma.
So I need to check your eye pressures.
Go for it.
First a drop.
Now this might feel a little weird.
Excuse me. Need a Heimlich valve.
( coughing )
It's okay. It's okay.
Did you use proparacaine?
Yes.
( yells )
( screams )
Did my eyeball come out?!
Oh, my God!
Chuny, ten of morphine right away.
Jake, dribble the local.
Adrian, what's happening to you is called a subluxed globe.
Get me an attending right away.
I think Kovac just got here.
Everything's blurry.
That's normal. You're going to be okay.
Adrian, Adrian,
We need you to stay still. I can't!
You have to.
Is that legal aid lawyer still here?
No. He had to go to class.
Turns out he's a third year law student.
Cocky little bugger.
Hey.
Five more minutes and I'd have given him the Ativan myself.
Hey, Sam, your hunger strike lady's asking for you.
In there?
She's coming around.
Elena, what do you need?
The bathroom. The bathroom.
Where did this come from?
I don't know.
I didn't have an order for an I.V.
With an amp of multivites?
Did you do this?
No.
What's going on?
Uh, well, Elena's awake
with an I.V.
Yeah, I can see that.
What is this?
We just came in.
Could you two step outside.
I need to talk to Elena alone.
What happened?
It's okay.
Elena, it's okay.
Wow.
What?
Who knew Lewis could start an I.V. all by herself.
All right, I'll stop by. Thanks.
Hey, Pratt. We'll run the board as soon as I help Abby.
Okay. Need to go to Oncology
for a bit. Okay.
Okay, Adrian, keep looking down.
Heard you needed an attending.
Welcome to your night shift.
Subluxed globe. Scleral pressure's
not doing it. Okay, we need
a Desmarres retractor.
We don't have one.
Uh... do we have a paper clip?
A paper clip? Yeah.
You're sticking a paper clip in my eye?
Don't worry, won't feel a thing.
Oh, God.
Okay, okay, okay. How about some versed?
Don't you have like an eye specialist here or something?
KOVAC: Okay, insert between the upper lid
and the superior rectus.
It's tough.
Jake, retract the lid superior.
Got it.
Little bit more.
Good. Cover the end
and depress with your ring finger.
Okay.
The eyelid... is past the equator.
Okay.
Look up, Adrian.
Oh, my God.
I can see.
JAKE: Nice.
I'm cold.
They're getting you some warm blankets.
Did you do this?
It's just one bag.
After that, it's up to you.
I thought it was up to me already.
You know, I talked to some reporters.
You're getting a lot of attention.
Mmm.
Because I'm dying.
Here you go.
The INS is taking your demand
for a hearing very seriously.
They don't want the bad press.
You have done
all you can.
It's okay to eat now.
Not until they let him stay.
He wasn't always like this.
He was a good boy.
He did a stupid thing and then in jail,
he joined the gang.
You try so hard, but never know
how they'll turn out.
All he has now is anger and hate.
But you want to keep going?
He's still my son...
even though he doesn't care about me.
I think he does.
He just doesn't know how to show it.
The last thing he said on his way out
was, "Please, don't let her die."
What time is the ambulance coming to take me home?
Should be in about an hour.
There's someone I'd like you to meet before you go.
Long as it's no surgeon.
She's not even a doctor.
Debra Graham, I'd like you
to meet May Crawford.
Hello.
What are you?
A social worker?
No.
A psychologist.
I'm a secretary at an ad agency.
And a breast- cancer survivor.
It's been three years now.
We'll let you two talk.
I had some spots on my bones.
That's how they found it.
Really? They broke my leg.
They put a rod inside.
There's a cancer support group
upstairs and they
have patient navigators to help
people get through the system.
Think it'll work?
Maybe she'll listen to her
more than she'll listen to us.
CARTER: Hey.
I thought you were going to leave it on the steps.
Yeah, I got stuck doing an L.P. on a 300-pound guy.
It's cold, huh?
Yeah. Springtime in Chicago.
Want to come in for a second and get warm?
I don't think so.
You have my stuff?
Yeah.
Hang on a second.
( phone ringing )
Thanks.
( phone still ringing )
You need to get that?
No, the machine will pick it up.
Sure you don't want to come in?
I can make some coffee. Or some tea.
No, I should get going.
Yeah.
Good night, John.
Good night.
Thought we did a pretty good job
getting that kid's eyeball back in.
Yes, we're a pretty good team.
Yeah, this is Abby, she's my....
teammate.
This is Abby, she's my...
partner?
No.
Sounds like we work at a law firm.
How about...
"my special friend"?
What are you afraid that people will think?
What?
This morning, that's what you said.
I just don't want us to go too fast
and get ahead of ourselves.
You have two weeks to decide.
Decide what?
How fast you want to go.
How you'd like to be referred to.
What happens in two weeks?
Big family thing. Oh, yeah?
Yeah. It's like a Saturday brunch.
Okay.
And before that,
we're gonna have to go to church.
Church?
Yeah. My niece is getting baptized.
I have to hold her.
Oh, you're the godfather.
Yeah. If something happens to the parents,
I'm responsible.
That sort of thing.
Mm-hmm. So I'm going to a baptism
as the godfather's...?
Fill in the blank.
Doctor Carter, Ed Miyamoto.
The revised architect's plans'll be
in my office Friday. Stop on by.
( beeps )
Hello. If your current mortgage rate is...
( beeps )
KEM: Hi, John.
About 6:00 in the morning here.
Just wanted to say hello.
You can call, but I'm leaving for work in an hour. Bye.
Hey. Hi.
It's me.
I wasn't sure I was gonna catch you.
Well, I just got home from work.
It was good.
I looked at the plans today.
Yeah, and I've been thinking about a name for the building.
Well, how would you feel about...
The Joshua Carter Center?
Yeah, after the baby.
For the first two days, it's pretty much all I.V.,
but we can try a small amount of clear liquids.
That's it?
Just a few spoonfuls until your stomach gets used to it.
I swore I wouldn't stop until he was safe.
( praying in Spanish )
Amen.
Bless us, O Lord, and these Thy gifts
which we are about to receive
from Thy bounty through Christ our Lord.
Keep my son away from harm.
Amen.
Amen. Amen.
( phone ringing )
Hello.
Uh, yeah. Hey.
Okay, hold on.
Dr. Lewis, it's Chuck on line four.
Oh. I'll take it in the hallway.
Okay.
Okay, put him on.
Hi, baby. It's Mommy.
Yeah, you need to go to bed for Daddy, okay?
I'll be home soon.
No, I'm sorry, I can't do that right now.
Yeah.
All right.
All right, I'll try.
"One hippo, all alone,
"Calls two hippos on the phone.
"Three hippos at the door.
"Bring along another four.
"Five hippos come over-dressed.
"Six hippos show up with a guest.
"Seven hippos arrive in a sack.
"Eight hippos sneak in the back.
"Nine hippos come to work.
All the hippos go berserk."
