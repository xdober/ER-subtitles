Previously, on E.R.--
Who are you? Dubenko. Surgical attending.
I'm covering Trauma today.
What'd you do, wait until
I wasn't there to hire the only candidate
I didn't endorse?
Maybe something's opened up at the hospital.
I don't want to work in the hospital.
Welcome to Jumbo Mart. Can I help you?
What are you doing? Working.
You can stay here for tonight.
Actually, you can stay
as long as you'd like.
Sometimes I-I get nervous.
It didn't seem like nerves to me.
Do you have OCD?
It's against the law to harvest an organ
from an HIV- positive patient.
The recipient is also HIV-positive.
It doesn't matter-- UNOS won't approve,
and no surgeon's gonna perform the operation.
It is absolutely ridiculous
to let a perfectly good organ go to waste.
Prep him. I'll mobilize the team.
( smooches ): Mwa!
( pounding on door )
Go away! Let me in!
Open this damn door! Why can't you just
leave us alone!
Mama, what's wrong?
I'm never leaving you, bitch!
Just leave us in peace!
I'll kill all of you! The kids, too!
( pounding )
Just let us alone!
( gunshot )
Oh, God! Oh, God!
Oh, God! Go. Go. MAN: Is that what you want?!
You want me to kill the kids?
( pounding )
Mama, please... ( crying ): It's gonna be okay.
We just got to go. Come on.
Open it, or I'll kill 'em one by one
and make you watch, bitch!
Go where he can't find you.
( pounding ) MAN: Open this damn door!
( gasps )
( pounding continues )
You want me to kill them kids?!
( pounding )
Saige!
Mama!
CORDAY: You know, the transplant wasn't a total success.
I still have to meet with
the medical executive committee.
Yeah, makes me nervous, too.
Mommy? In the picture?
Uh, look, John, I'll have to go.
I'll call you when I hear something, all right?
Yeah, okay. Bye.
I'm sorry, sweetheart, what were you saying?
Is this Daddy?
Yeah. You know that.
Who are they?
( chuckles ): That's your nana and your grandpa.
Are they dead, too?
I've been to the science museum, like, 10,000 times.
Why can't I just stay home?
Because this way maybe you'll learn something
instead of zoning out all day in front of that Xbox.
You can learn from that, too.
Luka taught me how to rob all 15 stores in Vice City.
Looks cool on his plasma.
You like it over there? At Luka's?
I mean, like the neighborhood and everything?
Guess so.
You like him, too, right?
Yeah. Why?
Just wondering.
Well, how would you feel about, you know,
maybe moving in with him?
You serious? He offered.
You want to? I don't know.
We never really lived with anyone before.
We lived with Dad.
Can I put our TV in my room, then?
Mm... yes.
I don't know, I think maybe we should think about it some more.
ALEX: Yeah.
Sir, please don't read that paper
until you've paid for it.
( sneezes )
Just this, please. Sure. $1.19.
One-one-nine.
I'll be right with you.
Is there a problem? I got it.
I'll get it the next time.
I think Howard has a touch of OCD.
Is that even possible,
to have a "touch" of OCD?
$3.10, please.
( siren wailing ) Busy over there today?
I wouldn't know.
I thought you'd gotten out
of your mandatory ride-along.
Apparently it doesn't matter
that windowless vehicles make me sick.
I guess that's why they call it mandatory.
How's it going over here?
$8.42, please. Great.
I get ten percent off all my purchases.
DUMAR: Abby.
We got to roll.
See you later. All right.
I talked her into doing it.
Your hand never touched a scalpel.
Look, we're just trying to determine
Dr. Corday's understanding of the law...
That's about to change. Fine. The current law regarding HIV-positive
organ transplant.
Look, the donor was originally my patient.
I'm just trying to ask for an opportunity to speak in her behalf.
Attendance is limited to department heads,
and last time I checked, you weren't one.
Bring it on, people-- Dr. Pratt is on the clock
and ready to rock. Which reminds me,
I'm concerned we have doctors using work as therapy
for post-traumatic stress. ( chuckles ): He's fine.
I'm not talking about him.
( sighs ): Look...
I got your request for extra shifts,
and it seems to me you're glossing over
some of your susceptibilities.
WOMAN: Hold the elevator!
I'm late. Sorry.
I'm sorry to bring up
your history of substance abuse,
but the fact is, you're still an addict.
You've been through an emotional roller coaster,
and believe me, I know what it's like.
Why push it? Why tempt fate?
God knows you don't need the money.
There's no problem, Kerry.
Good.
Because I'm not in the business of safeguarding doctors' licenses--
not twice, anyway. So no extra shifts?
Oh, go to the movies, take weekend trips.
Do something other than hang around this godforsaken hellhole.
Uh, Kerry? What?
I tried to make an appointment,
but your assistant's being a little snarky
about your schedule. Let me guess,
you want to extend your maternity leave.
Uh, I was wondering if you'd found
a permanent replacement for the Chief of Emergency Medicine.
Is there someone you want to recommend?
Yeah. Me. Tried to tell her you were busy.
Well, I tried to offer you the position before,
and you turned me down. That was pre-baby.
Post-baby that bad?
Turns out I like kids better when they're
not sucking the life force out of me.
And, uh, Chuck doesn't mind being a stay-at-home dad
as long as we can make up for the lost income.
A grand more per week, with a two-year commitment.
Deal.
When do I start? I need six-months worth
of variant X-ray interpretation, unscheduled returns,
and pneumonia pathway compliance by day's end.
Oh, and the toilets in the E.R. are backed up.
Good luck finding maintenance.
MAN: About time. Getting crazy out here.
DUMAR: How young are the kids?
Four and five. Three-story fall from
a window ledge-- miracle both of them
are breathing and talking.
Any idea what happened?
Some sort of domestic disturbance.
Mom's pretty worked up.
WOMAN: Please, God, please!
He tried to kill my babies!
Who did, ma'am?
( crying ): My husband!
Looks like an angulated fracture.
Spontaneous resps. Get her vitals.
Get her on O2 and start a line.
I need a leg splint.
Hi. Hello?
Can you tell me your name?
( weakly ): Kali... Okay, Kali.
( crying ): He had a gun...
Any idea where he is now?
Oh, God, why did you
let this happen?!
All right, it's okay. Oh, God...
LOCKHART: Can you wiggle your toes?
( sobbing continues )
Great.
That is perfect.
Are you an angel?
Vascular is okay. A what?
An angel... gonna take me to heaven?
PRATT: Somebody please answer my question.
Are we talking urticaria?
LUDLOW: We're not sure.
Insect bites? Lymphadenopathy?
Erythema nodosum? It's possible.
Which one is possible?
All of the above?
Come on, guys!
Were the bumps firm? Were they non-tender?
Were they freely movable?
They're just... bumps.
All right, hold on, hold on, hold on.
First of all, read up on derm.
Secondly, learn to describe lesions systematically,
so your superiors don't look at you all
like you're complete dumb-asses.
( sighs ): How you doing, Mr. Hayslip?
I'm Dr. Pratt.
Do you mind if I take a look at you?
That's what I'm here for.
Good. All righty.
So, what are they?
Um, let me run some tests, and we'll find out for you, okay?
In the meantime, take a more thorough history
and get his labs cooking.
Jing-Mei. Hey. Hey.
What are you doing here?
Oh, Ortho's slammed-- borrowed a cast cutter,
figured I'd do it myself.
I know you're limber, but you're not that limber.
Come on, let me help you.
Oh. Thanks.
Anytime.
It happened so fast.
BP's 106/60 after morphine, pushing another two.
DUMAR: I got it.
The way he came right at us,
and then my babies were down here...
Ma'am, we're taking your kids to County Emergency.
All right, up we go. You can meet us there.
Do you have a family member or friend that can drive you?
What if he comes back?
The police are here to protect you and your son.
No! We got to stay together! I'm sorry,
it's against policy.
My children need me! Let her in.
What? Just let her in.
Hey, Pam?
What? Will you take
the brother with you?
This way your sister, won't be alone, okay?
Thanks. You're just supposed
to be along for the ride, remember?
You feeling that at all?
Mm-mm.
( groans )
So, no John Hancocks?
Hm?
Your cast. Nobody signed it.
Oh. Well...
could've asked the night nurse, I guess.
( chuckles )
You know, haven't left the house in weeks.
Only reason why I'm here is because I've decided to, um,
hitch a ride with my Dad's transport ambulance.
He's got pneumonia again, for the third time.
And phlebitis and a UTI.
( groans )
Admitted him this morning.
Should've just called me-- I could've picked you up.
I think, uh, it's gonna be a while
before I get into a car with you again.
( chuckles )
( chuckles )
Don't forget your range-of-motion exercises,
build up your gastroc.
You ever think about him?
Who?
Elgin.
LOCKHART: Five-year-old,
displaced tibia fracture after falling
from a third-story window attempting to escape
an abusive father.
GCS 15, vitals stable after six of MS.
Distal neurovascular status?
Intact. That the mom?
Yeah, it's a big red taxi, thanks to Abby.
Brother and sister are in the next rig.
All right, ma'am, we're gonna do
everything we can for them, I promise.
Tenderness at the olecranon
and distal radius, multiple fractures.
MOTHER: Her name's Kali, after the Hindu goddess.
Any LOC? Not according to bystanders.
You switching teams on us now, Lockhart?
MOTHER: It's pretty, you know?
CBC, lytes, type and cross for two,
lateral c-spine, chest, pelvis, left elbow, wrist and femur.
And put CT on hold for head and abdomen.
CARTER: Very good, Howard.
But it means "destruction."
DUMAR: Dumar, go.
( crying ): He only used to hurt me.
Why'd he have to hurt my babies?!
Chuny, we need Social Services down here right away.
And let's get Mom to the family room.
Sure. Ma'am, you want to come with me, please?
It's okay.
Good breath sounds, good sats.
I'll check on number two.
They catch the bastard that did this yet?
DUMAR: Okay, we're out of here.
Old man found down in Lincoln Park.
Trachea midline. No JVD.
I'm scared. I know.
DUMAR: Abby, come on.
I'm right here. Don't worry.
I'm gonna catch you on the next run.
CARTER: Set up for the neck film.
Look, you don't do the full 12 hours,
you're not gonna get any credit.
On the right side or the left side?
No hemotympanum.
Little sister's stable for now.
TKO the saline after 500 cc's.
DUMAR: You coming or not?
Someone get me a lead apron.
There was no next of kin.
And you know that because the hospital's policy
of "due diligence" was exercised?
The organ had to be procured quickly
for the operation to be successful.
There wasn't time for a 24-hour family search.
Was the rest of the surgical team aware
they were performing an illegal procedure?
I'm sure they assumed that consent
and UNOS approval were in place.
Did they know both patients were HIV-positive?
( sighs ): Universal precautions
are taken in surgery regardless of a patient's HIV status.
Look, this was a unique situation
requiring decisive action.
That now exposes us
to huge civil liabilities.
Yeah, only if negligence or malice are proven,
which is clear not the case.
The recipient is thriving.
It's against the law, Elizabeth.
At the moment, yes.
But the bill changing all of that is sitting
on the Governor's desk as we speak.
Unsigned.
So, a perfectly good liver that would have been destroyed
was transplanted into a man who would never have qualified
for one a day or two earlier than the law allows.
Where's the harm in that?
I saved a patient's life.
Actually, our patient died.
This other fellow just happened to benefit from it.
You breached hospital policy,
state and federal law, any of which
is grounds for dismissal
and/or loss of your license should we report this
to the State Board.
Sorry.
Got stuck in a hemorrhagic Meckel's diverticulectomy.
Why is he here?
He's on the Medical Ethics Committee.
If you had followed protocol
and presented to them, you would have known that.
What's the next step, then?
( sighs )
We'll make a decision.
You'll be notified as soon as we reach one.
All right.
SAM: Damn, these veins are tiny.
( screams )
You're going to have to settle down
or it's going to hurt even more, okay?
Mama...
C-spine is clear. Mama!
Sat's 97. Need some help? Done it before.
Yeah, I bet you're pretty good at it, too.
Mama! Parietal abrasion, no step off.
What do we have?
RAY: I thought they paged Dubenko.
Well, you got me. Mama!
Four-year-old with chest contusion.
Rib fractures eight, nine, ten, on the left,
but the lung is up.
Sisters, right?
Let's check for tamponade.
Soon as Sam sticks the kid.
Sorry. I get a flash, but no return.
I'll try the other side.
Do we need another nurse?
No.
Where's my mama?
Hey, Tamira, do you like The Wiggles?
Which one is your favorite, huh? Anthony?
Murray-- he plays guitar.
DTR's two plus and equal.
Good answer.
I like Jeff
'cause he's always sleeping.
Got it.
Thanks.
Good bowel sounds. No guarding.
How on Earth do you know about The Wiggles?
I try to keep up with kids TV.
Gives me something to talk to them about.
You're kidding me, right?
Okay, she's stable enough for CT.
I hate the bloody Wiggles.
Kali, you have big, beautiful brown eyes,
and they are both equal and reactive.
No murmur, rub or gallop.
How's it going in here?
Pretty severe pelvic fracture.
Call Ortho?
Yeah, in the meantime, let's use sheet traction.
Pocket Doppler to Dr. Corday.
How'd it go upstairs?
I'm not sure.
I'll know in a couple of hours. Thanks for asking.
Can't imagine they'll give you
anything more than a slap on the wrist.
Good pedal pulses.
Foley's in.
Dip it for blood.
Angel?
Angel?
Uh, Abby, I think she's talking to you.
Oh.
Hi.
You're still here, right?
Yeah, we're all still here.
CORDAY: She'll need a second IV.
I can start a central line.
Dr. Pratt? What?
We have the chest X rays back for Mr. Hayslip.
Who? The guy with the bumps.
He has a huge left hilar mass.
Okay, go. I've got Abby.
Yeah, but she's playing paramedic.
Yeah, well, I got Howard, too.
Howie?
How's the urine?
Negative, but I should try with a re-agent strip
from another bottle.
I only dipped it twice.
Why? Once is sufficient.
Dr. Corday? We need you in here.
What happened?
Sats dropped to 79.
Probably a pulmonary contusion.
Tamira? Tamira, can you hear me?
She's barely moving air.
We need an ambu bag and intubation tray.
Should we get the mom in here?
Why, I'm not planning on her dying, are you?
Is the universe punishing me for being a bad mom?
There are charts here
that haven't been picked up in six hours.
Good help is hard to find.
Like if you order a no-foam latte,
there should be no foam on it.
Yeah, Neela burned my bagel earlier.
You finish those Q.a. reports?
Not yet.
Yeah, I thought you'd be a little rusty.
Where's Dr. Corday?
In Trauma.
Okay, tell her to find me the minute she's out.
It's important.
Oh, and St. Joe's is closing
its E.R. next week for renovations.
Plan on doubling your intake down here.
Congratulations on your promotion.
What's this?
That is my time-off request,
demand for five percent pay increase
and my letter of resignation
if neither condition is met.
Ah... Welcome to management.
How are you doing, Kali?
I'm not hungry. Tachy at 130.
We got a big pelvic bleed. Let's take some O-neg
and let's get a pressure bag on that saline.
Got it.
Where are they?
No, I don't want to!
Okay, Kali, you need to relax.
Somebody needs to tell me what's happening to my kids!
We're doing absolutely
everything we can for 'em, ma'am.
Mommy, no!
No, you're hurting her!
What are you doing to my baby?
No, no, Nichelle. Abby...
Oh, my God, what are they doing to Tamira?
Come on, Abby. Listen. You have to listen to me, okay?
Why aren't they helping?!
Why aren't they helping my kids?!
Shh. They are. They are, okay?
Okay, come on.
Let's go.
Let's just let the doctors do their work, okay?
Okay.
( sobbing ): Okay.
It's nonproductive.
Any hemoptysis?
Cough's chronic, but getting worse.
Yeah, after two packs a day for 25 years, no kidding.
Should I cancel the Derm consult?
The guy's got stage-four lung cancer,
with a hundred skin mets.
What do you think?
He have a primary care doctor?
No. ( coughs )
Mr. Hayslip.
Let me guess, more tests.
Actually, that won't be necessary.
Good. Give me a nice little cream
for my rash and I'm outta here.
It's not a rash.
Look, I don't know how to say this,
so I'm just going to come right out and say it.
You've got advanced lung cancer.
What?
Which has metastasized to your skin.
These are little cancers?
You need to see Oncology.
They'll have the results of your biopsy
and can recommend a course
of chemotherapy.
I'm sorry.
Stay with the patient.
He'll need somebody to hold his hand.
CARTER: Blood pressure's up with 40 per kilo.
Let's repeat the bolus. All right, I'll take that.
You chart. Chuny, hang the blood.
On it.
You running this trauma now?
Guy's sweatin' bullets.
All right, first hematocrit is 34.
DUBENKO: Dr. Corday?
One room over.
Circumferential traction?
Yeah, pelvic and femur fracture
with retroperitoneal bleed.
T-POD's better.
You should get it from Central
and mobilize angio.
Didn't know we stocked the T-POD.
That must be new.
All right, let's give her ten liters O2 by mask.
I'll call Central.
Yeah, you do that.
My sister gonna die?
Um, Saige, right?
Well, we're doing everything that we can
to make sure that that doesn't happen.
Want to up the FIO2?
Howard, can you please take him out?
That's the social worker's job.
PRATT: Yeah, but they're not here right now.
Type specific's ready. So, get a nurse
to talk to him.
I'm a little busy right now.
I'd rather talk to him.
Who, him?
Go.
All right, come on. I asked for some blood.
I want to repeat the crit, I want a unit of FFP.
and I want to know where the damn social worker is.
Covering two hospitals by herself till midnight.
That's my excuse for being late.
What's yours for being an ass?
Where's the hemacue?
Foot of the bed.
14 centimeters at the lip.
Can you see well enough?
Most of the time we can't get one trauma surgeon down here.
How'd we manage two?
Getting harder to bag.
There. Rib sliced up the spleen.
The large amount of free fluid
in the subdiaphragmatic space is rather obvious.
Consent for an ex lap and a splenectomy.
Whoa, sats are dropping.
Tachy at 140.
No breath sounds on the left.
She must have a tension pneumo.
The first chest X ray was clear.
Okay, open a 20 French and a thoraseal.
Toss in an 18-gauge angiocath.
SAM: Dr. Corday?
Sometimes endotracheal intubation
with positive airway pressure
exacerbates an imperceptible pneumo.
Okay, sats are up.
I was about to perform a needle thoracostomy.
You can go ahead and place the chest tube.
O.R. can take her as soon as that's in.
All right. Uh, who should I put down as the attending?
Dubenko. Corday.
LOCKHART: Nichelle, it might help
to talk about what happened.
No... I can't.
Is there anyone we can call for you?
I just need to pray. for my children to live.
Pray for some peace in my heart, in my mind.
Pray for him to die.
He's an evil man.
Oh, he's an evil man.
But he gave me my children.
( laughs )
Now he's gonna take them away.
Need me to answer some questions for you?
Want to watch some TV?
Is my mom gonna be okay, huh?
Well, it's pretty hard for her right now.
She's worried and upset.
I'm sure you are, too.
But hopefully, your sisters will get better real soon
and they'll be back at home
getting on your nerves in no time.
Hey... you see those guys right there?
They're gonna do everything that they can
to keep your family safe from your father.
I'm sorry.
Oh, man.
There are scrubs in the far supply closet.
Thanks.
Come on. It's okay.
Don't worry, about it.
How's it going?
Not so good.
We can't find this guy.
There's some indication
he may have left the state a year or so ago.
But if he came back, no one's seen him.
The neighbors weren't any help?
Woman next door was passed out drunk,
never heard a thing. People on the other side--
they weren't even home.
Well, she's still very upset,
a little scattered.
Yeah, I would be, too,
if I saw my kid fall three floors.
But I would want to catch the guy who did it to 'em.
Hi. Wendall Meade, Social Services.
Detective Maskins.
Ma'am, first let me say
how sorry I am that this happened.
Who are you?
Nichelle, this detective
needs to ask you about your husband.
Ma'am, do you have any idea where he's staying?
Where he might go?
The time. What's the time?
Uh, 12:15.
He likes to drink.
Get drunk soon as he could, every day.
Did he have a favorite bar?
She's a survivor, this one.
CORDAY: Let's hope.
Look, um...
I've been wanting to congratulate you
on the transplant work you did with the HIV patients.
Groundbreaking stuff.
I wasn't trying to break any ground.
Right.
Well, in a more perfect world,
you'd be given an award for it.
Uh, Weaver's waiting on you.
She says it's important.
Anyway, I think what you did was brave.
Dr. Dubenko, T-POD's ready in Trauma One.
I'll send another surgeon down.
Uh, the sheet traction method you used is a little archaic.
This gives a better hug
around the hips and upper thighs.
Sorry.
What about Weaver?
Tell her to wait.
Excuse me.
She's asking for you.
What's going on?
CORDAY: Slowly, steadily pull the handle
straight out from the patient's side.
Kali?
I wasn't a bad girl.
No, of course you weren't.
How's her pressure? Down to 65.
Crit's dropping, even with the transfusion.
So much for Dubenko and his cutting-edge contraptions.
KALI: I don't want to go there.
HOWARD: Barely has a pulse.
KALI: Want to go to Heaven...
Just hang on, okay, Kali?
"When the pulley system is closed,
"secure the compression by wrapping the string
around the four protruding arcs"
HOWARD: Tachy at 150.
No radial pulse.
CORDAY: Intubation and central line kit.
No room for a femoral with the T-POD, right?
We'll go subclavian.
On a five-year-old? ! LOCKHART: Kali, we're going to put
a tube down your throat to help you breathe,
but you won't be able to talk anymore, okay?
CARTER: Prep the upper chest. Let's go.
Kali?
I want to go with you, Angel...
CORDAY: Five-and-a-half E.T. tube...
Get the crash cart in here!
HOWARD: One, two, three, squeeze...
B.P's down to 56, Systolic. Howard?
Need some more ultrasound gel.
Come on, come on, come on, come on!
CORDAY: Show me the subclavian.
Trying to... I can't get in there tight enough.
Dammit, I can't see anything.
I can't see anything either.
Howard, you think you can move?
Howard, swing it around. ...one, two, three, squeeze...
All right, let's check her urine output.
And where's that blood?
Here. Two units cross-matched. Abby, you ready?
Right there, John. Yeah, yeah.
Hold it steady.
...one, two, three, squeeze.
One, two, three, squeeze...
I've got a flash.
Guidewire.
Okay. Kali Richardson medical record #331928.
Right. Transfer another 20 per kilo, round to 400.
A-positive unit number KB 579111.
LOCKHART: Good to go.
Cordis introducer.
LOCKHART: Hang it. Three bolus of 400, 1,200 total.
One, two, three, squeeze. Okay.
I'm in. Hook me up. 3-O nylon.
Pressure's dropping. 50. ...three, squeeze...
Let's mix up some dopamine.
LOCKHART: Okay. 200 in 250 at 5 mikes per kilo...
Will you please shut up!
...squeeze.
One, two, three, squeeze.
One, two, three, squeeze.
KOVAC: The youngest one made it to surgery without arresting.
They've started the ex lap.
Still working on his sister in Trauma One.
( sighing )
You okay?
I just called Alex.
Took everything I had not to cry.
He accused me of being on my period.
Then maybe I am, too.
Almost called him myself.
( sighs )
You two decide yet?
About moving in?
Don't. Not unless you want to kill the romance.
They're on their best behavior at first,
then before you know it,
they're farting in the kitchen.
Um, we've talked about it.
You know, we probably need to talk about it some more.
Just so you know?
I'm not jealous, I'm not crazy
and I won't be farting in the kitchen, okay?
LOCKHART: Can't get her pressure above 60.
Must be a posterior bleed.
LOCKHART: Third unit's in. We need to check the fourth unit.
Howard, help Abby.
Give FFP after the fourth.
Up the dopamine to ten.
Okay. Kali Richardson,
331928.
9... 928 or 938?
28. Show me.
928!
Oh, okay. Good.
Bradying down. Give me some atropine.
Let's get the ultrasound. We need to make sure
we're not missing an intra-abdominal bleed.
...BT... "BV" as in "Victor"
or "BT" as in "Tom"? "T" as in "Tom." Next.
4524542. Lost the pulse. Start compressions.
HOWARD: Okay, once more, slowly, 'cause I think you
may have transposed something.
Howard, hang the damn blood!
Okay. It matches, it matches.
We're in V fib.
Charge to 50.
I just didn't want her to have
a transfusion reaction. And clear!
All right, young man.
Now, if you have to go again,
just let me know, okay?
Okay.
Feel better? Yeah.
All right, now, let's go find your mom.
( sighing )
You coming?
I was scared.
Of course you were.
I-I should've done something to stop it.
Look, you're just a kid.
I'm the oldest.
You're nine.
Your father, he's a grown man.
There's only so much you could do.
He was never there.
Who?
My father.
CORDAY: Clear!
Still fib.
Should have rechecked the blood.
Second bolus of lidocaine's on board.
70 again.
Should we send hemolysis labs
in case it was a transfusion reaction?
That the mother?
Yeah.
Clear.
Seventh unit's in.
Are you sure this is a good idea?
Nichelle, you need to open your eyes.
You need to be with your daughter now.
Another round of epi.
Let's go. 70 again.
Oh, God.
Clear.
( crying )
Asystole.
Could be fine V fib.
NICHELLE: Kali...
Again.
Baby...
Careful, careful, don't get shocked.
( monitor flatlines )
It's all right.
Go ahead.
( crying )
Kali...
( crying ): Oh...
( kissing )
No!
No, no, no, no, no!
No! No! No!
No! No! No! No!
No! No! No!
Kali! Kali!
( choking up ): Kali... Ka...
( sobbing )
Ka... Ka...
( crying )
I was hoping to have seen you earlier.
Yeah, I got caught up in a trauma.
So... I have good news.
Though certain members of the committee lobbied
for your dismissal, I was able to craft
a proposal that I think will benefit all of us.
Really?
How would you feel about accepting a non-tenure track
position as clinical instructor here at County?
So, after giving seven years of my service to this hospital,
I lose my tenure over a single patient.
( sighing ): Elizabeth, you broke the law.
What did you think was gonna happen?
I don't know.
That, um... I might be appreciated for saving a life,
that, uh... that friends might have fought for me.
I did fight for you.
I had to beg, borrow and steal
just to keep them from giving your name to the state board.
( wry chuckle )
What the hell... let them pull my license.
Let them make it ugly.
I'll go public, I'll tell anyone who cares to listen
that this hospital was willing to let a man die
because a bloody bill
was signed on a Tuesday rather than a Monday.
We did something extraordinary here, Kerry.
You're right.
We did.
But that's not our purpose.
We can barely service
the community's basic medical needs as it is.
And that's it?
Just stay open, get through each day?
Isn't that enough?
( sighing ): Howard?
You shouldn't have stopped me.
Howard, you need help.
There are medications for this.... therapies.
I'm fine. ( slamming )
I don't think you're fine.
I saw you check,
double-check and triple-check every lab form,
and blood unit that went into that trauma...
Probably ABO incompatibility.
No, listen to me, the transfusion was fine.
Nobody did anything wrong.
Howard, we didn't kill her.
Her father did, and you're not gonna get any better...
I'll go into Derm or Radiology...!
You're not being rational.
I'm being thorough!
Why is that such a problem for you people?!
Uh... what was that all about?
Howard has OCD.
Please don't tell me I just lost a doctor.
She would've started kindergarten this year.
You all right?
Hanging in there.
How about you?
Personally or professionally?
First year resident...
it's probably one and the same at this point.
Today was hard.
I can't imagine what it must feel like to lose a child.
Yeah.
Yep.
Hey.
Big brother just told me he hadn't seen Dad in a while.
Might be because he died a year ago.
Any candidates at all that didn't match for an internship?
You know, he always seemed reasonable to me.
There's only four in the entire country?
A friend of mine's taking a year off
after medical school to live with wolves.
I can see if she's still in town.
I'm sure that if you just went
and talked to him he would change his mind.
Right, and the one in the Dominican Republic.
Can I do a phone interview?
I did talk to Howard in the parking lot,
but he kept locking and unlocking his doors.
There's a doc in Urology who says
he's looking to start over in Emergency Medicine.
Oh, he's in Milwaukee? How soon can I get an interview?
He's close to 60, but I think he's still spry.
Oh, yes, thank you.
Thank you so much.
( sighs )
Did you hear?
What?
The youngest died in the O.R.
( sighs )
WENDALL: The police went to dad's favorite bar
and confirmed he died last year.
Shot to death in some sort of holdup.
After that, kid says she couldn't eat, couldn't sleep.
Yeah, after years of abuse,
she probably didn't know what to do with herself.
Is there any psychiatric history?
No, but insurance records show that
our outpatient clinic had her on Valium three times a day.
Stayed on it six months, until she ran out of money.
How long ago was that? Last week.
So, she was hooked.
We're talking Benzo withdrawal.
If she quit cold turkey... could be psychosis,
delusional thinking, hallucinations...
Did the oldest kid say what really went on?
No.
And you can forget about him talking to the cops.
Hey, Lockhart.
EMS Coordinator called for you.
Sounded pretty pissed about your ride-along.
Sorry.
Hey, Chuny, how's he doing?
Better. Gave her ten of Valium P.O.
Psychosis should start resolving.
Maybe now she can tell us what really happened.
Only if she knows.
Hola, Doctora Guzman?
Ah, si. Buenas noches to you, too.
Habla ingles?
No? Wonderful.
Uh... Estoy Doctora Susan Lewis
de County Hospital in Chicago...
Hey, Jerry, how do you say "we have an opening" in Spanish?
No clue. But I think that resident
you wanted to interview is here.
Hi. How are you?
Hi.
CARTER: Nichelle?
You think you can tell us what happened?
No...
I don't know.
Can you tell us where your husband is?
Raymond?
He's dead...
Can you tell us how he died?
In a robbery.
You said he was trying to break into your apartment.
You remember telling us that?
Mama, what's wrong?
CARTER: You said he was trying to kill you.
Oh, God! The door! He shot the door!
Mama, let go!
( crying ): We're just gonna leave.
SAIGE: Mama, stop it, please.
Go away!
Mama, what's wrong?
But he wasn't there, Nichelle.
What happened to Kali and Tamira?
NICHELLE: We just got to... we just got to leave.
SAIGE: Mama, stop it.
Please.
We just got to... find...
find a place where he can't find you...
where you'll be safe.
How did they get over to that window?
( panting ): It's the... it's the only way.
Hurry! Hurry.
Mama, don't...
please...
You'll be safe.
Mama, don't. Stop it. Please!
Saige! Saige!
( cries )
How did they fall?
Mama!
Saige! Mama!
You'll be safe!
Go! No!
Go! Go!
Mama!
Go! Go!
Go...! Go...!
Mama, stop!
Mama, quit it!
Saige! Go!
Go!
Saige!
Mama, stop!
( crying ): Saige!
Saige!
I made them go out...
I'm...
I'm sorry, Dr. Carter?
Dr. Corday was looking for you.
Said she got her answer.
Sir, I'm afraid that's the only kind of cheese we have.
This isn't cheese. It's orange crap.
Are you almost off?
Five, 50 and five make ten. Thank you.
Want to go get a drink or get something to eat, or...?
I still have another hour yet.
I work longer days than I did when I was an intern.
Though I did learn something new today--
how to clean the hot dog machine.
Now there's a skill I can take wherever I go.
One large coffee
and a first-year resident, please.
Sorry?
Howard quit. He did?
Yeah, are you interested?
Well, Neela's going through this delayed adolescent rebellion
slash premature mid-life crisis thing right now.
Look, I've called the NRMP,
I have scraped the bottom of the barrel,
I have seen or spoken with more freaks than Dr. Phil.
I am desperate-- no offense--
for anyone even remotely competent and/or sane.
I don't know, I mean, I'm working now so...
Yeah, you're right.
You just keep ringing up those pork rinds
and making Icees.
Hey, who labeled these jalapeños?!
They say mild, but I'm burning my damn tongue off.
Dr. Lewis?
When do you need me to start?
Elizabeth?
Hi, John.
So, did you talk to Weaver?
Yes.
What did she say?
Well, she said that there was a place for me here.
A lesser place, but a place nonetheless.
I'm sorry.
Don't be. I didn't take it.
I've decided to leave.
There's not enough of a future for me here.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Let me talk to Weaver again.
We can go to the courts. No, it's all right.
It's all right.
This whole transplant situation,
the new staff, my four-year-old daughter...
it's all helped me see things more clearly.
Mark's gone, so many of my friends are gone.
There's... there's no reason to stay...
not for me, not for Ella.
I suppose I've known that for a long time now,
but it's, uh... it's just...
hard to move on, isn't it?
It's hard to close that chapter.
Several.
Where are you going to go?
Home, I think, for a bit.
Back to England?
Would you apologize to everyone for me?
Aren't you gonna come by and see everybody before you go?
I'm not much for good-byes.
They make me cry, truth be told.
If you want me to tell anybody anything...
Tell them, uh...
it's been lovely.
