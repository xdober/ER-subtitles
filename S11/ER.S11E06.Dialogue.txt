( pounding machine )
( pounding machine )
( baby crying )
( shushing )
All right.
Who do I gotta screw to get some health care around here?!
Well, honey,
why don't you try an intern? They're always hard up.
Come on, Jeremy, I'll take you back.
Where?
To see the doctor.
My dad here yet?
No. He's on his way.
Can I give my ticket to you?
Just a little longer, sir.
D-D-Don't make me late.
My baggage already went through.
Right.
Come on, Jeremy.
11-year-old boy
with multiple lacs.
Hey, how you doing, little man?
TV fell on him.
Kids were home alone.
Okay, we'll get to him real soon.
Standard of care is primary closure within six hours.
Standard of care is for rookies.
Get him started, Jane. Dr. Pratt will be right there.
And, I got a real winner for you.
Belly pain with combustible breath.
You talking about that creepy homeless guy?
"Creepy" I'll give you, but I don't think he's homeless.
How 'bout we wait till he sobers up?
I'll be home and in bed by then.
He needs to be examined, Pratt.
I'll take care of it. Thank you.
How long's he been here?
Oh, about two hours.
He thinks he's in an airport or something.
He's altered?
Yeah, a little.
If you ask me, we need to have one line for legitimate patients,
another line for all the rest.
Yeah, well, good thing nobody asked you.
Luka, our UTI, dislocated shoulder
and rapid hair loss all need to be signed out.
I haven't been this starved
since the last Burning Man festival.
Who wants some 'za?
You had a burger a couple of hours ago.
Fast metabolism.
Pratt, wheezing guy was driving insomnia lady crazy
so I moved him into Exam Three.
Okay, beautiful.
Okay, who's the lucky bastard that gets to take my blood?
I need CBC, LFTs and amylase.
I'll do it.
Is this about your needle stick?
Yeah.
You gotta do what you gotta do, right?
Hey, this is Dr. Barnett from County.
I'll take six-- no, no, no, make that seven. I'll take
two pepperoni, two sausage and pepper,
two Hawaiian and one with the works.
It's, let's see, 11:23 right now.
So we'll get that at 12:03, right?
All right, man. Cool.
Seven pies. What the hell was that about?
Guaranteed delivery within 40 minutes
or there's no charge, but what the guy doesn't know
is that Wacker's closed
and the Loop is a parking lot.
There is such a thing as a free lunch, my friend.
Luka. Belly-pain guy's going down.
Somebody bring a gurney!
Sir. Open your eyes, sir.
Hey, doctor, no way. Uh-uh. I was here before him.
Vitals were normal when I triaged him
a couple of hours ago.
That nurse told me I was next.
Diaphoretic, carotid's weak and thready.
70 systolic.
Hey, is that what it takes, huh? Flopping around
on the floor like I'm dying?
Yeah, don't push me! Watch me! Hey!
One, two, three.
Get him on O2 right away.
Here we go!
Hey! Look at me! Look!
My bag. My bag. I want the bag?
I got it!
Stat EKG in case he's having an M.I.
What about me, huh?
I could be having an M.I., too!
Any history of hepatitis?
Abby, can you give us a hand?
What about my blood draw?
I'll write you a note. Get a 12-lead going.
Where am I?
Sam, you've got the IV.
Where am I? What are you doing?
Okay. Hey, Pratt, can you spare Jane?
Definitely.
Document everything we do at the time we do it.
Isn't that usually a nurse's job?
There's a nursing shortage, Jane-- haven't you heard?
What are you doing? Stop!
Hey, hey, hey, now. Okay. I may not
always know what to write. We'll tell you.
Start with two liters of 02 at 11:25. Pulse ox 98.
Ow.
That's my bag. Gimme my bag back.
I'll give you your bag back right down here.
Get your hands off of me!
Hey! Calm down.
Knock it off.
Okay? We're here to help you,
and we can try this
the nice way, or we can try other options.
This is how you help?
Yeah, that's right, sir. Okay.
EEG is ten centimeters.
EEG's printing.
Chart it.
11:26.
Got your line. What do you want sent?
KOVAC: Abby?
CBC, chem 20, PT/PTT, troponin. Type and hold.
And add a serum ammonia.
EKG looks good.
Hey. No ischemic changes.
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Hey.
Hey!!
My name is Charlie.
Metcalf, okay?
Okay?
Okay.
Okay?
Okay.
Ouch! Don't.
Okay, okay. I'm not gonna hurt you, okay?
Dr. Kovac.
Okay, let's get him gowned.
We need you to work with us, Mr. Metcalf.
This'll be much easier, okay?
What's the trouble?
Possible extensor tendon lac.
Okay. Can you move your toes up and down?
How'd that happen?
My sister pulled the television down on me.
It was an accident.
I guess it's true,
then, huh? TV really is bad for kids.
KOVAC: Where were your parents?
JEREMY: My dad was at work.
KOVAC: Baby-sitter?
We can't afford one.
I watch after Steffie.
Can't afford a baby-sitter,
but they got one big-ass TV.
Luka.
Somebody called the dad?
Yeah, the neighbor who brought them in.
Get him cleaned up and send for X rays.
We have three TVs.
That IV making you feel better?
Yeah. Yeah, look, before-- I-I'm sorry.
I-I just... Shh.
11:27. 300 cc bolus is in. Pulse down to 110.
No murmur rubs
or gallops. Multiple spider angiomas
on the chest wall.
Watch my stomach. Watch my...
( Metcalf coughs )
You seen a doctor lately?
Um, it's been a of couple years.
Do you have a primary-care physician?
No, not at the present time.
Need a 5-O nylon.
( groans )
Who were you seeing a couple of years ago?
I don't remember the guy's name.
Some doctor in Taylorville.
Taylorville? You lived there?
Yeah.
There's a prison there, right?
Yeah, it's a correctional facility.
What's the big deal?
I knew somebody who spent time there once.
Small world.
Positive fluid wave.
Liver's small. JANE: Ascites?
Yeah.
What's that?
It means you have fluid in your belly.
So, what were you in for?
A mistake.
What, you mean you weren't framed?
Spleen is enlarged.
Chart a BP. 100/70 at...
11:28.
Caput medusa.
What kind of mistake?
I killed a guy.
Palmar erythema and muscle atrophy.
Oh, yeah? For what?
For asking too many damn questions, that's for what.
Hemocue 7.2
My dad here yet?
No, not yet.
Hey, kid!
Don't look at him. Just look this way, okay?
Hey, pally.
Don't worry about him.
Mr. Metcalf? What?
Mr. Metcalf?
You're very anemic and could be
losing blood from an ulcer.
Are you a drinker?
( laughs ): Yeah.
Were you drinking in jail?
Yeah, but you're not gonna rat me
to my parole board, are you darling?
It's important we know what you've been taking.
Pruno, breakfast of felons.
Now, I drink wine, beer, anything I can get my hands on.
Pruno?
Yeah, it's fruit... ow.
fruit and bread from the cafeteria.
You put it in a garbage bag
with toilet water and then you let it ferment.
Ow. Ow, ow, ow, ow.
Ferment where?
Under the bed.
Strain it through your socks
and then you're ready to go.
If you're desperate enough, it tastes like a martini.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah. You don't know what it's like to need a drink.
I can imagine.
Okay. To check for blood loss,
we're going to have to do a rectal exam.
A what? No, no, no, no, no.
I spent the last nine years avoiding rectals. No.
It's the only way for me to know
that there's any gastrointestinal...
You're gonna stick your finger up my ass?
My gloved and lubricated finger, yeah.
No.
I'm sure it's smaller than your bowel movements.
Listen, boss-- exit only. You understand?
Exit only.
If you're bleeding internally, it could be life-threatening.
Okay. fine.
Can I...? Maybe we can cover me up or something.
JEREMY: I don't want it.
Would I hurt you? No! I don't want it!
Look at me, I'm not going to hurt you, okay?
I want my dad!
You don't have to worry.
Where's my dad?
Look at me, I'm not going to hurt you, okay?
I want my dad! I don't want to get a shot!
Look at me. I'm not gonna
hurt you, okay? Pally?
What's your name?
Jeremy.
Jeremy, you know, the way I see it,
doctors are mean.
They wanna make us cry,
but you know what?
If you don't, I won't. What do you say?
Let's show 'em. Let's both not cry.
Okay, kid?
Okay, Jeremy.
It's okay. It's okay. It's all right.
See?
( groaning )
That's it. Don't worry
It's okay.
There it is.
Get that. That's it.
See? Hey, that wasn't bad, was it?
We have to put a tube down your nose into your stomach
to figure out what's causing the bleeding.
No, the docs in the joint gave me one of those
for my pancreatitis.
We're going to numb it up so it won't be too bad.
Great. We won't keep the tube in
any longer than necessary, okay?
Sit him up.
( groans )
You know, I used to be an artist.
Open.
Pressure's up to 110/76.
What kind of artist?
I-I did some painting.
A mural for my wife's church,
You know.
Mostly I, uh, I earned my living as a contractor,
a carpenter-- that sort of thing-- fixing old places up.
You all could use my help around here.
Okay, if you swallow it while we pass it,
it'll go down easier.
All right, all right, all right.
Okay.
It's going down.
Keep swallowing. It's going down. That's good.
Very good.
All set.
Relax.
Okay. Hook it up to low suction.
Yeah, I was mixed up before.
I get confused in my head.
I-I-I'm better now.
Like you think you're going on a trip?
When you were in the waiting room,
you kept asking me what time your flight was.
Sometimes it's a train or a bus.
Sometimes it's a boat.
One time, I was getting ready to parachute.
So is that what the suitcase is all about?
No, I always have that.
You leave anything behind at the flop,
it won't be there when you get back.
The scumbags steal it.
NG output one liter at 11:32.
KOVAC: Blood's too dark for an ulcer.
Varices?
What's that?
That's when the elevated pressure in your liver backs up.
KOVAC: The veins of the esophagus
become engorged and fragile
and can bleed a lot, sometimes uncontrollably.
Emesis basin!
Oh, you made me worse. Get...
Get it out of me.
Mr. Metcalf.
Get it out!
Okay.
That has to stay in.
Get it out of me!
Okay, soft restraints. Get the tube out.
Pressure's dropping, 82/66, tachy at 130.
Another liter and two units
of type-specific, and call G.I.
down here now.
Get these off. ( stammering )
Trauma One is open. Okay.
Mr. Metcalf, is there anyone we can call for you?
You mentioned you had a wife.
No. Children, siblings?
No. No. Nobody that'll come. Okay, let's get him
up to X ray. Stef, you stay with him.
Okay, sweetie? I'll see you back here in an hour.
Pratt, with us.
Make it four units type-specific.
Type-specific'll take too long.
Get O-neg out of the cooler!
Get these things off me. Don't tie me down!
You can't keep tying me down!
Let's go, people. Prime the rapid infuser.
Subclavian on the right?
Yeah. Prep the chest.
Let's go, people. Prime the rapid infuser.
Subclavian on the right.
Prepping the chest.
O-neg here.
Squeeze in the first units. Sam, second on the infuser.
Pratt...
Push the octreotide
You've been paying attention, huh?
You need me to do something?
Yes, cycle the dynamap when it's ready.
A little sandostatin's not going to make his chances any better.
Diminished blood flow through the portal system.
Yeah, but what's the point?
The odds of him making it are what, 30%?
Another 200cc's out the NG tube.
He's that sick, even though he was just lucid and talking?
He's right on the edge. All he needs is a little push.
You know what, Pratt?
We got a lot of hands in here.
If you don't want to help...
So you want attending now?
What, no one wants to be a nurse anymore?
Pratt, come on.
Prick.
That's enough.
Heart rate's up to 140.
Is he taking any meds?
Check his bag. He said all his stuff is in there.
First unit's up.
11:35.
Pushing 15 mikes of octreotide.
All right.
The guide wire's passing.
Yo, hair of the dog.
151 proof.
This guy's a class act.
Where are you with your extension tubing?
What is your problem, Pratt?
We're killing ourselves for a non-compliant
alcoholic, ex-con drifter with end-stage liver failure.
You want to get out?! Then get out!
You know what? It's Friday.
I don't do lost causes on Friday.
It's a religious thing.
Second unit's going in.
Is there anything else in that bag
we need to know about?
No, but there's a picture.
It looks like him and his wife and a kid maybe.
A bunch of letters and a journal.
Pressure's 98 over 62 at 11:37.
I don't know. Some kind of painting.
Where's my passport...?
Where's your what?
Give me my passport.
I can't go without my shoes.
Go where, Mr...?
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Let me, let me go. Let me go.
Head up to 20 degrees.
Let me go.
And check on G.I. again.
Let me go. Thank you.
I'll be right back.
Get 'em off. Get 'em off.
Do you have a problem with me?
No.
Sam?
I was out of line.
Okay, let's go.
The guy's a waste.
Dying from something that he's doing to himself.
Last time I checked, alcoholism was still a disease.
So is suicide.
He should catch some of that and save us the trouble.
We get ones like this every day.
Then maybe I need a day off.
This personal?
I guess.
Good.
You and I have to talk about it.
You like riding me, don't you?
I don't think I do. Ever since I was an intern
you've been on my back.
Maybe a couple of times.
Why?
You're good, Pratt, but I think you could be better.
There's a number you wrote down here with a name.
"Bobby?" Should we call him, Charlie?
No. No, don't call him, please.
I don't want anybody to call him, okay?
No calling. I-I don't want to see him.
I don't want to see him!
Mr. Metcalf, the veins
at the end of your esophagus are bleeding a lot.
This is a result of your cirrhosis.
That also means you have less than
50% chance of surviving.
This is surviving for how long?
A few months? Months? Months? What?
Not that long.
PRATT: What we need to know is if you stop breathing
or your heart gives out,
do you want us to use heroic measures?
Heroic what?
You want us to do CPR, shock your heart
or put you on a breathing machine?
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
You saying now?
You're, you're saying now, you mean like, today?
No, no, no.
Look, no, I have a lot of things
that I have to do. I'm just not ready.
Okay.
I'm not ready. I'm, I'm...
Okay, the man wants it all.
Okay.
I'm Adler from G.I. How bad?
About 21/////2 liters of output.
Pre-load the scope with a Saeed six-shooter.
What? What's a six-shooter?
We're going to look down your esophagus
and try to band the veins to stop the bleeding.
What's the deal with your suction?
Turn it up.
I did.
Nothing's coming out, great.
Check in two, Abby?
Jane, get on the phone about a portable unit.
You guys have suction in here?
Last time I checked.
What time is it?
11:40. Why?
They got 23 minutes, or we're eating for free.
Is your patient stable?
Smoke inhalation with wheezing.
Okay, we need the room.
You into pepperoni, Abby?
Do you have ADD? Come on! Let's go.
Give us two minutes to finish the...
We need it now, Ray. We're good in here.
This guy may just need to be tubed.
This guy might need to be pronounced.
I hope you're not a veggie, 'cause I got meat on everything.
See you later.
Cetacaine and bite block.
A little more numbing spray, Charlie.
Push two of versed.
All right, Charlie, once we're ready to start,
you're going to have to keep this in between your teeth
because it stops you from biting down
on the fiber-optic scope.
Check your monitor.
Is this Bobby, Charlie?
Is that your son?
Yeah.
And your wife?
Evelyn.
Pretty.
You want me to call her?
No, she's gone. It's been a long time.
What about Bobby?
Must be all grown up by now, huh?
Yeah, he's 19.
He's going to be 20 next month. He's in college.
Let's try to reach him, okay?
I haven't talked to him since he was little.
His aunt gave me that number when I got out of prison, but...
Well, it's all the more reason to use it now.
Let's pull the NG.
Okay, Charlie, here we go.
( Charlie coughs )
( grunting )
How's his pressure?
108 over 58.
Okay, ready to go.
Hi, I'm looking for Bobby Metcalf?
Okay. You know what?
Can you actually wake him up for me?
( coughs )
Hi, Bobby, my name is Samantha Taggart.
I'm an ER nurse at the County General in Chicago.
Grade-two varices?
Grade three.
Yeah, we have your father here, and, uh... Yeah.
And he's pretty sick.
Four columns, two hemorrhagic.
Two bands at each bleeding site, one at the others.
SAM: Uh, no, he's, well, he's out of jail.
I don't know. For a while, I think.
Systolic's down to 90.
Is there any way you can come down here
and be with him?
Probably the versed. 500cc saline bolus.
Uh, no. You know what.
He can't talk right now because he's in a procedure.
Sucking the varix into the cap.
Okay, hold on.
He wants to talk to you.
Sorry. That needs to stay in.
And...
firing.
Okay, let's talk.
Okay, you guys, I'm gonna put Mr. Metcalf's son
on the phone for a minute, okay?
( son breathing into phone )
Bobby?
Dad?
Is it you?
Yeah... it's me.
So you're sick huh? You dying?
No, no, no, no.
Nurse, is he dying?
He's very sick.
What am I supposed to say...
huh, Dad?
It's been a long time, There's so many things I...
Yeah?
I don't know. I...
Hey, Dad?
Yeah?
Nice knowing you.
( receiver clicks )
( sobbing )
I told you you shouldn't call him.
Firing.
Good.
Turn up my section.
Can you band it?
Not if I can't see it.
Mr. Metcalf? Mr. Metcalf?
BP 62 over 38.
I can't even feel a pulse.
Bobby?
Bobby?!
( whistles )
Bobby?!
He's bleeding out.
Okay, turn him over.
Another two units on the infuser. Ambu-bag!
( birds chirping )
Come on in. The water's warm.
Try the femoral.
Get another four units up here.
FFP after these two!
Hey! Hey, you dumb son of a bitch!
Hey, you dumb son of a bitch!
Thought we lost you there for a second.
Bobby?
Uh, we had him on the phone.
Is he coming?
No. No, he's not coming, man.
JANE: BP's 86/42 at 11:44.
ABBY: You want the FFP?
PRATT Yeah, and another unit of packed cells.
Dr. Kovac.
How long have you been out of touch with him?
Your son.
Long time. Since I went to prison.
Well, even in prison, he's still your kid.
Blood's here.
You don't know what it's like.
I know if I had a kid, I'd want to do
everything I could to stay with him.
KOVAC: I need a Linton tube, Kelly and a 60cc syringe.
You think you know, but you don't.
How it could all switch on you.
How life could turn on a dime.
Gets broke and you can't s...
you can't see a way to fix it.
KOVAC: Mr. Metcalf,
the specialist, uh, here thinks
we can control your breathing with the scope.
ABBY: So you want a Linton tube?
METCALF: Wha... What?
We pass a large balloon into your stomach.
So it helps us keep pressure on your veins.
All right, well, what's to lose?
I'll test the balloon.
IT was April 10, 1992.
Bobby was turning eight.
My wife asked me to go get some stuff for the party,
but I... I-I st...
I stayed so I could finish
putting together this robot for him.
You know, so I made her go.
From the street, I hear a thud...
and the scream.
And I go to the window to look out.
And... and she's... she's lying there
like she's asleep on the street.
And the ice cream cake...
the ice cream cake was all around her on the pavement.
SAM: Five syringes.
So there I am, there I am with this...
with this little boy to raise.
And what do I do?
I start drinking...
and getting high.
I couldn't keep it together.
I couldn't keep it together.
And then I stabbed some guy in a bar,
Just for... just for...
just for nothing.
For nothing.
'Cause he looked at me wrong.
SAM: This one's good.
KOVAC: We can go up to 750 for hemostasis.
Okay, ready, Mr. Metcalf?
( coughs )
( gagging, coughing )
( coughing )
( gags )
( gagging continues )
KOVAC: So, where was your son after that?
With my wife's folks.
Listen for bowel sounds.
METCALF: At first, they would bring him by on visiting days, but...
after a while that stopped.
And then the letters started coming back unopened.
You know what?
I-I-I-I don't feel good. Something's wrong.
Something's wrong.
BUN 74, creatinine 8.2.
Okay, call renal and throw in a Foley.
Hey, we should think about TIPS.
What's that?
KOVAC: TIPS stands for Trans-jugular
Inter-hepatic Porta-systemic Shunt.
Uh, we put a catheter from your neck to your belly.
By bridging the two vessels, we can bypass the liver
and slow down the bleeding.
And how much time would that give me?
It's hard to say.
No urine output.
ABBY: Hepatorenal syndrome.
Your... your kidneys are not working.
ABBY: He needs dialysis.
PRATT I'll make the call.
RAY: GSW to the belly.
KOVAC: Not here, Chuny. There's nowhere else.
'Kay, move him over, and keep traction on the Linton.
Hold on. 'Kay, go ahead.
KOVAC: Okay, let's transfer him. One, two, three.
RAY: There's no meds,
no allergies, no past history.
NG, Foley and portable chest.
Bastard shot me for stealing my own spliff.
I need another nurse in here.
Said it was his, but it was mine.
Rolled it myself this morning.
What's going on? They just need to stabilize him.
I want my own damn room!
Get the hell out of here, man!
Screw you, jerk-off.
KOVAC: Okay, doctors only talking now.
Damn, that's hard.
Even a gunshot wound to the belly
don't buy a man some privacy.
Ow! KOVAC: 'Kay, two grams of Cefoxitin
I.V. piggyback. That's a house
we rented one summer.
There was a lake nearby.
I-I took Bobby fishing...
Periumbilical GSW with intestinal prolapse.
DUBENKO: Hey, what about the on-deck batter?
We're waiting for a TIPS and IR.
DUBENKO: That sounds bad. Let's get him up for an ex-lap.
Portable monitor, let's go.
KOVAC: What about X rays?
DUBENKO: We'll get them upstairs.
RAY: T minus eleven minutes on those pizzas.
PRATT: IR's already on the floor,
and Renal's on the way.
Luka, he's getting tremulous.
Haven't had a drink since last night.
It's alcohol withdrawal.
Who's Dr. Pratt?
Hey, that'd be me.
Hey. Ramirez, nephrology.
All right, who's this guy?
We're gonna need central access.
KOVAC: He's got a subclavian.
That's great, let's consent him and start the run.
What? What is he talking about?
He's here for the dialysis that we discussed.
I never discussed it.
You discussed it. I never... I never
discussed it.
Alfonso, how are you?
Is this a TIPS patient?
Yeah, and we should go first.
Uh, wha... wh-what are you talking about?
That's what's gonna prolong his life.
RAMIREZ: Yeah, without the dialysis,
he'll bleed out the minute you spike through his liver.
What? What? Spike my liver?
Will his pressure even tolerate dialysis if the varices keep bleeding?
I-I don't understand.
I can support his pressure. The Linton tube
is supporting his pressure, and only barely.
Wh-What are you talking about? Dr. Kovac.
Well, he's gonna need dialysis three times a week.
Yeah, for the rest of his life.
Hey... hey... TIPS is not a cure.
It's a bridge to a liver transplant.
We all know that's not gonna happen. Hey, hey,
hey, hey.
I'm right here.
Yeah. Talk to me.
Sorry.
Now, you can't fix my kidneys?
You're gonna need dialysis,
three times a week.
And what about my liver problem and the... and the bleeding?
The TIPS is a temporary measure.
Your best hope is for a liver transplant.
I-I-I don't understand.
Wh-Wh-What are the odds of that?
KOVAC: Based on your history of drinking,
not good.
Is there... is there any chance
that I'm gonna be walking out of here?
With the dialysis and the TIPS...
METCALF: I mean today.
What are the chances that I'm gonna walk out of here today?
None.
I-I-I don't want it.
I don't want anything, then.
If you don't have the TIPS procedure,
we can't control the bleeding-- you'll die.
Yeah, I get it.
I get it.
Just stop everything.
No more blood transfusions?
No breathing machine? No, it's over.
No CPR? No.
I need it to be very clear, Charlie--
if we don't continue with the treatment,
do you understand what will happen?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay, Mr. Metcalf is a DNR.
11:57.
Wait, wait a minute, wait a minute.
Hey, he's not competent. Come on.
It's what he wants, Pratt.
Can you, uh...
can you do something for this?
Hey, could we put him on an alcohol drip.
You gonna get me drunk? Just enough to stop
the tremors, Charlie.
Charlie, let us do the procedure.
You don't have to do this.
Just call... could you, um...
try Bobby again.
Try my boy, get him on the phone.
If he knows it's really over, he'll come.
Okay? He'll come.
TAGGART: Hey. Bobby Metcalf...?
Oh, yeah. It's the hospital calling again.
Yeah, do you think you could do that?
Okay, thank you.
What happened?
He went to class.
His roommate's going to see if he can find him.
Can you take this out?
It's uncomfortable.
That tube's keeping you alive.
It's uncomfortable. Please.
Okay.
Is there, um... is-is there a window?
Can you open a window and get some fresh air in here?
Please?
Sam. Please.
All right. Here we go.
That's right, blow it out.
( gags and coughs )
( gagging )
( passing traffic )
( people chattering )
( distant music playing )
What is that, Lincoln Street?
Harrison.
I worked here over a year, and I never even
thought about what's outside that window.
I've worked here six.
It's from the tube. I'll take care of it.
Ten percent ethanol at 100cc's an hour.
You know, your booze works fast.
Mad Dog IV, just for you.
All this stuff, you know,
it's just blinders.
It's just a screen.
I don't want anything separating me
from what's happening.
I'm not gonna run and hide from this.
Pulse ox and dynamap can come off.
Last sat's 92.
My brother Lou died...
when we were kids.
My mom, she said...
Oh...
She said, "Charlie, Lou's gone away on a long trip."
Don't you just leave me here.
I want to see a doctor now.
Last B.P.'s 90/60.
When is my turn, huh?!
When's it going to be my turn?! Huh?!
People!
When is it?!
When is my turn?!
170...
91...
What are you saying?
It's your vitals.
Is it starting?
What, Charlie?
Am I going?
It's starting.
Don't you people have a system?
Isn't there any method at all?
Don't worry, you won't be alone.
Good.
That's good.
Someone will stay with you.
Sam, you got this?
Yeah.
Could you, um... touch me?
Sorry?
My face.
Please?
Maybe we should anchor.
What?
Do you think we should keep going?
I don't know, Charlie.
What about him?
What do you think he wants?
I don't know.
I don't think he knows.
Is it too late?
Not if you don't want it to be, Charlie.
( papers drop on floor )
Watch it!
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
( tapping )
I feel drunk again.
Yeah.
Thank you.
Okay, Mr. Metcalf,
we're going to keep a heart monitor on
and the alcohol drip for comfort.
Okay.
But I'm going to take you off the octreotide now
which is the last support measure.
Okay.
It shouldn't be long now.
Okay.
I never believed in God.
That might bite me in the ass now, huh?
God will get over it.
Do you need this? Can I take it?
Take it.
Take it.
What?
What can I take?
No, never mind. Never mind.
What's it going to be like there?
Peaceful.
Come back.
Charlie.
Charlie...
Get all my stuff?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
Make sure he gets it.
I will.
Yeah, and give this to him.
You never knew your dad.
No.
That's too bad.
I don't let it bother me.
I bet it bothers him.
Bobby.
Let me in.
Open up.
Let me in.
BOBBY ( whispering ): Charlie, can you hear me?
Charlie, can you hear me?
( quietly ): Hey, pally.
You made it.
Uh, how do I look?
( whispering ): You look okay.
I'm so sorry.
( breath quivering )
I'm so sorry.
( sniffling )
Oh, don't think about that.
Okay?
Just take it easy.
( quietly ): It's okay... son.
It's...
( heart monitor flatlines )
( sniffles )
Um...
( sniffles )
12:04.
Oh.
( Pratt sniffling )
I'll take that.
( sniffling )
( sighs )
Can someone just tell me that?
How much longer?
Ma'am, you need to wait in the room.
Oh. Let's go.
Well, it's about time.
You been with the same patient for almost 45 minutes.
Whatever happened to "treat 'em and street 'em" Pratt?
Do as I say, not as I do.
All right, well, the TV kid's back from X ray.
He's in triage with his dad and his sister.
Things go south?
He was a nice guy.
Just a drunk.
All right, well, there's pizzas over here if you get hungry.
Got you one with anchovies.
Oh, and the delivery guy got here at 12:04.
You know what that means?
It means he didn't make it on time.
No, it means lunch is on the house, my friend.
Hey, Jeremy,
little man, back so soon?
How are you doing? I'm Dr. Pratt.
Yeah, I'm the one who treated your son.
