Previously on ER:
What do you want me to call you?
How about you introducing me as "Abby."
You don't want people to know we're going out.
I'm Dr. Pratt.
Olivia Evans. I'm with Cease-Fire.
"Cease-Fire"?
Violence prevention program?
What's she like?
She's a health professional, Ray.
Don't be such a dog.
Where did this happen?
23rd. Wabash.
Uh, well, it-it was near the corner.
Did you file a police report?
What's the point?
She and her sister
panhandle out on Wabash.
I give 'em a buck once in a while.
I need this publication
for my chief resident application.
Trust me, Morris, it's going to take
a hell of a lot more than that.
Yeah, I called Syd and, no,
he doesn't have anything new to show us.
We need a new realtor.
He showed us 17 houses.
Not one of them even close.
You don't think the problem could be us, do you?
All right, what about this one? Nah.
You know, it just doesn't seem fair
to schedule it like that.
You work all night,
now you got to rush back, you're tired.
What do you mean, I'm tired?
Do I look like I'm tired?
Of course not.
No, you look chipper.
Oh, a smudge.
It's just you're worrying so much.
You know, they don't schedule tenure meetings
around the candidates.
Hey, at least you're over-thinking the wardrobe.
I am not worrying and I am not over-thinking.
You know, tenure means financial security--
we could get a house,
start a college fund for Cosmo.
What if Cosmo doesn't want to go to college?
What?!
Baby, I can go back to work.
I know.
And you can make more money
at a private hospital.
No, it's not about the money.
I want to be at County. It's where I belong.
Okay, I'm going to leave these here.
Promise me you'll step over them.
I promise.
All right, I got to go, baby.
I love you.
And you, too.
Oh, Susan...
All right, I have one meeting after this,
and then I will be home.
Susan... How do I look?
You look great except, uh...
Smudge!
( laughs )
( groans )
Jules Rubadoux, 85.
Who're you?
I'm Dr. Rasgotra.
You're a doctor?
You got a high school diploma?
85, fainted.
I did not faint. I was tripped.
It was witnessed.
Syncopal event at his bridge club,
unconscious 30 seconds.
Who told you that, those old geezers?
They're unconscious most of the day.
Must've been a long ride.
Oh, tell me about it.
Get out of here and bring back the omelet!
Now! Okay, we'll see what we can do.
Delirium, tachycardia, hyperthermia, mydriasis--
And it better not have spinach in it!
What does that make you think?
Don't try to get high
by snorting crushed antihistamines?
I hate spinach!
Come on, guys, this is classic.
Mad as a hatter, red as a beet...
Dry as a bone?
Anticholinergic toxicity.
Bingo. What's your plan?
I.V., tox screen,
activated charcoal.
Yes. What else?
EKG-- rule out cardiac effects.
Mm-hmm.
Ativan for the agitation.
Excellent. And what happens
if the delirium worsens despite benzos?
Physostigmine.
The only acetylcholinesterase inhibitor
that crosses the blood-brain barrier.
Everybody get that?
Where do I sign to get out of here?
We need to examine you first.
If I wanted help, I wouldn't come
to this place looking for it.
I want another hospital.
We're just going to check you out.
I don't want this place.
It won't take long.
And I don't want your doctors.
Dr. Carter, we need you. Okay.
Especially that one.
I don't want that one
anywhere near me.
He killed my wife!
Sam, what's the deal with my lymphoma guy?
CT was ready for him 40 minutes ago.
Oh, man, I totally spaced.
I'll go take him.
Uh, don't bother.
They've got a seizing ICU player up there.
Be backed up for awhile.
Okay. Oh! Crap! Sorry.
That was the Guatemalan blend.
I said I was sorry.
Come on, people.
Let's move some bodies.
Ray, transfer from the Seashore House
with fever and incontinence.
I got stuck with the last dump from the Shore.
Abby, I'll trade you-- whatever you get.
No, Ray, I don't think so.
Neela, 85 year-old with syncope.
This is the one you brought in.
The nasty guy that yelled at Carter?
Afraid so.
And as much as I hate doing this to you,
I'm outta here.
Exam Three.
And I've also served on the curriculum
and admissions committees for the last three years.
ANSPAUGH: We appreciate that.
We're also looking for excellence in teaching.
You've won the resident teaching award
three years running.
That's very impressive.
Almost seven years as an attending,
only four publications?
No original research? Nothing as first author?
I just submitted a review article on oligoanalgesia
and I have other studies lined up.
I'm just waiting to hear about the grants.
Emergency medicine's a broad smorgasbord.
Sometimes it's hard to find your niche.
Excuse me?
The university is willing to float junior faculty
for a few years, but...
But tenured attendings need
to demonstrate the ability to carry their own weight.
You mean bring in grant money.
Okay, my focus hasn't been research,
but I've spent the last seven years
becoming a very good clinician and teacher.
That's clear, Susan.
And we put a great deal of value on that.
Well, I don't want you to do anything
until I can talk to my own doctor, Stanley Obelmeyer.
Right. We have a call in to him.
Yeah? Well, Stanley's not going to like
what you guys are doing, prodding me here.
Mr. Rubadoux, I can't hear anything
while you're talking.
Well, you've been listening for five minutes.
You've been talking for five minutes.
Did anyone ever tell you you have a murmur?
A what? A murmur.
It's the sound of blood rushing through the heart.
You think I have that?
I'm pretty sure, yeah.
Oh, pretty sure?
Is that all you can say?
I'd like to run some tests.
What tests?
EKG, chest X ray.
Look, no offense,
but I don't want some nurse
calling the shots around here.
Mr. Rubadoux, I am not a nurse.
I am a doctor.
Well, you're not my doctor
and I'm not going to listen
to anything else
until I talk to him!
Okay.
Okay!
Geez.
I'm Dr. Pratt.
Can you take a deep breath for me, please.
Sat's 88 on a non-rebreather.
Is he dead? Is my husband dead?
He's right behind us.
The doctors are working on him.
He's alive! Whoa, whoa!
I'll get you next time, you son of a bitch!
Wife fired a couple of rounds to the chest and abdomen.
Pulse 133, BP 90 palp, went apneic in the rig.
Access?
Two large-bore IVs, got a liter en route.
Another day, another happy couple.
All right, on my count. One, two, three.
Two of versed right away.
Your husband stabbed you?
He cornered me in the kitchen, had a knife to my throat.
Ooh! Definite EtOH on board.
Have you been drinking, Mrs. Casey?
I didn't know what to do,
so I grabbed his gun from the kitchen drawer.
Decreased breath sounds on the right.
You have a collapsed lung.
I need to put in a tube to re-inflate it.
Sam, you were supposed to check
the airway boxes this morning.
I don't think so.
According to the schedule.
I thought it was Malik's turn.
All I know, we're out of eight-ohs in there.
Malcolm, who's sorry now, you bastard!
Chuny, what'd you do, take a vacation?
Not my fault
Sam didn't stock the shelves this morning.
Tube.
I can barely palpate a femoral.
Heart rate's up to 140.
Okay, hang the 0-neg
and call for type specific. Ray, he needs an IJ.
And a surgeon.
O.R. Three's on hold.
You got this? Uh-huh.
I need to check next door.
How's she doing?
Her lungs are down.
She's stable, but she's agitated.
Sam, where's that versed?
What are they doing in there?
I was getting it.
Okay, I was just right here.
I got it covered, Luka. Okay.
They better not send him home.
I'm changinq all the locks!
I'm not going to let him in!
Mary, Mary, you need to calm down
and answer some questions for me, okay?
Where are you?
Some hospital.
And what year is it?
2005.
Good. And where do you live?
West Garfield.
West Garfield?
Do you got a problem with that?
Bilateral crackles,
three over six,
harsh systolic murmur, JVD and the liver's down four centimeters.
You heard him.
He doesn't want to see me.
Why don't you present to Kovac?
Tied up in a trauma.
We're still waiting on a call from his doc
and the only way I got him to calm down
was by promising
to bring in an experienced physician--
which means an attending which means you.
Any cardiac history?
Chronic CHF and evidence of an old infarct.
HALEH: I sent off troponins.
I'll get an EKG when you're done.
ABBY: And did Obelmeyer call yet?
Uh-uh.
Hello, I'm Dr. Carter.
Don't worry, I remember your name.
Ten years, I don't forget.
I understand...
Do you remember my name--
Rubadoux?
It's a very unusual name.
You don't even remember.
And you don't remember my wife then, either, do you?
Just some other old person,
give 'em the old song and dance and ship 'em off.
Okay. Well, we're waiting to hear from your doctor,
so in the meantime...
I knew she didn't have much time left,
but why did you have
to put her through all that?
My sweet Sylvie,
keeping a smile
every step of the way.
Let's take a quick listen.
No, no, no, no, no. I want my own doctor.
Uh, Mr. Rubadoux,
he's the attending.
He has to examine you.
What do you mean, "has to"?
What, is there a law around here or rule
when you come into this place?
Yes, actually, there is.
All right, make it fast.
( wry laugh )
What was that about?
A very unsatisfied customer.
He needs an echo.
Yeah, I called Kayson. He's on it.
Radiology called about that kid
with the huge head-- hydrocepha... something.
Hydrocephalus. Yeah, I'll call neurosurg.
Even more of a handful now than before.
You remember him?
Don't let him get to you, Carter.
It was a long time ago, and you were just a student.
Dr. Lewis,
thought you were off.
What're you doing here?
Don't ask.
I've been paging you.
I was in a meeting, Jerry. I turned my pager off.
Got slammed with a double trauma,
so as long as you're here...
I'm not here!
The Chief Resident'' meeting
got changed to 3:30.
What?
That's why I've been paging you.
I just worked all night. I can't stay till 3:30.
( groans )
Rubadux?
Rubadoux, Sylvie.
How will this take?
Ten-year-old chart, could be a while.
I'll wait.
Certainly thinks highly of you.
Hmm. That's very flattering, coming from him.
Oh, and don't get me wrong, he was brilliant,
but he drove us crazy.
Made us do a full work-up on every single sniffle.
Well, that's my Dr. Obelmeyer,
nothing if not thorough.
Dilated left ventricle, gradient's 86.
Those calcifications?
Shh!
I'm listening to the doctor, please.
Ejection fraction's only 45.
But seeing as he presented
with both syncope and failure,
there's really only one option.
Mr. Rubadoux, you have critical aortic stenosis.
One of the valves in your heart has narrowed.
We have to operate to open that valve.
Operate?
Mm-hmm.
When?
As soon as possible.
Your heart's not generating enough force
to push blood through that constriction.
And you can do something about that?
We have to run a few tests, but yes, we can.
I'll talk to Anspaugh.
You check his BUN, creatinine and order PFTs.
Hang in there, Mr. Rubadoux.
Call me Ruby.
Ruby.
Hey, pretty lucky, huh?
Same school as my doc.
Nothing personal,
but they both have
a little bit more water under the bridge,
if you know what I mean.
I know what you mean.
Did you understand everything he said?
Yeah... Yeah, I-I need a heart operation.
Do you have any questions?
Heart surgery's a big deal.
I know that.
What am I, an idiot?
Well, do you also know that, given your age,
the risks of surgery are higher.
What risks?
Complications.
I need to get some more information
on your lung function and your kidneys.
I have something wrong with my kidneys?
No. I don't know. I don't know yet.
Yeah, well, why don't you come back when you're less confused?
Okay, Mr. Rubadoux,
I just want you to understand
that this surgery is very serious
and that we don't know yet
if you're even a good candidate
and that it's important you consider all of your options.
Listen, doll...
can you fix my heart?
No.
Then I'm going with the guy who can, all right?
Bye.
Prior MI, marginal ventricular function
and his creatine's 2.3.
He's 85.
He has significant coronary artery disease,
renal insufficiency and a history of COPD.
What do you think about his lungs?
We can go ahead and check his PFTs,
but he's an old guy, they're not going to be perfect.
Anything else you want us to do down here?
Send coags, have him typed and crossed.
Excuse me, I'm sorry.
Don't you think, just maybe,
open-heart surgery might not be such a good idea for this man?
Don't you think, just maybe, that's the surgeon's call?
Actually, no, I think it's the patient's call.
This guy could spend the rest of his life
on a beach in Miami or hooked up
to a ventilator here at County.
He wants the surgery, Dr. Lockhart.
She's just trying to advocate on behalf of her patient.
Well, the CICU's full. Mr. Rubadoux needs a bed.
Perhaps she could advocate for him up there.
Anspaugh's on his way down.
What?
So, how's it going in there?
I'll take a 12-year-old gangster
over a domestic violence case any day.
When she said she was from West Garfield,
I figured I should give you a call.
But I wasn't too sure,
if this was a Cease-Fire kind of thing.
Every shooting is
a Cease-Fire kind of thing.
And if she gets out of this mess,
there's a lot we could do for her.
I don't know, she seems pretty far gone to me.
How do you stay so optimistic?
How do you?
What, stay optimistic? I don't.
Three years in this place, I'm jaded as hell.
You just saw a drunk, battered woman
who shot her abusive husband
and saw some hope in the situation.
I did?
You wouldn't have called me
if you didn't think I could help.
I see right through you, Dr. Pratt.
Is that right?
We'll follow up with her after she's discharged.
Oh, so that's it? You're done?
For now.
Well, shouldn't you stick around?
I'm pretty sure she's bound to have more questions,
once the sedation wears off. I'm sure you can handle it.
Yeah, but the thing is, I don't know too much
about domestic violence counseling.
I would love to give you a lengthy tutorial
but I'm out of time.
How about later?
You can school me over dinner.
Pick me up at the office at 7:00.
( coughing ): Is this going to take long?
REBECCA: We already been here quite awhile.
We'll need to be going soon.
Well, you had a low-grade temperature
when the nurse took it earlier.
Beautiful girl.
REBECCA: Caramel skin.
Like a young June Allyson.
Maureen O'Sullivan.
Susan Hayward.
Ava Gardner. Myrna Loy.
Sophia Loren.
Sophia Loren?!
Okay, I heard some crackles on the right side,
which could be a sign of a lung infection.
You'll need to have a chest X ray.
Crackles?
The other doctor didn't say anything about crackles.
That's right.
You were in here over a week ago.
You saw Dr. Lockhart.
Lovely woman.
Like a young Patty Duke.
Your aortic valve, right here, is stiff and stuck shut.
What we're going do--
is we're going to cut out all the stenotic material
and replace it
with a porcine valve.
So its definite he's having surgery?
It is...
...isn't it?
I mean, it's...
It's the only way to go, right?
We could treat your condition with digoxin and diuretics,
but that would just be a short-term solution.
At this stage
of your disease,
surgery's the only definitive treatment.
Just so you know, Dr. Anspaugh, his FEV 1 is only 53%.
Thank you, Dr. Lockhart.
Make him NPO after midnight.
And don't his decreased lung capacity
and renal insufficiency strongly con...
What I mean is: shouldn't we be discussing the risks?
RUBADOUX: We talked about all that.
The risks, the complications,
the kidneys.
ANSPAUGH: And we're going to talk
about them again, Mr. Rubadoux.
Call me Ruby.
Will you excuse me for just a minute?
Certainly.
Dr. Lockhart.
I take it you have a problem
with Mr. Rubadoux's decision to have surgery.
I'm concerned it's not an informed decision, yes.
And is that because you failed to adequately explain the risks?
Do you think I would operate on this man
if he didn't fully understand the consequences?
Why would I do that?
Because I have nothing better to do tomorrow?
No, certainly...
If you have concerns,
you ask the consulting doctor to step outside.
You do not, in front of a patient,
attempt to subtly disagree with a senior cardiologist
and the Chief of Surgery.
That kind of behavior is helpful to no one.
Do you understand?
Yes.
I have concerns.
JAKE: Knowing you as well as I do,
I'm going to guess you really hate it when people do this.
Uh, with the "come from behind,
and put your hands over the eyes" thing?
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, words cannot express exactly how much I hate it.
Pretty cool that I knew that, don't you think?
Bad timing? Yes.
You want to talk about it? No.
So I'm back.
Oh, my God, Jake, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. How was San Francisco?
Amazing faculty, lots of O.R. time.
I thought Boston was first until I saw UCSF,
but, unfortunately, it's a long shot.
Well, they wouldn't have invited you
if they weren't interested.
Hey, Frank, where's Carter?
MRI. Thanks.
So... UCSF, huh?
Yes. I liked it.
But, you know, I still could match right here.
Yep.
What would happen
if I did that?
Well, Jake, then you'd be working at County.
Dirk Harmon, 14, crashed head-first into a retaining wall
while luging down Sheridan Road.
Luging?
Street luge. Don't you ever watch those guys on ESPN?
When do you watch ESPN?
Pulse 72, BP 112/65, sats 100.
What's up? I'm Dr. Pratt.
How fast were you going?
40, maybe 50.
All right.
Come on, you guys.
He was one of the top qualifiers at Super Mass.
But I'm really more into dual.
Where do you find hills big enough in Chicago? Luka.
You do snow too? Totally.
Hello, everyone! He just rammed his head into a wall.
Yeah! Yeah!
Hey, dude, my hands are numb.
Weird.
When did that start?
Just noticed it.
Pratt, hold the c-spine.
Let's move him carefully.
Hey, I need to talk to you about the Rubadoux thing.
Birdie Chaddock, 72-year-old female
with cough and low-grade temp.
Sats are fine,
no shortness of breath.
Right middle lobe infiltrate on the film.
She was your patient last week,
so, perhaps, for continuity of care...
She was in with the same thing?
No, she had facial contusions.
Her sister was with her?
Oh, yeah, she's here this time, too.
Okay, If she's got family support,
treat her like an outpatient, send her home.
They're panhandlers, both of them.
Everybody's got to make a living.
What is wrong with you?
She's not going to get better back out on the streets.
Why don't you call Social Services to come down.
Maybe they can hook her up
with elder assistance.
Now, they did express interest in leaving as soon as possible.
Call Social Services.
Okay, about Mr. Rubadoux--
nobody is painting him a clear picture.
Surgery is a lousy choice.
It's his choice.
He does not have an objective view.
17-year-old, avulsed finger.
Need you to sign so we can treat without the parents.
How'd he do it?
Slammed his hand in the car door.
Somebody needs to talk to him. You're his doctor.
You're the attending. And he's old school.
He needs to hear it from a guy.
It's that time again-- Girl Scout cookies.
And I'm feeling the pressure.
Okay.
Okay, I will find you later, all right? Just... Okay.
What is going on with you?
Why do you keep blowing this off? I'm not blowing this off.
You just tried to stop our conversation again
to buy Girl Scout cookies.
You need to talk to this guy.
I'm not the one to do it.
Okay, I don't know exactly what went on
between you and him, but right now...
Okay, look, Abby, every once in awhile
you're going to find one of these old guys
who would rather be treated
by a gray-haired guy with a white coat.
And you have to figure out a way of getting through to them.
I have been trying to do that for over an hour.
This guy's a wall.
Well, then you did your job.
Move on.
Dr. Lewis?
( louder ): Dr. Lewis?
Yes, Jerry?
Are you sleeping?
( saw buzzing )
Probably not, huh?
The chief residency meeting is starting.
Thank you, Jerry.
Are you really up?
Because I have to leave now.
Yes, Jerry.
( saw buzzing )
1800 of solumedrol, going in.
What have you got?
Keep your eyes closed, Dirk.
Traumatic C-spine injury,
I didn't want to just yank the helmet off.
Pretty cool, huh?
Dude, one move,
they'll slice right through your head.
Shut up, man, this is gnarly.
Compared to the Gravity Games,
this is nothing, man.
Except for a little cord compression.
Anybody seen Carter?
No, he's probably at the chief residency meeting
which is where Luka and I are supposed to be.
Anspaugh wants a central line
on our aortic stenosis patient.
Pratt, go help Abby. I'll finish that.
Okay. Sterile nines and prep for acordis.
Nice suit, Morris.
Thank you.
It's important for the Chief Resident
to project a certain... professionalism.
And I must say, life in the ER
doesn't offer enough opportunity to dress up.
Sorry I'm late.
You haven't missed anything.
Dr. Lewis, if you don't mind...
The lights, please.
( clears throat )
The Chief Resident in a busy urban ER
must wear many hats:
teacher, mentor, counselor, friend.
( clears throat )
Over the course of the next hour...
Hour? I will review my proposed strategy
for making the Resident's schedule
and address how the new ACGME/ RRC work-hour mandates apply.
I will also identify common stumbling blocks
that may affect a schedule
and present my patented
"win-win" approach to problems and changes.
Next slide.
Whoa, you can't just leave.
Oh, yes, at our age, we can.
I'm sorry that Social Services is backed up,
but we actually need them to see you before you go.
We saw them the last time we were here.
Lovely woman.
Oh, a regular young...
No, no, God, no, please.
Please, just...
Dr. Barnett, we are grateful
and we're going to do the best we can,
but it's important that we leave now.
Don't cannot miss the rush hour
at the el.
And if we got you into any trouble.
I'm so sorry.
We could write you a note.
I... a note?
It's just not going to be good enough.
You see...
last week, two of my other patients, they left on me,
and my boss is really unhappy with me.
Oh? Mm-hmm.
And he says if this ever happens again,
they're going to send me to...
Away?
Well, to... the morgue.
The morgue.
Yeah.
It's a big demotion.
He's clever. Oh, yeah.
You got to give him that.
Page me from MRI, I want to see the scan.
Sam, what's going on?
Nothing.
I'm cleaning up and restocking.
This about luge boy?
I can't believe you were encouraging him.
I wasn't.
Pratt and Ray, that I can understand.
Sam, I wasn't. And you're overreacting.
( laughs )
A little bit?
Oh...
I'm just having a bad day.
I have a headache.
Just... hey, just tell them you want to leave early.
I'm fine.
No, really, just tell them you want to go home,
and if there are any complaints, they can talk to me, okay?
Okay.
Okay.
I'm okay.
Okay, aim your needle inferiorly
and watch the screen as you enter the vein.
How we doing, Mr. Rubadoux?
I don't know,
you tell me.
You're doing just great.
Got a flash.
Guide wire.
( alarm beeping )
What's that? What's going on?
It's okay, Mr. Rubadoux.
Throwing PVCs. Pull back.
( alarm beeping )
Run of V-tach. Abby, come on, pull back.
I am, I'm nowhere near the myocardium.
I don't feel right.
( alarm beeps ) V-tach again.
All right, I'm coming out.
What's happening?
Hang in there, Mr. Rubadoux.
A hundred of lido.
Mr. Rubadoux...
Mr. Rubadoux...
All right, let's get him into a trauma room right now.
Come on, let's go.
With the Morris Modified Circadian Scheduling System,
we can build some much-needed flexibility into the program.
A sample sequence might go like this:
three days, two off, three evenings, two off,
three nights, two... ( pager beeps )
911. It's the ER.
Liar.
Morris, I apologize.
I'll put a hard copy of
the presentation in your box.
Yeah, that'd be great.
WEAVER: Get on with it, Dr. Morris.
Uh, three nights, two off,
and repeat until the end of the block.
Next slide.
Good news, Social Services...
Hello.
Hi.
This is our niece Shelley.
I just found out they were here.
Thank you for taking care of them.
We wanted to leave, didn't we, Doctor?
Yes, we did try, right?
You made us stay.
Yes, I did.
So now Shelley's here, we can go with her.
Oh, no, no, no. You have to wait...
Could we talk?
Oh, yes, go ahead. That's fine.
Okay.
Listen, we're waiting on Social Services
to come down here.
Yes, and they're wonderful, they've been so helpful.
But, you know, it's been such a long day
and they're both, they're really getting tired.
It shouldn't be too much longer.
They're both so stubborn, those two.
I've been trying to get them to move in with me.
You know, they just, they want their independence,
so they can panhandle. Isn't that unbelievable?
Yeah.
I told them that I could get them right home,
into a hot bath--
our oldest moved in with her boyfriend,
we've got the extra bedroom now.
( stammering ): I've tried everything.
I don't know what else to do.
I don't know how to make them accept
some family support.
Okay, let me talk to them, all right?
Okay.
Birdie, Rebecca...
Still V-tach.
All right, another epi, chase it with lido.
All right. Switch out.
Set up to intubate.
What happened?
Anspaugh wanted a central line.
It was going fine till he started having runs of V-tach.
Must have an irritable myocardium.
360, clear.
No change.
Why's Anspaugh even opening this guy up?
Critical A.S.
Epi's in.
Move that. The man can't tolerate
a central line, he sure as hell
isn't going to do well in the O.R.
He wants the surgery. So what?
So, we're giving it to him. Those guys upstairs got nothing better to do?
Oh, damn it.
I think I broke his rib.
All right, clear.
Normal sinus.
That's what I'm talking about, Mr. Rubadoux.
The Chief Resident position is 90% administrative.
Morris can handle that.
Yeah, but even the med students think he's a joke.
Maybe we should get someone from the outside.
That's very difficult on the staff.
You came from the outside.
How'd the Morris meeting go?
Oh, you just missed a fascinating lecture
on circadian scheduling.
We're not giving it to him, though, right?
We're considering it.
Are you out of your mind?
Hey, if you don't show up to the meetings...
I was stuck in a trauma.
What did Carter say? Maybe we should vote.
You can't vote. You weren't there.
Uh, I don't care.
I've been on 36 hours, I have to go home.
And I'm late.
John, what happened in that Morris meeting?
I don't know, I left.
Kerry's leaning towards him.
Yeah, well, okay.
"Well, okay"?
We've had worse.
No, I don't think so.
Well, then maybe she won't give it to him.
Hey, Frank, can you come and find me
when the labs are back on Gase in Two.
Yeah, got it.
You were gonna take that haggard mom, five kids, Exam Three.
Rubadoux's back to baseline, he's complaining
about his chest tube and telling the nurses, "No Jell-O."
Good.
And I told Kayson and Anspaugh about the broken ribs
and the resultant pneumothorax.
What about the surgery?
Not right away.
They're going to stabilize him in CICU
for a few days, let the pneumo resolve,
but everyone remains hopeful.
Just waiting on a bed.
Can I help you?
Yeah, how you doing, man?
I'm looking for Olivia Evans.
Supposed to meet her here.
She's in the back.
Follow me.
Okay.
WOMAN: ...and three grandmothers
reclaimed the corner of 78th and Hermitage
by opening a bakery.
Turned one of the roughest corners
in our city into a coffee klatch.
( applause )
Dr. Pratt, just in time.
Everyone, this is Greg Pratt,
he's an ER doc at County.
( all greeting )
How y'all doing?
Dr. Pratt gets to see firsthand
how senseless shootings
are overwhelming our city's hospitals,
and we were just talking about
various job opportunities in the neighborhood,
so maybe you'd like to say something
about jobs in healthcare?
Um...
( chuckles )
Felix, get back here!
This is for Tasha's ear infection,
twice a day for a week.
Holly's the one with the ears.
Right, uh,
Tasha has the eczema.
Apply to the affected area three times a day for a week.
Just like the ears.
Uh, no. Ears twice a day. Rash, three.
Found him.
He was running off with your hammer.
Thanks, Chuny.
Give me that. No give me.
Just a minute.
( kids shouting )
I'm going to go.
I thought I'd say good night.
Could use a little help over here.
One, two,
three, four, five.
I'm off.
I'll be home by 8:00, want to grab dinner at Intermezzo?
I'm kind of beat, let's just stay in tonight.
Okay, see you later.
Good night.
Coffee?
Yup.
Sorry to hear it.
Really awful this time of night. Oh, I know.
When I was a student on my surgical rotation,
Rubadoux's wife was very sick.
She was part of this research study.
When her results, um...
when she was no longer useful,
there was a lot of pressure to get her out, so I did.
I dumped her into a nursing home.
Did she belong in one?
We all figured she'd end up back in the hospital,
but she'd be on the medical service
and not ours.
So?
Surgery dumps another patient on medicine.
Happens every day.
I told Rubadoux that, um, she was going to get better.
I told him that her situation was going to improve.
I told him what he wanted to hear.
You know, when you're a student...
you know, you're so desperate for approval,
you want everybody to like you.
You want your patients to like you,
you want their families to like you.
You got to be efficient, too, though.
You got to impress your superiors.
Yeah, you don't have to tell me,
I'm still on the bottom rung of the ladder.
I mean, when the Chief of Surgery
says get rid of her, you get rid of her.
Yeah.
And then she came back about three days later,
and she died and...
Rubadoux was so surprised.
I don't know.
Ultimately, it was the attending's call.
It wasn't my responsibility.
You want to help with this?
Take it easy, man.
You, too, man. All right.
One of my guys has a real thing for science.
Maybe I could bring him down to County sometime,
have you show him around? Sure.
Some of these kids have never been out
of the neighborhood. They don't realize
there's a big city out there.
Yeah, I know what you mean.
I was ten years old before I saw Lake Michigan.
You're from Chicago? Mm-hmm.
Any relation to, uh, Charlie Pratt?
Charlie Pratt who works
for Parks and Recs over on Lamont?
Yeah, the older fellow.
No, I don't know him.
Hey, that was
a really nice meeting tonight.
I gotta run.
Oh. Okay.
It's nice meeting you.
You, too.
You're still speaking to me?
Yeah, I think so.
Because I'm not sorry.
I wanted you to come and see what we do
'cause you never come on your own.
And I'm not apologizing
about the tuna casserole,
but since you're being such a good sport,
I'm willing to buy dessert.
So... ice cream or Key lime pie?
I'm sorry, what?
Dessert?
Um...
Past your bedtime?
No, no, it's just that, uh...
I have this patient I have to check
back on in the ER.
Well, then, um, I guess... I guess you better be going.
I'll call you.
$15.95.
Where you going, Ray?
Look, I know I'm on for another half-hour,
but I have taken care of everything.
I filled in Abby on all my cases.
Is Abby your attendant?
Right.
Uh, ulnar fracture
up getting casted in ortho,
malignant otitis admitted to ENT,
tongue lac wants a vasectomy--
you know, as long as he's down here--
going to follow up with urology.
Oh, and the Olsen twins,
they decided to leave with their niece
and a z-pack, follow up in a week.
What did Social Services say?
They actually didn't make it down.
I mean, in time.
But you released them anyway?
I felt comfortable they had a strong family support system.
These are the panhandlers, right?
Mm-hmm.
But you felt comfortable
releasing them to a family member,
who obviously hasn't been that much of a help so far.
Their niece, yes, she has admitted that it's been
a hard time getting them to accept her help,
but they are moving in with her now.
And is Social Services going to do a follow-up?
I mean, seeing as how
you prevented them
from doing their job today.
I will make those arrangements.
I need to know everything about your patients.
I need to know the status of every single one of them.
I need to know how they are,
where they are, where they're going,
why they're going.
You're still an intern, Ray.
I'm the attending.
I'm responsible.
I'm... sorry.
FRANK: Hernia guy's HMO
is refusing to cover admission.
He's not stable for transfer, I'm not discharging him home.
You want to tell them that? I'll call them.
Conscious sedation for Mr. Garrity.
Kovac was there. He can sign. Okay.
You won't believe this,
but your tibial fracture is requesting an organic cast.
I'll be right there.
Mr. Rubadoux?
I'm not feeling well, so, if you don't mind...
I just wanted to... say that I'm sorry.
I couldn't believe it when I saw you.
You're still here.
Been ten years since my... my Sylvie's gone
and you're still here.
Yeah.
Huh. And you didn't even remember.
Oh, well.
( deep sigh )
They gave me six other doctors, so...
I won't need you this time.
I made a mistake with your wife.
And I made a mistake with you.
You don't think I know that?
Huh?
You don't think
I regret ever bringing my poor Sylvie down to this damn place?
You and your fancy tests:
"We'll put her through this, we'll put her through that.
"Oh, Sylvie?
"Well, she'll practically
be back on stage, dancing again."
Well, we did try.
You tried? You tried?!
It became a very complicated situation.
And I didn't have the experience
to handle it properly.
All you had to be was a human being.
You lied to me.
And I believed you.
My Sylvie, my Sylvie...
she was really something.
Mr. Rubadoux...
...what you have wrong with you-- aortic stenosis--
can oftentimes be corrected with surgery.
But that doesn't mean
that that's the right thing for you to do.
You're 85 years old,
you have chronic respiratory problems.
The chances of you coming through this surgery
and getting back to the shape
that you're in right now, pretty slim.
If you go ahead with it,
there is a good chance that you will never
leave this hospital again.
You'll be connected to a ventilator
and you will live out the remainder of your life
in the intensive care unit.
Now, without the surgery,
it's true you're not going to get any better,
but I believe that you will
leave this hospital under your own power,
and you will have more time with the people that you love.
You will have more time...
being the person that you are today.
And, yes, ten years ago, I lied to you about your wife.
But I am not lying to you right now.
