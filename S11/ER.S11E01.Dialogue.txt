Previously on ER...
Who did you match?
University of Michigan- Ann Arbor.
Are you withdrawing from this residency program?
Your Honor... I love my son.
You'll be notified of my decision.
Alex and I have to leave.
What? I'm sorry.
I don't want to go!
We have to say good-bye to our son.
( cries )
I can't get in touch with my mom.
The phone ain't working or something.
So, what, you need a ride?
Hey, jack-off!
Try paying attention to the road!
What's your problem, man? Get outta here.
Pay attention to this.
Oh, nice.
All right, we're outta here.
See you, suckers!
PRATT ( laughing ): Feel that hemi power, baby.
It's a beautiful thing!
CHEN: Slow down!
There. Everybody happy now?
Okay, good.
Greg...
( screaming ) Son of a bitch!
He's shooting at us! Get down!
Come on. Hold on!
We got to get out of here.
Hold on!
Where is he?
Let's go. Hold on.
We've got to get away from him!
( screams )
Get away from him!
There he is! Watch out! Get down!
Damn it.
Get away from him!
Where is he?!
( screams )
Oh! My leg!
Are you hit?
I'm shot.
Oh... Don't worry. Where is he?
( screams ) Watch it! Watch it!
( groaning ): Oh, God...
Greg... Greg...
I think I broke a rib.
ELGIN: Somebody help me... please.
All right, man, I'll be right there, man.
Don't worry.
Where are we?
We're in the river.
Can you get out of that seat belt? Uh-uh, no. It hurts.
I can't move.
Come on, we gotta get out.
Elgin, come on, man,
we gotta get out of the car.
I can't feel my legs.
( groans )
Here, take my hand.
Come on, take it. I'll pull you out.
I can't.
Come on, man, squeeze my hand.
Squeeze it.
I really can't.
( groaning ): Oh, Greg,
I can't get this belt off.
The kid might have a cervical cord injury.
I'm gonna call for... aah!
Oh, my leg!
Hello? Yes. Please help us.
We're in a car that crashed into the Chicago River
near, uh, uh... Franklin.
It's wet. I'm-I'm getting wet.
( groans )
Hey.
Yeah, there's three of us in here.
Critically injured.
Please hurry, we're sinking.
ELGIN: Why is there water?
I don't want to die, man.
All right, I'm coming, man.
( groans )
It's getting deeper.
I'll be right there, Elgin.
Don't worry.
Okay... Come on, duck under this.
( groans )
Oh. I can't.
Yes, you can. Come on, baby.
You have to. Come on.
Come on.
Come on. ( groans )
Yes. Get under there.
Good job. Good job.
Good job. Okay.
Okay.
ELGIN: Doc...
What?
How come I can't move?
Looks like you hurt your neck.
We think it might be broken.
( startled yelling )
CHEN: What's happening?
The weight of the engine takes the front end down first.
CHEN: Oh, God. I'm coming, man.
Oh, God.
PRATT: All right.
It's not fair.
Every intern gets a vacation
and I'm stuck with the last overnight.
Maybe it's 'cause you called in sick, like, 50 times.
I have Epstein-Barr, okay?
It's not my fault they haven't found a cure.
Damn shame... Uh-huh.
...that we have to listen to you whine all night.
Who's the attending?
Schedule says "Lewis," but she's on maternity leave.
Maybe it'll be somebody cool who'll let me out early.
Kovac or Carter.
Just as long as it is not...
Morris!
Bingo!
15 minutes into your shift,
and you haven't picked up a single patient?
I was... I was doing sign-outs.
From who, Colonel Sanders? Go.
Where's Carter?
Finishing up a lac. Kovac?
Left a couple hours ago.
WEAVER: In the middle of his shift?
Said he had to go.
Nice suit. Job interview?
PRATT: Ready: one, two, three-- up.
Okay, Elgin, try not to move your head.
I-I'm cold.
Look, Elgin...
when we roll down that window
we got to swim out of here.
I don't think I can swim.
I'll stay with you, all right?
Greg...
Jing-Mei, you'll be fine.
Now, look, when I open up this window,
you push out and I'll pull Elgin out behind you.
All right?
All right, I got his neck.
All right, everybody hold their breath, okay?
Deep breath.
( groans ): Oh, damn it.
What's wrong?
Power windows.
I need to pee.
You're gonna like Louisville.
They have, uh, the Kentucky Derby,
the Ohio River, hush puppies.
Can I go in the bushes?
Here we go.
ALEX: Have you been?
What? Louisville.
Have you ever been there?
Hey, it doesn't look half bad.
Hey, look, they even have a pool.
( gasping, grunting )
( groans )
( panting )
It-It's stuck.
We're sinking.
You have to wait for the water pressure to equalize.
What? Physics class.
When the water gets high enough in the car,
you'll be able to open the door easy.
( groaning )
You got to wait, man.
( groans )
You got to wait.
CHEN: What was that?
Bottom of the river.
Now what?
Well, I guess we wait.
( soft groan )
( panting )
( bell dings )
TAGGART: Hello?
Hello?
WOMAN ( on TV ): Going somewhere?
BOY: I was sleepwalking.
Hello?
Can't you beat that?
Look at this, Ma. I'm fully dressed.
Hello?
I couldn't understand a word of it.
( laughter on TV )
WOMAN: Sit down.
Hi.
Uh, can I get a room, please?
Just the two of you?
Yeah.
How many nights?
Uh, just one. Passing through.
WOMAN: You had a simple punishment...
You folks on vacation?
No.
You better call the police.
She's kidnapping me.
Alex, cut it out.
Kids.
I want you get to ready to open the door
and push out to the surface.
I'll pull out Elgin after you.
Greg, I don't think I...
Just do it! Just do it.
All right, Elgin...
I want you to take a deep breath
and blow it out on the way up, all right?
Okay.
All right, go, Jing-Mei. Go, baby, go!
( inhaling deeply )
( panting )
All right, big man, you ready? Yeah.
All right, take a deep breath...
Deep breath.
( both inhale deeply )
( gasping, groaning )
Oh! Oh!
Hey!
Hey! Hey!
MAN: Starboard side.
Two o'clock!
Oh, please, help me!
( groans )
Grab the ring, ma'am!
Oh...!
Is there anybody else in the car? Two more.
( groans )
( pained groan )
( groaning, gasping loudly )
Over here!
Over here!
We got somebody down here!
Come on, right here.
Oh, hey, where's Elgin?
I couldn't get him out.
He got stuck on the door!
Hey, there's somebody else.
( panting )
I got to go back down there and get him.
Divers will get him. Sir!
He's paralyzed. He can't move.
We don't need any more victims! Get in the boat!
Get in the damn boat!
Gored by a deer antler. Admitted to ortho.
You call Animal Control?
No, no-- he fell when he was trying
to hang it on his mantle.
And a woman got her glaucoma drops
mixed up with her Super-Glue.
Ouch. Nice of you
to grace us with your presence, Luka.
Family emergency. I'm back now.
I don't need you now. Go home.
I still owe you a couple of hours.
This is not a co-op.
Next time you decide to leave
in the middle of a shift,
don't bother coming back.
Frank, call nursing admin.
Tell them Sam won't be working tomorrow.
Or any other day.
Family emergency.
He doesn't even have a family.
WEAVER: Is that it?
Uh-huh.
You look nice.
You have another court date?
Yup.
How'd that go? Okay.
MAN: She's lying.
WOMAN: I am not!
Good luck, huh?
MAN: She's a drug dealer.
Tiffany James-- foreign body in the vagina.
She tucked her stash up there when we busted her.
No problem. I can fish it out.
You'll do no such thing.
Are you having any pelvic or abdominal pain?
I feel fine.
This is not a medical emergency.
So I can leave?
Sit your ass back down.
Doing a pelvic exam without consent is assault.
This guy said he would.
Hey, Luka!
Something going on with Sam?
She left.
She left? She left to go where?
I have no idea.
Did she take Alex?
Is she coming back?
I don't know, I... I don't think so.
You okay?
Yeah.
Say goodbye to Kem for me, will you?
Frank, they need X-ray in two.
Haven't you heard?
New interns don't start till tomorrow.
It's my last nursing shift.
I'm finally getting out of here.
You ready for it?
FRANK: I had the doctor up my Xanax.
Abby...
Hey, what are you doing here?
I thought you were in Michigan.
You get kicked out already?
MALIK: County. Meet me on Two-Bravo.
You got time to grab some coffee or something?
No, I have to get some sleep.
I'm back on at 6:00. What's going on?
Nothing, except I may have just
thrown away my medical career.
I don't care what your captain says,
we do not do strip searches!
Come on, Doc, give me a break.
The jail nurse won't do pelvics.
That's your problem. Not mine.
MALIK: Yo, Dr. Weaver.
Multi-victim T.C.
How many criticals can we take?
Start with three. What is it?
Auto versus pole and pedestrians
and another car in the river.
Who's still on?
You and Morris.
Carter left and you sent Kovac home.
Abby, can you stay?
No, I-I-I...
Good.
Somebody go find Morris!
He's probably hiding in the bathroom again
staring at Maxim.
PRATT: How you doing?
( Chen moans )
Did they get Elgin out?
I'll be right behind you, okay?
They need to get a collar on you, Doc.
I'm fine.
How come they're not bagging him?
Doc, you need a collar.
Is he alive?!
I don't know.
OFFICER ( over radio ): Confirming recovery
of a third body.
Stand by.
Why aren't they doing CPR?
PB 49, any vitals on that third victim?
( over radio ): Not at this time.
I'm sorry.
Oh, you just left?
After I spoke to the director.
Excuse me. Where do we sign in?
He was at a birthday party.
Always has to be the joker.
What did you put up there?
LEDs.
He was supposed to just wear them on his clothes.
Triage nurse, straight ahead.
You know, you were only there a couple of hours.
You need to give it more time than that.
DUMAR: Auto versus utility pole.
Decent vitals, probable dislocated hip.
Give me something for the pain, man!
WEAVER: Morris, reduce the hip!
Ten of MS, slow IV push.
Pedestrian with multiple lacs
from jumping out of the way.
I can take him. No.
Lily, put him in Three.
I can still suture.
You're no longer a student.
You're not covered to practice medicine here.
You want to stay, you observe!
That's it!
Car flew into the river. Probable broken ribs.
Tachycardia. GSW to the left leg.
Jing-Mei?
ABBY: Oh, my God.
What happened? CHEN: Road rage.
A guy shot at us.
Is the abdomen okay?
Pleuritic chest pain.
PRATT: Get me off this damn backboard!
Pratt was the driver.
All right, you start with Pratt,
I'll stay with Jing-Mei. Show me a C-spine!
PRATT: This is so stupid! I'm fine!
NEELA: Bad scalp lac.
And he's combative.
I'm not combative!
I'm just pissed off that you tied me down!
Come on! Get back in there!
Morris, move him to sutures.
Got it!
Let's go, we need the room!
MORRIS: Dr. Chen?
That's the guy. That's the guy that shot at us.
PRATT: I want to sign out AMA.
You can't, Pratt. You're a trauma patient
with a head injury.
One, two, three...
First day labs, C-spine, chest and pelvis, and a head CT.
Would you stop it? I don't need all of that.
CHEN ( gasping ): It's getting harder to breathe.
MALIK: Pulse ox is 89.
Up her to five liters.
PRATT: How's she doing?
Probable sternal fracture.
Don't wait for the X ray.
If there's decreased breath sounds, put in a chest tube.
NEELA: Open your mouth.
( screams )
Is her pain on the left or the right side?
Keep your mouth open so I can check your pharynx.
Thought you weren't supposed to be doing anything.
You're a resident, no one's gonna care if I kill you-- Open.
CHEN: I'm feeling dizzy.
BP's 90 palp. She could have tamponade.
Shut up, Pratt!
Hello? Can I get a doctor?
What? What is it? What?!
Flaccid paralysis of both arms and legs.
Divers fished this dude out of the river.
Is that Elgin?
Elgin Gibbs. Is he alive?
Tubed him but he has a pulse.
Elgin was with you?
Abby, check him out.
You're a doctor now? No, my internship starts tomorrow.
I just advanced your residency
start date 12 hours.
Go. Now you're an intern. What? You want
an engraved invitation? Go, go, go!
Hey, and keep your eye on him.
Make sure he doesn't get up.
Both toes are up-going.
Solumedrol, 30 per kilo of bolus.
Abby, what do we have?
High cervical cord injury.
Starting steroids.
Who's the resident on the case?
That would be me.
Early bird catches the worm.
Fine cuts through the C-spine.
Set up for Gardner-Wells tongs.
WEAVER: Good alignment.
No fractures. You can take him off the board.
About time.
How you doing, Greg?
I'm fine.
GCS is 15, abdomen is benign.
How's Elgin, the spinal-cord-injury kid?
There's no blood in the belly.
Four of morphine and sew this up.
I'll get Morris to do it.
Morris?! No, screw that, I'll do it myself.
PVC's.
100 of lido, open the crash cart.
He could be accumulating blood in the pericardium.
We need a stat echo-- run in a liter of saline.
How the hell did this happen?
Some kind of hit-and-run.
They caught the guy, he's next door.
Any JVD or muffled heart sounds?
Dr. Pratt... Check for pulsus paradoxus.
Back off, Pratt, or I'll check
your rectal tone with my crutch.
Somebody has to call my house.
My dad's nurse.
Her name's Marie...
Both lungs are up.
I was supposed to take over at 9:00.
She needs to stay longer.
Mediastinum appears normal.
GSW to the left leg. She barely has pedal pulses.
Did I transect the artery?
CORDAY: Order an angiogram.
We need to check compartment pressure.
Okay, she's bradying down.
WEAVER: Amp of atropine.
MARQUEZ: Dr. Weaver, Abby needs you now.
NEELA: For Elgin?
Prep the entire leg, open a cut-down tray.
Some guy named Eduardo on line two.
Says he's Sandy Lopez' brother.
Sounds upset.
Wait, wait, wait, is Henry okay?
Who? My son.
I don't know. He didn't say. Well, go find out.
Doc, we're getting a judge to issue
a body cavity search warrant. Good for you.
How much longer is it going to be?
LOCKHART: He dropped his pressure.
I ordered two units of O neg.
Dr. Weaver, my wife is in the car
and has some questions. I'm kind of busy here.
Henry's fine, but this Eduardo
still wants to talk to you.
ABBY: I think he has decreased breath sounds
on the left. I agree.
You don't work here anymore.
FRANK: He wants to meet with you as soon as possible.
He says it's important.
Take a message. BP is only 80.
What's the hemocue?
11 point three.
Okay, good breath sounds.
It's spinal shock.
Dopamine at ten mikes.
You don't think a chest tube?
No. Re-check the hemocue.
It needs time to equilibrate.
If it's not dropping, he's not bleeding.
I'll be with Chen.
I should try and call his mother.
What size suture you using?
Four-oh nylon.
Morris, I shave my melon, man.
Go with the five-oh, minimize the scar.
CORDAY: Compartment pressure is 42.
I've lost the pulse.
Kerry, Abby's doing a thoracotomy.
What?!
Who's getting a thoracotomy? Elgin?
Aorta's clamped. More suction.
Are you out of your mind?
LOCKHART: He was coding.
I told you he didn't even need a chest tube.
He had three liters of blood in his chest.
What?
You want the cell saver? WEAVER: Yes.
Mrs. Gibbs, this is Neela Rasgotra
from County General Hospital.
Your son Elgin was in a car accident tonight.
It's pretty serious.
When you get this message,
can you come to the Emergency Room and ask for me?
It was a machine.
Last one.
Beautifully averted and well approximated.
You are definitely a lightweight when it comes to morphine.
C.T.'s ready.
Okay. Greg, time to wake up.
Greg.
Greg, come on.
Oh, crap, he's got a blown pupil.
Intubation tray, 20 of etomidate, 100 of sux.
Should I get Dr. Weaver?
Get the head down.
Soon as we tube him,
I want 80 of Mannitol.
I need suction and an end tidal C02 detector.
Here we go.
Charge to 30 again.
Asystole.
WEAVER: How much O-neg has he had?
MARQUEZ: Eight units.
CORDAY: Ruptured the proximal aorta.
FFP and platelets are here.
What about a side biting clamp?
There's nothing left to bite.
Are you done?
Stop compressions.
Pratt's herniating.
CORDAY: What?!
We need to close his chest.
His mother's coming.
I don't want her to have to see him like this.
Keep the head at 30 degrees
and his MAP in the 90's.
Hyperventilate? To a PCO two of 30.
Morris? Epidural bleed.
Mannitol's on board. He was awake and alert.
Classic presentation with a lucid interval. It's a skull fracture.
Probably tore the middle meningeal artery.
Abby, call the O.R., tell them
we need an ICP monitor.
Hello.
Hey, you ready?
Sorry, I got stuck with a sick kid.
I called the restaurant.
They can take us at 9:30.
Let me throw on a clean shirt--
I'll be ready to go.
Maybe we could just stay home
and watch a movie.
Sure.
How does Thai food sound?
The, uh... take-out menus
are in the kitchen top drawer, yeah?
The good news is the pupil went down with Mannitol.
The bad news is Greg needs surgery
and he might have long-term brain damage.
So it's wait and see?
Yeah.
So what happened in Michigan?
Can we maybe talk about it tomorrow?
Sure.
You should go home and get some rest.
Go on, I can finish this.
I'll stay.
You start in a few hours.
I think I started tonight.
Go. Really.
I'm okay.
You don't have privileges here anymore, remember?
Don't think I'm going to be sued for missing a suture
on a dead boy's chest.
Go.
I'll wait for his mother.
We'll talk tomorrow?
Hi... this is Sam.
Leave a message after the beep. Bye.
KOVAC: Has he woken up yet?
Not as of 6:00 a.m.
With all the trauma, the board's a mess.
PICU can take the baby up after change of shift.
Two more messages from that Eduardo guy.
He's persistent.
Where do you want the fresh meat?
Interns? Right there.
Ray. Ray Barnett.
Luca Kovac.
Are you Dr. Weaver?
Yeah. Sorry, I've been up all night.
You could've fooled me.
Howard Ritzke.
WEAVER: Orientation's in the second floor
auditorium at 8:00 a.m. with the new house staff.
And the elevator's that way, right?
Thank you.
So, we come back here at what time?
Whenever you're through.
Here's the labs on the baby.
Out of here.
That explains it.
All right, I gotta go. I've got an appointment.
Sorry, my alarm didn't go off.
How are Pratt and Chen?
In surgical ICU. They're both stable.
Good.
Did the other interns go upstairs already?
They did, but you've been excused.
What?
I have a few pass-ons for you from last night.
I don't have to go to my orientation?
You have an I.D.
You know where the bathrooms are.
All you need is a lab coat.
Welcome to County, Dr. Lockhart.
Excuse me. You a doctor?
Yes, I am.
Sara's stool tested positive for botulism toxin.
What?!
Will she get better?
It can take a month.
A month on the breathing machine?
She needs oxygen and tube feedings
until her muscles recover.
How could she get botulism?
The spores can be present in honey, corn syrup...
She doesn't get that stuff.
I cook and puree everything for her myself, by hand.
Honey?
What?
Oh... Damn it, Jeffrey.
You don't give honey to a baby.
How am I supposed to know that?
It was in the book. You never read the book?
Why don't we all just...
You gave me four books.
I do the diapers, the bottles, the cleaning, the shopping...
Excuse me, do you know anything about a search warrant?
We're not doing it.
It was one book, and I told you
which book... Hey, it's not like I want to be doing this!
I know you're both upset, but...
The only reason why I am working
is 'cause you lost yet another job
because you can't control your damn temper!
Good luck.
Look, I was up all night finding a judge to get that warrant
Yeah, yeah. Where does it say that we have to do the search?
Wait a minute. You want me to go back to get a court order
to compel you to do the search?
If we start doing cavity searches for the cops,
word's gonna get out
and people are gonna be afraid to come here.
Who? Drug-dealing hookers?
Fine! I'll get the order!
You refuse that, I'll arrest you.
( man coughing loudly )
How long do those batteries last?
This guy's spitting up blood!
Hi, I'm Ab...
I'm Dr. Lockhart.
George Pisoni,
history of oral malignancy.
Cancer of the tonsil.
Been going like this all night.
LOCKHART: CBC, PT/PTT, type and cross.
Bayonets,
gelfoam and some Cetacaine.
Can you stop the bleeding?
I'm going to do the best I can.
Open up. Yankauer's ready.
( gurgling )
It's just a little numbing spray.
Nice coat.
( sudden moan )
It's a mess in there.
Two operations,
lots of radiation.
This should help it clot.
Sorry.
Maybe you would be more comfortable
holding that yourself.
Okay, you're bleeding
over... a large area,
so we may need to put a breathing tube in your throat
to protect your airway.
( weakly ): No...
Hemocue is 8.5.
You might also need a transfusion.
No, thanks.
I have an advance directive.
Yeah, but if we don't stop this, you're could bleed to death.
I guess...
maybe...
today's the day.
( gurgling )
Alex.
Alex, come on.
I could have been dead
and you wouldn't even have noticed.
If we leave now, we can make it
halfway to Florida before dinner.
I don't want to go to Florida.
You can swim in the ocean.
So what?
All right, how about
my cousin Fran's in Atlanta?
Her place smells.
Fine, where do you want to go?
Back to Chicago.
That isn't an option.
Come on, we don't have time for this. No.
You want to stay here?
Yeah. Really? Right here?
Yes. And I can't change your mind?
Nope.
Okay.
We'll stay here.
We'll stay right here in this pool
for the rest of our lives.
I found another treatment option.
Will it cure my cancer?
Nebulized epinephrine.
It's like a vapor, you inhale it, and sometimes,
it constricts the blood vessels and stops the bleeding.
How long will it last?
It's, it's just temporary.
You're sure?
Yes. Yes.
I'm getting tired.
As your blood count drifts down, you get sleepy.
Will it hurt?
HALEH: If it does...
...we'll give you morphine.
Okay.
Will...
Will you stay with me...
Will you stay with me awhile?
Sure.
Abby, paramedics have a new chest pain
and a febrile seizure.
I'll be here, George.
Make sure you get everything you need.
Thank you, Haleh.
And I'll be back, Mr. Pisoni, okay?
Greg? Greg,
yeah, you're intubated.
You had an epidural bleed.
Excuse me.
Can he get a pen and paper?
Hey...
welcome back.
"I have a shift at 8:00 a.m."
( laughs gently )
Well, you're late.
It's already noon.
Gellin's d-dimer is positive
and the spinal tap on Gomez looks like viral meningitis.
The coat suits you.
Thank you.
Dr. Kovac, are you expecting a collect call?
No.
Area code 502?
Want to grab some breakfast?
No, I'm too busy. Do you live here now?
I slept in the call room.
I gave up my apartment a few days ago.
Have you been up to see them?
Jing-Mei's okay, but Greg hasn't woken up yet.
Well, it's only been a couple hours.
Now, whatever happens, stay calm,
be professional and respectful.
We can always appeal
if we don't like the court's decision.
Kerry, did you get my messages?
I really don't think
there's anything else for us to talk about, Eddie.
Mr. Lopez, I don't think it's appropriate for you...
Just, please, let me have a minute, okay?
We've all agreed to let the court decide this matter.
You know, with you working so much,
my parents are retired
so they're home all the time for Henry...
Please, Mr. Lopez,
Dr. Weaver is well aware of your family's concerns.
No, please.
Kerry, two minutes. Please, two minutes.
JUDGE: Mr. and Mrs. Lopez,
you have now agreed that a full order of legal and physical
custody will be granted to Dr. Weaver, for Henry,
and that you will continue
in your current role as caregiver
during Dr. Weaver's working hours?
BOTH: Yes, Your Honor.
With visitation rights on holidays, as specified.
Yes.
We just want to be a part of Henry's life.
Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.
Sounds better. 60 of Prednisone.
MARQUEZ: Films on Rowland.
Okay. Set me up for a sugar-tong splint.
Repeat EKG on Harper.
Oh, Bolus 5000 of heparin.
And we can't get an I.V. on Grant.
Okay, I'll do a central line.
Have you met the new interns?
No. It's about time.
Put 'em to work.
Actually, Luka wanted you to see a few more patients
with them first.
Why can't he take them around?
He left a couple hours ago.
Again?!
Luka!
Luka!
How about here?
It's okay.
( sighs )
Is there a prayer?
I don't know.
We should say something.
We miss you...
...and you'll always be in our hearts.
"Il y a un temps pour tout,
"un temps pour toute
"chose sous les cieux.
"Un temps pour etre
"ne et un temps pour mourir.
"Un temps pour rire
"et un temps pour pleurer.
Un temps pour danser et un temps pour s'affliger."
I want you to stay.
I can't. I can't.
( moans )
Please?
I want us to be together.
I want to marry you.
Think I could get something to eat?
I'll order you a tray.
Been here almost 18 hours.
I'm aware of that.
You've held up a bed, woken up two judges
in the middle of the night, and now the head
of the Public Health Department
is coming here to do your exam.
Really?
Really.
He's driving all the way in here from Lake Forest just for you.
And he's really happy about it, too.
He says he hasn't actually done a pelvic in about ten years,
but he's willing to "give it a shot."
So, you can either wait here for another hour
for the old guy to get here
and give you what, I'm sure,
will be a remarkably painless and gentle exam
or you can let me do it
right now.
Hey. Signed, sealed, delivered.
She's all yours.
You did the exam?
No, it was more like self-service.
I need you to sign a death certificate.
On who?
Tonsil guy finally bled out.
George?
Mm-hmm.
When?
About an hour ago.
Well, why didn't you come and find me?
He was a DNR. You were busy.
But you were you with him?
Yeah.
He was comfortable?
Yeah.
NEELA: Is now a good time?
If you're too busy, I'll just come back after your shift.
No, it's fine.
Abby, where's the Marcaine?
Drug lockup. Middle cabinet.
Right. And the drug...?
Behind you.
Thank you.
Who's that?
It's one of the other new interns.
Okay, what happened?
I told my residency director
I didn't want to do an internship.
In Michigan.
Anywhere.
What?! What did he say?
He told me to think about it.
You're lucky he didn't fire you.
It would've made life simpler.
Diarrhea boy's at it again.
Okay. You know, you can't get a license
without doing an internship.
So?
So you can't practice medicine.
Right.
That's crazy. It's one more year.
I don't want to do it.
Oh! Eight years of school.
You're so close to the finish line.
What are you going to do, just throw away your future?
I'm not sure it's the future I want.
Abby...? I'm coming!
Let's get something to eat later.
What are you doing, Sam?
What I do.
You knew that.
I don't stay in one place that long.
How long can you keep doing that?
Long as I have to.
Can't keep running away.
Sure, I can.
This isn't just about Steve.
I'm sorry.
Sometimes there's a little collateral damage.
I have to do this for Alex.
From what I can tell, it's not working for him.
Well, he's ten.
He doesn't know what's working for him.
Is this the life you want for him?
For yourself?
I don't know what else to do.
Go to your car and follow me back to Chicago.
You don't have to do this alone.
I'm here.
You can trust me.
It's not something I'm good at.
Why not give it a try?
It can't be any worse than this.
( laughs )
Can it?
Come on. We should get going.
I don't want to miss my flight.
( sighs )
When are you coming back?
I'm not sure.
Well, my schedule's flexible.
I can come and visit in a few weeks.
Can we talk about it when I get back?
Sure.
I'll just need a bit of time, you know?
Just... I've got to rest.
Get back into work.
You didn't answer my question.
( sniffles )
It's okay.
I love you.
You don't have to answer me now.
I'm just not ready.
Well, will you think about it?
Will you promise me that?
( crying )
I just don't know what to think about anything.
It just all happened so fast,
and felt so right, didn't it?
( crying )
Well, it is right.
Just give me a bit more time, okay?
( passionate sigh )
I love you, too.
I love you so much.
