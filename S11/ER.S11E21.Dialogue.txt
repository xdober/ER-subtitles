Previously on ER.
You won't tell me how you feel.
It's fine. LEWIS: If you're
having trouble, you should see a couples therapist, and
if you can't do that, you should work separate shifts.
This is our niece, Shelley.
I just found out they were here.
We're waiting on Social Services to come down here.
It was my father's.
I want you to have it.
It suits you.
( heavy machinery buzzing and whirring )
Surveying your kingdom?
I was just wondering,
what do they do with all the dirt?
When's it supposed to open?
A year from
September.
Hey, congratulations, by the way.
Uh, tenure.
( machines beeping )
Thank you.
But that's not a good thing?
No, it's good.
It's great.
So, you got about two weeks left on your internship, huh?
You ready to be an R-2?
Do I have a choice?
I can't believe it went so fast.
Don't hear many interns say that.
Hmm.
Who's Joshua?
Family member.
Yes, I got that from the "Carter" part.
Joshua's what Kem and I were gonna name the baby.
It's a good thing you're doing here, John.
LEWIS: If Surgery's mad
'cause some guy went up without a central line,
they call and scream at you.
If GI is pissed because some ulcerative colitis went home
without follow-up, who do they call and yell at?
Me. ! You got it.
You also have office hours
for the med students and residents to stop by
if they have any problems or questions.
I get an office?
Well, the other chiefs haven't really used it.
Where is it?
Morris, office hours is just really a figure of speech.
Just make yourself available at Admit.
You're the new head cheerleader.
You organize parties, bring treats for residents
working holidays, host happy hours.
Do I get a budget for that?
Yup, it's called your ATM card.
Next year's resident contracts--
sign them and have them in my box
by the end of the week.
Dr. Barnett, we need to find some time
to talk about yours, okay?
WOMAN: So, you two work together?
TAGGART: Yeah, in the E.R. at County.
I'm a... a nurse.
Luka's a doctor.
Must be challenging.
Can be.
Place is an insane asylum.
How long have you been together?
About a year on and off.
Mostly on.
Have you sought therapy before?
No.
So, what brings you to me today?
I-I don't think Luka and I should be together.
Oh, mama, mama, mama!
Another four of M.S., with two of Versed?
Is that a statement or a question?
Four of MS and two of Versed.
You want Ativan?
Oh God, it hurts! RASGOTRA: No. It has too long
a half-life for pre-op assessments.
( man crying ) Calm down, sir.
What is all the ruckus?
RASGOTRA: Mr. Lillion was checking radiator leaks
while his engine was on.
I caught my hair in the damn belt.
Yeah, avulsed his whole scalp.
( Lillion crying )
Okay, okay.
Then tried to pull his hair
out of the moving fan with his hand.
Ouch.
RASGOTRA: Open fracture of the third
and fourth metacarpals
and extensor tendon lacs.
You want antibiotics?
A gram of Ancef I.V. piggyback.
Anything else?
( Lillion crying and coughing )
100 of gentamicin. Why gent?
( Lillion panting )
CARTER: Because open fractures
are susceptible to gram negative organisms.
FRANK: Hey, Pratt, some guy
out front says he's a friend of yours.
What's his complaint? Nothing he'll tell
me about. Says he knows you from high school.
Ugh. CARTER: Go ahead, I got this.
( groaning and panting )
Oh, my head.
Ow!
Darnell.
Greg, how you doing, baby?
What's up, man? All right. My boy.
Remember KJ, right?
Yeah. What's up, little man?
Get up and say hello to Dr. Pratt, man.
Where's the love at?
Yeah, right. Yeah, you're getting big.
Yeah, tell me about it. So, what's up?
Got somewhere we could talk?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
All right. Be right back.
I'm happy.
No, you're not.
I'm not.
Well, nobody is happy all the time.
( sighs )
He's like a sphinx.
I never know what he's thinking.
We talk.
We don't talk.
I talk.
You sit there and smile.
Occasionally, you nod.
( sighs )
And then I get mad.
I am always the one who's getting angry.
I am always the one who's yelling.
What, you want me to get angry?
Yeah. That would be nice.
Could you please break a dish,
or-or scream at the top of your lungs, something?
( sighs )
That's what I'm talking about.
What are you feeling, Luka?
I'm happy.
I'm happy, and Sam's not. I don't...
I don't know why.
We're healthy,
we-we enjoy each other, our work.
We have a good life.
WOMAN: How does that make you feel, Sam?
Like hitting him over the head with a... hammer.
WOMAN: Was there a particular event,
or series of events that led to your decision
to come here today?
Uh... yeah.
I thought that, uh, I might be pregnant.
And are you?
No. Thank God.
That's a pretty unequivocal answer.
Yeah.
That's how I feel about it.
Is that how you feel about it, Luka?
What is that?
Hey, what the hell is that?!
What's what, Billy?
That, up there, coming out of the damn ceiling.
Smells like crap.
It is crap!
Okay.
Bad enough I'm stuck in here,
you're-you're gonna let the building crap on me?
I think it's just your DTs kicking in, Mr. Seiger.
Hey, uh, uh...
unless they're passing out ponchos, better get him
back in the ambulance and over to Mercy pronto!
Jake's in Philadelphia?
Tulane.
I thought he was in San Francisco?
That was a couple of weeks ago.
Frank, something disgusting is leaking out of the ceiling.
You might want to call maintenance.
That or a Hazmat unit.
So, Carter gets tenure,
and Dr. Lewis doesn't?
Yep.
Well, how do you explain that?
Lewis has more seniority, she runs the E.R.
Bada-bing. Show me the green.
Hey, anybody seen Carter?
He's got African love on the overseas line again.
He took the avulsed scalp.
Sorry, Kem.
Can I take a message?
So, you get tenure based on how much money you have?
Well, he's building a new wing for the hospital,
and she's pushing paper and banana bags.
Highly-qualified woman, well-liked man.
Who do you think they're gonna get?
Oh, put your bra back on, Gloria Steinem.
Carter's been here ten years,
Lewis split, and then came back.
Yeah, and it's a level playing field now.
Haven't you heard?
Uh, Xnay on the Lewisnay.
Dr. Barnett, do you have a minute for me?
Sure.
Ooh.
PRATT: So, what, is he interested in medicine or something?
No, but he's got
to do his community service hours somewhere.
What did he get busted for?
Tagging. Had some weed on him, too.
( sighs )
Hey, we did a lot worse,
just never got caught.
Yeah, speak for yourself.
( laughs ): It ain't my fault I ran faster.
( laughing )
All right, look, on the real,
I'm just a hired hand around here, you know?
It's not really my decision to make.
But you'll ask?
Yeah, man.
My man. Oh.
I'll ask. My man, 50 grand.
( laughing )
Because I don't think it would be fair to Alex.
WOMAN: Alex is?
My son.
You know, he doesn't have enough problems already
without feeling like
he's getting elbowed out by a baby.
I think Alex would like
to have a brother or a sister, a family.
He has a family.
Hang on, hang on. Time out.
Luka, issues revolving around
having children can be very complicated
when one person in the relationship
already has a child.
God, Luka, I didn't even want
to have a kid the first time.
Alex was unplanned?
Yeah, you could say that.
I was 15.
Well, you're not 15 anymore.
After what happened to your wife and kids,
you really want to bring another baby
into this world?
You had a family before?
He says he's happy, and he can't even talk about it.
I had two children and a wife.
They were killed years ago.
I mean, how does it help us--
for me to talk about these things?
Because that's a huge part of who you are,
and you won't let me in.
LOCKHART: How come every kid
named Destiny
Miracle or Faith
ends up with leukemia?
Hmm.
Alkanalize her fluids and give Oncology a heads up.
That scalp guy went to the O.R.
Oh, you got another call from your Kenyan love nest.
It's the Congo, Frank.
And I know that you know it's the Congo.
Kenya, Congo.
It's all mosquitoes the size of flying toasters to me.
She sounded kind of upset.
MAN: You're all set.
You're just gonna leave that bucket
sitting there in the middle of the floor?
We shut off the toilet up in the O.R.
Soon as it drains, we'll snake it.
So, how long are we gonna have raw sewage
seeping out of our ceiling?
Another hour or two, at the most.
Oh, okay, great. So when the bucket's full,
maybe we should just toss it out into the street
like we do with the chamber pots.
Hey. Kem Likasu, please.
Is this Charles?
Hey, Charles. This is John Carter.
Good, good. Is she around?
Hey, Frank, I found what used
to be the Chief Resident's office down by the lounge,
but there's a ton of boxes I need you to move.
She what? I look like Bekins to you?
Get a couple of your interns, lean on them.
I... I...
See, but they're busy, and you're not.
What happened?
Ray, honestly, what are you doing here?
This is a great program,
you were lucky to get into it,
and you're just taking up space.
You don't think I'm a good doctor?
I think you could be a very good doctor.
But you know what?
You watch the clock all day,
just waiting to punch out.
( sighs )
You have two weeks left on your internship.
Take your degree
and go work at a doc-in-the-box,
or do air-transport.
If you're doing this to make a living,
you don't need a specialty.
You make more than enough money right now to support your music.
Don't sign this contract unless you are sure
this is what you want to do.
( sighs )
Did something happen to Kem?
No. It's her mother.
She's in the hospital.
In Africa?
No, her mother lives in Paris.
Did she say what happened?
I didn't talk to her.
She'd already left for the airport.
Hey, Frank, I don't know where Susan is,
but would you please tell her that I had to go?
Go where?
Uh, just tell her
that I'll call her from O'Hare, okay?
I've got to go by the bank on the way back, if that's okay.
Do you need anything from Home Depot?
Thought I'd swing by before work.
Home Depot?
Yeah, I need to get some anchors
to fix that towel bar Alex pulled down.
Where are you going?
Leave me alone, Luka!
Are you gonna walk?
It's got to be five miles.
Towel bars!?
Sam!
KOVAC: So, what's he doing in Paris?
LEWIS: Kem's mother is sick.
Meningitis. She's immunosuppressed from chemotherapy.
So, with Professor Carter AWOL,
you and me are stuck picking up the slack.
Five night shifts in a row?
What?
The new schedule. Morris?
If that's what it says.
A swing shift and a day shift back to back?
And Ray gets every weekend off. What?
Hey, Cubbies-Braves, right?
Got you covered, Chief. All right!
LOCKHART: Oh, I see.
So he bribed you for a good schedule?
Of course not.
That would be totally unethical.
Oh, I hear U2 tickets are hard to get.
It's a shame, I really wanted to go.
Dr. Lewis?!
( sighing ): He's the Chief.
Any way we can make Abby Chief Resident?
You know Morris isn't the sharpest shovel in the shed,
but he's a paperwork hound.
Besides, it keeps him from seeing patients.
Think of it as community service.
C.T. call on Werntz, yet?
I'll call them again.
Flowers usually work.
Hey, Jerry, I want you to meet KJ.
He's our new volunteer.
Ah, Volunteen. Welcome.
Yeah, Jerry runs this place.
He'll be telling you what to do.
Jerry, just have him run specimens up to the lab, or whatever.
"Specimens"? Yeah, blood, urine.
Piss?
( stifled scoff )
Nasal swabs, wound cultures,
stool samples-- the whole enchilada.
Hey, Pratt, 47's pulling in with a septic newborn.
Hey, you don't like it, the door's that way.
Is "stool sample" what I think it is?
Mm-hmm.
Septic newborn?
So they say.
Hey, you study your antibiotics last night?
The Gentamycin for the open fracture.
Come on, you should know that stuff cold by now.
You're gonna be an R-2 in a couple of weeks,
supervising new interns.
You got to start stepping it up.
Eight-day-old female, febrile to 104.
Grunting with severe retractions,
can't get a pulse ox.
Tachy to 192, resps 80...
It started this morning.
I thought it was just a cold.
RASGOTRA: Access?
Had a 23 gauge in the hand, but it blew.
Pardon?
Vous parlez anglais?
Quoi?
Vous parlez anglais?
Non. No?
Uh, je cherche... Mme. Almont.
Fabienne Almont?
Chambre... Elle as chambre?
Chambre quatre six
quatre.
Quatre cinqante quatre?
Quatre... six... quatre.
Quatre six quatre? Oui.
C'est par là.
Merçi.
( women speaking French in hallway )
John.
What are you doing here?
I got your message about your mom.
You should have told me you were coming.
Well, I called your cell.
No, it doesn't work in Paris.
( sighing )
How is she doing?
I can't tell what antibiotics
they're giving her from the I.V.
Oh, she's not on antibiotics.
They're not giving her antibiotics for meningitis?
Viral meningitis.
Who told you
she had meningitis? I called the clinic.
Charles said you flew to Paris,
and with all the chemo, I just assumed...
So, she's okay?
Ah, she had a fever, and the doctor got worried
so he admitted her, but she's much better now.
MICHEL: Ils n'ont pas de sandwich.
Alors, j'ai pris deux croissants.
Michel, je te presente
un ami à moi, John Carter.
John, this is an old friend of mine, Michel Timbaud.
MARQUEZ: BP's 58 over 29.
PRATT: She needs volume.
ALLISON: You're hurting her!
We can't help unless we're able
to give her fluids and medicines.
I'm in. Portable X ray, call R.T. for a vent.
Good chest rise. All right.
Airway and access.
Neela, what's your plan?
Normal saline, C.B.C., blood culture, Amp and Cefotax.
Good.
Hey, your Hodgkin guy's pressure dropped
after the antibiotics.
Run in a liter. ! He's altered
and trying to pull out his broviac.
PRATT: Give the bolus, I'll be right back.
100 ccs NS through the I.O.
Will somebody please tell me what's going on?!
RASGOTRA: We suspect your daughter has an infection.
We're giving her antibiotics for it,
fluids to help elevate her blood pressure,
and the tube is helping her to breathe.
I.O.'s infiltrated, it won't flush.
How old is she again?
Eight days.
RASGOTRA: Her umbilical stump is still attached.
Is that bad? No, that's good.
Umbilical line kit, 5 French.
Sterile 6s and a 10 blade.
PRATT: Hey, Jerry,
Hodgkin's guy needs a med bed, and let the NICU know
they got a customer down here.
Your Volunteen kid doesn't seem very interested.
Yeah, well, he's not.
So, why is he volunteering?
He has to work off his probation.
Ah. What'd he do?
Second degree murder, I think.
Really?
He got caught tagging a police car.
JERRY: Wait, he tried to spray paint a cop car?
Yep, with the cops still in it.
( chuckling ): Whoa, the kid's got guts.
Either that, or he's an idiot.
LOCKHART: Small bowel obstruction
secondary to a popcorn overdose.
Six-year-old ate a huge tub of popcorn
all by himself.
Yeah, and...?
Call surgery and get a C.T.
Think they'll be ready
to supervise interns in two weeks?
Not a chance.
John?
( sighing )
That was awkward.
Where are you going?
Back to the airport, I guess.
You just got here.
( uncomfortable chuckle )
Well, you were right, I should have called first.
Michel and I went to school together,
and he's fond of my mother.
Are you two a couple?
We were.
Does he know about the past-tense part?
Are you jealous?
Yeah.
( chuckles softly )
Hey, don't do that.
Don't laugh at me. Okay, okay.
Are you sleeping together?
No... do not answer that.
Well, you haven't been dating?
Look, is there someplace around here
where I can catch a taxi and go back to the airport?
Don't be so dramatic.
Okay, look, I'm sorry, okay?
I'm tired...
and I shouldn't have just barged in on you,
and I feel completely ridiculous.
Actually, it was very sweet.
Yeah.
Okay. Look, I'm really glad that your mom's okay.
And why don't you call me when you get home?
John.
Just stay.
Just for the night.
MARQUEZ: Flushes easily.
RASGOTRA: Hook up the transducer.
Sats 93, systolic's up to 78.
Good. That's good.
How we doing in here?
What are you doing?
Umbilical lines.
You're what?
Umbilical lines.
I heard you. Why?
I.O. infiltrated, we needed access.
Why not just put in another I.O.?
She still has an umbilical stump.
UAC and UVC allow
for frequent blood draws,
gasses...
Did she do something wrong?
Hotel Lamartine.
I'll come by in the morning, we'll have some breakfast.
Michel coming, too?
He has to work.
Those his real teeth?
They're a little too straight.
Get some sleep.
I'm going to pick you up early.
Ah, you get some sleep, too.
Bonne nuit.
PRATT: You can't be placing
umbilical lines by yourself.
Do you know all the things that could have gone wrong?
Thromboembolism, vascular injuries, arrhythmias.
I thought arterial monitoring...
You're an E.R. intern!
You can't go playing neonatologist
whenever you feel like it.
I did a bunch... of these
when we rotated through the NICU.
Really? And when was that, two years ago?
Have you done one, or even seen one
since then?
You told me to take more initiative.
"Initiative"? What about common sense, Neela?
What's next, neurosurgery in the lounge?
You need to know when to ask for help!
W-What the hell is this?
What, you gonna cry now?
All right, look, you got lucky this time.
She's stabilizing.
But you have to start using your head.
Now, go on, get out of here. Go.
I'll deal with the NICU guy.
( sniffling )
( phone ringing )
Bonjour. Hello?
Um... I'm sleeping.
It's still dark outside.
All right, I'm up.
All right, I'm up, I'm up, I'm up.
( horn honks )
Bonjour, mon soleil.
How's Michel going to get to work
if we have his car?
Who said it's his car?
Come on, I want to show you something.
Does it involve coffee?
Everything in Paris involves coffee.
Whoa!
( horn blaring ) Hurry!
We're going to miss it!
Where are we going?
Nowhere. We're here.
You got me up at 5:00 in the morning
to ride a commuter train?
Mm-hmm. Be patient for once in your life.
She spent the night... at her dying husband's bedside.
He was a member of the Resistance,
fought bravely against the Occupation
while she smuggled messages
for the Free French
through Nazi lines on her bicycle.
He still loves her,
but she's not
so sure after all these years.
He's an accountant.
She is a waitress
who longed to be a singer.
She had a mad, secret,
tempestuous affair
with her sister's fiancé.
What about them?
Mm. It's a sad story.
She only has a few months to live.
Cancer.
They love each other desperately.
Spend every moment together.
What about us?
Do you have a story for us?
Quick, close your eyes.
Quickly, quickly, quickly, quickly!
Come on!
Close your eyes.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait.
Paris le matin.
What are you doing out here?
Deciding if I'm sick. Pratt's on.
Ah.
Hey, Neela.
Hey.
I got you a bear claw.
They don't have the apple fritters.
What are we doing?
Neela's trying to decide if she should go to work.
We get to decide?
She put in umbilical lines
in a newborn yesterday.
Really? Cool.
Unsupervised. Pratt became unglued.
Wow. I miss all the good stuff.
Well, I've got to go,
or I'm going to be late.
Got to get back on that horse.
( siren beeps )
MORRIS: Nothing fancy.
Just some primer and a couple coats.
I was thinking Lichen. ! Morris, I'm not painting
your office. The hospital does it.
I just need a purchase order.
Yeah, a purchase order that comes
out of my E.R. budget.
Hey, Pratt, stabbing victim
in Trauma One.
Back up the interns, please.
Paramedics are two minutes out with an MVA,
nine-year-old kid.
Uh, okay. Hey, Luka, can you get that?
I've got an extubation in C.T.
We don't have to do the trim... No, Morris, no.
MVA coming in.
Trauma panel, type and cross for four.
MALIK: Pulse ox down to 78.
BARNETT: Taking down the neck dressing.
Shouldn't we tube her first?
Be my guest.
Maybe there's something
we can tie off.
Etomidate and sux.
BARNETT: Got the jugular, spared the carotid.
I can't breathe... BARNETT: Okay, it's okay.
You're going to sleep. We'll breathe for you.
Prep for a subclavian on the right.
8-O E.T. tube.
Is this the penetrating neck?
Single stab wound. Hypotensive.
No sub-Q air. Two of O-neg
on peripheral I.V. Pressure's up to 90 palp.
I'm in. Bag her.
BARNETT: Got a flash.
We'll have a central line
for the next two units.
Good breath sounds.
Excellent. Maybe there's hope for you two after all.
Professor Carter.
It's associate professor, actually.
( chuckling ): Well, I'm proud of you.
CARTER: Susan didn't get tenure.
KEM: Susan Lewis? Really?
She's pretty pissed about it, too.
She's not talking to me.
Now, this is what
I really miss in Africa-- baked goods.
What?
You have, uh... a lot of jam on your face.
Well, help me.
Hello.
Maman?
Non?
Pardon, il vous ennuie?
Ah, non, pas du tout.
Tu viens ici.
( speaking French )
Tu dis au revoir?
Au revoir.
Au revoir.
Hey, hey, got a minute?
Uh, not really. What's up?
Uh, I got to finish my rank list for my match.
I could use a little advice. Excuse me. Excuse me.
There's something leaking from the ceiling.
ABBY: Oh.
Okay, um...
I'm going to move you...
right over here...
and Christian's going to take care of you.
Thank you.
Is that what I think it is?
Yep. Susan, code brown
dripping from the ceiling again.
Damn it, that is it.
Jerry, call the A.O.D.,
tell them we are closed to trauma
until someone comes down here
and deals with the raw sewage
leaking from the ceiling.
Is this the respiratory distress?
Jerry, what's open?
There's a bed open in Curtain Three.
Arnold Brixton, 65, short of breath.
Sats 83 on room air, 91 on a non-rebreather.
Tachy at 115, afebrile,
good B.P., on theophylline for emphysema.
( coughs ): Don't say it.
Say what?
I stopped smoking five years ago.
Good for you.
Come on.
So, I was thinking
that I might rank County as my first choice.
You want to...
stay in Chicago?
Yeah. I mean, my friends are here, all my family.
He needs a monitor
and a continuous Albuterol with 500 of Atrovent.
What about San Francisco?
UCSF has a great program,
but, um, County has a lot to offer, too.
MARQUEZ: Look who's back.
Okay, 60 of Pred and a portable chest.
And do you want to talk about this later?
Sure.
Rebecca? Birdy? They okay?
Do you know them? Yeah, they've been in a couple times before.
Circumferential ecchymosis.
Neela wants to get her a telemetry bed.
What happened?
Rebecca almost got strangled to death.
I tried to tell you guys it is too dangerous
for you to be out there on the streets.
I'd be dead if-if Birdy hadn't stabbed her.
You... you stabbed the attacker?
Well, I had to.
Is she going to be all right?
Yeah. I mean, she seems stable for now.
We might have to... No, no, not Rebecca. Shelley.
Our niece.
They're working on her in that room over there.
KEM: I grew up playing here
when we weren't in Kinshasa with my dad.
My mum would save the old bread
so I could feed the ducks on the weekends.
There was thousands of them in the summer.
CARTER: It sounds idyllic.
Yeah. Yeah, it was.
So, why did you leave?
It was different when I was little.
You know, we were a novelty then.
My very white mother...
my black father with their little brown girl.
( laughs ): It wasn't easy for them.
You know that Joshua would be a year old now?
Uh, I'm going to head back to the hospital,
see my mother, okay?
What are we doing?
What are we doing?
I still love you, and I know you still love me.
We talk to each other every day.
We talk for hours, on the phone.
We tell each other absolutely everything about our lives.
I make you happy.
I make you laugh.
I tried living in Chicago, and it wasn't for me.
We don't have to live in Chicago.
You have a life there, your career, everything.
I would give it up for you.
I don't want you to.
Kem...
we had a baby, and he died.
It's a tragedy that happens to people,
and it happened to us...
but that doesn't have to define us.
It doesn't. We're stronger than that.
Aren't we?
I can't...
We can have another baby.
Stop, please, don't do this...
I'm sorry...
I'm sorry.
Are you going to come to the hospital, hmm?
'Cause Fabienne's going to want to say good-bye.
Tidal volume's 700, AC 14 on 100%.
Units three and four on board.
Ray, did you ever follow up with Social Services
on that home visit for the Chaddock sisters?
I'm sorry. Who?
The two old ladies
that panhandle on LaSalle.
You sent them home with their niece, right?
The two old ladies from a few weeks ago?
Yeah. Pressure's down to 60 systolic.
PRATT: Check for tracheal shift.
And let's get four of type specific.
This is the niece, Shelley.
Birdy stabbed Shelley because she was trying
to strangle Rebecca.
She what?
You sent them home with Shelley.
Did you forget about the follow-up,
or just not want to deal with it?
No, I called, but what am I supposed to do,
chase them around all day, make sure they do their job?
All right, come on, people.
Can we focus on this patient for a second?
V fib. Starting compressions.
PRATT: Ambu bag. Charge at 200.
Does she have a cardiac history?
I don't know, Ray. You're the only one
that's ever met her. Clear!
( zap )
( laughter )
( Michel speaking French )
Quel menteur, Michel.
Ne dis pas de mal de tes amis.
MICHEL: Non, pas ici.
( Michel speaking French )
Oh, we're being rude.
FABIENNE: I'm hungry.
Will you get me something, mon ange?
Oui.
Vas-y, j'ai faim.
Rapporte-moi du chocolat
et un cafe creme avec deux sucres.
Thank you for the
beautiful flowers.
He's a very handsome young man.
Who?
Michel.
Yeah. Yeah, I guess.
Also something of a fool.
When are you going home?
There's a flight tonight at 9:00.
You're giving up awfully easily, aren't you?
I was rather firmly discouraged
from continuing to try.
You know what life is?
Joy and grief hand in hand.
You can't know real happiness
until you've had true sorrow to contrast it with.
Hmm.
She hasn't learned that yet.
KEM: Leave him alone, Mother.
We were just catching up.
RASGOTRA: Rib spreader.
PRATT: Abby, get the suction.
BARNETT: I don't get it.
She was stabbed in the neck.
Yeah, the knife must have angled down,
bagged the subclavian. Stand back.
This is gonna be pretty bloody.
Dry as a bone.
Starting internal compressions.
BARNETT: We put in six units.
Where's it all going?
All right, whoa, whoa. Hold compressions.
MALIK: Fine V fib. Internal paddles?
Oh, man. Son of a bitch.
All right, stop bagging.
18-gauge needle.
( sighs )
Coronary arteries are full of air.
An air embolus?
( Pratt sighs )
All right, that's it.
We're done.
Time of death, 11:47.
How'd she get that much air in her heart?
I don't know. She had an open neck wound.
The negative
intrathoracic pressure sucked the air
into her jugular, but I don't see how that's possible.
She has an occlusive dressing.
I-I, uh...
I took it down to explore the neck.
Was it before or after the intubation?
This was before.
You took down the patient's dressing
before she was intubated?
Excuse me, Dr. Lockhart?
Your emphysema
guy is coding.
It was only for a few breaths. I...
LEWIS: Damn right we're closed.
And we're gonna stay closed as long as I've got crap--
and I don't mean that figuratively--
literal crap pouring out of my ceiling!
I came back to check his neb, and he was down.
Mr. Brixton? Mr. Brixton?
PVCs.
All right, a Mac-2 and an 8-oh.
You should have come and got me
if it looked like he was tiring out.
No, no, he was holding his own. ( alarm )
Systolic's 77.
Okay. NS wide open, start a second line.
( alarm )
Run of six. ! All right, what now?
LOCKHART: Acute emphysema flare.
He went apneic on continuous nebs.
V tach.
No pulse.
PRATT: All right, start compressions,
and mark the time.
Let's get an ABG and a capnograph, now.
How's she doing?
Good sats, no stridor.
Got a repeat EKG and neck films.
You're doing good, Rebecca.
I didn't mean to hurt her.
I just wanted her to leave Rebecca alone.
Did she suffer?
No.
We put her to sleep to work on her.
She didn't suffer any pain.
I didn't mean to kill her.
( teary ): We love... we loved her.
PRATT: 200.
Clear!
( zap )
LOCKHART: Back in sinus. Got a pulse.
Okay. LEWIS: What have you got?
Emphysema flare.
Abby had him on continuous albuterol.
He was wheezing and tight,
and given the acute setting, I thought...
Chuny, correlate the capnograph to the ABG,
set the rate at 40.
Abby, what's the end tidal C02?
96.
Can you tell me why?
He was apneic. ! Why?
He wasn't ventilating?
That's not an answer.
He has emphysema?
Wrong. Tired out?
No. Basic respiratory physiology.
He was hypoxic. MARQUEZ ABG's back.
PH 7 point one.
LEWIS: Think about it.
Emphysemics chronically retain C02.
They rely on relative hypoxia...
To trigger their respiratory drive.
And I put him on continuous nebs,
blasted him with oxygen
and took away his impulse to breathe.
Leading to hypercapnia, acidosis and v-tac.
I'm sorry.
PRATT: Don't apologize to us.
He'll be okay once you blow off some C02.
It's a classic intern mistake.
You won't make it again.
Get up.
Get up!
What?
What-What's going on?
Tell them.
That poor woman in there thinks
she murdered her own niece.
Now, Ray.
( clears throat )
Faites demi-tour s'il vous plait.
Quoi?
Retournez.
Retournez.
( Jake sighs )
Hey.
If it's, um, any consolation,
that was a great teaching case for me.
I'm glad my public humiliation
can further your educational goals.
The guy's fine, Abby.
It's not your fault
he smoked two packs a day for decades.
So,
I, um, was thinking
that I might rank County as my first choice
for internship.
What about UCSF?
Um, I don't want to go to UCSF.
I want to stay right here.
Don't do that for me.
BARNETT: Ooh.
Now this...
This was a seriously crappy day.
Who wants to go get mad drunk
and pick a bar fight with a bunch of law clerks, huh?
I still have an hour of charting to do.
How are Birdy and Rebecca?
They're gonna be fine.
Did you find out what happened?
Turns out the niece had them on the corner panhandling
to support her crack habit.
Knocked them around
when they didn't bring home enough.
Well, well.
If it isn't the three amigos.
Let's me see.
Failure to recall
basic respiratory principles,
uh, unsupervised umbilical lines in an infant.
Ew. And a fatal air embolus.
Wow. Hey, when do the new interns start?
A week from Monday.
MORRIS: Man, oh, man.
God help your patients.
( laughs ): Wait up, dude.
RASGOTRA: Well, I don't know about you, but I feel
really inspired right now,
so I think I'll go and throw myself under a train.
Mm-hmm.
Don't go away mad, Jake.
But do go away.
( horn honking )
( door buzzes )
( doorbell ringing )
( panting )
I'm moving back to Africa.
And we can start over.
We can do everything that we didn't do before.
And you take as much time as you need.
You can take a month, you can take a year,
you can take ten years.
I don't care.
And I'm not leaving without you.
And I'm not living without you.
( panting )
I love you.
( laughing )
I love you.
