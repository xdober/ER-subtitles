Previously on ER...
Who's that?
LEWIS: Med student.
Jane, why didn't you say anything?
No one listens to me.
No one even remembers I was in the room.
Third year resident, I've been ordering my own scans
since I been here. What's that about?
It's about me making the rules.
Come on, that's stupid.
Congratulations, Jake.
Your ER rotation is officially over.
Good evening.
Can I help you?
Room 415?
End of the hall.
Helen?
Helen, it's Kerry.
I don't want to leave it like this.
The things that we said...
Is this how you want to leave it?
If it is, tell me, and I'll go away...
like we never even met.
I heard it was supposed to be sunny
and slightly warmer today.
I heard "partly cloudy, chance of rain."
Winter.
Did you know that most snowflakes
are less than one-half inch across?
Uh, no, I didn't...
Do you know why they're white?
The complex structure of snow crystals
results in countless tiny surfaces
from which visible light is efficiently reflected.
What little sunlight is absorbed
is absorbed uniformly over the visible wavelengths
thus giving snow its white appearance.
What's wrong with you? ( laughs )
Alex had a school report.
Luka and I got kind of into it.
Yeah, guess so.
Excuse me...
Do you know how much longer I'll have to wait?
Ooh, that's nasty.
One of the other skaters ripped into me.
This morning?
Skating club.
We only get the ice from 5:30 to 7:00.
We'll get you checked in in a couple of minutes, okay?
Thanks.
Ugh, winter.
So it's already an every-night kind of thing?
Since he started his surgical rotation, yeah.
Dubenko's working him pretty hard,
and my place is closer to the hospital.
Oh, I see, so sleeping over is basically a convenience.
No, we do like each other.
And, do you know, his real name isn't Jake,
it's George?
It's actually kind of a funny story.
I mean, it's not funny- funny, but it's... sorry.
Tibial plateau fracture, ortho's taking to the OR.
Make sure he's NPO. Got it.
Cellulitis following cat bite, admit to medicine.
Already did.
Antibiotics on board?
Three grams of unasyn.
DKA on an insulin drip, going up to the ICU.
Last glucose?
534. And they just brought back a 60-year-old lady,
Pick's Disease with agitation.
I'm officially out of here.
Thank you, Luka.
Hasta la vista, suckers. Dr. Barnett.
Ray, when you get home, take the back stairs,
front ones are kind of frozen.
You didn't shovel?
You're kidding, right?
Oh, and the kitchen window,
I couldn't get it to close all the way.
Meaning?
Meaning there's snow in the kitchen.
Bit of a build-up, actually, so you might want to try
turning the oven on and leaving the door open.
So it'll melt.
It's just a suggestion.
She used to be my roommate.
WEAVER: Shall we get back to medicine here?
Atypical chest pain waiting on a second troponin.
I'll take it. How come Weaver's on?
How come Weaver's on?
She does two shifts a month to keep up her skills,
to stay in touch with the needs of the department.
Our lucky day.
Teenage ice skater bleeding like a stuck pig
out in the waiting area.
Frank, let's get a wheelchair.
Okay. Someone might want
to grab the trauma at the back door.
Carter, take Neela with you on that chest pain.
Susan, 50-something woman, dyspnea, curtain four.
Abby, Jane, you're with me.
Must be awkward for Dr. Lewis,
being chief, then having Dr. Weaver back.
What, are you kidding?
Weaver comes in, takes charge, runs all the cases.
Lewis loves it. It's like having a day off.
Not so, however, for the rest of us.
Altercation at someone's
all-night-turned-out-badly birthday party.
Good morning, Dr. Pratt.
Yeah, half an inch of snow and traffic grinds to a halt.
Multiple stab wounds to the back with a screwdriver.
You think he dropped a lung? Probably not,
sats are 100.
Abby and I have got this one.
There's a woman there with Pick's Disease.
Why don't you grab that.
Oh, and take Jane with you.
It's a good teaching case.
I'm sure Jane has seen more than her share
of combative patients with dementia.
But not with you as her teacher.
Have you, Jane?
You could start by reviewing
the key elements of the history,
physical, genetics, differences from Alzheimer's.
Okay, okay, we're on it.
If it's any consolation,
I'm a blank slate when it comes to Pick's Disease.
I know we studied it maybe first year.
No, I think it was second year.
No, it was first year.
What did she say about Alzheimer's?
Man, talk about your short-term memory loss.
Lousy son-of-a...
I'll get a piece, you stupid fat piece of sh...
Nice language. Equal breath sounds.
Pulse ox 98. First hemocue?
13.8.
Okay, let's roll him.
We're going to roll you onto your side, sir.
No head injury.
Guess he's sleeping it off.
Regular or Phillips head?
What?
Stabbed with a screwdriver, right?
Yes. At least 20 wounds, all superficial.
I'd say regular.
Sonosite.
Mr. Scanlon, what is Hamman's sign? Uh...
A crunching sound heard with pneumomediastinum,
listen for it.
TAGGART: X-ray's back.
What is normal intrapleural pressure?
Negative...
Negative ten to 12 millimeters of mercury.
And what's the intra-alveolar pressure?
Fluctuates.
Minus three with inspiration, plus three with expiration.
So, Jake, tell me:
How does this poor guy end up with a pneumothorax?
Penetrating trauma allows air to enter the pleural space,
raising the pressure, collapsing the alveoli.
Well done, Mr. Scanlon.
Fantastic.
BP 124/82.
Let's get him a floor bed.
He needs the ICU. He's stable.
No, the guy's Swiss cheese. He needs close observation.
We'll never get an ICU bed.
He doesn't need one,
no pneumo, his crit and vitals are stable,
no blood in the pericardium or Morrison's.
He could have an occult solid organ injury
or a delayed pneumothorax.
Are you going to bludgeon us
with the differential?
Occasionally, I can be thorough.
How about a tele admit?
Maybe after four hours.
Four hours?
Uh, Kerry, that lady with dyspnea,
Sharon Williams,
she's asking for you.
Said she here before, you were her doc.
Okay. This "Swiss cheese" is stable.
Let's get him admitted to a med-surg bed
and don't listen to any of Dr. Dubenko's suggestions.
So, Dr. Lewis...
Don't start.
Oh, okay. No problem.
We humble surgical servants
shall leave this in your capable hands.
Uh, Jake... do not move
Mr. Screwdriver without a foley,
an NG, three crits and a four-hour chest film.
Oh, and suture all the lacs.
All 20 of them?
Oh, yeah.
Sharon Williams, BP 124/70,
pulse ox 90.
No history of asthma or emphysema.
Thanks, Haleh. Sharon Williams?
You're Dr. Weaver?
I'm sorry, of course you're Dr. Weaver.
You were in once before?
Yes. And when was that?
Oh, God, let me think.
I don't know, I can't quite remember.
You know, I'm actually feeling much better now.
I probably didn't need to come in.
Well, as long as you did...
Well, I don't...
This whole thing is silly.
I don't know what I was thinking.
I'm much better, I'm breathing fine.
Why don't you let me examine you
and we'll make sure of that.
Okay, you said you experienced shortness of breath?
Yes.
Any cough or fever? No.
Have you had any prolonged periods of immobilization
like a plane or car trip?
No.
Lungs sound good, oxygen level is fine.
We'll check a few tests and see what's going on.
Haleh, EKG, PA and lateral chest, D-dimer.
Sure.
And I'll be back to check on you later.
Dr. Weaver.
Yeah?
Is there something you need?
No, no.
Well, yes...
It's not really important.
What's not important?
Well, I was wondering,
the daughter of a friend of mine
is thinking about medical school.
Do you like what you do?
Very much.
Did you always want to be a doctor?
From when I was a little girl.
So you were lucky, then, weren't you?
Getting the opportunity to do it.
Ms. Williams, is everything all right?
Oh, I'm fine, Kerry.
Really.
Thank you.
I don't want to take up any more of your time.
Okay then.
Sharon Williams,
let's pull up her records from the last time she was in.
Sure.
Can you wiggle your fingers?
Can you wiggle your fingers?
Why don't you just give it a try for me?
Why don't you just give it a try for me.
Charlotte,
Charlotte, the dinner party.
The dinner party, they're going to be here early.
It's okay, Mom.
What are we going to do? It's okay. Mom, it's okay.
5:30 this morning I hear her
crashing around in the kitchen.
You got a bathroom around here?
Chuny... Mrs. Devon, you can come with me.
You can come with me.
With me.
There is no dinner party.
She was in the kitchen.
She thought she was cutting chicken...
she was cutting her own hand.
Well, we're gonna take care of that.
When did her symptoms start?
Two years ago.
She was only 58.
We've been able to keep her at home, but now
I've got three kids.
What am I supposed to do?
WEAVER: Labs back yet on that syncope?
No. still waiting.
Call them again and ask nicely.
"Nicely"? We're never nicely.
Pratt, Pick's Disease?
Jane?
Uh, similarities with Alzheimer's,
but with an earlier age of onset
and a faster progression of symptoms.
Mainly causes damage
to the frontal lobes of the brain
resulting in disinhibition.
Patient can be extremely rude, which we have seen,
and then can become extremely loving,
which we have not seen.
Uh, often has a tendency
to repeat statements spoken to them,
you know, but I'd actually say it's a bit more...
Thank you, Jane. Good job, good job.
Yes, and let me see--
was that Dr. Pratt's extremely efficient teaching
or was it...
"eMedicine."
She learned about it, didn't she?
She learned the facts,
not necessarily how to handle the patients or the family.
Yeah, but she will. The woman's got some lacerations.
We're going to suture her as soon as the Ativan kicks in.
Dr. Pratt said that...
What about the family?
The daughter's trying to line up a skilled nursing facility.
You should help her with that.
Isn't that a social worker thing?
Just dive in.
See what you can do.
Hey, Sam, did that screwdriver stabbing guy
get sent upstairs yet?
Uh, well, Dr. Dubenko wanted a few things taken care of first.
In what possible universe
would I say the words, "Let's polka"?
I'm telling you, in your sleep two nights ago.
Look, I'm not making this up.
You don't think I was surprised?
I don't talk in my sleep.
How do you know?
Even if I did, I wouldn't say "polka."
I wouldn't even say "dance." I don't dance.
I mean, maybe once when I was a kid I did the limbo.
Yeah, maybe that was it.
Maybe it was the limbo.
Ah, see? And you're making it up.
( both laughing )
I'm sorry!
Dr. Lockhart.
Mr. Scanlon.
Kerry.
Dr. Weaver.
...um, mixing up some Ancef.
I'm just gathering up supplies, so...
I thought you were gathering up
a med-surg bed for the guy with holes in his back.
I'd like very much to do that.
Dr. Weaver. That patient, Sharon Williams?
There's no record of her being here before.
I asked her about it
and she got pretty nervous. Wants to leave AMA.
Now? Yeah.
"Gathering supplies"?
Yeah. I know. Okay. I know.
Excuse me. Uh, that woman who was here.
Did you see her leave?
Yeah, just now.
Kind of bolted.
You want me to try and catch her?
Ms. Williams.
Please wait.
Your test results aren't back yet.
I don't need 'em.
It shouldn't be much longer.
I don't need 'em.
You could have a blood clot in the lung
or fluid around your heart.
Stop, please.
I don't have any of those things,
There's nothing wrong with me.
I don't understand.
I've never been to this hospital before.
My name's not Sharon Williams.
It's... Helen Kingsley.
I'm your mother.
WEAVER: Who'd you say, Kovac?
Yeah. His wanting Saturday off is potentially a problem.
Well, however you want to handle it.
Kerry, they can take Sharon Williams
for her chest x-ray now.
That won't be necessary.
You can cancel her labs, too.
Cancel all of it?
Yeah. Kerry, about earlier...
Susan, could you follow up on this migraine in Two?
I know we were supposed to take the screwdriver guy upstairs.
Don't worry about it.
Dubenko wanted serial crits and the UA
showed 10 red cells.
Do we need to work that up?
That's probably just from the foley.
So he doesn't need a CT?
Frank, I'm gonna take a break.
What?!
"Break"?
Well... they say it isn't good for your arteries.
I guess you'd know about that.
But I like it anyway.
How did you find me?
The letter you sent.
But that was four years ago.
Why-Why all this pretense?
Why didn't you just write back?
I wanted to see you first.
That poor little ice skater girl.
Her leg looked awful.
She's young. She'll heal.
What you do, it's so important.
I guess I was scared.
I'm here in Chicago
for a week, so...
You're still in Indiana?
Terre Haute.
That's next door.
You could've been to Chicago a hundred times.
I'm sorry.
I looked for you.
I hired an investigator.
I finally found the right address,
you knew where I was and, still, you waited so long?
I can't explain it.
I know it wasn't fair.
I'm truly, truly sorry. Oh, plea... please.
Please. Don't go yet.
So, um... have you always lived in Indiana?
South Carolina, originally.
I'm here in Chicago with my choir.
Your choir?
There's a Christ Crusade
and we were chosen to sing in the festival chorus.
That... that sounds like quite an honor.
When's the concert?
Tomorrow afternoon,
Community Baptist on Dearborn.
Oh... as a matter of fact,
they're going to be looking for me.
We've got a rehearsal.
Um...
I'd like to talk to you again, Kerry.
If you want to, that is.
Yeah, I would.
So I can call you after I'm done?
Do you have the number of the hospital?
No.
Just wait one second.
There's a separate number
for the ER.
Uh... one second.
Here you go. There you are.
So you'll call.
In a couple of hours.
Great.
Pressure's only 72 palp.
Left pupil is 6 millimeters
and sluggish.
Hang 80 of mannitol.
Multiple rib fractures with sub q air.
Glove up for a chest tube.
So, our drunk vs. screwdriver is having some more trouble?
This isn't the screwdriver guy.
Oh, I heard he was still down here, so naturally I assumed
there was some emergent situation.
No. This would be the motorcycle vs. tree guy.
Blunt head, chest...
Looks like a fractured spleen.
Mr. Scanlon, your patient's bleeding
in the head and belly. What's your plan?
Uh... quick head CT before going to the OR for an exlap.
Good call if you want him to bleed out in the scanner.
Betadine and steri-drape.
What's the Monroe-Kelly hypothesis?
Uh, I don't know.
Abby?
I don't know.
CPP equals MAP minus ICP.
Cerebral Perfusion Pressure equals Mean Arterial Pressure
minus Intracranial Pressure.
Spleen's a bigger threat to the MAP.
Two units on the infuser.
Guidewire's ready.
Stop what you're doing.
Have you even read about this procedure?
I supervised Jake putting in a chest tube last week.
Oh, good. Because I'm sure you told him
you always insert a gloved finger and feel lung tissue
before...
before inserting the tube.
Why is that, Mr. Scanlon?
Uh...
First, to break up any adhesions.
Second, if there is a diaphragmatic injury,
you could be in the abdominal cavity and chest tubes
don't work very well in the stomach.
Line is primed.
Kerry, I think we can take this from here.
Uh... yes, I'm sure you can.
That was fun.
Would you like to tell me
why she's so pissed off at the two of you?
Man, and I thought I knew how to pimp.
When did your neck pain start?
Came in from Cleveland yesterday
to help my brother move.
I was lifting a chair.
She had an MRI last year--
three slipped disks in her neck.
Any neuro findings?
Motor and sensory intact.
The pain goes down into her arm, though. Don't forget that.
NEELA: I was going to order some morphine.
PATIENT: Makes me sick to my stomach.
HUSBAND: Demerol's the only thing that works when she gets like this.
We could try Toradol.
Allergic.
Demerol.
Okay, we will be right back.
Neck pain with radiculopathy
consistent with herniated disk syndrome.
Allergic to Toradol--
she may as well have told us she's a Demerol addict.
We have no objective test for pain.
Shouldn't we err on the side of believing her?
Give her the Demerol and get her out the door.
See what I mean?
She's on every case.
Looks good.
Did Dr. Pratt show the two-layer repair?
Where is Dr. Pratt?
I think he's looking for supplies.
Looking for supplies.
Didn't this woman have her daughter with her?
That's where he is.
He's, uh, with the daughter.
He's helping her locate
a skilled nursing facility.
CVP is 10, MAP is 80
and we're transfusing to an SCV O2 of 70.
Once the crit is 30, consider dopamine.
Dr. Pratt, is there some good reason
why you've left your student unsupervised?
Other patients?
Look, I've got a 75-year-old man with urosepsis,
a woman in pulmonary edema
and a kid with anaphylaxis from a peanut allergy.
And "my student" should be supervised by an intern.
Except that I asked you to do it.
You've got to stay on these residents.
Dr. Pratt isn't the problem.
You know that break you took?
You may want to take another one.
Frank, have I gotten any calls?
Nope.
You've been here the whole time?
Yep.
I'm going out.
Carter, would you take over
this bowel obstruction in Four...
Retinoschisis in Two...
Mr. Langstaff with pyleo,
he's waiting on an admit to medicine.
A 72 year-old female with nausea
and I need an LP on the fever in Six.
You're signing out a spinal tap?
So much for every case.
( choir crooning harmonies )
( choir continues )
* Just as I am
* Without one plea
* But that Thy blood was shed for me *
* And that Thou bidst me come to Thee *
* O lamb of God
* I come
* I come.
Thank you.
Thanks, Ann.
( all talking at once )
Has it already been two hours?
I, I just thought I'd catch some of the rehearsal.
It was beautiful.
It stopped snowing.
I gotta get my coat.
Seems like a lot of people brought their families.
I have two children-- two other children.
Carl's 26. He does something
with the county court system that I don't understand,
and Lorie's a year out of college.
Free spirit, bouncing around.
And I'm... divorced.
I always had this image of you
living somewhere with this happily-ever-after family.
Ending the marriage was more difficult than I imagined.
The church saved me, gave me back my life.
Except for that part of my life
that's taken up with my business.
I own an auto parts store.
That's unusual.
I know. Nobody can quite believe it.
But it was part of the divorce settlement.
Oh.
Thank you.
Why do you need it?
You don't know?
Uh, congenital hip dysplasia.
In common parlance,
it's a birth defect.
Birth defect?
Yes.
Something I gave you.
Well, well, there's really
no way to know.
It's not that clear-cut.
Helen?
I was thinking about what you said,
about how I could've been in Chicago
a hundred times, why this time?
I think it's because I just recently
got the news that your daddy died.
Oh, no, my father died years ago.
That's not who I mean.
Your other father.
His name was Cody Boone.
Should've been a character in some old Western TV show.
We were 15.
Well, I was almost 15.
And that was in South Carolina?
Myrtle Beach.
My daddy had a miniature golf course.
Cody worked there after school.
So what happened?
Nothing fancy.
I got pregnant.
All the parents pitched a fit, and rightfully so.
And abortion wasn't legal.
Oh, I never would have done that.
Back then they had these homes for girls in my condition.
There was one up in Indiana where my aunt lived,
so they sent me up there.
That's where you were born.
Did you ever want to keep me?
Oh, of course.
Cody and I had a whole plan.
He was gonna quit school,
get work.
There was a room over his parents' garage
where we could live...
but in the end,
you're 14, 15, you got no money.
So.
I came to believe that the best thing for you
would be to be with people who could care for you
and do things for you.
It was true, right?
I don't know.
Well, what I mean is...
I know what you mean.
I had two loving parents.
I was happy,
but even with that, it somehow always... felt like rejection.
Does that make sense?
They took you so fast.
I never held you.
I never even saw you,
and nobody ever told me anything about the birth defect.
When I was a little girl, I used to wonder
if that's why I was given away--
not quite perfect.
All Jesus' children are perfect.
An-and my father, Cody, he nev... he didn't go with you?
I never saw him again.
Ever?
But when you heard he'd died...
Kinda pushed a button, huh?
I guess I'd always
thought about him over the years...
although not as much as I thought about you.
( beeping )
Oh.
That would be work.
She's concerned, and so am I.
I understand, Mr. Bulowski.
The pain is still in her neck.
And still in my arm.
Yes, I understand that, too.
I thought that you were going to help her.
Dr. Rasgotra?
Excuse me.
Mrs. Bulowski complained that she was still in pain.
And you explained to her that she
had already had her Demerol?
So she suckered you into a second shot.
Well, one could look at it that way.
Jerry, I'm back!
I didn't even know you'd been gone.
Uh, Kerry, I hope you don't take this
the wrong way but when I said to take a break,
I didn't mean it literally.
I didn't think I'd be gone so long.
We're getting slammed here.
Morris is out sick.
We're boarding ten ICU patients.
We've got charts in the rack for four hours,
12 patients on the board, and we're 50 behind in triage.
You're back. Yes.
Are you going out again? Yes.
Yes? I irrigated
the obnoxious bald guy with the head lac.
Got moved into Trauma Two.
I can take that, Susan.
Okay. Thank you.
ABBY: I don't know.
I don't understand.
JAKE: Well, after I explain, you will.
Dr. Weaver. Kerry.
I was looking for some obnoxious bald guy who needs suturing?
Yeah, he was here, but...
We put him next door.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Do you work here?
My head is throbbing, throbbing,
throbbing. No one will
even give me an aspirin. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What the hell is going on?!
Mr. Screwdriver, so nice to see you again.
Okay, Kerry...
I-I, I take full responsibility
for this patient still being in the ER.
You don't think Dr. Dubenko deserves just a soupçon of that?
He ordered an NG, a foley, three serial crits
and a four-hour chest film.
I hear everything, Mr. Scanlon.
She pretty much does.
So, do we have some hope
that this gentleman will be sent upstairs
in, let's say-- our lifetime?
Ten minutes.
Thank you, and when you're done with him, do the guy next door.
Does she have multiple personalities?
You're not on, bro.
No, Dr. Morris has failed to be on.
I was rather unceremoniously
told to bring my ass back in here.
Have you seen Neela or Carter?
No.
Dr. Barnett, you got your first case.
The well-fed, well-drugged Bulowskis in Curtain Two.
Review the chart and kick their asses out of here.
JANE: They're both good facilities.
Locked doors so patients can't wander,
and the nursing staffs are specially trained
in handling dementia patients.
Thank you so much.
Jane?
Uh... Mrs. Devon's daughter, the Pick's disease.
I was going over some of the nursing facilities with her.
And Dr. Pratt, is he even remotely
involved with this patient anymore?
Yeah. We're swamped, you know.
One of the docs is out sick,
so he's been really busy,
but he's involved. Sort of.
Wow. Wound edges are everted nicely.
Excellent approximation.
Jane does good work.
Were you waiting on a Unasyn piggyback?
Yeah, thanks, Haleh.
Don't worry, I got this.
Okay. Okay, I get it, Mrs. Devon, but please,
do not play with the Kleenex box, all right?
All right.
You know what?
4:30 and it's already dark.
Winter.
You really are leaving, aren't you?
You know that patient who was here this morning,
Sharon Williams?
Yeah.
She wasn't really a patient.
Yeah?
Do you remember when I was looking for my birth mother?
Oh, my God. You found her?
She found me.
Kerry...
Oh, I'm so happy for you.
Is it weird?
There's a lot to take in.
I mean, there are certain things that she's told me, and...
there are a lot of things I still have to tell her.
I gotta go.
I'm going to go home and change, and, uh,
I'm gonna go have some dinner.
Well, yeah. Don't worry about this place. We'll be fine.
I'll try to stop by later.
Susan, thanks.
You said you had pictures
of some relatives?
I want to hear about Africa.
Okay, we lived there when I was little.
The adoption people said the family,
your family, were involved in the church.
Were they actually missionaries?
More like wannabe missionaries.
My-my mom worked to set up new schools
and my dad was a civil engineer.
He taught me how to build a canal,
not that I've had much use for that.
Well, did you like living over there?
I was different simply for being white.
No one seemed to even notice the crutch,
and then... my parents
were older.
Their health wasn't so great,
so we moved back to Minneapolis
when I was 12, and they both passed away
when I was in college.
So they never got to see you become a doctor?
Mm-mm. Oh.
They would have been so proud of you.
I'm proud of you.
My biggest regret is that
they never got to meet their grandson.
You have a family?
Uh, my son... Henry.
He's named after my dad.
There he is.
Oh, my heavens,
what a little doll. 13 months.
Oh, that's a handful.
Between him and a full-time job,
no wonder you need a nanny.
Is your husband a doctor, too?
I'm alone now. There was an accident.
Oh, my God, Kerry.
I'm so sorry.
Was it recent?
Last year.
Oh, Kerry. My dear Kerry.
We are tested, but the Lord gives us strength.
I can only imagine how difficult this has been.
But you have to have faith.
Paul wrote
in Romans 8:
"I am convinced that neither death nor life,
"nor angels nor rulers,
"nor things present, nor things to come
"can separate us from the love of God
in Christ Jesus, our Lord."
( sighs )
( taking deep breaths )
Are you waiting?
What?
Oh, no, go ahead.
( sighs )
This is my Uncle Jackson.
Loved stealing cars.
Just had a real passion for it.
Do you have any pictures of my father?
Just one.
When I was away
in Indiana, Cody drove all the way up to see me.
Didn't even have a license yet.
For the life of me, I don't know
what we thought we had to smile about.
This is my family, Helen.
This woman's name is Sandy Lopez,
and she's not my nanny.
She was my partner.
Your partner.
My lover, my wife.
The mother of my child.
She was a firefighter,
and she died last year.
You're gay?
Yes.
I wanted to tell you earlier, but I was afraid.
My mom and dad died before I came to accept it,
so I never got a chance to tell them.
Uh...
uh, so they never knew you made this choice.
It's not a choice.
It's who I am, who I was born as.
Will you pray with me?
No. No. I am not gonna do this.
Kerry, please...
Kerry...
HELEN: I didn't mean to offend you.
I was just so glad to find you.
And my being gay changes that?
This is who I am. It's wrong, Kerry.
I knew this was a mistake. It's not what God created.
Why are people like you always saying things like that?
Why are people like you
so dismissive of people of faith?
Because you have no faith
that God knew what he was doing,
that God created me, too.
God did create you and He loves you.
What is it about us that is so much more threatening
than all the really terrible things in the world?
Don't dismiss me so easily, Kerry. People are starving,
people are being shot at,
men are flying planes into buildings,
yet the faithful are saying, "Watch out for those lesbians,
they're gonna destroy our God-gifted lives."
Well, the world isn't perfect, it's what we make it.
You just finished telling me how perfect it was.
That neither life nor death, angels nor rulers
can separate us from the love of God
in Christ Jesus, our Lord.
I know the words, Helen, I was raised in the church.
Then you know it's healing mission.
Except that the welcome sign's not out for everyone, is it?
Do you hate all faith?
No. No, of course not.
I hate that my own faith now excludes me,
tries to tell me I'm a sinner because of the people I love.
It's the people you've chosen to love.
I have made a choice:
to stop living a lie about who I am.
I was alone in my soul.
Do you know what that feels like?
My... my hotel's nearby.
I think I'll walk.
They won't budge. And I called Cleveland Memorial.
She goes there twice a week asking for Demerol.
She's in their turkey files.
We're not gonna cure her habit by denying her drugs today.
Just kick her out, please? Weaver's gonna be pissed.
Watch and learn.
Mrs. Bulowski...
I understand you're still experiencing some pain.
It's better, but I think
one more shot of Demerol would really do it.
You've already had two. Hey.
CARTER: Well, the problem is, is that
when you use it regularly, as... I think that you do,
it doesn't work as well,
and you can grow dependent on it.
Are you saying that my wife is some kind of drug addict?
You don't know what real pain is.
I'm not sure that's really fair.
MR. BULOWSKI: What do you know about fair?
Mr. Bulowski. You think it's fair
that my wife has this kind of pain?
You said you would bring her another shot, and you never came back.
Mr. Bulowski... I'm not talking to you!
Jerry, call Security.
You like stringing people along, is that it?
Okay, you need to...
Will you get the hell away from me?!
( grunting )
RAY: Come on!
( Mrs. Bulowski grunting )
Get him off of me!
Beth! Come on, Beth! Where the hell are you?
Beth! Beth! Get him off of me, Beth!
( bedpan clangs )
( panicked shouts continue )
What the hell am I doing?
( grunting )
Who's winning?
Neela was about to deck somebody with a bedpan.
JERRY: I've always wanted to see something like that.
Hard to let go of a dream, isn't it, Jerry?
So, are we under control?
Yeah, I'd say so.
Thought you were gone for the day.
Yeah. Me, too.
Charlotte? Charlotte?
It's okay, she's gonna be right back, Mrs. Devon.
Hey, where's her daughter?
She had to pick up her kids.
What's she doing? Is the roast...
is the roast going to be ready? Don't worry,
the roast is gonna be just fine, okay?
She's folding napkins for her dinner party.
The literature says that, generally, you shouldn't play
into this kind of delusional thinking,
but I don't really get the point of that in this case, do you?
You got this?
I think so.
Dr. Weaver.
What's going on with the Pick's Disease?
Found a bed for her tonight.
Her daughter managed a placement,
but they won't be able to take her till tomorrow.
Thanks. Hey, I just wanted you to know that, um,
I'm willing to have Jane assigned to me anytime.
I'll bet. She's good.
( chuckles ): Yeah, no kidding.
Hey, so, did you hear?
They're bringing in a fisherman vs. horse.
Vs. horse? Yeah, I know.
You'd think it'd be vs. fish,
which doesn't make sense, either, but... Go.
Hey, Kerry.
Hey. Aren't you in a little early?
An hour. But with Sam on days and me on nights,
we're just trying to steal a moment when we can.
Have a good night.
Thanks.
Good evening.
Can I help you?
Helen?
Helen?
( muttering ): That's the wrong...
They tell you the coffee's free.
( chuckles ): You just got to pay for the room, that's all.
You think about a day like this for a long time.
You play out every scenario in your head.
Except for this one.
Is it because I gave you up?
No. No, of course not.
Is it because I didn't come looking for you
for so many years?
You don't get to paint the whole picture yourself, Helen.
Feel guilty because you gave up a child, and then...
get all warm and fuzzy because it turned out all right:
she had a good family, became a doctor.
If you're disappointed, it should be
with the limitations of your faith,
not in the way that I've lived my life.
I gave birth to a child who I abandoned.
For all the right reasons, they told me.
But I thought about you.
And I came to realize
that by giving you up,
I'd broken my own heart.
And faith is the only thing that gave me hope.
Gave me courage.
I can't abandon it, too.
Can you accept me for who I am?
I can love you,
whoever you are.
I don't want love without acceptance.
It was so good to finally meet you.
( choir crooning harmonies )
