Previously on E.R.:
NEELA: "Dear Michael.
It's been months since I've heard from you."
MICHAEL: "Tell everybody I'm still here.
Still doing the doctor thing."
( screaming in Arabic )
MICHAEL: She could die
without the proper burn care.
She can't get that here.
Yeah, okay, I'll try.
What's going on. She's talking to Gallant.
You got 72 hours, son.
Get her there.
MAN: For Laura,
my little one.
Neela, your favorite patient
is out in Waiting, asking for you.
Oh, no, please.
Back pain guy?
Third day in a row.
LOCKHART: You can sign out to me
but you have to take care
of your boyfriend out there
before you leave the building.
Deal.
Hey, I heard the Iraqi girl's coming in today.
Have you talked with Gallant?
Not since we set it up, but when she does,
I'll call the CASH to let him know.
All right, but this time, I want to talk to him.
Who's that?
Oh, that is Tio Escobar, 17.
Superficial stab wound to the right flank.
Not him, her.
He cut me. I didn't do nothin'.
Word was, you told Drake
you were coming for him with a gun.
I didn't say that.
There were witnesses.
Mind if I take a look?
Other doctor already saw it.
Yeah, well, I'm the supervisor
so I have to check it out anyway.
The wound is superficial.
We'll be back to clean it out.
You got lucky.
This time.
Hi, I'm Dr. Pratt.
Olivia Evans. I'm with Ceasefire.
Ceasefire?
Violence prevention program.
How many
shooting victims do you see in a shift?
Too many to count.
Exactly.
So how can you not know about Ceasefire?
Wait, the name sounds familiar.
Tell me more about it.
Tio and I-- we're not... we're not done here.
Are we, Tio?
Anything else?
I'll be back.
So, what's she like?
She's a health professional, Ray.
Don't be such a dog.
( Taggart sighs )
I shouldn't have taken Franklin.
Mom, what day is it?
Wednesday.
I meant date.
It's right in front of you, Alex.
The 27th.
Dad'll be coming soon.
You spoke to him?
No, he wrote me a letter.
You never said anything.
He wrote it to me.
And he said he was coming to see you?
Yeah.
( sighs )
Alex, honey, how many times has he told you
he was going to do something, and then he didn't?
Okay, Mr. Kirkendall,
we'll do this one more time.
All right. Thanks for your patience.
Dr. Rasgotra, you got a minute?
You go right ahead, I'll be with you in a moment.
Okay, I'll-I'll wait right here. Thank you very much.
Uh, congratulations.
On what?
Yeah. The Iraqi mother and daughter arrived
early this morning.
Oh, that's great! Yeah. Is Dr. Gallant around?
I wanted to introduce him
to the plastics attending.
Excuse me?
Dr. Gallant.
Michael was in the hospital?
Yeah. I was just with him an hour ago.
Oh.
So, if you see him, could you send him my way?
The unit staff really wants to meet him.
He's, uh, he's a bit of a hero up there.
Yeah.
Registration and urgent care in the atrium,
primary care clinics over here.
36 state-of-the- art exam rooms
with a dedicated outpatient pharmacy.
Mm-hmm.
Lab and X ray suite located behind the sculpture garden.
And this?
What's this?
Commercial space.
We're already taking bids.
It'll probably go to some fast-food joint.
What?!
Sorry I'm late.
( panting )
Kerry sends her apologies,
but she, uh, had an appropriations meeting.
So... what do you think?
Very impressive.
Well, listen, uh,
public affairs is working on a press release
about the Carter Foundation contribution...
Dr. Anspaugh, I thought we agreed
that comprehensive HIV care would be very much a part
of all of this.
We cannot get into subspecialties yet.
We had struggle enough getting family med to commit.
Primary care docs can staff the HIV clinic.
There is no space for that.
Well, maybe we should pitch a tent
in the sculpture garden, or maybe
we could stake out a few tables in the burger joint.
Look, the clinic was your idea.
We are just trying to make it happen.
Primary care and comprehensive HIV treatment.
Not Architectural Digest and super-size meals.
( chuckles )
Call me when you have something else for me to look at.
12-year-old Victor Hopkins, GSW to the groin, pulse 115,
resps 20, 98/60.
And my sats are okay.
( laughs ): Well, how do you know about sats?
I heard her say it on the radio.
OLBES: Got two of morphine
en route. Mom's on her way in.
Weird trajectory for a GSW.
Who shot you, Victor?
Nobody. It just went off.
You shot yourself?
No, it was in my pocket.
What's a smart kid like you doing with a gun?
Protecting myself.
Michael, I don't know
if you're checking this cell phone.
Are you in town?
I'm a bit confused...
Call me back at the hospital, okay?
I'll be here for another hour or so.
You ran away from your back pain guy,
but he's waiting for you.
He can wait.
I heard Michael was here.
Did you know he was coming?
Yeah, sure.
You didn't mention it.
Didn't I?
He didn't stop by?
I guess he just didn't want to go over everything.
Should I continue being oblivious,
or do you want to explain
why you're bleeding from your cuticles?
I'm not crazy, am I?
Crazy?
How did I manage
to build up feelings for someone
I've spoken to once in the past year?
Well, you exchanged letters.
Letters?
What are letters?
You can think, feel,
say whatever the hell you want
in a letter to someone thousands of miles away.
It's all speculative, imagined.
It doesn't mean anything, it's just on a piece of paper.
It's okay if you're mad at him...
Mad?!
More like furious.
I'm furious that he didn't tell me
he was coming.
I'm furious that he could just walk away like that.
I'm ridiculously
desperate to see him.
None of which is based on anything more substantial
than the inner workings of my neurotic brain.
You know, I was ready to bestow my sage wisdom, but...
I think you got it covered.
Am I so pathetic
that I have to concoct a love life
out of nothing?
That's not fair.
You and Michael were very close.
It's not so crazy
that you're having these feelings.
( heavy sigh )
Graze wound to the right testicle.
It's just superficial.
Victor, you're a lucky man.
PRATT: GSW to the
right thigh, no exit.
Belly's soft.
What happened here?
I got hurt last summer.
Victor, you got shot before?
Just some kid at school.
I'm not that popular.
Victor?
Hey, Mom.
Thank God you're all right.
What happened?
Well, your 12-year-old son
had a 9mm pistol in his pocket.
He did?
Do you know where he got it?
No.
Mrs. Hopkins,
who's the gun belong to?
Boo, I taught you how to keep the safety on.
Oh, Neela. ! Oh, I'm sorry, Dr. Lewis.
I'm getting to him right now.
Oh, wow. Am I that much of a hard ass?
I was going to ask you if you'd seen Gallant.
Uh, no. Sorry. Uh, patient's waiting.
Can you sign off on an order
of Ancef for Victor Hopkins?
The prepubescent gangbanger?
More like aspiring vigilante.
And his mom's behind it.
What?!
She gave him the gun.
Get social services down.
And, um, Sam, somebody called for you.
Who?
Well, uh, he didn't leave a name,
and he sounded a bit agitated, and Frank said
that you got a similar call yesterday?
Yeah. I, uh, took care of this wheelchair vet
with ascites last week.
Kind of got a thing for me.
Do you want me to put security on alert?
No, no. It's nothing like that, thanks.
It's fine. Really.
Okay.
What's going on?
Oh, a patient wants me on the phone.
Sam, what's going on?
Nothing. What?
You don't want to tell me?
Fine.
Hey...
Come on, let's get a coffee, okay?
Have you been taking the ibuprofen, like we discussed?
KIRKENDALL: Yes. Resting?
Trying. Well, like I said yesterday,
and the day before that...
No, it was Tuesday, actually,
'cause I couldn't come Wednesday. I got busy.
Okay, a muscle spasm like this
can take weeks to heal.
Oh, I know.
So why do you keep coming back?
I believe in you,
and I keep thinking maybe you can fix me.
All right, let's do a full exam.
Uh, it's a unitard.
You know, like a bodysuit.
Okay, I'm going to step away
and let you take that off and get into a gown, okay?
Uh...
( clears throat )
I can't, I can't do it.
Why not?
Mr. Kirkendall, do you want me to help you or not?
Look, don't laugh, okay?
Okay?
Okay.
My wife used to call me, um, uh, Clark,
as in Clark Kent.
Look, I can't examine you properly
unless you undress...
She said she could see through my,
you know, everyday disguise,
and underneath my unassuming facade,
there was, uh, there was something else...
Something else?
A, uh... a secret strength.
A special person.
The power of a locomotive.
Mr. Kirkendall...
On Tuesday
it'll be 19 weeks since she died.
I'm sorry.
Allergic to nuts and, uh,
accidentally ate an almond in someone's birthday cake.
That's awful.
So, after she passed, I bought the suit,
and I wear it under my clothes on the really bad days,
and, uh, I don't know, it makes me feel, uh...
better.
You weren't wearing it yesterday.
Oh, yesterday was a good day.
You think I'm crazy.
Uh, well, I wouldn't say that.
Oh, you think I'm crazy.
No, I think...
I think I can examine you over your suit.
I wasn't sure what the calls were
until Alex told me about the letter this morning.
So he's here.
I guess so.
What do you want to do?
I'm not going to run away again.
Especially not now.
I don't want you to have to worry, it's my problem.
I kind of think it's our problem.
I'm Dr. Carter.
What do you got, Dr. Pratt?
12-year-old,
GSW to the thigh. Vitals stable.
Waiting on an X ray.
And a social work consult. The kid had a pistol.
He's too smart for his own good.
Bullies tease him, he mouths off right back.
He tell you what happened last year?
Tony Ramsey,
the biggest doof at my school,
told him he won a Darwin award for the most inbred.
( chuckling )
I didn't think he'd actually shoot me.
He shot you at school?
No, on my way home.
Kid went to juvie, was back in class four months later.
Still, a gun's not the answer.
I didn't know what else to do.
9mm in the femoral triangle.
Pulse is weak.
I'll page Angio.
We may not have time for that.
What's wrong?
He's going to need surgery.
Surgery? Again?
'Fraid so.
Curtain Four has a biliary colic.
Ultrasound and lipase are normal.
Better after two of morphine.
Okay, home and follow up with PMD.
Uh, DUB has settled down,
and going home with GYN follow-up.
And in Curtain Two, I've got the...
You mean, the superhero
over there?
Yeah, a repeat customer
with lower back pain.
No reproducible paraspinal tenderness...
Hey, is it true what I just heard?
Is Gallant back? ...and, uh, uh...
That's the rumor, but nobody's seen him.
...normal neuro exam. Is he drug-seeking?
Probably went to see his parents.
I just think he's lonely.
I've got him on round the clock ibuprofen
and gave him a referral for grief counseling.
Neela, is that right?
Gallant's parents, they in Texas?
Uh, yeah. Yeah, I believe so.
Is that it?
I don't really know much about his parents.
I meant the patient.
Oh, no, that's it. Okay.
Coffee and a jelly donut, please.
Same thing every day, Doc.
Try a cruller. Crullers are nice.
I'll stick to the donut, thank you.
I didn't even know you were coming.
Ah, Jamila was, uh, touch and go.
My CO sent me at the last minute.
You didn't call?
We were only in Germany for about an hour or so...
I meant today.
Dubenko told me you left, so I thought...
I just... I had to do something.
But I couldn't leave without seeing you.
I mean, I thought it might be easier that way, but...
but I couldn't.
Everyone's sad you didn't come by.
( sighs )
It's just it...
I mean, it feels weird, you know,
being back in the world.
The thought of going into the E.R.
and having to answer
all those questions about, you know, what I'm doing,
and what it's like over there...
How long can you stay?
I fly back out tomorrow morning.
I only came to make sure the girl got here safely.
( cell phone ringing )
Hello?
I left all the orders on the chart, it's all there.
I'm at... lunch, Frank.
At Ike's.
No, I can't come back. He'll be fine.
What happened there?
Uh... nothing.
It's just a... just a little gash.
( pager beeping )
This morning I went to, uh...
I went to see the family of a guy I knew from Iraq.
He died right before I left.
And I-I, uh...
I brought something that he got for his daughter.
I'm sorry.
Monday, his wife
saw two men walking, uh... towards her door
in dress uniforms.
She begged them to go away,
told them, uh, told them that they must have the wrong house.
But they didn't.
And she, uh, she knew why...
she knew why they were there.
( breathes deeply )
She knew.
Neela's superhero won't leave.
What's the problem?
He won't say.
Want me to call security?
Hey, um, do you think maybe someone could page her?
You know what, I'm sorry.
She's home in bed.
No she's not. She's over at Ike's.
Well, who's Ike?
I mean, maybe we could call him?
Why don't I see if I can track her down.
Thanks.
MAN: Hey, you got a hot nurse here named Samantha Taggart?
Yeah, what's your name?
Steve. Steve Curtis.
It's okay, Frank.
I got this.
You still hanging in there?
Looking for Sam?
Yeah, I can't believe she's lasted
over a year in this place.
Do you need some water or something?
If she hasn't run off by now,
you must have her chained to a bed or something.
Let's step over here for a minute.
PRATT: But seriously, how long
do I have to wait for these scans?
I need those now.
Hey, Olivia. I'll call you back.
Hey, I wanted to tell you
I was very impressed with what you said
to that kid back there.
Thanks.
And I was wondering if I could
talk to you about another patient of mine.
This 12-year-old kid,
he came in with a gun.
Unfortunately,
that doesn't surprise me.
No, but this is a smart kid.
Not a tough guy, not yet.
And I was hoping, you know, you could, uh, do your thing.
My thing?
( chuckles )
Wow. Somebody's been practicing.
I didn't like the way you ran the table last time.
Wait, wait, hold on a second.
What?
I'm your bridge.
Go ahead, you can reach.
I hope you're not about to get too competitive,
because it looks as if I'm about to beat you.
Michael.
Hey. Hi.
Abby, hi. Hey.
Thought you left already.
Well, not exactly.
How's it going?
Uh...
That's a tough one to answer, I guess.
Yeah, how you been?
Very good.
Yeah, uh, I came by, uh, to try to bring you back
for that Kirkendall guy,
but I'll just take care of it.
Thank you.
Are you going to stop by?
Um, I'm not sure. Say I said hi.
It's good to see you. Yeah.
And, uh, I hope you know that we all think about you.
Yeah, me, too.
Okay.
I know it's a bad thing,
but I'm just trying to level the playing field.
They all have weapons at his school.
PRATT: After what happened today, you really want
your little boy walking around with a gun?
Give us a minute to talk... Look, Victor was shot last year.
I can't let that happen again.
It just did. Excuse me?
I work two jobs. I can't watch him every minute.
But he's a good kid. I can tell.
But... you know what?
A man like you can be tough
just by staying away from problem situations.
You got to grow up so you can be the president
and fix our public schools.
I'd rather be a pilot.
OLIVIA: Whatever you want,
so long as you don't mess up your young years.
Avoid those bad kids. How?
They follow me on my way to school.
Here's what we're going to do.
You see that tough guy over there?
When you get better,
he's going to walk you to school for a week.
What? Wait...
And if you give up your gun,
I'll have someone walk you
to and from school every day after.
And each week your escort is going to get bigger
and scarier than that guy.
Just point me to her, okay?
I don't need a baby-sitter.
You're not really allowed to be back here.
We're making an exception.
Wow. Thanks.
There's a lounge down the hall.
Well, aren't you the man.
Listen, this is where I work, okay?
I don't want any trouble.
So just get her for me.
She'll be out as soon as she's free.
Any tingling here?
No.
How about here?
Uh-uh.
Here? A little.
All right,
here we go, Victor.
I will be your driver today.
Ray... You can thank me later, Sam.
Come here for a second.
All right.
Look at this bullet.
There's a chip missing.
Let's talk ballistics later, all right?
15 minutes is not going to change his outcome.
Should show this to Carter.
Hey, Vascular's waiting.
He's got a bounding popliteal pulse.
Surgeons are all set to do a femoral repair,
but he's got a fragment in the popliteal artery.
Well, Victor's got to be in pre-op in five minutes,
or they're gonna cancel the case. X ray, please.
I just want to make sure they're not operating on the wrong side.
They're just going to figure that out upstairs. Hi. We need a tech
in Trauma Two for a right knee.
Okay, come on, we don't need this, all right?
This is my patient, Sam. I don't want this.
Yeah, you do. Show that to Carter.
Make Vascular wait.
Thank you.
She can't be pulled away while she's with a patient.
STEVE: Okay, boss, I think we're done.
It's okay. Thanks.
I got it.
Big guy's kind of tense.
So it's serious with this guy?
Yeah, it is.
I'm glad it's working out for you.
Do you want to talk?
Has anybody been looking for me?
No. Nobody's contacted you?
Why?
Never mind.
Steve, what'd you do?
Nothing. Noth... I just...
I-I owe a guy some money.
Could I...
could I borrow some cash?
Steve...
I n... I need it. I do, Sam.
I-I'm going to take Alex on a little trip, okay?
What? I may... I may not see him for a while,
and I'd like to spend some time with him.
He's in school.
What is he, third grade?
So he'll miss finger painting class.
He's in the fifth grade; he's studying the Constitution.
But he's still my kid, right?
Please, Steve?
You know it's a bad idea.
Yeah, I guess you're right.
Hey, look, if you want, maybe the three of us
could go get some dessert or something together.
You could catch up with him a little bit.
He'd like that.
Yeah.
I got to hit the road.
I'll... I'll just call him, 'kay?
But, uh...
what about the money?
I think I only have about $40 on me.
How much do you need?
A couple hundred would be good.
Come on, there's an ATM around the corner.
So, you still having a bad time at, uh, at work?
Oh, I'm sure I overstated it.
It's just I came to work here and fell into old patterns,
from college, from growing up
and all the stuff I wanted to get away from.
I mean, one day you realize that's how people see you,
that's who you are to them,
even if that's not who you want to be.
So you don't like who you are?
I don't always like how people see me.
Ah.
You can change that.
Be someone different tomorrow.
Come on.
What? Where are we going?
Millennium Park-- it's new--
and then I'm taking you to dinner.
Dr. Kovac, can I talk to you?
Sure, Frank.
I know it's none of my business.
I was a cop, and I can still
sniff out a skel when I see one.
Guy's name is Curtis, right?
Yeah.
A detective I know at the 1-5
checked the NCIC for me.
NCIC?
National Crime Information Center.
He pulled up this arrest warrant from Colorado.
I thought you should know.
Thanks, Frank.
Is the film back on my GSW kid?
Uh, not sure.
Pratt and Ray are in with him now.
You okay? Yeah.
Where's Steve? Gone. It's all right.
He just wanted some money. No, there's something else
we need to talk about. I saw something on TV once
where they cut the wrong leg off.
Nobody's cutting your leg off. Just a minute, okay?
ALICE: Do I have to sign something?
RAY: Anesthesia has the consent forms upstairs.
Where are you guys going? To the O.R.
No, we have to wait for the results of Victor's...
X ray.
You were right.
Bullet fragment in the popliteal fossa.
Nice catch, Sam.
Vascular's scrubbed and waiting.
My mom says I can eat ice cream for dinner after I wake up.
Yeah? Well, your mom is pretty cool.
Thanks for everything.
Yeah. Ditto that.
Anytime.
Alex left school with Erica.
Yeah, she's tutoring him today.
Frank got this.
It's about Steve.
What, you had Frank snoop on Steve?
He just did it.
He robbed a market outside Denver.
A cashier got hurt.
What?
Oh, my...
I mean, he's gotten in trouble before,
but nothing like this.
We should call the police.
No, I can't...
He's Alex's Dad.
I can't be responsible for getting him locked up.
Oh, Sam, I need you to work a couple hours of overtime.
I lost my MICN. I can't.
I need someone who can work the radio.
Yeah, I'm sorry, Dr. Lewis.
It's just till Chuny gets in.
She's stuck on the I-90.
Yeah, I know, but...
Hey, come on, Sam, I've cut you some breaks.
Help me out here.
Hey, Susan, I'm going to take the sled collision in Two.
Oh, okay, wait. Thanks, Sam.
It's okay, I'll go straight home.
All right.
Call me as soon as you get there, okay?
Okay.
So, Chuck and I have basically
been hibernating for a year with Cosmo,
and I'm trying to get us to reenter the social world.
So I was thinking that maybe you and Wendall
could come over sometime for dinner.
If you don't mind
talking over the static of a baby monitor.
Oh, that's a really nice offer.
Yeah, I'd love to.
But things with, uh, Wendall didn't work out.
Oh. I'm sorry.
Yeah, it's weird.
She's actually not really even speaking to me.
Are you all right?
Yeah, I'm good. I-I'm fine.
I just, um...
Just what?
I don't know.
I just kind of feel like lately I've...
fallen off the tracks.
It's taken me a little while to figure how to get back on.
Will you call the office later
and let me know how Victor's doing?
You got it.
After he's discharged we'll set up a schedule
for you to walk Victor to school.
You weren't serious about that.
I'm serious about everything I say to these kids.
Um, I'm kinda busy.
We're all busy, Dr. Pratt.
So, what, you going to stamp out violence in Chicago
one kid at a time?
That's the plan.
( Pratt sighs )
It's like any other epidemic.
How do you contain TB?
Knock on doors and give out meds.
You stop the flu by giving out vaccine shots
on street corners. It's the same thing.
Yeah, but there's no meds and no vaccine.
The kids I know who carry guns,
you can't talk them out of it.
We react to every single shooting
even if no one gets hurt.
We mobilize a neighborhood response
every time someone fires a gun.
Stigmatize violence and death rates will drop.
It sounds good.
It's working.
Come by and see for yourself.
The address is on the card.
It looks like a frat house.
Yeah, it's definitely lived-in.
That's what you get
for rooming with a rock and roll resident.
Where are you staying tonight?
Uh, a buddy of mine took over my old lease.
I'm probably going to sack out there.
I'm hungry. Are you?
Yeah, yeah, definitely.
Well, I'll just go and get changed then.
Me, too.
I could use walking around in some civvies for awhile.
Okay, well, I'll be back in a minute.
Okay.
What are you craving?
What's that?
What kind of food do you want?
Chinese, deep dish,
burgers?
Uh, deep dish sounds good.
Or, uh, Thai.
There's this great place on Indiana.
Yeah, yeah. You know, whatever you think is good.
( tailgate slams shut )
I'm just picking up some of my stuff.
You broke into our apartment?
Alex let me in.
Where is he? Upstairs.
Where's the baby-sitter?
I sent her home.
Okay. Put it all back.
What?
It doesn't belong to you.
You see this?
I gave her this.
Okay?
What about the TV and the stereo?
You keep whatever you want.
I'll go check on Alex.
Alex is fine.
I'll go see.
No.
You don't want to do that.
( strained grunting )
ALEX: Luka.
It's nothing, kiddo.
Just a little disagreement.
What's all that for?
Dad's taking me to Florida.
We're going to get a bungalow by the beach
and watch the whales migrate.
Mom said it was okay.
Alex, go back up.
No.
Alex, now!
Easy hoss, not your kid.
Listen, you can take whatever you want,
I don't care,
but he's not going anywhere with you.
Think about it.
You really want to get him into all that?
Hey, we'll catch the whales in the fall, kiddo.
I'm going the other direction. What?
Come on, now, don't be upset. You said we'd...
You said we're going to go to Florida.
You can't miss that much school.
Doc here's got a point.
We'll do it next time.
Come on, buddy,
don't make this harder on me.
That's right.
Wow.
If that's your deep dish pizza outfit,
I'm glad I didn't say French food.
Let me just, uh, turn off the light.
( inhales sharply )
*
( moans )
It's pretty.
Can't sleep?
Nah.
Does it hurt?
No, not really.
What happened?
There was a, uh, a patient brought in...
he was part of a unit that got caught in a firefight.
They had men down, they needed help getting them out alive.
( rapid gunfire )
Get him out of here! Quick!
( rapid gunfire )
GALLANT: I never thought I'd be in the middle of it.
( yells )
We'll cover you! Get going!
But there I was.
And all I cared about
was getting us both the hell out of there.
( rapid gunfire )
( yells )
( panting )
Three of our men died there that day.
I don't know how many Iraqis.
( gunshots )
( rapid gunfire )
It's funny, what you were saying earlier
about, uh, wanting to be... someone different.
I keep wishing I could go back to who I was.
All we can do is keep moving forward.
I wish you didn't have to go back.
It won't be too long before I'm home for good.
They're in 3-L?
Yeah, burn unit.
Morning.
Morning, uh, Dr. Gallant.
I didn't realize we'd see you again.
Yeah, I'm just on my way back.
Uh, Hayat,
this is, uh, Dr. Rasgotra.
Neela.
DUBENKO: We were able to lighten
her sedation for a few minutes.
She squeezed her mom's hand.
( pager beeping )
Um, sorry.
It's the E.R.
I'll be right back.
I'll be a minute.
Probably forgot to sign a chart.
Okay, uh... yeah, I'll wait right here.
Why don't you come down? Abby's there and Pratt.
I don't have a lot of time.
Okay, I'll come get you.
CHUNY: Systolic's down to 60.
CARTER: Fluids wide open.
Hang two of O-neg,
and type and cross for four more.
LOCKHART: I'm in, pass me the bag.
Oh, no. I saw him yesterday, he was fine.
LOCKHART: Never left, he just signed in again at the triage desk.
Got good breath sounds, let's call X ray.
Aorta's dilated, abdomen's full of blood.
What happened?
Looks like a ruptured triple-A.
All right, prep the chest.
Thoracotomy tray to Dr. Pratt.
His pain was musculoskeletal.
Bradycardic, 58.
Mig of atropine.
Come on, get the blood on the rapid
infuser right now.
PRATT: Ten blade. I missed it.
Well, he's a young guy
with no risk factors, it's an atypical
presentation.
Well, I could have done a CT.
Nobody would have done that.
CARTER: Never lost a pulse,
he's got a shot.
PRATT: Let's go, Neela. Get sterile.
( knocking )
I didn't know you were up.
I know you're mad.
And I know that he's your father,
and nothing's gonna change that.
But you and me and Luka, we're a team now, right?
We're in this together.
And last night, he had to make a decision.
And what he did, he did because it was best for you
and that was the right thing,
whether or not you like it.
I have to pee.
Hey, come here.
Talk to me, okay?
I know you're sad and that's okay.
( sobbing )
LOCKHART: Subclavian's in, good flush.
Run in a liter while we wait for the other blood.
This clamp keeps slipping.
Try the DeBakey?
Already did.
LOCKHART: Systolic's down to 54.
Chuny, can you get the burn unit
on the line for me, please?
We don't need the burn unit.
No, I know, I just...
Aorta' s flat. He's bleeding out.
Okay team, this is a race.
Let's get that blood up as fast as we can,
let's up the dopa to 20 and stand by with epi.
It's the O.R., they want to know when he's coming.
We're not gonna transfer him until he's cross-clamped.
I'll make sure they got a team ready. ! Neela, come here.
Hold the descending aorta, okay? Don't let go.
LOCKHART: Neela, I can do that.
It's okay.
I got it.
PRATT: Oh, look who's here.
CARTER: Pratt, call for FFP
and cryo, he's going to need it.
( chuckling ): Big Mike.
I knew you'd show.
But you've got the worst timing, though,
We got a nasty triple-A in there.
Yeah, I can't stay anyway.
Hold on.
Yeah, this is Dr. Pratt in the E.R. No, wait...
I know you're going to let me buy you a beer, right?
Not this time. Listen, Greg, I need a favor.
Yeah, I need two units of cryo and FFP right away. Name it.
Can you give this to Neela? I gotta go.
No, no, just send it straight to the O.R.
All right? Thanks.
Uh, what's up?
Tell her not to open it unless, uh...
unless something happens to me.
Nothing's gonna happen to you.
I just want her to have it just in case.
You okay, man?
Everything all right?
CARTER: Come on, Pratt, let's go.
He could code on the way.
Dr. Carter.
Hey, Mike, good to see you.
Take care of yourself, huh?
All right, back off
the tidal volume, you'll blow a lung.
LOCKHART: Systolic's 65.
CARTER: All right, crank up the epi.
( engine revving )
( sighs )
( helicopter blades whirring )
( helicopter approaching )
