Previously on ER:
What, you got Frank to snoop on my ex?
He robbed a market outside Denver.
A cashier got hurt.
Failure to recall basic
respiratory principles, unsupervised umbilical lines
in an infant and a fatal air embolism?
Wow.
Don't sign this contract unless you are sure
this is what you want to do.
You from Chicago? Mm-hmm.
Any relation to, uh, Charlie Pratt?
I don't know him.
I'm moving back to Africa.
I'm not leaving without you and I'm not living without you.
I love you.
KOVAC: I rented a Ninja movie for Alex.
Maybe we can watch it tonight when I get home.
He's got a math test in the morning.
Hard to keep track.
He's not talking much lately.
( sighs )
Alex keeps asking when he can visit his dad.
You think that's a good idea?
He doesn't know.
Steve keeps telling him
that he's got some new job in Colorado.
Sam, you've got to tell Alex the truth.
Steve promised me that he would.
Do you want me to tell him?
CARTER: Hey! Hey!
Hey, can I get a hand with this?
Your farewell feast?
Pizza and sodas. I think I got off cheap.
Africa, huh?
That's where she is.
I gotta go. I don't have a baby-sitter.
I'm sorry I'm gonna miss your party.
Take care of yourself, Dr. Carter.
Party?
Shut up, it's a surprise.
I just can't believe it's your last shift.
Last 72 minutes, to be exact.
But who's counting?
Okay, come and get it!
( groans )
Carnivores... All right.
Veggies.
11 years, all we get's a few lousy pizzas?
Yeah, man, I was getting ready to get the search and rescue team.
I took a little detour by the river.
I wanted to see them turn on the lights at the Wrigley Building.
Yeah, must have been
after you picked up the pies, 'cause it's cold.
Maybe you want to re-think the pizza thing.
Dr. Carter, we have a resident
for a fall on outstretched hand?
I'll take it.
I'm Miss Fleming, the school nurse.
This is Janell.
How'd this happen, Janell?
Well, I tried to spike the ball,
and I got caught in the net.
Uh-huh.
She's very energetic.
Are they called "residents"
because they live in the hospital?
And very curious.
Is it true that people can have face transplants?
Yes, it is.
In fact, I'm 80 years old.
I got this off a dead guy.
Dr. Carter, I'm leaving an 18 month old
with febrile seizure in Two.
Yeah, give it to Abby or Neela.
Okay.
Still post-ictal but temp's coming down.
You get a CT?
No history of trauma.
LP?
The kid's got a URI, no meningismus.
Oh, so you figured out
a way to evaluate meningismus
in toddlers? Congratulations.
How long's the kid been here?
Half an hour.
LP's not strictly indicated,
but if he's not back to baseline
in an hour, we get it anyway. Good.
And don't look now, but the next set
of victims is on their way.
Exam Room Three. Trauma One
and Trauma Two over there.
Computer hacker with a paronychia
needs a quick I and D in Exam Two,
but since my shift's not over
for another six more minutes,
I guess I'll handle it myself.
Come on, what's a little cuticle pus between friends?
You guys gotta learn to get each other's backs.
Exam Two. Paronychia. I and D.
I'll get your next prolapsed rectum.
You're a peach.
Ray, Cubs game starts in an hour. Wanna grab a beer?
I'm sorry, Chief, but my buddy's
having a party, and I promised him
I'd be there. Sounds good.
Meet you in front. What?
We'll stop by my place on the way so I can change.
PRATT: And if you look here, this is the Admit area.
I want you to take a look at these sad and tired faces.
See, you're the "before" pictures,
and I want you to meet the "after."
Trying to frighten them?
Jane, congratulations.
Yeah, I was really counting on Bellevue.
Nice to see you again, Abby.
Uh, I'm sorry.
I trailed you for a few days
during my third year. Jim Babinski.
As in the Babinski reflex?
Cool. Any relation?
Nope. None at all.
I'm gonna go get them some lockers
and then let them tail you guys around.
Finally getting the long coats, huh?
Pretty thrilling.
MAN: I don't want to!
All right, here we go.
Lesson number one-- floor control.
Sir! Sir, you're going to have
to get back on the gurney.
Come on! Are we really about to become R2's?
All right, calm down. Take it easy. Relax, relax. Come on.
No turning back now.
My contract is signed and sealed on Lewis's desk.
Mine, too.
Yeah, I got some things to think about.
Like what?
Susan was just pushing you, Ray.
Don't let it get to you.
I don't know, maybe she was right.
Maybe it's time for me to make a change.
PRATT: Get back on the gurney.
( patient grunting )
Leave me alone!
Hey! Get off!
Take it easy! Calm down!
Lucky for us...
interns bounce.
What do you mean, I might not have any fun?
I'm just saying, you're not gonna know anybody.
You never know-- I'm into the music scene.
Gigs, demos, whatnot.
How's it going, guys?
All good.
Is Nick around?
Try the penthouse.
( music playing )
MORRIS: Good to get out once in a while, isn't it?
Forget about the daily responsibility we carry
as healers and just mingle with regular people.
Okay, listen-- don't talk like that.
What, like a doctor?
Like a bonehead.
I wouldn't want to see you getting bounced
down all these stairs by a bunch of my pals.
Duly noted.
Hey, Riles, what's up?
What's up? Make yourself at home, bro.
Beer upstairs?
Yeah. Catch me later.
This is about me being chief, isn't it?
What?
You're a little bitter.
Morris, I couldn't care less.
I've been meaning to talk to you about that.
What?
Your lack of initiative.
( sighs )
Yo, Barnett!
Hey, hey.
What's up?! What's up, man?
How's it hanging?
Uh, this is Archie. We work together.
I thought you were gonna bring the roomie.
Neela had to work.
Is Jessica here?
Yeah, she is.
*
So you're a doctor too?
Well, chief resident.
Wow. That means, like, nothing to me.
Hey, Vanessa!
Nice meeting you.
( music playing )
Okay, Mr. Enriquez.
Are you gonna crack his chest?
That feels like a ganglion cyst.
What's "ganglion" mean?
Have you had any luck finding her parents?
She was supposed to be at a friend's house tonight.
They're stuck out on a lake cruise.
They wanted a romantic night out,
just the two of them.
I bet they did.
So? Can you fix it?
Well, unless it bothers you, I would avoid the surgery.
Most of the time, these things turn out to be benign.
If you say so.
What's "benign" mean?
Janell, stop bothering the doctor.
Who says I'm bothering him?
Dr. Carter. Just got a call
from Building Services.
The sewer pipes they fixed last week?
They're broken again.
So, we only have one O.R. open.
All right. Let's watch the trauma traffic,
and try not to get overextended.
Break out the buckets.
Chuny, is Curtain Two clear?
Pick a bed, any bed.
32-year old actor,
smacked by falling scenery.
Now, are you a bull cow, or are you for milking?
The bleeding won't stop.
Should have been wearing your headpiece there.
I was, it broke.
A and 0 times four, no LOC.
All right. Neela, you got that?
Good thing I'm not Hindu.
37-year-old male, abrasions
and first-degree burns to the torso and extremities.
What's all this about?
Community theater gone bad.
It's an Equity showcase.
Excuse me?
We're mounting an original musical
about the great Chicago fire.
I had a little tiff with Mrs. O'Leary's fat cow over there.
Learn the blocking, you clod!
Listen for your cue, Elsie!
I'd say you definitely have this.
I love the theater.
And where might you two be going?
To get some coffee. Ambulance run.
Dr. Carter, asthmatic in Three is waking up.
Hey, Tony, you seen KJ?
Who? The Volunteen kid I hooked up.
Oh, yeah, Nurse's desk.
All right. Hey, man.
It's not gonna be the same without you.
Oh, you'll survive.
See you at the party?
Party?
I don't know anything about any parties.
Hey.
Finish breaking down those charts?
Yeah, I took yellows back to Medical Records
like you told me.
Good. It's after 8:00.
What are you still doing here?
Waiting on my dad. He's late.
Did he say how late he's gonna be?
You have anybody that can take you home?
No, but he'll show, though.
All right, come on.
I'll take you home.
First I gotta hit this party.
What party?
Check it out. Huh? Huh?
Music notes?
No, man.
Try the opening guitar licks to "Free Bird."
( singing guitar riff )
Oh, Benny, we got it.
You had a hep B shot lately? I mean, the tat's
really red around the edges.
You might want to keep an eye on that.
Oh, my God!
Doc Barnett talking the talk, man! You!
You're a doctor?
Yeah, yeah, I guess so.
That's really cool.
Yeah?
Then, yes, I'm a doctor.
Got anything for heartburn?
No, man. How about some mellowing agents?
Man, there is mellowing agents all over this place, okay?
It's kinda hot in here.
Wanna go get a drink?
Sure.
Okay.
Uh-oh.
*
I thought you were a musician.
Oh, medicine's the way I pay the music bills.
Ahh...
( man howls )
Hello up there! Beer here!
Yo!
What's up?
Toss us down another couple of brews, bro.
All right.
You ready?
( grunting )
( laughing )
So, how's the double life treating you?
Well, some days are better than others.
That's interesting.
Hey, any more Jagermeister around?
Uh... try inside.
Hey. Archie.
Yeah, I introduced you two ten minutes ago.
Oh.
Is that guy really your boss?
Huh?
That's what he's been saying.
MAN: I hadn't even kicked over the lantern yet.
You missed your cue
on account of all that mooing.
10ccs of lido and 5-O on a needle driver, please.
I'm doing the job of two actors.
And giving half a good performance, assboy.
Son of a bitch!
Unless you'd like a saline shower,
keep your head still.
LOCKHART: How'd you get these burns?
It must have been the light stand.
I'm not gonna be scarred, am I?
Nothing too serious.
Hey, Abby, got a minute?
Sure.
Because I usually play leads.
600 of ibuprofen and silvadene dressing.
I use my body
a lot as an actor.
You mean, like in pornos?
You've seen my work?
What an idiot.
Okay, I'll be right back.
What do you need?
There's a bunch of people waiting at Ike's,
so I thought I'd walk Carter over.
You guys are good?
Are we taking traumas?
The pipes won't be fixed
for three or four hours, so not till then.
Okay. And I'd like to get over there
at some point, too.
We'll rotate.
I'll be back in half an hour.
You ready to go to my surprise party?
Yup.
( television playing )
Hey there.
ALEX: Hey.
Did you check your sugar before dinner?
Ninety-two.
That's good.
Did Erica help you with your math?
Yeah.
Did you remember to tell her to pick you up tomorrow?
No.
Are you done with your homework?
I'm doing it.
Looks like you're watching TV to me.
( hip-hop music playing )
( music stops )
You got a letter from your dad.
As soon as you finish studying.
Mom...
Alex.
It's my mail.
My rules.
You're such a...
Excuse me?
Where's Luka?
He's at work.
Are you still fighting?
No.
We're going to have to move again, aren't we?
Yeah, I'm bringing him right now.
Okay. Right.
What was that about?
Just telling them to be ready.
Act surprised.
I'll act surprised.
GROUP: Surprise!
( laughing )
You guys, you got me!
KYLE: Ray.
NICK: Who wants a burger?
Yo, Ray, Your boy's hurling in here, man.
Stay here, okay?
I won't move.
All right.
He almost made it to the bathroom.
Hey, sweetie, you okay?
Yeah. You going to come out here?
Yeah, one second.
Let me just finish talking to these guys, huh?
*
( groaning )
Stupid, stupid, stupid.
Easy, easy. Stupid, stupid.
( sighs )
Hi.
You know, I admire you, Ray.
You're one of those guys
who just glide over every speed bump.
It all comes so easy.
But me... people don't expect much from me.
Most of the time, I prove them right.
I guess that's why I wanted chief, you know.
Show 'em I could do it.
Look, it's not so easy for me either.
I-/////!m just pretty good at faking it.
Yeah.
Oh, my God.
( retching ) I'll go get you some water.
I swear to God, that's what she said.
Get out of here.
Hey, he okay?
He gets excited.
Hey, Ray!
Find me some aspirin, too?
( sighs )
Sure thing.
Molly!
( whimpering ): Ray...?
Ray!
No!
No!
( victims yelling and groaning )
WOMAN: Call 911.
Okay, call 911!
We've got at least 20 people injured here.
Oh, man.
KYLE: Molly, where are you, baby?!
Molly?!
( groaning )
Jess, Jess, I got you. I got you.
You all right?
I'm burning...
You breathing okay?
Yeah.
Molly?!
Hey, over here, this kid's stuck!
You, you, get over here.
Stay with her, okay?
Help me! Somebody help me!
The ambulances are on their way.
Stay with her. Don't move her.
If she passes out, come and get me.
No, Ray, don't go! I'll be back.
Ray, man, stop that! Get over here, and help me get him out!
( victims groaning )
Talk to me, Molly.
Come on, baby, keep talking to me.
WOMAN: My friend's hurt. Help me get her to my car!
Okay, everybody, stop. Stop!
Shh, shh...
I'm a doctor, okay?
The paramedics are on their way.
So what we need to do in the meantime,
is just clear out all this crap
and uncover as many bodies as we can,
but nobody move anybody
until I get to check them over first, okay?
Is the cow all fixed up?
Both ends.
May they go now?
I'll be with you in a moment, sir.
He's here for the actors.
It's his play they ruined. Oh.
MAN: My stage manager is filling in.
Horrid.
But if I can get them back in time,
I might still have a second act.
I doubt these guys are up for it.
They're professionals.
You know-- "the show must go on."
Yeah. Why is that exactly?
I mean, why can't the show just stop once in awhile?
Keep the pressure going, okay?
Stay here. Don't move.
Tachy at 120. Pulse is weak and thready.
It hurts when I breathe. All right, all right.
Yeah. Breath sounds are on the bad side.
So no tension pneumo?
Paramedics to him first.
He needs two liters of saline ASAP.
Ray. Please. Just another sec, okay?
Jess, you're okay. You're okay.
Ray!
They're coming, man.
( groaning ) Keep tight.
Ray, come here, man.
I think she cut her ear, man.
Okay, well, that's one possibility.
Molly? Molly? Follow my finger.
You got a headache?
I feel okay.
How many weeks are you?
38. Is the baby okay?
Benny?
Can I have it now?
On the table.
Mom...
Hmm?
Are we ever going to live with Dad again?
Alex.
He's got a good job now.
He's a river guide. It's cool.
We're not going to live with your dad.
Hey, I got you those marshmallow cookies.
I want to go read my letter.
( groaning )
Easy, Nick. We're going to get you fixed up.
Four of MS and monitor the foot pulses.
All right, we got at least four other criticals,
and I'm not sure who's still under there.
Loading the pregnant lady and chest pain.
Working on the impaled girl.
Okay. What else?
Okay. We got six dead over there.
Plus about another 15 non-criticals,
fractures and contusions.
We were only eight minutes behind the call.
Yeah?
You assessed over 25 patients in eight minutes?
There's no paperwork out here.
Morris is with you, right?
Yeah. Send him to Saint Rafe's.
He needs a banana bag.
No, we'll send the criticals there.
The rest can go on to Lakeview.
Saint Rafe's? Why not County?
You guys closed to trauma. Got the call an hour ago.
Whoa, this is a level one.
St. Rafe's can't possibly take care of the patients like we can
Well, if you can get County to open, all the better.
It's a lot closer.
County General on two bravo.
Ray? You're with Rescue 56?
Our Ray?
No, she's not here. Him either.
We got Abby.
Thanks.
Ray, what's going on?
Porch collapse. Lots of wounded.
Five criticals.
We need you to open up right now.
No, we only have one working O.R.
They won't all need the O.R.
It's mostly blunt trauma.
Okay, we can accept one critical.
Come on, Abby. Take all five.
No. No, we're understaffed here.
They might not make it anywhere else.
Ray, we don't have any attendings.
Abby, you're a doctor. You can do this.
No. No, I'd have to run it by Kovac.
There isn't any time.
CPR guy's flat-lined.
Okay, we are down to four criticals.
Ray, I can't...
Come on, County General.
Will you accept these patients?
Abby, you're being recorded, you know.
I know.
Rescue 56, we're taking four trauma patients.
You have blanket orders for IVs, c-spine and O-2.
Thank you, County.
We're four minutes out.
Okay...
Okay, let's get patients out of trauma,
sutures and curtain two.
Jerry, call the O.R., tell them to set up another room.
Chuny, page Kovac.
KOVAC: Okay, listen up.
Okay, first of all--
you should all eat and drink well,
because the party's on Weaver.
That is a surprise.
If you guys are still on duty,
don't let me see a beer in your hand.
Hey, 11 years.
Couldn't we spring for some caviar for the man?
Anyway, uh...
There's something my father would say
when... when a friend went on a journey.
And, uh...
he said it to me when I came to the United States first.
So I thought of it today when I realized
I wouldn't be working with this guy anymore.
Not for a long time at least.
Uh...
My father would, uh...
clasp the person's hand,
and say, uh...
"We only part to meet again."
Here, here.
Yeah! ( applause )
Cheers.
Cheers, everybody.
To Carter. Cheers. Cheers.
To the doc.
Burst eardrum, no battle sign.
When's her due date?
May 29.
Tachy at 128 after a liter.
Systolic's only 84.
All right, get her on her side.
One, two... What are you doing?
Yeah, I have the same question.
Supine hypotension syndrome.
Uterus compresses the vena cava, reducing cardiac output.
We're helping to get her blood pressure back up. ( groans )
You're okay, Molly, we've got you.
No, my back!
Does it hurt here?
No.
All right, those back pains,
they were contractions.
What? Now?
Baby's crowning.
Should I get a screen?
No, we'll flip the bed.
Get a warmer, a BOA kit and page OB.
( alarm )
BP's 80 palp.
Ten blade.
Chuny, everything okay?
Baby's coming, mom's hypotensive
and we don't have fetal heart tones yet.
Well, a simple "no" would've sufficed.
Where's Kovac?
On his way, I guess.
Doesn't he need a chest X-ray?
32 French.
He's unstable with clinical evidence of a hemothorax.
Tube first, ask questions later.
Good. Systolic's up to 100.
Wow, you did that chest tube really quick.
O-Neg on two pressure bags set up for a subclavian.
Are you like the senior resident?
No, I'm like an intern.
What you're gonna be in a few days.
DORI: BP is 110 over 76.
How's Riley doing in there?
JARVIK: Need a central line.
( hoarse ): Is he okay?
Yeah, he will be.
How's your throat?
A little raw. All the yelling.
( coughs )
No dorsalis pedis.
No posterior tib.
That doesn't sound good.
You cut the artery in your foot.
You're gonna need surgery, all right?
We only called them a few minutes ago.
I doubt the O.R.'s gonna be ready.
No, no, no, they will be.
JERRY: Have them call us back as soon as they can.
Off the phone.
Go, go.
OR.
I called OB. They're in the middle
of a crash section. There we go.
Head's out, Mom, lots of hair.
Molly, you're doing so good, baby. Come on.
Suction.
( crying )
Um... Neela?
Turtle sign.
Jerry, 911 them.
Tell them we've got a shoulder.
Shoulder dystocia?
Wait, is something wrong with our baby?
He's a bit big for your pelvis.
( yells ) You can do this, Molly.
Push again. Really hard, okay?
Pull her legs back.
( screams )
Anterior shoulder is stuck.
Suprapubic pressure as hard as you can.
Another big push, Mom. Come on.
Molly, push again, all you've got.
( cries ): I can't.
You can, Molly. I know you can.
Come on, baby.
She can't, contraction's over.
Fetal pulse is coming back up.
All right, support the head. Right here.
I'll be back in a second.
Wait, she's leaving?
Why is she leaving?
Abby, I've got a shoulder dystocia
and OB's MIA.
Uh, did you try a Wood's screw maneuver?
Never heard of it.
That gives me a strange satisfaction.
I'm getting a flash but I can't thread the wire.
They need someone in there with L and D experience. I'll do this.
Okay. You're giving up?
If you can't get a procedure after the third attempt,
you're never going to get it.
Is that from Tintanelli's book?
No, that's the book of John Carter.
Heartbeat's up to 140...
This guy needs tons of volume.
I'll stay ahead four units.
What's going on? Mom's pressure is borderline.
Baby decels with contractions.
Okay. Hi.
I'm Dr. Lockhart.
Are you from OB?
I used to be, yes.
Okay, let's see if we can...
( Molly groans )
...coax this little guy out, huh?
It's a girl.
Her name's Janis.
Janis. Okay...
Okay.
I'm going to rotate Janis' posterior shoulder...
( yelling ) Here comes another contraction, Mom.
Come on, push!
( yelling )
( groaning )
Flex the arms across the chest.
Come on. Big push,
okay?
( grunts ) Baby's pulse is dropping again.
In the 80s, poor variability.
All right, come on, Molly, focus.
Really big push.
She's tiring out. Sat's 91.
Okay. All right, all right, relax.
Okay. Put her on oxygen, have O-Neg standing by.
Someone asked me to bring you this.
Did OB ever call back? Stuck in the OR.
They said it'd be about 15 minutes.
How long ago was that?
Eight minutes ago.
What about Luka?
Want me to page him again?
No. All right, you.
Me? Yeah, you.
You know where Ike Ryan's is? Yes.
Get over there, find Kovac and bring him back here fast.
Okay, we can't wait, not with the late decels.
Betadine, lido and a ten blade.
( cries ): Get her out.
You're doing a section by yourself?
Where the hell is Luka?
I only needed one more shot.
I got lucky.
Three times in a row.
You guys just missed Kovac running the table on me.
DUBENKO: I've heard Kovac cheats.
Yeah, I didn't even know
they played pool in Croatia.
Sure, but we just used broomsticks
and goat testicles.
Get out of here.
No, it's hard.
Those balls don't roll straight.
( laughing )
All righty then, on that note...
let me get out of here, take the young man home.
Greg...
take care of yourself. Thank you...
for everything.
Really. Anytime.
All right, and I'll see you suckers later.
Enjoy yourselves.
See ya.
Got your toast ready?
Yeah.
Got to say something, don't you?
Do I?
Oh, yeah, definitely.
Let me go lick my wounds first.
I'll be right back.
MALIK: Dr. Lewis said to wait till she gets here.
When's that gonna be?
She's on overnight.
She's gonna stop by on her way in.
( panting ): Who's...
Who's Ko-vach?
Neela, talk to me.
Porch collapse in Wrigleyville.
I know that.
Tell me about the patient.
Chest trauma with two liters
out the left.
We're doing a cut down. Ray? Yup.
Open it up to the femoral sheath.
This is the fastest way
to resuscitate a peri-arrest patient.
Right?
That's right.
Looks good.
Run the level one.
Do you know Abby's doing
a symphysiotomy in here?
By dissecting the ligaments connecting the pubic bone,
you can get up to three more centimeters of pelvic space.
Fetal tracing. He's holding in the 90s.
Feels like we opened up a little bit,
so next contraction,
big push, okay?
Okay.
Here we go. Here we go.
( inhales, groans )
LOCKHART: All right, come on, Molly.
Come on, Molly, push!
( groaning )
LOCKHART: Push. Here she comes.
LOCKHART: And...
MOLLY ( crying ): Oh, God!
LOCKHART: The anterior shoulder
is out!
( sighing and panting )
( baby crying )
Suction... and clamp.
( panting )
Scissors to Dad.
( panting )
( baby cooing )
Oh, wow.
( Kyle panting )
( crying )
Hey, big girl.
( crying )
( whimpering )
( crying )
( Molly sighs )
Hi, Janis. Hi.
KOVAC: Congratulations.
She's a beauty.
( laughs )
( Molly panting )
( groans )
So, how's school?
It's all right.
You doing okay?
Well, you know, I'm pretty damn good with science,
so if you ever need a hand,
just give me a call.
( glass clinking )
Uh... thanks.
Uh, I got it from here.
( metal clinking )
Hey, Dad. Huh? What? Oh.
Hey, Dad, come on, let's go inside.
( sighs )
Oh, man.
Here, I'm gonna help you up.
KJ, go put some coffee on.
Come on. It's okay.
Don't worry, I got him.
Go ahead, go inside.
Come on, man, let's go.
Come on, come on, man, get up.
All right, all right.
You know how to walk.
( coughs )
Come on, sit down.
( sighs, pants )
He give you any trouble, man?
All right, man, go get the coffee.
He's getting a little older.
He thinks he's smart.
But that don't give him no excuse to give any lip.
How come you didn't pick him up, man?
( sighs )
Damn. What time is it?
He was waiting on you, D.
You never showed up.
Where were you?
Hey, listen!
You his father. You understand that?
The only one he's got.
( sighs )
( sighs )
Systolic's up to 110. Where's Dubenko?
He went up to get the OR ready.
What about Jessica's ex-lap?
The impaled girl? Mm-hmm.
Anspaugh took her up to surgery. She's stable.
Ray, he's getting stridorous.
Uh, uh...
Okay. Sleep tight, Riley.
I'll check up on you in a bit, okay?
All right, come get me if he decompensates.
( loud, labored breathing )
How's your breathing, man?
A little rough.
Oh, Dr. Neela, you missed the party.
( loud gasping )
How are you doing, Nick?
( groans )
I'm sorry. ( Nick coughs )
There's crepitus. NICK: I had a dream like this.
( loud gasping breath )
Only Ray wasn't with us.
( chuckles )
C-spine's clear, losing the collar.
Pulse ox 90 on five liters.
20 of etomidate,
120 SUX.
( phone ringing )
Hello?
Yeah, speaking.
My credit card?
No, it hasn't been stolen.
Alex?
Alex!
I'd like to thank you all
for coming tonight.
I consider myself...
a lucky man.
Yeah, a lucky man...
That's good...
for Lou Gehrig.
It's been...
11 years.
And I feel...
like I grew up here with all of you.
Hmm.
Where did everybody go?
Work.
They said they'd be back.
Are you new in the ER?
Uh-uh. Geriatrics.
Heard there was free food.
Ah.
I like you with the beard.
( laughs )
( murmuring )
Keep an eye on the stats, all right?
All right, I'll check your crit in angio. Okay.
Symphysiotomy, huh?
Uh-huh. Healthy girl.
Eight pounds, ten ounces.
Dr. Barnett, I was told you demanded
we not take any patients before the tib-fib guy.
I re-prioritized.
Take Neela's patient first. My guy can wait.
( sighing )
They took me to Lakeview.
I couldn't find a taxi.
What do you guys need?
We're all good, Morris.
Really? You sure?
I'm gonna go lie down.
Hey, you guys all ditched Carter.
He was hugging some huge orderly when I got there.
We've got it under control now.
Well, that's good. Cosmo's been screaming like a banshee.
I intend to spend my overnight shift sleeping in the lounge.
Carter, your volleyball girl's up in traps,
ready for the reduction.
That's okay, I'll get it.
No, I'll take it.
One more for the road.
How long you here for?
I just have to pick up some stuff.
How 'bout you?
I'm off as soon as you're ready.
How's "never" sound?
Luka, did you hear from Alex?
Is he here?
Why do I have to hang my hand from these things?
Janell, manners.
So that I can re-align your bones.
Hello, I'm Dr. Carter.
Clyde Parkerson. My wife, Eva.
I'm sure that Janell told you she broke her wrist.
AKA Colles' fracture.
And that we gave her a local anesthesia.
AKA hematoma block.
( chuckles ): And that she has
a future in medicine, it would seem.
AKA I'll be rich.
CHUNY: I'll give you counter-traction.
EVA: Dr. Carter, do you remember us?
Um... I'm sorry, I don't.
Cast padding.
I was a patient here in 1994.
( chuckles ): Really?
CLYDE: We went into premature labor at 32 weeks.
EVA: There was no time to get me to the OB floor,
so I gave birth here, in the ER.
You delivered her.
I did?
( chuckles ): Cool.
Two-inch roll.
Um...
can I have the purple cast?
Whatever you want.
He must have gone through my purse.
He tried to buy a bus ticket?
They wouldn't let him.
He took off while they were calling the cops.
He probably went to a friend's apartment.
I called them all.
What did the police say?
They said for me to, um,
wait at home while they're searching,
but I'm not just gonna sit there.
I have to go try to find him.
What if he shows up at the apartment?
Erica's there. She's gonna stay.
How much cash did he get?
Uh, about 80.
Maybe a hundred. I don't know.
He's pissed. He's just walking it off.
He tried to buy a ticket to Colorado.
He's gonna do whatever he can to see Steve.
He's not gonna stop.
He doesn't have his glucometer.
He doesn't have his syringes,
he doesn't have his insulin...
Sam, Sam, Sam, hey, hey, hey.
He'll be okay for the next 12 hours.
We'll find him way before then.
Let me get my jacket.
Hey, uh, Luka, will you, uh,
will you get some NPH from lock-up,
and some D5 and some D10, too, okay?
Okay.
( doorbell rings )
Hey.
Can I help you?
Yeah, I'm looking for Charlie Pratt.
I know you?
Your name is Charlie Pratt?
Yeah.
I'm sorry, I must have got it wrong.
MAN: Chas, who is it?
Is there a problem?
Are you Charlie?
Are you a bill collector?
Then, yeah, I'm Charlie.
I'm an ER doc over at County.
Is somebody sick?
No. No, nothing like that.
I, um, I got your name from the folks at Ceasefire.
Couldn't wait till morning?
I'm gonna be there tomorrow for the meeting anyway.
You're right. It can wait.
You all right, son?
Yeah, I'm okay.
Maybe you ought to come in.
Sorry if I disturbed you.
Did I spell...
"symphysiotomy" right?
Yeah.
Thank you.
LOCKHART: How's your friend?
Missed the aorta.
Anspaugh fixed her up.
Jessica's gonna be fine.
You look tired.
You should go home.
Mm-mm, I want to be here when my friends wake up.
All right, then.
Help yourself to a chart.
Dr. Carter.
I was just on my way out.
Thought I'd stop by.
Sorry we missed the party.
Eh, you weren't the only ones.
So I just found this in my locker.
It has been in there for a very long time.
And, to be honest,
I haven't given it much thought for many years.
Not since Mark died.
You see, when you were an intern under Dr. Greene,
he would have everybody write a letter to themselves
that they wouldn't open
until their very last day of residency.
So... that's your letter to yourself?
What's it say?
It says...
that I'm scared.
And that I know I have a lot to learn,
and I hope I learn it quickly.
And that I pray to God that I don't kill anybody.
And it says, um, that if
I'm good at this...
and I can stick it out
and become an attending,
well...
it'll be all I ever need.
I got a plane to catch.
GREENE: One day, you'll look up
and maybe, uh, ten years will have passed.
BENTON: Carter...
you're going to make a good doctor.
HATHAWAY: Carter, you got to hurry it up.
You got a million things to do.
ROSS: My mom told me that you never
put anything in your ears smaller than your elbow.
GREENE: You set the tone, Carter.
( Morris groaning )
Morris?
I think I might puke again.
You set the tone, Morris.
Huh?
( chuckles )
Never mind.
What's that?
My contract.
Oh.
Okay, then I guess you have some more writing to do.
It's good enough for Carter.
Think it's weird if I put "Dear Neela"?
Hey, Erica, any word?
Did Bobby's mom call back?
He wasn't with them?
Okay.
Yeah, it's gonna be all right.
Uh, what about Navy Pier? He likes the rides there.
It's after 11:00, it's closed.
What about your cell phone, is it charged?
Sam. Sam.
It's all going to be okay.
( honking )
