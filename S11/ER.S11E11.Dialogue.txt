Previously on ER:
I take full responsibility
for what happened with Sanders.
It won't happen again.
Please, you got to help me.
I think he's dying.
Hey!
That man's just been told his cancer has spread.
Don't you think he has a reason to cry?
Yes.
Fix my brother, bitch,
before I blow your head off.
I'm telling you, trust yourself
enough to comfort.
I said let's go!
Please...
You don't have to do this.
I said lay down.
He's too young to go, and he shouldn't
be listening to that music anyway.
I didn't know you already said no.
Luka, I'm trying to teach him the value of a dollar
and you go and you give him everything he wants.
It was only 50 bucks.
For a concert ticket for a ten-year-old? No.
That's ridiculous.
I just don't think
you should be worried about money so much.
Okay, I appreciate your generosity,
but I'm not going to let you start paying for everything.
But you don't have to pay exactly half the rent
and half the bills every month-- it's ridiculous.
I managed to support me and Alex for 10 years all on my own.
I think I can handle it.
You know, this isn't about money at all.
You're worried about losing your independence or something.
And about my role in Alex's life.
What, you're worried about losing control over him?
You know what, you always do this?
Do what? This!
Telling me what I'm really mad about.
Most of the time you don't know what you're really mad about.
Sam, this isn't our stop.
Hey. Sleep okay?
Yeah.
Better than the night before?
You want to eat anything before you smoke?
No.
But thanks.
I can make French toast.
Aren't you on your way out?
I have time.
Want anything to drink?
I bought groceries yesterday.
We've got milk, juice...
No, thanks. Were you vacuuming last night?
I'm sorry. Did I keep you up?
No. I just...
No, that was very nice of you.
Your, uh, shift starts at 2:00, right?
You ready to go back?
Well, can't keep hanging around here.
I got to get going again.
Everyone's been asking how you are.
So, you sure you're okay?
What I really need is a little space.
Okay.
I'm sorry, I just... No, you're right.
I should find my own place. I'll start looking today.
You don't have to rush. No, really.
See you at work.
They're not closing the E.R., are they?
I heard the county health system's run out of money.
They say that every year
so that the government will bail us out.
Well, they're not meeting on the match.
No way, the applications aren't even in.
I know, Ray, that's why I said it's not the match.
PRATT: It's an attendings' meeting, they do this every month.
NEELA: But they usually meet upstairs.
Come on, enough with the paranoia, people.
Let's get back to work.
What's going on?
Attendings are meeting.
W-Why? Why here? Why now?
PRATT: I don't know.
Maybe they're thinking of cutting a resident.
No. You think that's what this is?
I don't know, but whatever it is,
it can't be good.
PRATT: Uh-oh.
Go! Go! Go! Go!
LEWIS: What color are you painting
the conference room? Lime green.
Why?
Because it's my favorite color.
Okay, the attendings' note.
It's not enough just to co-sign the chart,
you have to write your own brief history,
medical assessment and plan.
On every patient?
It's the only way we'll get paid.
( Carter yawns )
Sorry, very long shift.
( yawning ): Yawning's contagious.
Cosmo's teething, I was up all night.
I'm exhausted...
and we're down two nurses-- anything else?
If we don't get our patient satisfaction scores up,
we can't start pursuing HMO contracts.
Okay, who's low?
Ray, Neela, Morris.
Abby's the only one with a decent score.
Even Pratt's on the low end.
I think Pratt's okay with patients,
it's the other doctor's he has a problem with.
Need the room for a brachial artery laceration,
ten minutes out.
And Neela brings up the rear with a score of 2.21.
If we want to make our patients happier,
we need to teach our residents to connect with them better.
To communicate, to listen...
What are you, the Croatian Dr. Phil?
They can't even communicate with each other.
Have you ever seen Neela and Pratt work together?
Ray and Morris?
But we can teach them to make eye contact,
to introduce themselves, you know?
Act like normal human beings in front of the patients.
But that would be changing
their basic personality structure,
which would be a great strategy
if we could turn back time
and make their parents love them more.
Med schools churn out scientists.
It's up to us to turn them into physicians.
Try it. They can't do any worse.
( yawns )
I'm going to get coffee.
I'm going home.
MAN: How long you been waiting?
'Bout six hours.
Six hours?
A little longer, my friend,
and you're looking at a very big cash settlement.
Here, take one of my cards.
Out of my way!
Give one to your buddy here.
Out of my way.
I look forward to hearing from you.
My first job was working in an orange juice factory...
Hey, Amy, could you sit down please?
...but I got canned-- couldn't concentrate.
I'd rather stand.
The seats are too small for her.
Oh, shut up, Cullum.
I'll get you in soon, okay?
Pratt, knee contusion,
slipped at work, can't bear weight.
Well, I've got a hot MI, so it's gonna have to wait.
I didn't say it can't wait, I said can't bear weight.
As in stand up.
I'll get to it when I get to it.
Little plan to help the residents communicate,
you might want to start with Pratt.
Okay, just tell me the truth.
How many Vicodin will it take for you to just go away, huh?!
Or Morris. 'Cause I'll write it down.
I'm doomed. Morris!
Relax and come talk to me when you're done.
Hi.
Hi.
Going home?
Yeah, I'm going to go home and sleep off my shift,
and come back in 12 hours and pick you up.
Oh, really?
Puccini's can take us tonight at 9:00.
For me it'll be breakfast,
for you it'll be whatever you want.
Fantastic-- I'm craving a pound of pasta
and some oily garlic bread.
She's carbo-loading for a marathon.
Enjoy your honeymoon.
I'm going to be spending the night fighting with Sam.
Okay, have fun with that.
Dr. Kovac, can you get gastritis after 16 ibuprofen?
Uh, why's your patient taking that much medicine?
Is he depressed?
I was about to check.
There you go.
Neela, Amy Packer,
an obese 15-year-old with forehead lac.
Her mother's on her way in.
What happened?
Brother hit her over the head with a lamp.
SAM: Hi, Amy.
This is Dr. Rasgotra.
Hi.
Hi. Um, this is Cullum.
Um, I can't get up.
Too fat to get up.
Ow.
Oh, my goodness, that was quite
the fall, young lady.
Thank you.
Can you believe it? Here you go.
All this ice and not a speck of salt to be seen.
I mean, I think the hospital is completely negligent
and responsible for your injury in this situation.
Oh, no, I don't have an injury.
You're going to feel okay probably
for the first 24 hours, and then the pain develops.
You could be looking at long-term disability
from, uh, for example, lumbar myofascial strain
or a disk herniation syndrome with radiculopathy.
It's just a bruise.
I think an MRI is indicated, definitely.
Are you a doctor?
Uh, no. Attorney.
Herb Spivak, attorney at law.
My, uh, card.
JERRY: Dr. Lewis, OIG on line two
claiming we transferred an unstable patient.
You're a doctor, huh?
Yeah.
Well, let me tell you something.
You never know when you're going to need
a little more protection.
These hospital bigwigs will let you hang out to dry.
I guarantee you that, if you ever get sued.
If you solicit any more patients in my ambulance bay
I will have you forcibly removed.
How 'bout a free pen?
Follow my finger, um...
Amy. Thank you.
Hi, I'm Dr. Kovac.
Neela, present to me when you're done here.
Oh, okay. Am I in some sort of trouble?
No, no. Just keep going.
PRATT: It's Mr. Meacham, right?
The one and only.
Tell me about your knee pain.
Did you fall or have an injury?
I was moving boxes at work.
Where do you work?
Well, I used to work as a lumberjack,
but I couldn't hack it so they gave me the ax.
Is it worse when you walk?
Can I help you with something, Dr. Kovac?
Just observing.
You have pain in any other joints?
Hey, Sam, can you get
a postural vitals for me in Exam Two?
I'm getting slammed.
I'm setting Neela up for suturing,
I got a Foley, an NG, two I.V.s to start
and a five-page patient transfer summary.
I got your tray.
Hey, Amy, I talked to your mom,
she's on her way in from work.
Oh, my foster mom.
He's her real son.
How long have you been with them?
Since last March. Ow!
Sorry.
Uh, that was lidocaine
to numb up your cut.
Die! Ha!
I hope he's referring to his game.
Cullum needs his meds adjusted, that's why he has tantrums.
Is that what happened, he lost his temper?
Kinda.
What meds is he on?
Adderall and Depakote for ADHD
and ODD.
I'll be, uh, back to sew you up.
Does it seem like every 10-year-old boy we see nowadays
has ADHD?
ADHD, a Game Boy and an iPod.
Foster kid, head injury, unsupervised home.
We should call social work.
I think Wendall's on.
Look, I know how to do an H&P.
Excuse me, Dr. Kovac?
Hold on.
How long did you let him talk before interrupting him?
20, 30 seconds.
Four. What color were his eyes?
I don't know, we weren't on a date.
You didn't make eye contact.
Did you listen to his heart?
The guy had a twisted knee.
Doesn't matter what he has.
You need to listen to his heart
to show that you care
and that you're paying attention to every detail.
I don't have time to put on a show.
It takes one minute and it can make a difference
between your patient
feeling taken care of and feeling ignored.
Look, we've got patients
that have been waiting over nine hours out there.
Believe me, they already feel ignored.
You ready to present?
I think I need to redo my exam.
Listen, it's about connecting better.
If your patients trusts you,
she'll heal faster.
That's what all the studies say, okay?
Okay.
Wow, I find it really distracting
working with somebody so good-looking.
Who? Dr. Kovac?
Oh, come on. Don't pretend he's not hot.
I don't know.
You just get used to it.
Yeah, but I mean, he's gorgeous.
Who's gorgeous?
MAN: Got a John Doe.
Looks about 16, multiple GSWs to the chest.
NEELA: Any vitals in the field?
Nothing.
Luka, tier one, no BP.
Never had a rhythm, fixed and dilated.
You want to call it?
Let's see what we can do.
NEELA: Should we get some 0-neg?
Am I missing something?
No, let's stick with saline for now.
I thought asystole in the field
meant zero-percent survival.
Sam, start compressions.
What, you want labs, too?
No, just check a crit.
Oh, this is like some sort of a practice thing.
Apparently.
JANE: Oh, can I do a chest tube?
No, Neela's going to do a saphenous cutdown.
She is? I am?
Oh, cool.
Okay, let's prep and drape the ankle.
10 blade to Neela.
Okay, now make your incision from the anterior tibia
to the medial malleolus.
You a doctor?
I think I'm having an aneurysm.
Sir, please wait back inside for a doctor to get to you.
Pratt, you got a sec?
I could be having a stroke right now!
It's probably just a tension headache.
You really think they might cut a resident?
I'm gonna sue your ass if I end up paralyzed.
Why are you following me?
I'm not following you, dumbbell.
Gentlemen, please! I'm serious.
My attorney's office is right over there.
SPIVAK: Did a doctor screw you up? What?
Come visit the Mobile Law Office of Herb W. Spivak.
He's had two rounds of epi and atropine.
Holding compressions.
One more tie on the distal segment.
Okay.
Asystole. How much longer?
Until the third liter's in.
Sam, resume compressions.
Can you check for the femoral pulse?
Can't quite get one.
Because he bled out.
Third liter's in.
KOVAC: No pulse. Okay, that's it.
Time of death, 9:52.
Thanks for showing me.
Yeah. Write up your note. I'll co-sign.
Any identifying marks?
Brand-new sneakers, blue.
Wonder what he was thinking
when he put those on this morning.
What?
If it'd just been you and me,
you would've pronounced him dead in the hall.
He was hypovolemic.
He never had a pulse.
There was a chance
he might respond to a fluid bolus.
If you were really serious,
you would have ordered the 0-neg.
Someday they might find themselves in the place
with no rapid infuser or a central line kit,
and if they know how to do a cutdown,
they could save a life.
You know, I can't afford
to waste my time on teaching cases
when there's real work to do.
This is what we do.
We train doctors.
And sometimes that means running through codes
so residents can learn procedures.
It's a-it's a teaching hospital.
Yeah, it's also a real hospital,
with live patients who didn't get antibiotics
and insulin 'cause I was in here
doing compressions for 30 minutes!
Okay, so you did some extra compressions.
What are you really mad about?
Are you in all seriousness telling me
for the second time today
that I am not mad about what I'm really mad about?
I have no idea what you just said.
Forget it.
$900 for a studio in Andersonville?
What happened, Abby kick you out?
No... yes.
When's she coming in?
Her shift starts at 2:00.
I-I've missed her.
What? I-I have.
Well, I just got a two-bedroom sublet on North and Oakley
for just a thousand a month.
Wicker Park.
Yeah, but my roommate just flaked out on me, so...
Back in rehab, huh?
You wouldn't happen to be interested in, um...
You mean, you and me?
500's better than a grand.
Thanks, I'll think about it.
MORRIS: Hey, isn't that our local shyster?
Damn.
No, no. Allow me.
Go for it, Archie.
Hi. I'm looking for a Dr. Rasgo...
Rasgotra. That's me.
Hi. I'm Kitty Peyser, I'm Amy's foster mom.
Is she okay?
She's fine. She just needs some stitches
to the forehead and a tetanus shot.
I heard they got into a fight.
Cullum's not a bad kid,
he just needs his meds adjusted.
He's in the family room.
Perhaps you'd like to talk to our social worker?
No. I just want to see my daughter.
I should tell you I had to notify social work,
and they'll probably be contacting the DCFS.
What?
When foster children come in with suspicious injuries...
No, no, no. Come on.
Hey, kids fight.
It's a standard situation.
There is no situation.
Mrs. Peyser...
Look, look, don't do this to us.
We love Amy.
They'll take her away.
Hi.
OLBES: Multiple GSWs.
Gang shoot-out on the corner of 51st and King.
Tachy at 138, B.P. 85 palp.
I'll take the airway.
What do you got?
Three gunshots to the abdomen.
Run it, Pratt.
No breath sounds on the left.
Morris, chest tube. Jane, subclavian.
Ray, stop staring at the monitor
and concentrate on your patient.
JANE: I've never done a subclavian.
Hey, it's time to buck up, Calamity Jane.
Central line kit. Did you get rid of Herb yet?
He says he has a client at the hospital
revising her will.
He is wily, that one.
Stay in the mid-line, Ray.
I got it.
Does he need atropine or epi?
No, he needs oxygen. The tube's not in.
You have to see it go through the cords every time.
Gimme the blade.
Let me try again.
Maybe next time. Tube.
Pratt, why don't you try teaching?
Oh, okay. You did it wrong. Watch me.
Call surgery. This guy needs an ex-lap.
And... I'm in.
See? It's just that simple.
Thank you, Greg.
Any time, Ray.
Am I gonna have a scar?
Just a little line.
Honey, we'll take you to Darlene's salon tomorrow.
We'll get you bangs.
That'd be nice.
You'll have to keep the wound dry
until the sutures come out
so no baths and no swimming.
I should go check on Cullum.
Mary, can you take Mrs. Peyser to the family room?
Sure.
Don't worry, Amy.
Everything's going to be fine.
Okay, so Neosporin twice a day, and come back
if it's red, painful or draining fluid.
Does your cut hurt?
What's wrong?
( voice breaking ): I know what's gonna happen.
Once you call in social work...
Amy, don't get ahead of yourself.
I can't leave them.
They need me.
( sighs )
I give Cullum his pills every morning,
and I get him ready for school.
That's a lot of responsibility for a girl your age.
This is the only home
where I haven't been beaten up or ignored.
Kitty loves me, she needs me.
My whole life-- I've never felt that before.
( beeping )
Sam. Yeah?
Did you already call social work on Amy Packer?
Uh, yeah. Wendall will be down soon.
What is that?
( laughing ): It's still caffeine.
Can you call Wendall back and tell her not to bother?
Why?
I was too quick.
I should have waited to talk to the family.
She's a foster kid.
We always call social work.
Penny, what are you doing?
Stabbing me to death.
I think he's dehydrated.
Ow! Do I look like a pin cushion to you?
He's my patient.
Why are you torturing my patient?
Jane said Dr. Kovac told her you needed
some help today.
Sat's 79. Barely any pulse. ( alarms )
All right, get out of the way, let me do it.
You can practice later on a dummy.
I can't get the tube into the pleural space.
Use a twisting motion.
Systolic's only 60.
Cycle the dynamap.
Is your incision big enough? I don't know.
Morris, you've done a chest tube before, right?
Pratt.
PEA, lost the pulse.
Give me the tube. No, I got it.
Move out of the way!
Hey, Pratt, you need to manage your team.
I'm trying. I don't know how
to explain this stuff any better.
Bradying down to 50.
Amp of epi.
All you do is criticize them
and make them nervous.
What do you think it is that you're doing to me?
This kid does not have time for them to learn on the job.
Um, hello, we can hear you.
Yeah, we're standing right here.
He's pulseless.
Check it again.
Good carotid.
Tension pneumo.
It's a common cause of PEA.
Sats are rising.
So, uh, do you mind if I ask our residents
to roll him up to the O.R., or do you think
that that would hurt their feelings?
What was that all about?
That was an intubation, a chest tube and a central line
in under 15 minutes.
The point is not to do it all yourself.
Just because you all had a group hug this morning,
do I have to listen to this touchy-feely crap all day?
Yeah.
I'm not an intern, okay?
So, stop acting like one.
You have people under you now.
You are responsible for teaching them.
So, the your choice is yours.
Are you going to build their confidence or destroy it?
Well, if the choice is between building up their self-esteem
and saving my patient, I'm gonna have to go with my patient.
Every time.
( sighs )
WENDALL: I don't know.
They were unsupervised, the mother seems overwhelmed,
the brother has behavioral problems...
This is her fifth home.
It's not a perfect family,
but she says it's the best she's ever had.
Well, I haven't spoken to their caseworker yet.
The safest thing to do is to pull her from the home.
But she's happy there, and there's no guarantee
things are going to be better anywhere else.
You guys talking about that foster kid?
If they're happy together
and the family seems to be working...?
( sighs )
If the mom agrees to parenting classes,
I'll consider reevaluating her...
JERRY: Neela,
some landlord for you on line two.
I'll take it in Admit.
She'll do whatever you need.
I find hospital conditions absolutely woeful.
Are you overworked and underpaid?
I'm a nurse.
You can't be back here, get out.
No, you can't kick me out, I'm a patient.
What?
That's right. ( coughs )
Very bad sore throat.
Sore throat? I signed in.
Yeah.
I know you guys are backed up,
so don't worry, I'll wait.
Just take all the time you need.
I'm going to fetch me a lozenge.
Haldol and hard restraints.
Huh?
We could treat him like a psych patient
with delusions of being a lawyer.
Abby? Abby.
Hi.
Hi.
Um, are you okay?
Yeah, I'm okay.
Good to see you. You, too.
Oh, my God, Abby.
Did you get my card?
Yeah, thank you.
I prayed for you.
RASGOTRA: No windows at all?
Shared bathroom? Is that even legal here?
Abby finally kicked her out?
Well, how much a month?
It's ugly out there.
You usually do early shifts, right?
So you can go for gigs with your band?
Yeah. Yeah, and if you stick to your late shifts
or your overnights...
Weeks could go by, we might never see each other.
Months, even.
Welcome, roomie.
God, I'm going to regret this.
Excuse me, please.
Excuse me, I need to see my grandson.
What's his name?
Michael. Michael Barnes.
His friend said he got shot.
I don't see the name.
He's 16, he was wearing jeans,
a gray T-shirt and sneakers.
Blue sneakers?
Yes, yes, you saw him?
There was a patient who came in earlier
matching that description
Is he okay?
If you'd just like to take a seat
I can get the attending for you.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Did something happen? Ma'am...
Is he dead?
I can't give you more information until...
Is he okay?
Why can't you just tell me that?
Ma'am, please calm down.
Where is he? I need to see him.
If you'd like to take a seat...
Where's my grandson?
We can't confirm anything...
His name is Michael Barnes. Michael!
We can't confirm anything until the body's been ID'ed.
The body?
Oh, God.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean...
( cries )
Ma'am, if you'd just let me go and get the attending...
( cries ): No! Ma'am, if you'd just like to take a seat.
I'm sure the attending can... ( crying )
Oh...! My God!
( crying ): God...!
Michael!
Where's the grandmother now?
Crying it out in the family room.
I guess Neela still needs to work a little
on her death notification.
A little? Grandma's traumatized.
I can't believe we didn't have to sedate her.
You cannot teach basic people skills.
You're either born knowing how to relate to people, or you're not.
Croissant? I'll go talk to her.
You realize you're just encouraging him.
Just because he's a shark
doesn't mean we can't eat his pastries.
Who's on call for general surgery tonight?
Uh... Tsung.
I have to track down an abdominal series from radiology.
And I have a puking lady
that had a dystonic reaction to phenothiazines.
Zofran?
Yeah, right.
So how are you doing?
Good. Really?
Mm-hmm. Never better.
Really?
Yes. Yes.
Yes.
I've processed all my feelings of anger,
shame and guilt in an emotionally safe environment.
I've addressed the urge to "use" alcohol.
Oh, and I've consulted both a shaman and a guru.
So, really, I'm all good.
That was Wendall, our social worker.
She's just getting a little more information from your foster mom.
She's not going to take me away? No.
Your foster mom's going to take some classes
and you and Cullum are going to start an after-school program
so you can all go home together.
Oh, thank you!
Thank you, thank you.
Mary, can you take Amy up to the seventh floor, please?
Sure.
They'll be waiting for you.
So you convinced social work, huh?
Seems so.
Good job.
I took your advice.
I tried to connect.
Didn't do such a good job with the grandmother, though.
You and Dr. Lewis must think I'm a complete idiot.
No, no, you're just inexperienced.
Hey, hey, hey. Come here.
First, you have to bring them to the family room
for a death notification.
Sit down.
Somewhere away from the rest of the patients and staff.
She just got so hysterical.
Make sure they're sitting down.
Don't be evasive and don't use euphemisms.
Use the word "dead" and the word "is."
I know all this.
Give them a tissue.
Look them in the eye and make a connection.
Then just say "I'm very sorry."
It's okay.
I suck.
No, you don't suck.
You're still learning.
( sniffles )
I can't believe this.
I'm in a wedding next weekend.
One percent lido with epi, 6-0 vicryl.
God, I'm gonna ruin all the photographs.
Oh, they won't be looking at you,
they'll be looking at the bride.
You owe me one.
What? No, I don't.
Yeah, you do.
I put down the NG on Mrs. Leerburger.
I didn't ask you to do that.
Dr. Kovac did.
What?
He said you were a little overextended today.
Unlike the rest of us.
Uh, Abby, will you excuse me?
I have to go yell at someone.
Have fun.
Okay, Miss Tobel,
in the future, try not to pluck your eyebrows in a moving car.
Okay, numb and prep the wound.
I'll be right back.
MAN: Get away from me! I know what you want!
You want to hurt me! you want to make me suffer!
Security! ( man continues yelling )
Oh, Lockhart. You're back.
Welcome back.
Thank you. Um, I called John Manning
at the International Society for Traumatic Stress Studies.
Hey. We're looking for our son. Have you heard of EMDR?
We've been waiting here for an hour.
Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing.
His name is Tevin. Tevin Burrough.
Hold on. No, we've been here for an hour.
Where you going? Get back here, bitch!
It's been hugely effective in the treatment of, um, traumatic disorders.
Uh, basically, you focus on the most vivid image,
emotion or sensation in the traumatic memory,
while simultaneously focusing on an external impulse.
Uh, I've printed out a bunch of the studies for you.
Maybe you can take a look at them,
we can talk about 'em tomorrow or whenever you want.
Okay, thank you.
Good. Okay.
Abby, uh, eyebrow lac's ready.
You were going to show me how to do a running subcuticular.
Right.
Are you okay?
Yes. Yeah, I'm fine.
This won't leave a mark, will it?
Dr. Lockhart is using a special technique to minimize scarring.
Abby?
Um...
I'm sorry, I can't do this right now.
What?
Sorry.
Joe, what happened?
He threatened to sue me.
He's parked in front of a fire hydrant.
What's with the motor home?
I'm getting rid of it.
( sighs ) Susan.
Yeah.
Uh, I think maybe I came back too soon.
Are you okay? I don't know. I'm just not
in the right frame of mind to do this.
Okay, go home, take all the time you need.
And Ray's staying late to cover for me.
No, it's okay. Don't worry about us.
Thank you. I'll call you later.
( sighs )
Sorry. Sorry.
You all right?
Yeah, I'm fine.
God.
( chuckles )
You'll catch the next one.
Thank you.
Spivak, get out here now.
( faint laughter )
( sighs )
Hello, Doctor.
Oh, come on, we fixed you up!
Jerry?
He has...
really great coffee.
Sorry.
Ah, Dr. Lewis!
Are you, uh...
ready to discuss this morning's fall?
Did you send Mr. Fayen to CT? Yeah.
Yeah, well, I had to go all the way up to CT
to push morphine, instead of just doing it here.
Just trying to help.
No, you're being passive-aggressive.
Why are you so mad?
Because I'm used to having control over my own life.
Sam? What?!
Do you know where Neela is? No.
You're the attending on Amy Packer,
the foster kid, right? Yeah.
This is Mari Hinojosa from DCFS.
I have bad news.
I think that's everything.
Thank you.
Desensitization Reprocessing?
Yeah, it's some crazy stuff Dubenko gave me.
Want me to give it a try?
No, I think it's dead.
Procrastinating.
Didn't miss it at all.
Work. Over the holidays.
( chuckles )
I must have really made an impression on you.
You didn't even notice I was gone for a week.
No, I remember.
You're that guy with the beard.
Yeah.
Where'd you go?
Yellowstone.
Most beautiful place on earth.
You ever been?
I didn't realize it until I was smack
in the middle of the geysers, but the whole thing
is actually one gigantic, active volcano.
Did you know that?
No, I did not.
It could blow at any second.
It's actually 30,000 years overdue.
And what would happen if it did?
It would wipe out most of the western U.S.,
cover the rest of the country in ash,
wreak havoc on the global climate.
Is that all?
We'd be gone in an instant, just...
like that.
That's how fragile life is, but you know that.
You working in the E.R.
Yeah.
Human life span is so short anyways, it's almost irrelevant.
Are you high?
Here's your train.
See you later.
Thank you.
Bye.
Between the paramedics and the doctors here,
we worked on him for 45 minutes,
but his injuries were too severe.
His mother died when he was five.
Your son did very well in surgery.
They were able to control the bleeding in his liver.
Since then, it's just been the two of us.
He wasn't in any pain, and he didn't suffer.
LACEY: I knew something like this
was going to happen.
His heart and his brain were spared,
He'll probably end up doing just fine.
He was even talking about going to college.
I'm very sorry.
PRATT: He's going to be groggy
but he might be able to hear what you're saying.
Take as much time as you need to say good-bye.
This isn't my grandson.
This isn't my son.
( train rumbling )
Hello?
Hi.
No.
No, they can't refuse to admit her.
She's got post-op adhesions.
HALEH: Hurry, 'cause Surgery's going to rip our heads off
if we don't admit to Medicine.
Haleh, listen, okay, just push four of morphine,
and I'll be there in a minute, okay?
Fine. Bye.
How the hell did this happen?
I'm not sure yet, but...
Were the patients mislabeled? I don't know.
Did they look the same?
Was there a computer glitch?
I-I don't know.
All I know is that there were two John Does, both 16,
both gunshot wounds, both gang-related.
And both treated in Trauma One a few hours apart.
Susan, I just do not understand how this happened.
Whatever it was,
there was a massive communication failure.
Well, it's your job to make sure that people communicate.
I take full responsibility for it.
PRATT: We screwed up.
Neither of us knew
there were two John Does today.
We didn't speak to each other,
and we didn't check the board.
Who was in which trauma?
Neela, Sam and I worked on a dead kid
with a saphenous cutdown.
Morris, Ray and Pratt were with me in the other one.
And there was no overlap between the traumas?
JANE: I was in both.
Who's that?
LEWIS: Med student.
I put a name alert on the board.
Jane, why didn't you say anything?
No one listens to me.
No one even remembers I was in the room.
Uh, you guys look like you could use a vacation.
No.
I got this great timeshare down in Boca Grande
that I let friends use.
"Friends"?
Well, you know, friends that refer friends.
It's got a great house and this beautiful boat,
and a pair of jet skis.
Spivak? Security!
Come on, give me a break, will you?
You're back. Yup.
Thought your shift was over.
No, not till 10:00.
So, you were just taking a break?
I guess so.
Up on the EL tracks?
Yeah.
I love it up there. Me, too.
You never know who you might run into.
We just put them through hell.
What are you going to say to them?
I'll tell the truth.
Families of dead patients don't remember much.
The only thing they remember is if it seemed like you cared.
If you were honest and direct with them.
Did Dr. Lewis tell you to keep me away from them?
Yeah.
I want to go in with you.
Okay.
It's unconstitutional.
LEWIS: Thank you.
Do not cross this line, or I will have you arrested.
I don't see any line.
You know what I mean, you can't come back here.
You can't do this, this is a public institution.
That doesn't matter.
Well, you're violating my civil rights.
I never got to see a doctor.
So, sue me.
Your office is being towed,
by the way.
Yo! Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo!
Whoa, ho, ho, ho, ho!
Come on! Yo!
Come on, have some pity!
So much for Herb.
Whatever. You know he'll be back.
Amy?
What's going on?
Who are you?
I'm her doctor.
I'm bringing her to the Haley home.
What? She lied to me.
Go talk to your social worker.
I don't understand. Stop.
I have two more kids to pick up.
Please don't make my job any harder.
Amy, wait.
She told me I could go home.
30 days?
You can start having visitors after two weeks.
I need to talk to you.
Cold turkey, just like that?
They'll give you medication to help ease the withdrawal.
Think about it, okay?
How could you pull Amy
out of her home behind my back?
It wasn't behind your back.
We got new information.
We had a plan for her.
Her regular caseworker was out of town.
Why didn't anyone tell me?
If you would stop interrupting and let me finish one...
You're supposed to consult the doctor on the case
before making a decision like this.
Kovac signed off.
Hey.
I'm hating doctors right now.
Neela's mad,
Ray practically accused me of elder abuse,
and Morris laughed at me
when this kid kicked me in the shin.
I was going to ask you if you were ready to go.
That's all you have to say?
Well, you know, we come
from different perspectives sometimes,
and sometimes we disagree.
But whatever happened, you were right.
Why didn't you tell me about Amy?
I was going to. When?
When I had time, and I thought it might be better
if you found out after your shift.
I'm an adult.
I don't need you to protect me.
I wasn't trying to protect you.
You made a good decision
based on the information you had,
but there was a pattern of incidents.
Like what? Like...
April 16, scald injury to shoulder.
Sounds pretty minor to me.
July 14, bite wound inflicted by brother.
Who we know has behavioral issues.
October 20, clavicular fracture after a "fall."
November 30, 14-centimeter leg lac
after "tripping on stairs."
Her history wasn't consistent with her injuries. Okay.
Each one is not a big deal, but together...
I got it.
I thought it was a done deal.
I told Amy everything was going to work out.
I got her hopes up.
Well, in the end,
we're doing the right thing for her.
So, why not just tell me that?
I was worried that finding out would make you lose confidence,
and I didn't want that to happen, so...
If I was trying to protect you, I'm sorry, okay?
You know, I didn't always
used to be a mobile lawyer.
I used to have big money-- big, big money.
Then I lost my shirt on niftypets.com.
Can I get something for the pain?
Sure, as soon as we finish with this paperwork
required by our lawyer
to guard against, you know, frivolous lawsuits.
I ain't signing nothing.
This document gives us permission to treat you.
The second one specifies whether you have
an advanced directive or a living will.
Are you serious?
If your heart stops
or you stop breathing, do you want us to use
heroic measures to resuscitate you?
Just put me out of my misery.
Hi. Hey.
I'm leaving for the day.
I'm waiting on a transfer patient,
so I'll walk out with you.
Listen, I'm sorry about this morning.
No, I'm sorry.
I've been camping out on your couch
for six months.
I didn't mean to be a jerk about it.
No, I needed a good kick in the ass.
And I found a place-- with, uh, Ray, actually--
so I'll be leaving at the end of the week.
Well, take your time.
There's no rush, and by the way,
are you nuts?
Yes. Yes, I am.
So... random question.
ABBY: Yes?
Do you ever get crushes on people you work with?
What do you mean?
You know, crushes... on people... you work with.
Yeah, I guess, sometimes. Why?
I don't know...
What? What?
What?
Are you leaving for the night?
Yeah. Good night, guys.
Good night. Night.
Good night.
See you at home. Okay.
You know, you're really good
at teaching other people how to communicate.
Thanks.
We should try it ourselves sometime.
Yeah.
But my English, you know...
( laughs softly )
Now you're going to pull the Croatian card?
That's low.
You were right about one thing.
Oh, only one thing? Mm-hmm.
50 bucks was too much for a concert ticket.
