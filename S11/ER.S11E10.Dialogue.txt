Previously on ER:
You look like an old-fashioned doctor.
Well, I am an old-fashioned doctor.
Give yourself at least a week to be better
than the rest of us.
I think you're doing a great job.
I just wanted to make you aware
that there are still many, many, many, many
problems for you to work on.
And if there's one word
I can't emphasize enough, Susan, it's leadership.
That's it. Carry on.
Right, down from last year, I can see that.
Patient satisfaction scores?
Yes, Rush had a higher average.
They also have a bigger budget.
How'd we do?
All right, fine. I'm on it.
Weaver?
Yep. Otherwise known as the four-letter word,
beginning with a "C."
Crab?
73% of respondents would not recommend this ER to others.
Patients hate us.
Or more precisely, they hate the residents
for not listening, not spending enough time.
Ray, Morris, Pratt, they all scored 2.5 or lower.
Ah, could be worse.
The best being a five. Oops.
Last in the class? Neela at 2.12.
How about Abby?
Not bad at 4.15, but she's got other issues.
I'm telling you, they don't make interns like they used to.
Yeah, they're focused on the science at first.
Once you convince them they've mastered it,
they're free to focus on humanistic skills.
They're works in progress. They have to be taught.
But you can't teach empathy.
Or common sense.
Ray. Yeah?
When people come to the hospital,
they want to see a doctor, not a rock star.
Put on some scrubs.
You know, we do have a dress code here, people,
no stains, no tattered clothes, no leather, no piercings.
Got it?
You mean visible piercings, right?
And if your shift starts
at 7:00 and you come in at 7:02,
that's two minutes off another resident's life,
which is not only wrong, it's also salary-reducible.
You say something?
Think it's the tone of a woman's voice
that makes it easier to ignore?
Sorry?
I, uh, got a call from a Renal attending
about a dialysis order you finagled last week.
"Finagled"?
And in order to appease them,
I agreed to review three months' worth of your charts
for any irregularities. Wait a minute.
There were some concerns.
You started a central line with no procedure notes.
Well, wait. You reviewed all of my cases?
Here you admitted unstable angina patient to telemetry
before the troponin was back...
Yes, well, the bed was ready, the lab was slow.
And here we have: "Patient presents with rash,
discussed with Dr. Cohen, who agrees with the plan."
The problem is, no one in Derm,
including Dr. Cohen, has ever heard of this patient.
Abby, these are legal documents.
In a court of...
He had Lyme disease.
I didn't call Derm.
I called the Cohen in ID. And who are you?
What? Single MVA. ETA: two minutes.
You get promoted, and all of a sudden everyone's a slouch
and I'm falsifying medical documents?
Look, I'm pointing out.
Forget it. I'm on break.
Residents don't get breaks.
I'm waiting for the MVA then.
( tires screeching )
We need help! My brother's bleeding!
You a doctor? Yeah? What happened?
They shot him!
Where'd he get hit?
Please, you gotta help him.
I think he's dying!
Hey! Hey!
Hey!
What...? Go!
What are you doing?
BOY: Go, man! Come on!
Hey, let go of me!
LOCKHART: Get off me! Why are you...?
Stop this car!
What are you doing?
Help!
( grunting )
( grunting )
Help!
Loose! Loose!
Stop!
Hey! Help!
Shut up!
He's in the back. What?
Get in the back of the car!
( panting )
Got me from behind.
He came out the front.
( panting )
Oh, my God.
Fix him!
I can't. He has to go to the hospital.
I... I...
Fix my brother, bitch, before
I blow your head off.
Try to stay calm, all right?
( sighs ): I'm trying.
How long have you been short of breath?
Day or so.
My regular doctor's on vacation.
I'm pretty particular about who I see.
Smart lady. WOMAN ( crying ): Ai, ai. Ai!
Dr. Barnett will be with you...
WOMAN: Ai, ai, ai.
Ai, ai, ai!
Se√±ora, you need to settle down. Ai!
BARNETT: Ma'am, the splinter is out.
It can't possibly still hurt, okay?
Ai.
Neosporin dressing
and wound care instructions?
Yeah, you got it.
So, uh,
( clears throat ): was she faking or what?
That was what's affectionately known
in the ER as "Hispanic Panic."
Okay, let's see.
We've got cough and dyspnea on exertion.
How are we feeling,
Miss, um, Mitchell?
Ms. So-so, I guess.
Okay, "Ms." It is.
We're gonna run a few tests,
get back and examine you
as soon as possible.
Icon, CBC and chest X ray.
EKG, too?
You the man.
Thought "Ms." went out in the '80s.
Here you go. For the urinalysis.
Um... is there any chance
that I could see another doctor?
LOCKHART: He's lost a lot of blood.
I don't think there's anything I can do.
All right, um, um,
let me try to stop the bleeding.
Do you have a-a napkin or a towel or anything?
No, all he's got is CDs and crap.
Hey, CJ, you got any towels in your ride?
Use whatever you got till we get some supplies.
Listen to me.
You need more than supplies.
You need surgery.
( panting ): No, just...
Just patch me up. I'm good.
You need to go to a hospital.
( pained groaning, panting )
Make a list of everything I'm gonna need.
CJ: Hey, and get us some paper.
She moves, you shoot.
Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
I can't just patch you up, okay?
I can't, and even if I could, it wouldn't help.
You have got internal injuries, okay?
You could bleed to death...
Bullet went clean through.
U-Use a needle and thread if you got to.
Get him some antibiotics or whatever.
You got a medicine pad, right?
Start writing!
( sniffles )
RASGOTRA: Cause of ulcerative colitis is not known.
Probably some combination
of external agents and host factors.
More common in women or men?
Women.
Right. And peak incidence is bimodal.
Who can tell me the age range?
MAN: Excuse me, Miss?
RASGOTRA: Yes?
I know you're not my doctor,
but melanoma, when it's spreading, how long?
It's
impossible to say, sir.
It depends on the number of metastatic sites,
location of the primary lesion,
a number of factors.
( sobbing )
I'll make sure your doctor comes to see you.
( sobbing continues )
That was tough.
Yes, but there are some biological explanations
for excessive emotionality.
Who can tell me
the differential diagnosis of crying?
Starting with the obvious, limbic system lesion,
or temporal lobe mets would do it.
Could also be a thyroid dysfunction.
( sobbing ): Oh, God.
Other ideas?
Um, a sense of doom
has been associated with acute MI.
Right. Inappropriate weeping
can also be produced...
Neela...
that man's just been told his cancer has spread.
Don't you think he has a reason to cry?
Well, yes, of course, he does,
but there are also other organic causes of crying
which warrant consideration, too.
Excuse me.
This man's looking for anyone
who may have worked Monday.
I did. Can I help you?
MAN: Uh, my wife died here.
Uh, Jenna Putnam.
I was hoping, um, you know, talk to anybody
that, uh, might remember her.
I don't believe she was my patient.
Oh.
I'm sorry.
Maybe you can try asking in the Nurses Station.
Someone there should be able to help you.
Dr. Carter,
this, um, gentleman's wife
died here last week.
Oh.
I'm very sorry for your loss.
Thank you.
Um... I was up in Maine
and, you know, by the time I got back, uh...
You know, she was by herself.
You know.
And, well, I was just wondering if maybe she said anything,
or, uh, you know, she was scared.
What was her name?
Uh, Jenna Putnam.
Okay, I'll look into it for you.
I'm a social worker.
It might take me a while.
Do you want me to call you at home or...?
Oh, uh, could I wait here?
Uh, is that okay?
All right. Uh,
is there any way to know what, uh, room she was in?
Not really. No.
All right. Thank you.
( sighs ): Sad.
Yeah.
It's nice of you, by the way.
It's my job.
Um... Yes?
Maybe it's a little forward of me,
but I was wondering if you'd like to...
You know, it's bad enough
I got saddled with the shifts Chen dumped on me.
Now I've got residents bailing on me, too.
Have you seen Abby?
Uh, no. Why?
( sighs ): She went out to wait on a rig,
and she's been MIA ever since.
We can talk later.
When was this? Uh...
Hey, I've got a couple of more GSWs en route, ETA's five.
Okay. Half an hour ago, maybe 40 minutes.
And she went out to meet a rig?
Yeah, I called her on some stuff,
she got all bent out of shape and stormed off.
I guess I hurt her feelings or whatever,
and she declared herself on break.
Hey, you know what?
Malik, text-message Abby and tell her
to get her ass back on the job.
( pager beeps )
You don't got a cell phone?
( sniffles )
Not with me.
My brother's got one.
Plays this funny little song
when somebody calls.
He's like the captain of the ship, you know?
What's his name?
CJ.
( sniffles )
What's yours?
Mostly they call me Little C.
Why?
( sniffles )
Because CJ's really, really sick.
And I know your friend thinks...
Loose?
He's our cousin.
Well, I know he thinks
CJ can be helped this way, but he can't,
okay?
You need to listen to me. Listen to me.
I'm a doctor.
Your brother's gonna die
unless he gets an operation,
so we have to take him to the hospital.
( car door opening )
Get busy!
( sobbing )
Another one? Some kind of gang war going on?
Yeah, this one's got multiple GSWs to abdomen and legs.
I ain't in no gang!
Spontaneous resps, tachy at 121,
BP's holding at 106/64.
I'm Dr. Lewis.
What's your name?
I was just waitin' on a bus.
Second GSW's coming in on another rig.
Three others went to Mercy.
This one's the youngest.
She looks all of 13.
Hey, Jerry, did you get a hold of Abby yet?
I'm paging her now.
I need some light back here. I can't see anything.
What you got to do first?
Get his intestines back in.
That hurting him?
Yeah.
I have to keep pressure on this
to stop you from losing more blood.
Just do what you got to do.
I can't do anything while we're moving.
( yelling )
Damn. I think I hit something.
Oh, man, it's a little kitty cat.
Hey, fool, get back in here!
Hey, I think it's still alive.
Give me the gun.
( gunshot )
( pager beeping )
Is that you again?
I need you to help me lift his head up.
Come on.
All right, CJ,
I need you to swallow this, okay?
( gagging and coughing )
CJ...
Come on, dawg.
Good, man.
Drink it all down.
That's good.
Don't be stupid, all right? Pay attention.
Come on, sew me up.
Not yet.
I'll give the codeine
a little time to work.
One exit wound, right flank.
My dad usually drives me...
The other two bullets must be in the belly.
Through-and-through left thigh, distal pulses good.
It was for his birthday.
Hang in there, Tisha.
Ray, call the OR. Tell them we're on our way. Me?
There's blood in the foley.
Page urology. Looks like the bladder's been hit.
Want me to call in a dinner order while I'm at it?
Roll on my count: one, two, three.
I was just going to the mall.
Sat's only 84.
She needs an airway.
Neela, go. Pratt, go.
Pratt.
20 of etomidate and 100 of sux.
Set me up with a seven-five.
Tachy at 133,
BP's 82/50. Central line kit,
sterile 7's and a gram of cefotetan.
Can I do the femoral?
Last resort in abdominal trauma.
Could end up pouring blood and fluids
into a severed vessel.
How about a subclavian then?
No, call the blood bank, tell them to send
type-specific directly to the OR.
Systolic's dropping-- 78.
Okay, another liter and mix up dopamine.
Bag her.
Urology knows.
Good, now call for an X-ray and a vent.
Are you serious?
Second GSW's coming in. Can you guys spare a resident?
Yes, she can.
Take Pratt, too. We can handle this.
BP's 82/59.
How much dopamine?
None. Aim for relative hypotension in a young person
with internal bleeding.
If you jack up the BP, she'll just bleed more.
She can tolerate the lower numbers.
Fine. Pretty controversial approach,
but hey, guys, I just work here.
Saline flush and O-silk.
Hey, Malik, can you waste this ketamine for me?
Done deal.
Excuse me, sir...
I can feel her presence.
It's-it's very strong here.
Uh, sorry?
Uh, I'm...
uh, I'm pretty sure this is where my wife died.
She was in a-a car accident this week.
Do you remember her?
Uh, well, I-I'm not quite sure
that I was working on that day.
Well, she has red hair.
Uh... well, she had.
It was... flaming.
What was her name?
Jenna.
Hazel eyes.
Ringing any bells?
( sniffles )
This is stupid. This is stupid.
CJ: No...
No... I'm feelin' better.
No, it's needle and thread. It's not going to work.
He just said he was feeling better.
You're going to bleed to death.
Sewing him up like this is-is-is-is-is pointless.
You need surgery. Do it.
I can barely see what I'm doing.
You heard him.
( sighs )
This should numb it up a little bit.
( gasping ): All right, it's good.
It's good.
All right.
Okay.
( grunting softly )
Listen...
brace yourself.
( wailing )
( screaming ): What you doin' to me, woman?!
She's just trying to put in an IV, dude.
Settle down. What'd you call me?
We'll give you something for the pain as soon as we get
this line in.
Ray, secondary survey. Let's go.
Yeah, you're okay, homey. Bullet just grazed your scalp.
Man, what'd you buy, a book to learn how to talk like that?
He's just saying you're lucky
'cause the bullet didn't cause more damage.
Nah, you the lucky one. You free.
Wound's superficial, chest is clear,
pelvis stable, distal pulses good.
I bet you like hip hop, too, huh, Mr. Cool Guy?
We sent for a CBC, trauma panel, PT,
PTT, type and screen and five of morphine.
That's what I'm talking about, my brother. Shut up.
Bolus is in.
TKO. What else? That's about it.
Entrance and exit sites left upper arm,
small laceration right arm. Dr. Barnett, that lady
with the splinter's asking for you.
Thanks. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You didn't roll him yet. Pratt's got him.
Excuse me?
Got a better connection.
And what connection is that?
He's obviously not comfortable with me,
so what do you want me to do?
Ray, we're in the middle of a trauma.
Nobody gets to be comfortable.
I've got a patient who needs me.
LOOSE: How's he doin'?
He's going to die if he doesn't get to a hospital.
Listen...
can I ask what's the plan here?
Just stay out of sight
till the cops are gone.
Then we can get him home.
( scoffs ): To get something to eat.
Neela, I need to talk
to you later about your patient satisfaction scores.
Is there a problem? Yeah, they sucked. Abby, are you there?
Abby, you can't be serious. Come on, walking off a shift?
If you're there, pick up.
Fine, all right, call me if you get this message.
Wow, was she really that pissed off?
Abby left? Yeah, and now I'm pissed.
Here, Neela, go satisfy a patient.
Weeping pregnant teenager in Curtain Three.
Make eye contact, introduce yourself,
stay in the room longer than two minutes.
Um, I'm about to go and do a digital block.
I'm not really asking.
Dr. Lewis, uh, that patient of Ray's,
uh, still waiting to see you.
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
What'd she say?
Uh, fatigue and shortness of breath.
No, about Ray.
Oh, I don't know. She didn't say.
Hi, I'm Dr. Lewis, What seems to be the problem?
Just a little winded, mostly.
Any fever? Coughing up any junk?
No.
A little effusion here.
What's that mean?
Uh, just some fluid around your lungs,
but heart looks good. No pneumonia.
Does that hurt?
No, I just...
I didn't tell the other doctor that...
Sam, could you go check on her labs?
Sure.
Hey, why is Lewis seeing my patient?
Uh, the patient... The labs just got back here a second ago.
What the hell does she want from me anyway?
Ms. Mitchell,
I'm so sorry to keep you waiting,
but I think I can explain to you
why you've been so tired lately.
You're pregnant.
Congratulations.
I think I got this.
No, you don't.
Come again?
Excuse us.
Yes, I still need to work up the effusion,
but it's not like I need a chaperone.
She requested another doctor.
Why would she do that?
Maybe because she's a he
and didn't feel comfortable telling you that.
She's a pre-op transsexual.
But it was a positive pregnancy test.
Yeah, which in a man means only one thing.
$11.52, please.
Busy night, huh?
A little.
( register beeping and opening )
Three cheeseburgers, three fries.
Three sodas.
Bottled water...
and a Frosty.
Anything else?
LITTLE C: Hey, dawg,
get some extra ketchup.
LOOSE: Extra ketchup.
You have a nice night.
Thanks, you too.
So... snowboarding... you and I...
overnight at Telluride next Friday?
Ah, oh.
What? Don't tell me you're a skier.
That, and, uh... I have other plans.
Oh.
Dr. Carter, I think
my six-year-old knee pain has "skiffy."
A little young for that.
Go ahead, order the films.
Look, I, uh...
I realize this might sound a bit weird...
Me and Abby have been roommates
for a while now, but you've known her
for a lot longer.
I was wondering if you thought I should be worried.
She's not back yet?
No, and I can't imagine her
just walking off her shift like that, can you?
Uh, no, but that doesn't mean that she wouldn't.
( rap music playing loudly )
Um... hello?!
Hey!
What?
( clears throat ): I need to use a bathroom.
Please?
Hey, um... you just drove p-past the gas station.
You just drove past the gas station.
Where you going?
Excuse me. Where are you going?!
You know what?
It's okay. It's okay.
Uh, never mind.
Hello. Get out.
I really didn't... I said get out.
Okay.
Let's move! Okay.
Said you had to go.
Go...
but you ain't going alone.
Right here?
Drop 'em and go!
Come on!
( sniffles )
Scared of big black men, huh?
No, I'm scared of big black guns.
Yeah. Soon, hopefully.
CJ? I don't know exactly.
CJ, how you doing?
I'm not sure.
Yeah.
Okay, I guess.
See that?
Now look here.
Just got mine a few weeks ago.
Healed nice.
What's it mean?
LOOSE: Skin called, dawg.
I don't know exactly.
He don't want to tell me.
Told me not to get one.
Whatever. Find out soon enough.
LOOSE: Yeah, all right, dawg. Yeah.
Peace.
( sighing )
Cops been all over the hood.
Boo said they'll call when they're gone.
We'll take him home then.
Yo, give me those, man.
What, my comics? For real?
I need it for the fire.
Dawg, I'm right in the middle of a story.
( paper tearing )
I'll tell you a story.
( sighing )
LOOSE: So there was this punk and his girl, right?
They was parked out in the middle
of nowhere, you know what I'm saying?
Kind of like this.
They was in the car,
working it, getting things all hot and sweaty,
you know what I'm saying?
( lighter clicking )
But on the radio...
Can I have one of those?
Gives you cancer.
CARTER: Granted, she has been under
a lot of pressure, but...
It's still not like her.
I mean, she can be also be very emotional.
Easily hurt, stubborn...
Then again, she might just be going out for a walk.
Yeah, probably just blowing off smoke someplace.
Steam.
Hmm?
Did you two finish your QA reports?
Uh... no, not quite exactly.
When were those due again?
This sucks.
Susan...
You know why? Because it sets a tone.
What tone? If my attendings
don't take me seriously,
why should the rest of the staff?
You're taken seriously.
All right. What do I have to do?
Pull rank? Okay, I'm the chief of this department.
If I set a deadline, it needs to be honored.
Okay, I'm sorry. Okay, I'm sorry.
No, forget sorry.
Just do what I ask when I ask it.
Dr. Carter.
That gang kid's crashing.
I guess the fire helped.
He ain't shivering no more.
CJ?
CJ! He's apnic! Help me get him on his back.
What's apnic?
He's not breathing.
Nah, he's warm right now.
He doesn't have a pulse!
What are you doing?!
Trying to get his heart started.
What the hell happened?!
PRATT: He was just fine five minutes ago.
Ativan's in. Sat's only 79.
What did the head CT show?
Not done yet. Keeps getting bumped for more acute cases.
More acute than this?
Seizure's stopped.
The wound was superficial.
The guy had a GCS of 15.
Sometimes tangential GSWs can cause intracranial bleeding.
I saw him. He was lucid and he was talking.
Bilateral papilledema.
50 of mannitol, come on.
He's not moving air.
Intubate, hyperventilate,
and this time run him to the scanner.
CARTER: 8-O and Mac 2.
Okay, he needs to go to a hospital.
He ain't gonna let us do that!
He's unconscious, he can't tell you what to do anymore!
( puffing )
CJ, can you hear me?
Can you hear me, CJ?!
He can't hear you.
Just do something!
I am.
Watch your back.
He's posturing. Sedation's wearing off.
Okay. Dose him again when we get inside.
The movement will help jack up his ICP.
What did CT say?
PRATT: Diffuse hemorrhagic contusions with edema.
Ventricles are collapsed.
SAM: He's bradying down.
Blown pupil.
Neurosurg ready for him?
I said the bleed was inoperative.
If we don't decompress the brain, he'll herniate and die.
Sam, page Neurosurg again.
They're stuck in the OR.
with an emergent shunt revision.
We'll do a ventriculostomy here.
Cool.
Sam, let's get Neela for this.
What? I've only gotten to do it once before.
Yeah, and she's never done it at all.
Somebody needs to help me do this.
Do what?
The breathing part.
...five.
One breath after I count to five.
I can't do it myself anymore!
You.
Okay, fine, you do the compressions,
I'll do the breathing.
Get in here.
Here.
Put your hands like this right here.
You press down hard five times.
One, two, three, four, five.
I'll give a breath.
All right? One, two,
three, four,
five.
Go. Come on.
Go. Do it.
Go ahead. One...
two... three...
PRATT: Hey, I need a flush.
Sorry, took a while to find her.
Checked the Jumbo Mart. Abby's not there. What's this?
You're doing a ventriculostomy.
I've made the skin incision.
What?!
3-O silk.
Getting your flush, Pratt.
Separate the attachments of the temporal muscle from the bone.
Is it normal to have this much bleeding?
Yes. Sterile gauze and retractor.
I can't see.
More gauze, Sam.
NEELA: Frontal bone's exposed.
Nice. You'll use the twist drill
to penetrate the outer cranium.
Hold it perpendicular to the skull
toward the ipsilateral medial canthus.
Like this?
Perfect.
You can do this, okay?
Hey... oh, sorry.
What is it?
I just need Neela when she has a sec.
This about my pregnant teenager?
No, a guy whose wife died here last week.
He's been hanging around the hospital for a couple of hours.
Wants to talk to the doctor who handled her.
That'd be you.
One, two,
three, four...
Where are we?
...five.
One, two...
I don't know.
three...
He really needs help. ...four, five.
Can't... can't do it no more.
Can't do it no more.
I got it.
One,
two, three,
four, five.
One, two,
three,
four, five.
Hey.
Hi.
Dr. Lewis was pulled into a critical case
and won't be available for a while.
Now, I'm sure you prefer her to do this.
We don't have a lot of time.
Unfortunately, I'm going to have to be the one to tell you.
We think you have testicular cancer.
What?
And your urine was positive
for a hormone called beta-HCG.
Now, in women, that hormone means pregnancy.
In men, it means testicular cancer.
Are you sure?
Yeah. We've run a number of blood tests
that support the diagnosis
and we will do a testicular ultrasound,
but yeah, I'm sure.
But listen, it's treatable.
Even if it spreads,
your chances are great, okay?
That's funny.
What?
I was getting rid of the equipment anyway.
Ms. Mitchell...
You mind if I ask you why you wanted another doctor?
It's like you put on some kind of show here,
like you're not comfortable in your own skin.
I don't trust that kind of energy, I know it too well.
...three, four, five.
One, two...
He dying?
( sniffling ): Yes.
Three, four, five.
He ain't dying, bitch! You hear me?
Don't you let him die!
...three, four,
five. Come on!
( sniffling )
One, two,
three...
( sobbing )
( sobbing quietly )
( sniffles )
( sobbing quietly )
Come on.
No, wait. Wait. I said let's go!
Please...
Ain't got no shovel here. We gotta do it somewhere else.
Close it up.
Listen, you don't have to do this.
You don't have to do this.
Lay down.
Let's go.
I said lay down.
Transducer's reading on the portable.
Bring a dose of Ativan with you.
Pratt, walk him up to ICU.
Me?
Yeah, just to be safe.
Thank you. That was incredible.
You're gifted technically, Neela.
That's what makes you feel best about yourself.
Now all you have to do is take the confidence
you have when you do a procedure like that,
and just put it in the other half of your game.
I'm not sure I know what you mean.
Here's her chart-- Jenna Putnam,
multiple injuries sustained in an MVC.
Your signature.
I still can't believe it.
Well, we handle what--
20, 30 cases a day?
Easy to see how you could forget.
But it was just Monday.
I don't know what to tell him.
Yes, you do.
Dr. Kovac, I have no memory of that man's wife.
Are you telling me to lie?
No, I'm telling you to trust yourself enough to comfort.
Mr. Putnam?
Yes?
I'm sorry I didn't recognize your wife's name earlier.
Oh, no, that's okay.
But you do remember her now, though?
She was lovely.
She... talked about how much you meant to her.
How much she loved you.
And I don't think she was scared.
Hey!
Changed my plans.
I'm sorry?
Telluride-- I'm in.
If the offer's still open.
Yeah, yeah.
What?
Nothing.
Oh, it's something. I can tell.
I just...
Are you all right moving... forward
with... this?
Yeah. Are you?
Yeah.
Good.
Okay.
LEWIS: She wasn't even in the room?
Nope.
He pulled her from somewhere else...
Hey, Carter, I need your opinion on something.
Talk to you later?
Yeah.
What's up?
Neurosurg called to find out
why Kovac did a ventriculostomy in the ER
without one of them there--
which is difficult enough to explain.
Factor in the idea that he actually let Neela perform it...
And so...?
A: It's a very difficult procedure.
B: In a delicate situation like that,
it's customary to let the most senior resident
have first crack at it, and Pratt was right there.
Hey, I told her it was no big deal.
Well, I'm going to talk to Kovac about it.
Are you kidding?
No, I'm not kidding.
You don't think it's a bit of
an overreaction?
Thanks for your support.
Look, Susan, I understand
you want to define yourself as Chief.
I do. We all do. But?
Are you sure that this is the way you want to do it?
( sniffling, sobbing )
LOOSE: Stop crying now.
Ain't gonna bring him back.
( sobbing continues )
LOOSE: It's almost 9:00.
They'll be getting up around the block around now.
Listen.
I'm not going to tell anybody.
Okay, I really won't.
I just want to go home.
Hiding out, are you?
Uh, maybe.
Sometimes I'd use the utility closet instead.
Worse lighting, but more privacy.
So, how's it going?
Good.
Oh, actually, it blows.
Every time I turn around,
I'm either offending someone,
or hurting someone's feelings
or acting like a total...
crab.
Tell me about it.
It sucks to be in charge.
So what do you do?
Oh, get used to not being liked.
That's it? That's your advice?
Look, it's what we as women have the hardest time with--
we want to be liked, care what people think.
But the fact is, when you're in a position of authority,
you're gonna piss people off
and you're gonna lose friends.
Thanks.
Hope it helps.
ABBY ( on machine ): Hi. This is Abby.
Leave a message and I'll call you back.
( beep )
Hey, it's Susan.
You're probably not there.
I don't know, maybe you're at the movies,
or down by the river having a smoke.
If that's the case, I should be pissed.
If it's not, I'm worried.
Hopefully, I'll see you here before you get this message.
Sorry about today.
LOOSE: This is it.
Let's go.
We got business to take care of.
Get out.
Thanks, anyway.
