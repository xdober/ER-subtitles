Previously on ER:
Look, Luka...
I'm glad we're friends.
But I've got a dad.
Fingernails, tattoo, the hair?
It's the whole package. Well, I'll talk to my band mates
and see if I can't pull it back a little.
You off? Yeah.
If you wait for a second, I'll walk out with you.
Okay.
Damn it!
( speaking Chinese )
Son of a bitch!
He should be in a nursing home.
I'd never do that to him.
You can stay here for tonight. Plenty of room.
Actually, you can stay as long as you'd like.
( shower running )
KOVAC: Hey.
SAM: Hey. How was your night?
The usual.
Anything good?
Uh, guy got his arm caught in a sausage-making machine.
( chuckling )
Nice.
I'm not on until 9:00.
I can drop Alex off at school,
but can you pick him up at 3:00?
Sure. After I get some sleep.
Morning.
( yawns )
Mom, I need ten bucks for the class field trip to Millennium Park.
Okay.
They've got a giant silver sculpture
shaped like a bean.
If I don't get the money in today,
I have to stay behind and do homework with the fifth graders.
Okay, okay.
What, you've never seen a kid pee before?
This is gonna bounce.
Whoa. That's a lot of zeros.
Tuition was expensive.
No wonder you're still sleeping on Abby's sofa.
You know, you can defer paying off your loans
until after you finish residency.
Not this one. This is for my father.
What? Your dad's leaning on you?
It's for my brother's university tuition.
My parents put me through school,
so now it's my turn to help.
They can't wait until after residency,
when you're making the real money?
Is there something you need, Ray?
How would you like to work Christmas for me?
I'm already working New Year's.
Look, you do Christmas,
and I'll take your New Year's Eve.
You'd work New Year's Eve? It's important for my mom
to have us all together on Christmas.
Come on, I'll take Ramadan for you.
I'm not Muslim, I'm Sikh.
Oh, great. Well, I'll cover
whenever you want to take a Sikh day.
Oh, this is unbelievable.
What? Weaver's got a boyfriend?
Only 39% of the staff
has had a flu shot this year.
I don't want massive absenteeism in January.
I had mine. I'll get one today.
How 'bout you, Ray? Uh, tomorrow.
My band's gotta play at Delilah's tonight.
Can't have a sore arm. Sore arm?
How about 100% compliance by next week?
You have had some lame excuses for the past two months.
What are you talking about? First you had a cold.
Oh, yeah, then you were sleep-deprived.
Police officer got shot. ETA: two minutes.
Where's the wound? I couldn't understand them.
The sirens were too loud. All right, let's clear Trauma One.
Neela, Ray, Chuny, you're with me.
Call upstairs to the OR and RT.
Mary, get some extra security down here
to handle the press.
Do me a favor. Give me a flu shot today.
What?
Yeah, get me when I'm not expecting it.
Just stick me quick.
I got a thing about needles.
NEELA: Paramedics probably have two IVs.
You can go femoral, if we need it.
( tires screeching )
( brakes squeal )
Eddie Escobar, caught one in the neck.
Lost a lot of blood. This is a "throw and go"?
We were ten blocks away. ! I'm Dr. Lewis.
You're at County General.
You should have called the paramedics.
We'd still be waiting on the street.
C-collar. Board's ready.
One, two, three.
We're going to give you oxygen through your nose,
okay, Eddie? Thank you.
Pulse is thready.
Take my keys, Gary.
It's okay, Eddie. Try not to move.
Someone needs to feed my dogs.
Have an intubation tray ready.
And there's a filing cabinet
in the bedroom with all my papers.
Yeah, forget about that.
You're gonna be okay. Tell him, Doc.
Trauma panel, type and cross for six units,
call X ray, get a portable neck and chest.
I threw up all over Amy's collage.
It was so embarrassing.
Oh, that's okay.
We see like 100 puking kids a day.
Really?
Mm-hmm.
Mom's here. This is Dr. Lockhart.
Hi. School nurse called my office.
Uh, yeah, they sent her in for vomiting and fever.
Is she okay?
Well, seems like it's just the flu.
Are you okay, honey?
I should take her to see our doctor.
Well, she's here now. Why don't you...?
I see how busy you are.
Well, it's not that...
You want to go see Dr. Ben?
( stammers )
Look, it's probably just
the stomach flu. Let us run a few tests,
we'll give her some IV fluid, she'll be good as new.
How long's that going to take? About an hour.
Can we move her to a real room?
I'll work on it.
Oh, hey, Sam, this little girl needs a line
and Tigan.
You'll have to ask Malik.
Excuse me! Excuse me.
Excuse me! Sub-Q air, but otherwise okay.
Come on. Excuse me! Two units oh neg.
Looks like the bullet missed your spinal cord.
That's good, buddy. Excuse me.
That's good news. Sats aren't so hot.
LEWIS: He needs plastic.
RAY: Yeah, I'm all over it.
LEWIS: Eddie, we're gonna stick a tube down your throat
to give you more oxygen.
Whatever you say, Doc.
You're gonna go to sleep first.
20 of Etomidate, 800 of SUX.
Everyone else okay?
We're all good, Eddie.
You get the perp?
Couple of double taps to the chest. He went down.
Go for it, Ray.
SAM: What happened?
McWAYNE: Convenience store holdup.
Chased the guy into an apartment building.
Called for backup,
the scumbag starts shooting
out the window.
All right, there's too much blood.
SAM: Pulse ox only 72.
LEWIS: Okay, pull out and bag him up.
You want me to do it?
RAY: No, no, no, I got it. Give me a straight blade.
You cut yourself.
No, that's...
It's nothing. We should take care of it.
No, really, it's okay.
One more shot, Ray.
Ray?
Just... give me some cricoid pressure.
I can get this.
I still can't see the cords.
Okay, that's it. You want me to try?
How 'bout you try?
RAY: Crike tray.
Yeah?
Yes. Betadine.
11 blade. No, Sam, third drawer of the crash cart.
Get the trake light.
The what?
You going fiber optic?
Not exactly.
Got it. Where's the scope?
It's a blind procedure.
Great. Who's in charge of this ER? That would be me.
You can stay here, sir, but you have to be quiet.
Okay...
Bend the tip to 90 degrees.
Turn the lights off.
Pass in the midline, with the jaw forward.
Sats are dropping. Shouldn't we be prepping the neck?
When you're through the cords, you'll see a pre-tracheal glow.
He needs a crike.
That's the glow. You won't see it
if you're in the esophagus.
Okay, that's it.
Bag him. Turn the lights on.
Very slick.
How about a subclavian?
Okay. Good breath sounds.
Number six gloves, Dr. Barnett?
Seven and a half.
Sterile drape and finder needle, please.
OFFICER: I've got Mallory.
This is Eddie's fiancee.
LEWIS: Okay.
( sobbing ): Oh, my God, Eddie...
I'm Dr. Lewis. He's doing okay.
He was shot?
Once.
In the neck.
He's sedated with medication,
but you can sit with him, hold his hand if you want.
I was playing around with my nephew.
We were wrestling.
Looks like he kicked your butt. Is the rib sore?
Right there, yeah.
Okay, Mr. Sakabu, I think it's nothing but a bruise.
What about my shoulder?
( sighs )
Any pain when I press?
It's more on the inside.
It's probably just a strain.
I'll have the nurse bring your discharge instructions.
Hey, hey, hey, I didn't know you were in today.
Oh, my stupid alarm didn't go off.
Rough night, huh?
Yeah.
You okay?
Uh-huh.
Okay, got a quick one for you, ready for discharge.
Uh... give me a couple of minutes, okay?
Good news. Labs are fine. White count's not elevated...
So, we can go.
Mom...
( sobbing ): Mom.
Are you all right, honey?
What's wrong?
It hurts now.
Where does it hurt?
Right here!
Here?
Ow!
So, tell me, does it hurt more when I take my hand away?
Ow. Listen, I'm going to get you
some medicine for that pain, okay?
I need to run some more tests.
Start with four of MS.
Thanks.
I thought she'd be better by now.
Well, sometimes what starts out
looking like stomach flu
ends up to be something else.
Like what? Appendicitis.
You said it wasn't serious. Well, it may not be.
I'd just like to have a surgeon take a look at it...
You think she needs an operation? It's a possibility.
Oh, God. No.
No, she's not having surgery, not here.
If she does need it, it's a very simple operation.
I need to talk to my husband. Okay, there's time.
I need to do another blood test, possibly do an X ray...
You can't do surgery without my permission, right?
Right.
One step at a time, okay?
You call your husband; I'll get things started.
Excuse me.
Hey, Ray. Is Carter in there?
No, just Lewis.
How's the cop?
Stable for now. What's in your hand?
A chart. Okay, the other hand.
A pen. I didn't say I'd do it.
Hey, anybody seen Dr. Chen?
Sorry.
Do you have any plans for New Year's Eve?
You're not really my type.
Funny.
My band's got a party gig.
Can you take the p.m. for me?
On New Year's Eve?
Well, look at it this way:
You won't have to go to a square dance by yourself.
Or with a date, or whatever.
You give my med student lecture for me in January.
Deal.
Suspect's been wounded and apprehended.
Do we have an ETA?
No, I'm sorry. They haven't called it in yet.
We'll be with the family.
Okay.
Ten-year-old girl, fever, vomiting,
right lower quadrant tenderness.
Rule out appy.
Yeah, CT or ultrasound?
It depends.
What the hell was that?
What?
PRATT: Jing Mei...
Hmm.
Oh, sorry.
Coffee was brewing.
You okay to work?
Uh... uh-huh, yeah, sure.
What have you got?
35-year-old, strain and sprain.
Chest and shoulder contusion.
Okay...
You don't want to see the patient?
No, I trust you.
How's your dad doing?
( sighs )
Okay.
I mean, I've got a nurse for him 16 hours a day,
and then from 11:00 to 7:00, it's just me.
So, you're not getting much sleep?
No, a couple hours.
Hey, Dr. Chen, Carter's got a baby in status.
Need you for that suspect in that cop shooting.
How soon? Right now.
( sighs )
Multiple gunshots to the chest and abdomen.
Any vitals? No pulse in the field.
That's the son of a bitch. How long was he down?
Cops had to secure the building.
How long did that take? They made us wait 45 minutes.
It only takes 20 minutes to bleed out. If there'd have been
a second shooter in there, she'd be full of holes, too, okay?
Prep two of O-neg on the infuser.
NEELA: On my count. One, two...
Hold on. Hold on. He's cuffed.
Who's got the key? ! Not me. You got the keys, Tommy?
I'll check with Hogan. Quickly, please.
Start on the paramedic gurney.
Betadine, 32 french.
Thoracotomy's all yours, Neela.
You're going to assist? ! You'll be fine.
Sterile gloves and a 10 blade.
MALIK: First unit's up.
I need to lift up his arm
to make the incision. ! Excuse me.
Where's the damn key? We're working on it.
Malik, get the bolt cutters. Take it easy.
I've got it. Can the officers wait outside?
The suspect's in police custody and uncuffed. We're waiting right here.
I don't think he's going to jump off the bed anytime soon.
Hook up the thoraseal. Give her room to work.
You think he's got a chance?
Why do you think they're letting me crack his chest?
That thing's got to wait outside.
That "thing" is a service animal.
A service animal with fleas.
Actually, fleas have a natural aversion to minis.
Hey, Abby, Dilantin level's back on...
Carter, this is Mrs. Gelden and her guide horse, Ruby.
Who should be outside.
We let seeing-eye dogs in here.
Our floors are gonna be
covered with horse crap.
She's housebroken.
What if she spooks?
Oh, we've been on the El,
airplanes, elevators.
She can stay.
Thank you.
See you later, Ruby.
Dr. Carter, Officer Escobar's son is here.
Okay, we're-we're still working on his dad.
The kid's anxious to see him.
Let me... let me go check for you.
Thanks.
No, we're too close to the skull.
Can you stop the bleeding?
Direct pressure for now.
Got it. Call Angio.
Maybe we can balloon the proximal carotid.
They just picked up his son at school.
Arlo's here?
How old is your son?
15. I'm not his mother.
Arlo's from Eddie's first marriage.
Fine. Throw down a fresh drape.
I'll be next door.
RAY: CVC's in. Need a repeat chest.
Hey, Arlo.
It's not as bad as it looks.
It's okay. You can come on up here.
What is she doing here?
I want her out right now. Mom...
Uh, excuse me, ma'am.
Let's not get into this.
ARLO: Mom, come on.
You shouldn't be here.
Mom! Mom! Get out!
Can you just shut up!
Okay, everybody shut up.
Officer, you and Mallory need to step outside.
I don't want to leave him.
Everyone gets to see him,
just one at a time.
Come on.
LEWIS: We're going to start X rays on your father.
You can say hello quickly.
Dad.
It's Arlo.
I'm here.
He can't talk with the tube in his mouth.
You're going to be all right.
LEWIS: Ray, take them to the family room.
RAY: Me?
You're tough, Dad.
All right, honey. That's enough.
Dr. Barnett will answer any questions you have.
Okay, right this way, guys.
LEWIS: Sam, check a second hemocue.
I think it's next door. ! Yes.
You got a rhythm?
Units five and six are up.
Hold compressions.
Asystole.
How's his volume?
Heart's filling well.
Too many holes.
We could try high-dose epi.
CARTER: Penetrating trauma
with no pulse in the field.
Okay.
11:07.
He's dead?
Yeah.
You just saved the taxpayers a million bucks
in trial fees and prison costs.
What happened to your wrist?
Oh. I don't know.
Neela, do you want to help Officer McWayne out here?
I was gonna find some family...
Why don't you get Officer McWayne started
in the suture room?
Sorry about the misunderstanding.
Some people are freaked out by little animals.
I'm going to clean your cut out.
I have a cousin who gets nervous
around Chihuahuas.
Is she wearing sneakers?
Yes. It keeps her from slipping on the floor.
My husband wants her transferred to Mercy.
Surgery's on their way down to check her out.
We want to move her.
You're gonna have to find a surgeon at Mercy
to accept her before I can okay a transfer.
Whoa, whoa!
Hey! Hey! Back off, Ruby.
Doctor, can you come to the phone?
Yes. Just one minute, okay?
I'll be right back.
Re-prep the wound and tie up the horse.
It's my husband. He's driving back from Detroit.
Okay. Hi. This is Dr. Lockhart...
Yes, I am.
( loud screaming )
Mr. Trager...
M-Mr. Trager.
I-I understand.
We will.
Yes, your wife is working on that right now.
We-We would never do that, sir.
I got paged about a patient transfer?
Wendall Meade, Social Services.
Okay, well, why... Thank God you're here.
Sir, why don't you just get here as soon as you can
and we won't make any decisions...
( dial tone )
Nice talking to you, too.
Little pinprick... and some burning.
( groans )
Sorry.
Ow...
Must be a pain in the ass
having to waste all that time
trying to save a scumbag's life.
He jacked a mini-mart, doc.
Looks like a 14-year-old.
Feels like a foreign body.
Something hard.
Is it possible you were shot?
I don't think so.
I remember I scraped my wrist when I fell.
How about there?
Mm-mm. That's a loop of bowel.
I left messages for three surgeons at Mercy.
They'll call back.
How long can we wait?
ABBY: Eight to ten hours.
Hmm. I can't find the appendix.
What does that mean?
Uh, usually if it's enlarged, it's easy to find.
So she may not have appendicitis?
Well, it's not a perfect test.
She could still have the disease
even if the ultrasound is normal.
Can't you people give me a straight answer?
I would say, based on her fever and tenderness
that it is appendicitis.
Well, she said it was the stomach flu,
and then she changed her mind.
Now you can't find her appendix?
Transfer Center from Mercy
wants to talk to the attending.
Finally.
Hang a gram of cefotetan.
Do you think I need an operation?
Do I need it soon?
Yup.
Can I have it here?
Well, you could,
but your parents want you to have it
at a different hospital.
Won't that take a while?
Not too long. It'll be okay.
Why can't I decide?
Because when you're a kid,
your parents get to decide what's best.
The only way to stop the bleeding right now
is by blowing up a balloon in his artery.
This X ray is gonna guide us to the right spot.
How does he get blood to his brain?
Dr. Lewis?
That's a good question, Arlo.
Two carotid arteries supply the brain,
right and left. Okay?
If one gets blocked, Mother Nature has a backup plan.
It is called the circle of Willis.
It's a detour,
but it allows the blood from the right
to get over to the lefthand side.
I understand.
So, he can recover?
Well, priority number one is to stop the bleeding.
If you're not wearing lead, we need to ask you to leave.
Okay I'll come get you when we're done, all right?
Thanks, Dr. Barnett.
Ray is fine.
Okay, Ray.
FRANK: Sam,
Dr. Kovac called.
Did you take a message?
Sounds like your kid got suspended from school again.
I may need to leave.
In a minute.
Dr. Lewis...
Have them step outside.
I removed a foreign body from Officer McWayne's arm.
What's that?
Feels like a plastic BB.
Could be what shot your patient, as well.
I don't think that's enough to sever a carotid artery.
You sure?
Officer Escobar was shot with this metal slug
from the sub-Q, right upper trapezius.
Looks like a nine-millimeter.
Is that what the suspect used?
I don't think so.
Nine-millimeter semi-automatic,
standard issue. That's what we carry.
KOVAC: I can pick him up. It's not a problem. Stay at work.
SAM: Well, what is it about?
I don't know. The school didn't tell me anything.
What do you mean they didn't tell you?
What did he do?
They just said, uh, to come in for a meeting.
Well, is he okay?
Yeah, yeah, he's fine. He's fine.
All right. Well, just call me as soon as you get back.
I will.
Okay. Thanks. I have a tetanus shot for Officer McWayne.
Oh, uh, they're being interviewed
about the friendly fire thing.
Is it for sure now?
Well, they found a pellet gun
next to the suspect at the scene.
So he didn't shoot the cop then?
Guess not.
Arlo, you should be in the Family Room.
Is that the guy who shot my dad?
He was the suspect they were pursuing.
Can I go in there?
Probably not a good idea.
I want to see him.
Arlo...
He's a kid.
You don't have to do this.
Was he on drugs?
I can't say.
Did he have a police record?
I don't know.
Why would he do that?
Why would he shoot my dad?
Arlo, we're not exactly sure who shot your dad.
He may have been accidentally shot by a police officer.
What?
But-But I thought he...
This guy was only carrying a BB gun.
They won't know for sure
until the ballistics tests are completed.
Oh, man.
One of his own guys?
McWAYNE: Arlo?
Can we talk to you?
Which one of you guys did it?
We don't know anything yet.
Why don't we go and sit down somewhere?
We're sorry. It's not your fault.
It comes with the job.
There, our balloon is up, and the vessel is occluded.
Can we ask family in?
Not just yet.
Entrance wound is dry as a bone.
Nice.
He's not waking up.
He's still comatose with a flaccid paralysis
and an upgoing toe.
LEWIS: So much for collateral flow.
But you can repair the carotid.
DUBENKO: Oh, it'd likely do more harm
than good. It's not a procedure that I'm comfortable with.
But if the wife consents...
Uh, it's his fiancée.
It's not her call then.
We have an ex-wife.
Is there a blood relative?
Yeah, a son, but he's 15.
Could he be a mature minor?
A what?
It's when a kid's mature enough to make medical decisions.
LEWIS: Could be.
Okay. I'll talk to him.
LEWIS: Get Wendall in
on this, and, uh, find me if you need me, okay?
Okay.
Dr. Dubenko, need you right now.
Uh, keep his crit above 30, P02 90.
Ten-year-old appy, systolic's 60.
She's septic?
Antibiotics are on board.
We're running in a liter.
Who saw her from surgery?
No one. Family wants her transferred.
That isn't happening.
Dr. Hong at Mercy accepted her.
Pressure's up to 70 with 500.
They're sending an ambulance.
I'm sorry, ma'am. Your daughter is very sick.
She needs surgery right now. Do we have consent?
No. She said we could wait.
In most cases we could.
This is unusual.
The infection spread to her bloodstream
very quickly. I'm sorry, Mrs. Trager.
We need your consent for surgery.
My husband will be here any minute.
We don't have time. I need to wait for him.
It's life-threatening.
Okay. We'll "double doctor" it.
Wha... What?
Two physician signatures can override your consent.
Well...
Sign it. Sign it. Let's go.
This is not what we agreed on.
I'm sorry.
I've never done this before.
No one gets in trouble
for acting in the best interest of the patient.
Tell that to Dr. Corday.
...treating your...
Sorry, I was tied up.
Everyone, this is Wendall Meade.
Hi, Arlo. C-Can he stay?
If it's okay with Arlo.
Yeah?
Okay. So, the two treatment options.
We can use a catheter
to plug up the artery with coils.
Like with the balloon?
Yeah, and that would give him a 15% chance
of getting better.
85% chance of still staying in a coma.
Or we can do surgery to reconnect the artery.
If we do that, that would give him 30% chance of improving.
That's a little better.
Yeah, well, it's risky.
Usually with surgery, half the time the patient deteriorates
or dies.
The surgery sounds too risky.
WENDALL: Do you understand the choices, Arlo?
They both kind of suck.
Can you explain them back to me?
What?
I need to make sure that he understands the options.
I'll make sure he does.
Arlo?
Well, if we play it safe,
there's a small chance he gets better.
If we do the surgery,
there's a bigger chance that he'll improve,
but an even bigger risk that he'll get sicker.
That's right.
It's your call.
What are you talking about?
We've decided that Arlo's a mature minor.
He can make the decision.
BENITA: By himself? He can't
handle this. Yes, I can.
No, you can't.
You're 15 years old. He's my dad.
In cases like this, the decision has to be made
by a blood relative. It's the law.
How can this be right?
Between you and me, it's not the end of the world,
but the school board has a zero tolerance approach
to what they consider pornographic.
What?!
He brought this to school.
He was showing it to the other kids.
That might not be appropriate.
They have lots of cool electronic gadgets in here.
I don't think they were looking at the gadgets.
That your name on the mailing label?
Yeah.
And you're Alex's stepfather?
Not exactly.
I see.
But you take an active role in the child-rearing.
Yeah, I pick him up from school, and we, uh, do sports.
I took him fishing...
That's great.
Alex and his mom, we'll been all living together.
It's going well.
And how long has that been the arrangement?
About a week.
Ray, do-do-do-do you have a minute?
Hey. Hot chocolate? It's my treat.
I'm really sorry about my mom.
Look, she's just looking out for you, okay?
By freaking out?!
My dad's lucky that she won't even talk to him anymore.
You okay with what we talked about?
About your dad.
Last year, for the ninth grade prom,
there was this girl Sarah.
Yeah?
I was too afraid to ask her.
But my dad told me that you gotta take chances, or you miss out.
She was already going with this guy from the baseball team.
Two weeks later, she asked me to go to a concert on the pier.
Sounds like your dad's a pretty cool guy.
He'd want the surgery.
Okay, then that's what we'll do.
But my mom's gonna freak out...
It's your decision.
And I'll back you up.
You will?
Sure thing.
Abdominal pain and near-syncope from hypotension.
He was here this morning. Dr. Pratt's patient.
Marina, find Pratt and grab the ultrasound.
He thought it was a bruise.
When did you get dizzy?
A few hours ago.
Why didn't you come back?
Doctor said it wasn't serious.
Pressure's only 80 palp.
Trendelenberg, a liter of saline.
CBC, type and cross for 4.
Sir, where does it hurt?
Sonosite. What's up?
You sent home an unstable patient.
Damn. He lacerated his spleen.
Call surgery.
Dr. Pratt...
I signed off on this guy.
Hey, he was just rolling around with his nephew.
You didn't mention belly pain.
He didn't have any.
Did you even check a crit?
It would've been normal.
His shoulder was hurting?
Yeah, but there was no point tenderness...
Free blood irritates the diaphragm
and gives you referred shoulder pain.
You missed it because you forgot about Kerr's sign.
No, we missed it
because you were too tired to see the patient.
So what did the principal say?
Why can't you tell me now?
All right, okay, when I get home.
Arlo's consenting for surgery. It's all taken care of.
And you called it in?
Vascular's ready for him.
Okay.
I'll sort the pre-op list.
All right. I have to go pump before I explode.
Carolyn made it to the OR.
Who?
Appendix girl.
Great.
You're busy today.
Declared a 15-year-old a mature minor,
overrode parental consent on an appy...
And took a kid away from abusive parents.
It's the triple crown of social work.
When are you off?
Another hour.
Want to get some dinner?
Thanks. I have plans already.
Not-Not with anyone, if that's what you're wondering.
Not a problem.
You could come along, but I have to warn you, it's pretty physical.
Oh, yeah?
Dr. Carter, Neuro's admitting my CVA in Four.
Thanks.
Abby, that's two to sign out.
It's 7:05. I know.
I've been here five minutes too long.
Stroke patient, tele admit,
and a cop Dubenko's sending to surgery.
You've still got three on the board.
I know. They're all discharged.
Anyway, you forgot something.
Abby, what?
Ow!
Your flu shot.
You're welcome!
Pressure's good. 122/76.
You feeling better, Mr. Sakabu?
Yes, thank you very much.
Okay if the nephew comes back?
Yeah, sure. We might be able to get more history.
Are you on, uh, any medication?
SAKABU: No.
Any allergies?
Uh-uh. How could this happen?
It's a very unusual presentation.
You need enough force to break a rib that cuts into the spleen.
My nephew's a pretty tough kid.
He'd have to be to cause something like this.
My uncle going to be okay?
Hey, have you seen Susan?
She signed out. Oh, great.
Uh, no, just page her again for me, please.
What do you need?
I cannot believe Ray dumped this on me.
I'm supposed to be taking care of this cop's kid.
I have no idea what's going on.
He signed out to you? Why would he do that?
I was in his exit path to the door.
Dr. Lockhart, this is Keith Trager.
Daughter has appendicitis.
Right. Hi. Uh, we spoke on the phone...
Where is she? Her condition worsened
and we had to take her up to surgery.
Okay, you were supposed to transfer her.
I know. There wasn't time for that, sir.
Take me to her, now.
Okay, just one second.
There's a problem with Arlo?
Ray said it was all settled, but he's very upset.
I know the case. You want me to take it?
Can you? Thank you.
TRAGER: Excuse me...!
LOCKHART: Yeah, I'm coming.
Arlo...
Where's Ray?
He had to leave.
When's he coming back?
Actually, he left for the night.
He left?!
I'm sure I can help.
He promised me he would help me talk to my mom.
I can do that.
Oh, my God.
They're doing the operation through the scope,
which means a smaller scar and shorter recovery.
So... sh-she's okay?
It's not a complicated procedure.
Everything's fine, Keith.
Who's that operating?
That's the Chief of Surgery. He's the best.
DUBENKO ( over speaker ): Up on the Bovie.
Dr. Dubenko, the parents are here.
Oh, she's doing great.
We caught it before it burst.
( alarm beeping )
What's that?
Pulse ox probe slipped off.
Everything's fine.
You know, I brought my dad here for back surgery.
He never left.
Well, that's not going to happen.
He died on the table.
Some junior doc botched the job.
I'm sorry to hear that.
I hate this hospital.
Where's the other doc?
Dr. Barnett isn't available.
He took off.
So, Arlo, have you decided on which treatment
you would like us to pursue?
I want him to have the operation.
BENITA: It's too risky, honey.
It's what he'd want.
Isn't it better to have him around, even if he's sick,
than to lose him forever?
You should listen to you mother...
Why does he have to be in here?
He's your father's best friend.
I feel bad, too!
I don't even know why we're still talking about this!
Ray said it was my decision!
What, you don't want my opinion?!
No!
Tell her.
Legally, Arlo has the right...
He's too young. No, I'm not!
Don't talk to your mother like that!
Maybe if I reviewed the cases one more...
No! I understood it the first time!
Dad would want to go for it.
BENITA: I know that's how he always talked.
He liked to take chances.
That's what probably got him shot!
Look, we're not going to make any progress...
I want him to have the operation.
If you approve this surgery...
how are you going to feel if he dies?
He's not gonna die.
He could die.
Are you ready to live with that?
I'm trying to protect you.
I know you think you're all grown up.
Are you ready to accept responsibility
for your father's death?
( sighs )
Yeah, hey, Marie, it's Dr. Chen.
How's he doing?
Uh, okay, well, go ahead and push another two of Ativan.
Yeah. Listen, um, any chance you can work late tonight?
Yeah, we're getting slammed and, uh, I don't think
I'm gonna be able to get home till 2:00 a.m.
That would be great.
Thank you... yeah, thank you so much.
Okay, bye.
Hey. Hey.
Sorry about Uncle Sumo's spleen.
Yeah, well, we caught it in time.
Who knew his nephew was the size of a Hummer?
( chuckles )
Didn't mean to snap at you earlier.
No, no, I was the Attending.
I should've seen him.
So who's the potassium for?
My dad.
You know, you gotta go easy on that stuff.
Of course. 40 a day, for his diarrhea.
This should last me a few weeks.
Hey.
Hey.
That's a big wall.
Yeah, I'm in training.
For what, taking down PCPers?
Triathlon.
Hey, Wendy.
Hey, Brett. This is John.
Hi.
First time?
Nah, I did this once
when I was a kid.
All right, thanks.
Take good care of him. See you at the top.
Let's go over to the beginner wall.
Is this how this this thing is supposed to go?
Sure, if you want to hang upside down by your balls.
What's going on?
The family decided not to have the surgery.
The family?
We've been together for three years.
Don't I get any say in this?
Hello, this is Dr. Rasgotra in the ER.
We're canceling the carotid surgery on patient Escobar.
Yes, I can hold.
Hey, John.
Hi.
So you two are dating, huh?
Nah, we're just friends.
Well, that's how it starts.
We went out for a year or two.
Oh, yeah? Great.
I thought we might even get married.
Then one day she tells me
she wants to start seeing other people.
Why do they say that?
If you want to break up, you should just do it.
Is the rope supposed to be this loose?
Better?
Yeah, thanks.
( grunting )
Hey. Hey.
Did you get back to sleep?
No, not really.
Sorry.
Okay, where's Alex?
Up in his room.
Want a beer?
Do I need one?
He brought this to school.
That's it?
That's such crap.
Where'd he get it?
You subscribe?
I like the articles.
Oh, please.
So listen, anyway, uh...
a friend of his had the magazine in the bathroom.
In the stall.
At school...
You know, the kid was...
Are you kidding me?
Oh, my God.
Do you think that Alex is?
I thought it would be at least a year or two
until I had to deal with this.
Well, I guess I need to talk to him.
Yup.
So I'm here twice a week.
Any time you want to join me?
Yeah, that'd be great.
Brett could give you another lesson.
Oh, he's quite a teacher.
Hey, see you next time.
Bye.
I've got an outfit just like that at home,
but I didn't want to show off.
So, are you hungry?
Um, no. No, not really.
You got to eat dinner.
I think I'm just going to grab something at home.
Come on, you've been a good sport, my treat.
Okay.
So what are you in the mood for?
I don't know.
Indian? No.
Chinese?
Uh... sushi?
Had it for lunch.
What about deep dish pizza?
I could go for pizza.
I know a really good pizza place over on...
Yeah, too many carbs.
Right.
Hey, I have an idea.
Okay, close your eyes.
Pick a page and point.
That's where we go.
What if it's a donut shop?
Are you in this or not?
There?
Not there.
All right, right there.
And the winner is...
Uncle Vito's Mongolian Barbecue.
What's that?
Um, it's Italian.
It's Asian. It's maybe Southern.
All right, close your eyes and do it again.
No, no, you made the rules.
Mongolian barbecue?
Yeah, but it's in Downer's Grove.
We don't go that far.
Well, are you in this or not?
All right.
I hope they have tofu.
Officer McWayne.
They're moving him up to the ICU.
Okay, um... thank you.
Arlo!
Arlo! It's okay.
Where's he going?
Probably just getting a snack across the street.
He seems really upset.
It'll pass.
Well, maybe I should go and talk to him.
No, he's too emotional.
You can't talk to him when he gets this way.
I hope he doesn't feel like he was forced into this.
Are you sure you don't want to think about it some more?
Maybe discuss it with him after he calms down.
It won't help.
He's not being realistic.
That's why we had to make the decision for him.
He's too confused.
I heard him express a strong opinion more than once.
You and I both know it was the wrong choice.
He was hoping for something that's never going to happen.
He loves his father, but I'm the one
who has to set limits.
Anyway, thanks for everything you did.
I'm not sure I helped.
When you let us work it out together,
you did the right thing.
( knocking )
Yeah?
Hey, can I come in?
I didn't know you liked The Goon.
They didn't have Hellboy.
So look, uh, about today at school...
Mr. Elmore is such a loser.
Yeah, uh...
What happened with that kid in the bathroom...
I just wanted to make sure
you didn't have any questions.
About what?
You know, about what he was doing.
Spanking the monkey?
Yeah.
What about it?
Well, it's normal, but...
it's not the kind of thing you should do at school.
You think I'm stupid?
At your age, it can be a confusing time.
If you ever want to,
you can always talk to me about these things.
Okay.
Okay. Good night.
RAY: So I heard there was
an after-hours club at the Crowbar.
Cool.
Have you seen Kristy?
Yeah, she's pulling around the side.
Hey, you're late.
We went on at 9:00.
How could you just leave like that?
I'll meet you in the car.
I'm sorry. What?
You abandoned that kid.
I signed out my patients when my shift was over.
To Abby-- you should have signed out to me.
I knew the case. You were busy.
You thought it was quick and easy.
Well, it got complicated, Ray.
How did it get complicated?
The kid wanted his dad to have surgery.
Well, how long did you discuss it with him, two minutes?
He understood everything.
His dad's not having the surgery.
Why not?
Because you weren't there.
His mom gave him a hard time about it and he gave in.
Did you at least talk to them?
Yes.
Well, all he needed was a little hand-holding, Neela.
I mean, God, is that so hard for you?
Don't turn this around to make it about me.
You promised to help him.
No, I told him...
It's not my job, or anyone else's, to keep your promises.
My shift was over.
He was counting on you.
I had a gig.
Screw your gig. Medicine isn't a day job.
This coming from a girl
who was selling hot dogs three months ago?
I was off at 7:00. Abby was off at 7:00.
But we were still there taking care of our patients.
You know what, we would never leave the hospital
if we had to stick around to tuck in every patient.
I'm not talking about every patient.
I'm talking about one kid.
It was the most important decision of his life.
He trusted you, and you left.
