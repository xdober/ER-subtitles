Previously on ER:
I'm being deployed to Iraq.
PRATT: So how long have you got? On your tour of duty.
Well, a year at least.
You heard from Gallant?
We exchanged some e-mails,
but he's always in trouble with the Internet
at his CASH unit.
He seemed okay?
You know Michael. He's not one to complain.
Well, when you write, tell him we're
thinking about him.
Sure.
Another bad guy saved, huh?
Now he'll have to survive the hospital in Karbala.
Need me to redress that?
Thanks. I'll get it.
Dude.
I'm sorry.
Hey, Dr. Neela.
Hey, Bret.
Girlfriend kick you out again?
Ooh, good one.
No, we broke up.
I burnt this mix for you.
'cause you said you didn't know the blues and that's...
like a crime.
Thank you.
It's all yours, man.
Check it out. It's cool.
I'm sorry.
I'm getting used
to finding random rockers
passed out in our living room.
Bret's cool. Okay?
He's a good guy, and...
maybe you should get to know him a little.
No, thanks.
Well, you might like him.
Does he have a job?
Well, I think he likes you,
and I know how hard it is to meet new people in the city,
especially during the wintertime.
I guess I'm gonna shut up now.
RASGOTRA: Dear Michael, it's been months since I've heard from you.
GALLANT: Sorry I've been so out of touch.
They keep me pretty busy here, what with all the parties.
RASGOTRA: Everyone asks after you, and I think about you often.
Even at odd moments... at the market, picking something up,
or just waiting for my coffee.
I wonder how you're doing.
GALLANT: You guys probably don't even remember me by now.
I'm the tall, good-looking black guy
with the best bedside manner in the place.
Tell Pratt I said that,
and tell everybody I'm still here,
still doing the doctor thing.
Neela. A medevac's on its way in. Double amputation.
RASGOTRA: I try to imagine what your days are like,
how different your life must be.
GALLANT: The days go by, some slower than others,
but... I'm doing fine.
Incoming. Dump patrol got ambushed.
I do miss County...
( explosion )
...all you guys,
and sometimes, in the middle of everything,
I kind of wonder if what I'm doing here...
RASGOTRA: ...is maybe the same as what you're doing over there.
GALLANT: It's good to believe it is.
RASGOTRA: Makes me feel you're not really as far away as it seems.
GALLANT: ...that maybe it won't be so hard to get through this...
RASGOTRA: ...and that sometime soon
we'll see each other again.
Estimated blood loss?
RASGOTRA: As for work, well,
some things continue to be a challenge for me.
I know I'm good at some of it.
Crush injury? Looks clean!
But I have some deficiencies,
a certain ambivalence.
You can put them back on, right?
You're gonna be just fine, ma'am.
What's your name?
Private Thomas Perry, sir!
First of the 12th!
RPG explosion.
Shrapnel injuries on the right side.
Couple of AK47 rounds in the thigh. Hold it!
Hold it!
What happened out there?
They ambushed my patrols.
I had three buddies with me.
Did they make it?
I thank God for my two years at County.
They didn't make it, did they?
It prepared me for this, as much as anyone's prepared.
Radial artery hasn't clamped down.
Direct pressure for now.
How you doing, Doris?
I thought I could get in,
unjam it and get out in a few seconds.
Unjam it?
The saddle stitcher.
Gotta do ten bound books a minute.
You went inside a binding machine?
Somebody must have turned it back on
without realizing I was still in there.
Well, the cuts are clean,
so the chances for reattachment are excellent.
Dr. Lewis?
I left the registrar forms with the guy at the front desk.
Okay, good. Gown up.
Rosales, this is Neela.
Neela, your new med student.
I'm not even confident in my own decisions half the time.
Now I'm supposed to help orient students.
Neela's our resident brainiac.
Talk to me about pain management.
The irony is people think
I know all the answers...
We could titrate morphine?
...even when I don't.
No, let's do bilateral brachial plexus blocks instead.
20ccs of one percent with epi?
Yes, to Dr. Pratt and me.
I'm familiar with the procedure.
Have you seen it performed?
Well... Better see it before you do it.
Roberto, BP cuffs as a tourniquet
on both biceps. Keep it
inflated over 140.
Still, I feel like,
after all this time, the people I work with
should have more confidence in me,
but how can they if I don't?
Neela, abduct the arm like this...
Ever since med school, it's like I've been sleepwalking.
This is gonna be interesting, huh?
( patient shrieking )
Pressure's down!
The abdomen's tender, multiple shrapnel injuries
right flank and pelvis.
Two entrance wounds right thigh
with gross deformity of the femur.
Hanging the first unit of type-specific.
I have a lot of responsibility here,
and I gotta admit,
I kind of like it.
Where you from, soldier?
Burlington, Vermont.
Only one exit wound.
Give him another five of morphine.
Vermont? It must be freezing now.
( screaming )
Thank God you're not there, huh?
God or Don Rumsfeld.
Gotta go with the Sec Def we got,
not the one we wish we had.
Systolic's down to 88.
Throw me a cordis.
I'll put in the subclavian before he goes to the OR.
I need surgery?
They're gonna stop any bleeding
and stabilize your fracture.
I'll keep the leg, right?
Of course, the responsibility cuts both ways.
Sats dropping.
Get him on a non-rebreather.
Set up for an airway.
Forget it, we'll do it in the OR.
19-year-old 11 bravo, sir, AK47 times two to the...
I heard. OR's ready.
I'll take him from here.
This is Captain Whitley,
62 Alpha, fresh out of Doha.
Show her the ropes.
Andy! You're with me.
It's strange after just eight months to feel like a veteran.
Michael Gallant.
Welcome to the 57th CASH.
How long you been here?
I came over last spring.
How long did it take you to get used to it?
I'll let you know when I do.
I mean, the ER's rough,
and lately my mind's been somewhere else, you know?
Is it?
Yeah, my wife and I just had a baby.
January 21. Celia.
She's seven pounds, two ounces.
How old are you?
24. You?
27.
We wanna have three by the time we're 30.
We both grew up in big families.
How about yourself?
I grew up in a medium family.
No, I mean married? Kids?
I have a lot of catching up to do.
Must be hard balancing an ER residency and a social life.
Yeah.
This your double amputee?
The arms are in here.
They'll take it from here, Doris.
Your husband's on his way. Thank you.
Dr. Rasgotra, why don't you come with me.
I'll be late for board rounds.
That's okay. They'll manage without you.
While Dr. Lieberman's getting consent, we'll take a look,
make sure we have something to work with.
Dr. Lieberman?
Uh, I'm Roberto Rosales. I'm a third-year.
Lieberman's our plastics guy, world expert on burn management.
Untoothed forceps and a Kelly.
Should I get you a nurse?
No. You'll do just fine.
Oh, wow.
I find myself both proud and jealous at times, Michael.
These supple, resilient limbs.
Clean, straight amputations.
I'm telling you, if you had to have your arms cut off,
this would be the dream scenario.
You know,
Lieberman's a brilliant guy.
Worked for a while in Germany with the military
training combat surgeons in burn care.
You have a purpose and a role to fill.
Flexor digitorum superficialis...
Most days, I don't feel like that at all.
Okay, hold compressions.
Back in sinus.
Get me a chest tube.
Some days are bad. Some days every victory
feels too small.
He's got a pulse.
Boo-ya.
Wow.
That was... wow.
Okay, it won't last.
He needs the OR.
Tape the tube in.
Hook him up to suction.
I'll find Kilner. You're with me. Let's go.
Where'd you learn to do that?
I worked three years at a county ER back in Chicago.
Who do you have back there?
Wife? Girlfriend?
Not really.
Not really?
Okay. Don't ask, don't tell.
I know what a lot of people think about this war,
but when you're here, you have to believe that we're fighting
for something real, something that matters...
I thought we could save it.
Shattered femur.
Femoral artery was a tattered mess.
He was bleeding out, headed for DIC.
...that our guys, the ones we can't save
and the ones we barely patch back together,
are heroes, not victims.
Sir, we got a hypotensive Iraqi GSW with exposed bowel.
Good Iraqi or bad Iraqi?
He's on our side, sir.
Send him here in ten minutes.
So, 20 minutes if he's a bad Iraqi?
Have to be careful about human bombs getting in.
A unit in Kirkuk lost some people
when a patient blew himself up on the table.
It's crazy what your daily
concerns become.
You end up missing the littlest things...
...the stuff most of us take for granted.
( basketball bouncing )
Hey!
Hey.
Get that lady up to Lieberman yet?
The replantation should be underway soon.
Good. I gotta get back inside.
Greg, do you... miss him?
Michael. You were good friends.
We still are.
I keep... I dunno, thinking about him.
Nothing wrong with that.
Oh, uh, writing him a letter.
Is there anything you want to say?
You writing a letter or an email?
An actual letter.
On paper and everything.
( chuckles )
Well, um...
tell him to hurry up and get his ass back here in one piece.
I'm tired of waiting for my rematch.
Now let's get back inside.
We got things to do.
RASGOTRA: Pratt says he misses you.
Lots of my time is spent baby-sitting.
Even here, there's all the small stuff
right next to the stuff that rips you up.
Are you feeling better, soldier?
Getting there.
We've had a nasty virus blasting through camp.
Knocks you on your ass for about 48 hours.
Whole kitchen staff came down with it.
Ah.
Well, that explains why the food suddenly improved.
You want to go back to the days of MREs?
Oof!
We started off on rations,
when we were setting up.
Now it's our chow three times a day.
Yeah, you're welcome.
When the fluid's in, we'll recheck your orthostatics,
send you to the border tent.
Border?
It's just for a day or two.
We don't want her infecting the whole DFACs.
Is there anything I can get you, soldier?
The hell out of here.
They're sending a medevac. Shouldn't be too long.
It's tough, these enlisted kids
who come back with less than they came with.
And then there are the reservists and the Guardsmen
who never expected to be here at all.
They bit the bullet and showed up for duty,
only to get their tours
extended for months as a reward.
Now they're here with no end in sight.
"A weekend a month," my ass.
Hey, did you get 18s, too?
Hey, Chicago, for you, I got it all.
Hoo-ah! Name a tent after you!
Yeah. Hey, Cap!
( chuckles ): Hey, special pickup for you.
Cubans are legal in Kuwait.
What's the word on our Bulls?
Flirting with .500.
You think Jordan's got one more comeback?
You smoke those? Nah, a pregnant local lady
came in wounded from a building collapse.
I delivered the baby.
Hey, scorpion sting.
Got a minute? Scorpion sting?
Yeah, it's pretty common, no big deal.
Hey, is it always like this?
Multiply the usual busload of colds and coughs times ten
because it's February, add all the seasonal complaints--
frostbite, sled accidents, tongues frozen to metal poles--
double the car crashes, add your baseline chest pains, strokes and GSW's,
and this is what you get: hell frozen over.
Suzanne Harris, rash. Mm-hmm.
Hello. I'm Dr. Rasgotra.
Hey, yeah, I've got these red spots all over me,
and I have never itched so bad.
Looks like, uh,
insect bites.
Fleas, maybe?
Now, I don't have fleas.
Have you ever had scabies?
Scabies? They're tiny insects
that can cause severe skin reactions.
Oh, God.
Benadryl, Elimite, and home.
NEELA: I know I shouldn't complain to you.
My troubles must seem pretty minor.
Hey, Gus. How you doing?
I haven't thrown up in an hour.
How about the other end?
Slowing down.
That's what I like to hear.
Uh, after the liter's in, we'll "PO challenge" him
and recheck orthostatics.
But I spend 99% of the time waiting for the one percent
where it feels like I make a difference.
Neela, waiting time for a bed is up to 18 hours.
Lewis wants you to see about dispo-ing
some of the deadbeats straight out of chairs.
Yeah, we're on it.
Scorpion must've just crawled up my arm.
I never even felt it.
'Kay, IV, 500cc NS bolus.
LARABEE: Oh, hey, uh... Sergeant Varga's mom
sent him a box of Lucky Charms.
Can he eat the crescent moons?
As long as he's here, he's NPO.
In Landstuhl, he can eat what he wants.
( ringing ) LARABEE: So, uh,
no green clovers, either?
What is that, a monitor?
( ringing continues )
Larabee.
Jackson picked it up in Kuwait.
You can't use that here.
Look, Captain, if you want
to borrow it sometime, make a couple calls...
Will it call Florida?
My old lady's in Sarasota.
It's a security risk-- the signal
could be picked up by an enemy.
Come on, sir, you really think
these insurgents have homing technology?
Get a 12 lead, keep him on the monitor.
He's 112 degrees!
Fahrenheit!
I got 98.
With all due respect, ma'am,
if your boy had a temp
of 112, he'd be dead.
Exactly.
Here. Show me.
Excuse me... We're not up to you, sir.
Check in with the triage nurse. ( groans ): It's just...
I hurt my back.
Um, I was just tying a shoe.
Here, let me take a look.
( groans ) This where it hurts?
Yeah, right there.
Any meds, medical problems?
Mm, no.
You have a lumbar muscle spasm.
Oh, no.
A backache.
Oh, I-I probably should stay for a full exam.
Listen, you could go home, take some ibuprofen,
have a glass of merlot and get some rest,
or you could sit here and wait to be seen
for the next 20 hours.
Home sounds good. Thanks.
Uh... these yours?
Oh, yeah.
( pounds door )
Uh, Neela, did you just send that guy home?
Simple backache.
He still needs a chart.
I did a quick exam, pain was musculoskeletal.
It's an EMTALA violation. He left on his own.
Dr. Lewis, MI in 2 is ready to move.
I thought you wanted me to dispo...
I do, but I don't want you to get us sued.
Please, we need help!
My brother's in the car! He's very sick!
WHITLEY: You do triage outside the perimeter?
If they're at risk of losing life, limb or eyesight,
or were wounded as a result of US military action,
we can bring them in.
Otherwise, it's off to a civilian hospital.
If we treated every civilian who showed up at the Gate,
we'd run out of beds and supplies in a half a day.
No interpreter?
I'm fluent in Arabic.
I was at the Pentagon on September 11.
On September 12, I started studying the language.
GIRL: Over here! Hurry!
He's really sick!
( woman speaking Spanish )
ROSALES: She said they went to the clinic first,
but they couldn't help her.
Pulse is weak, barely moving air.
( speaking Spanish )
They gave her this note.
Please! Help him!
"To County General doctor,
rule out meningitis. Please evaluate." What?
Come on!
( woman speaking Arabic )
She can't keep anything down.
That hurt?
( speaks Arabic )
KESTEN: Bolus her up
and send her off to Balad?
She's only about five percent dehydrated,
not sick enough for us.
Balad, you have
to go to a hospital in Balad.
Do you know where it is?
( speaking Arabic )
Okay,
h-hold on, hold on.
( Whitley speaks Arabic )
'Kay, this will help.
One cup every hour.
( speaking Arabic )
It's good stuff, okay?
You drink it. ( speaking Arabic )
( speaks Arabic )
How is the hospital in Balad?
The infrastructure's been neglected for a decade.
They should be able
to handle a saline bolus, though.
It's so tough
turning them away when they're right here.
Even in the States, they wouldn't admit her.
Certainly can't justify treating her at the CASH.
( horn honks )
Any requests from the big city?
Hey, Jackson, you think you can score me some citrus?
I have a craving for some mangos.
I don't think mango's a citrus fruit.
How about some oranges then?
You got it, Chicago.
See if I can hunt us down some red hots, too.
All right, you better get going.
Okay, Rollins, let's go.
( woman speaking Arabic )
( speaking Arabic )
( shouting )
IED! Get down! Get down! Stay here!
There might be more!
Get them out of the truck!
Get them out of the truck!
I need two nurses and a pedes mask!
Set it for intubation.
Bolus 500
of normal saline,
and we'll need 400 of rectal acetaminophen.
( child shrieking ) This kid's burning up!
( shrieking continues )
( shrieking continues )
( yelling )
( yelling continues )
( girl shrieking )
( shrieking, yelling continue )
Supply driver's hurt pretty bad!
Get the CASH on the horn!
Tell 'em we got
a MASCAL at the gate!
( shrieking )
( woman yelling in Arabic )
( crying, shrieking )
Oh, my God!
Get me a C-spine! Now!
Right now!
( shouts in Arabic )
( shrieking )
( crying, shrieking )
Gross deformity of the right clavicle. Oh, God!
Dr. Gallant, what antibiotics do you want?
Clinda and Levaquin!
Pharmacy's out of Levaquin!
Amp and gent, then!
WHITLEY: Blood in the canal.
Okay, ten of morphine. Let's go! Let's go!
LARABEE: Got it.
Captain, we need you here!
( screams ): Mama!
CBC, type and cross,
get a second IV,
call X-ray for chest, abdomen, and right shoulder!
Only 87% on non-rebreather.
Okay, stridor and carbonaceous sputum.
Okay, 6-0 and a mac two.
Okay.
The inside of her airway is burned.
We need to get a tube down there before it swells shut.
( speaks Arabic )
Six of etomidate, 20 of rock.
This is medicine to help her sleep.
( speaks broken Arabic )
( speaks Arabic )
( speaks Arabic )
( repeats phrase )
Etomidate's in, pushing the rock.
Tube.
Talk to me.
Sats up to 92, had a 30 per kilo fluid bolus.
CBC, lytes and blood cultures sent.
Chest film's on its way. Suction.
Still needs a cath'd UA and LP.
Dopamine's at ten mikes
and ceftriaxone's infusing.
How long has he been sick like this?
Two days fever. Also vomiting.
Can't go through this. All right. Give it to me.
No. I'll get it. Let's try five and a half.
RASGOTRA: There are times when all my worries...
all the crazy thoughts in my head go away.
All that matters is what I'm doing now.
Securing an airway.
Got it! Bag him!
RASGOTRA: That's when I know what I'm doing.
Who I am.
You've got a pulmonary contusion--
some bleeding and bruising in the lungs.
We'll get you stabilized,
you'll be headed off to Landstuhl on your way home.
Home?
( labored breathing )
It'll take weeks for your lungs and the fractures to heal.
Your family will be glad to see you.
I don't want to ship out like this.
Tech just dropped this off--
repeat chest on Gopher there.
Okay, let me go take a look at your films.
Take it easy.
Contusions look worse.
How are his sats?
Holding... barely.
Okay, they'll come back.
I'll keep a bag-mask at the bedside.
Urine dip is positive for leukocytes and nitrates.
Bingo, found the source.
That's my sterile field.
You can re-prep.
He can be this sick from a bladder infection?
No, there's hydronephrosis.
Probably septic from pyelo.
We still need to rule out meningitis.
It's unlikely.
The kid's been vaccinated for H flu and pneumococcus.
Pratt, MI in 4 is crashing.
Okay. Add five of PEEP,
start gentamicin and lean on the PICU.
Let me know about the LP.
What if the PEEP doesn't work?
In the NICU, we used a high-frequency oscillator,
but I'm not sure if he's too old for that.
Should I call RT?
Let's wait and see what Pratt wants.
Sir, there are no facilities in Iraq
with the resources or the training
to take care of this girl.
True.
But you're telling me to stabilize and discharge her, sir.
I'm telling you we've done what we can, Captain.
Move on.
( fires shot )
They cannot take care of her in a local hospital.
Sometimes we have to accept our limitations here.
That sounds like a fancy way of saying
you don't care, sir.
You've been here, what, a year?
I've been doing this for 20.
So don't lecture me on who cares and who doesn't.
Yes, sir.
Maybe we could check a facility
in Kuwait, sir,
see about transferring her to Landstuhl for her recovery.
Captain, Landstuhl's for US servicemen.
Maybe some hospital in Egypt or Jordan could take her.
A C-130's on the way for Perry and Jackson.
We could get her on the same flight.
You need State Department approval
to bring that girl into the United States.
I know that, sir.
All right.
See what you can do.
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.
Will he sleep in hospital tonight?
In the pediatric ICU.
But we'll keep him here until the bed's ready.
Hey, check this out.
What's that? It's a high- frequency...
High-frequency oscillator.
I had a talk with the PICU attending.
He suggested that we give this thing a trial.
It uses high- frequency waves...
To carry oxygen to the alveoli.
Right. Well, you're the expert.
Tell us what he needs.
A hundred percent at six hertz. Inspiratory time 33,
amplitude 40,
mean airway pressure 18.
Yeah, that's what the PICU doc said, too.
I'll get you set up. Cool.
Hey. Way to stay on top of his pressure.
One of us should call the state medical board.
What for? To report the clinic doc.
You don't know what the kid looked like when they sent him home.
He looked bad enough for the doctor to advise them
to come here with a note to rule out meningitis.
Listen, clinic docs provide essential care in places
where there's nothing else.
I'm not sure bad health care is preferable to none.
The kid's vaccines are all up to date
and amoxicillin's better than no meds at all.
Look, you shut a guy like this down,
you're not doing anybody any favors,
including this family.
What?
No, no, no, it needs to be immediately.
Because this girl can't wait.
Okay, can I speak to someone else then?
What? No, don't...
You okay?
Two places in Kuwait said no
and the administrator at Landstuhl
practically laughed at me.
It's real sweet, what you're doing.
Yeah, what I'm trying to do.
What's up?
She's tachy with a widened pulse pressure.
The gram stain was negative.
Still on triples
but we'll be out of flagyl in the morning.
Yeah, well, it won't matter
if they don't get her skin grafted soon,
and that's not gonna happen anywhere around here.
Urine output's only half a cc per kilo per hour.
( speaking Arabic )
"God keep you for what you're doing."
It's not gonna be so easy.
You want me to tell her that?
No.
If you ever send us an unstable patient again,
we'll report you to the state medical board,
and trust me, Dr. Lima, you will lose your license.
Yeah, good-bye to you, too.
( phone slams )
Did you get it all out? What?
Whatever it is that's been bothering you all shift.
One minute you're treating me like I'm God's gift to medicine,
the next you're humiliating me in front of a student.
Humiliating you?
If you trust me, then just give me some room.
If you don't, just say so.
I don't.
What?
Neela, you could be the best doctor here.
Hell, everybody knows that you're five times smarter.
But most of the time you're in your head.
You're right. I am.
I blow things out of proportion.
I obsess.
So stop.
It's just...
I come here. I do my shift.
I go home. I sleep.
I can't believe this is my life.
See, now that's the problem. This cannot be your life.
You need to go out. You need to have some fun.
When was the last time you went on a date?
Why does everybody seem to think I need to get laid?
Trust me on this: sometimes it helps.
Colonel Kilner...
This Marine woke up with someone's arm
draped across his body.
Took out his dagger and started stabbing it.
It was his own arm.
It'd fallen asleep and he took it for the enemy.
Sir, I've run into some interference
getting things set up.
Maybe you could extend Jamila's stay?
Captain...
Just for a few days, it'll give me more time...
We don't have beds to give away.
I want her out of the unit by the morning.
Hey, Larabee, hold up.
What did I do now?
ER.
Yeah.
Neela, telephone.
Hello...?!
Is it that clinic idiot again?
Hello?
Hello...?
GALLANT: I got a nasty hangnail on my big toe.
Do you prescribe over the phone?
Michael.
That's too bad. Yeah, okay, I'll try.
What's going on?
She's talking to Gallant. Really?
When's he coming home?
Sounds like he needs help with something.
Hey, don't forget to spread the love, okay?
Is he okay? Yeah. They're yakking
like a couple of teenagers. What do you suppose
a long-distance call from Iraq would run you?
More important: what do you suppose it'll run the Army?
You know, it's we, the taxpayers,
who are underwriting this little rendezvous.
Yeah, okay. You, too.
What? you just hang up like that?!
He couldn't talk. He said hello to everyone.
KOVAC: Can we call him back?
It was a one-time thing. He got access to a phone.
I gotta go. Where?
I'll be right back. He sounded okay.
( sighs )
So, how you feeling?
You were right.
Time to go home.
Yeah, it'll just be a few days.
Your family will meet you at Walter Reed.
You told them I'd be all right?
Yeah, somebody contacted them, yeah.
( sighs )
You see that?
( sighs )
Picked it up in Mosul for Laura,
my little one.
( chuckles )
She's gonna love it.
( sighs )
I wonder how cold it is in Joliet.
My wife hates the winter.
Now, you make it quick, all right?
'Cause if you get caught, I never knew you.
( chuckles )
Looks like you caught them both.
Is that Lieberman with Dr. Dubenko?
Yes. They're looking at the lady you brought in.
Doris. She's doing well.
That's good. I'll tell them you're waiting.
That's all right.
Hello, Doris.
Dr. Lieberman, may I have a moment?
Bit busy here, Doctor.
I'm sorry. This can't wait.
The winds kicked up all through the Arabian Sea.
Your flight out should be in tomorrow, at the latest,
maybe even tonight.
It sucks, but it could be worse.
Mail.
I raided chow supplies for you, Burlington.
GALLANT: Maple syrup?
You can take the boy out of Vermont...
( sighs )
Thanks.
Who wrote you, sir?
Uh, my folks.
And a friend.
That stuff's like gold, huh?
Yes, it is.
Have a minute, Captain?
Take it easy, soldier.
Congratulations. A Dr. Lieberman
in Chicago has agreed to underwrite Jamila's care.
( sighs )
It came through. That's great, sir.
County General...
my guess is, that's where you used to work.
So, how did you plan to get her there?
Piggyback her on the transport to Andrews, sir.
And who's gonna get that approved?
( sighs )
It was lucky for you that the State Department
and the Army okayed it.
There's a C-130 on the airstrip in Baghdad.
We'll helo them over soon as we get a chopper.
Don't say I never did anything for you.
( exhales )
Yes.
Good news?
Yes.
( Clemente laughs )
Yes!
I've got, um...
two Heinekens under my bed.
They've been sitting there for weeks,
waiting for something to celebrate.
We're here, you know.
Gotta hold on to the good stuff while you can.
Yeah. Sure.
LARABEE: Dr. Gallant!
Sergeant Jackson's crashing!
Hello...
( loud blues music playing )
Hello?!
Oh. Hey.
Um... hot water's out at my place.
Sorry. Ray said it was okay.
( lowers volume )
You want?
No.
Yeah, sure.
Haven't listened to this CD yet?
You familiar with this guy, Robert Johnson?
Not really.
( sighs ) Eric Clapton?
Jimmy Page? Keith Richard?
Well, yes, of course, I've... Okay.
Well, there's a direct line between Robert Johnson
and every dude who's ever picked up a Gibson.
Robert Johnson is American music.
Is that so?
Yeah. That's so.
( panting )
Sats were trending down. I had to tube him.
LARABEE: Getting hard to bag.
Bleeding into his lungs. Hold compressions.
CLEMENTE: Still bradycardic, 48.
Another epi. Let's go. Maybe occult pneumothorax?
Pericardial effusion?
No. He's moving air. No carotid?
Holding compressions.
Rate 27, no pulse.
His heart's not getting any oxygen.
*
You know, they say he sold his soul to the devil.
Really? Why?
Well, he wanted to be the best.
And he was.
So, that makes it worth it?
Well, kind of depends on your opinion of the devil.
I think it's a made-up story.
Of course, it is. That's the best kind.
But this guy-- I mean, listen to this--
he's actually making a guitar talk.
( sighs )
To play like that, I would give almost anything.
( chuckles )
Wouldn't you?
It's good you feel that way about what you do.
What way?
I don't know...
Passionate.
Well, don't you?
I mean, what Ray and you do-- that's pretty amaz...
I'm-I'm-I'm, like, in awe of you guys...
I wasn't talking about me.
All I meant was...
...you seem pretty passionate to me.
( sighing )
( panting )
Damn it. Pace at a faster rate.
Not capturing. Atropine.
Epi drip-- wide open.
Hold compressions.
( panting )
KILNER: Asystole.
We haven't been going that long.
You can't reverse this.
( panting )
Another atropine. Come on. Come on!
( whooshing )
( panting )
KILNER: He's had three rounds of meds.
Hold compressions.
( panting )
KILNER: Dr. Gallant?
Dr. Gallant?
( panting )
( giggles )
Wait. Hold on a minute.
( stifled sobs )
( Larabee panting )
NEELA: You're-you're great, but...
I... ( laughs )
Are you laughing?
I'm-I'm sorry.
You're-you're great, really.
But, um... I'm just not into it.
Oh, well, you seemed into it a minute ago.
I need to go to bed now,
because if I don't go to bed now,
I'm going to stay out here with you.
And what'd be so bad about that?
Um, you know...
Ooh...
( laughs )
...when you have a-a cut or some injury,
but, uh, all you have in the house
is one of those tiny Band-Aids that don't even stay on...?
Uh-huh?
They don't really help the problem at all.
This would be... very nice, I'm sure.
It already was. Uh...
Can you see what I mean?
Um...
I'm a tiny Band-Aid?
I'm in a weird place, and...
I don't want to do something just because I'm lonely.
Isn't the cure for loneliness to be with someone?
That is so totally reasonable.
Good night.
She's not stable, sir.
Just get to the C-130. They'll take it from there.
She's hypotensive and septic.
You've got room to go up on the pressers.
She'll blow a pneumo at altitude.
Fly low and bag her on the way.
Sir, you're not the one who'll be coding her at 5,000 feet.
She could die without the proper burn care.
She can't get that here.
She could die during transport.
I'm not taking responsibility.
Would you take her if a doctor went?
( helicopter blades whirring )
You got 72 hours, son. Get her there.
Thank you, sir.
GALLANT: I try to be positive, Neela,
but the truth is... it gets to you.
Even if no one sees that, even if you never admit it.
Sometimes I wish I could just get out,
wear civvies, drink beer and clear my head for a while.
Then I'd come back... and finish the job I started.
NEELA: There are things I can't say to anyone except in a letter.
Except... to you.
Be safe, Michael.
I know I worry a lot about everything.
But most of all I worry about how long it will be...
before I see you again.
