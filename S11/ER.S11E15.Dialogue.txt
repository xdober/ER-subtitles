Previously on ER:
Okay.
WEAVER: Dr. Lockhart, Mr. Scanlon...
Kerry... I'm mixing up some Ancef.
I'm just gathering up some supplies.
Dubenko's working him pretty hard
and my place is closer to the hospital.
So sleeping over at his place would be convenient.
PRATT: I'm not into research and I don't care
about publishing.
You're going to be looking for a job
in a couple of years.
You're going to look back on this time
and wish you'd stepped up.
How do you stand it? What?
The responsibility.
Whoa!
Slow down there, buddy.
Sorry, ma'am.
Did he just call me "ma'am"?
Yeah.
Because technically I'm a "miss."
Maybe you project maturity.
Meaning I look old?
No, you look beautiful, you look youthful
and not a day over 16.
Seriously, if you didn't know me,
would you think I had a fifth-grader?
No, no.
But I could see you with a toddler.
Ugh, God...
Sleep deprivation, diapers, teething--
been there, done that.
Is that something you think you might want again?
Kids?
You?
I don't know.
I can't really imagine myself with an infant again.
WOMAN: We gotta go. We gotta go.
Lucas, Lucas, Lucas--
take it for five minutes
and then Christopher can have it for five minutes.
( dog barking ) Calleigh... Calleigh... shh.
( phone ringing ) I got it.
Would you take that?
Hello?
It's not just his. It's mine, too!
Mom, can I go to Stacy's house after practice?
No. One of you take the dog out.
You do it. She can be such a bitch.
Okay, kids, your father. Come on.
I know. Okay, I got to go.
My dad's here.
I got to go. Bye.
Here we go. Here we go.
Take your coat.
Okay, you got, you got?
You got your trumpet? Come on, you guys.
All right. Don't try and sweet-talk your dad, okay?
The answer is no.
Please close the door!
Thank you. Have fun.
( phone ringing )
( softly ): Oh...
Hello?
Hi, Pam.
Can I call you right back-- five minutes?
Okay, great, thanks so much. Bye.
WOMAN: You know, I'm, I-I'm really feeling okay now.
I-I-I just got a little dizzy.
Pulse ox 99 on two liters.
I just got a little dizzy.
PARAMEDIC 2: Got another call!
Lower Wacker MVC.
Lucky us.
I-I-I think I'm going to be okay,
so if you could just take me back home?
I-I-I really appreciate your coming,
and every... thing you've...
Sir?
Sir?
Hi, I'm Dr. Kovac. Hello, Doctor.
What happened?
35-year-old woman,
found down in her kitchen by a neighbor.
Probably had too much coffee, or...
Aphasia and right hemiparesis.
...or maybe some kind of anxiety attack.
A little young for a CVA.
Is she hypertensive?
Last BP: 128/76. My dad had high blood pressure.
What's open? I don't.
Trauma One.
Ma'am, can you tell us your name?
Yes, Ellie.
Sorry?
My name is Ellie Shore.
TAGGART: What'd she say?
( slurring unintelligibly )
( loud, thrashing rock music playing )
See you later, Ray!
You heading in?
Yeah.
Guys. I'll give you a ride.
I'm working tonight anyway.
I thought we were trying for opposite shifts.
I had to make a switch.
We have a gig on Saturday. I'm sorry.
Is it okay with you
if the guys stay here?
Cool.
Hi.
Y-You play anything?
The viola.
SHORE: That's kind of bright.
LOCKHART: Pupils four millimeters,
equal and reactive.
Nobody is listening to me here.
Normal sinus on the monitor. Am I slurring?
Chest is clear.
Is there something wrong with my tongue?
Right-sided facial droop.
Face feels kind of numb.
Maybe I'm not talking loud enough.
TAGGART: Glucose is 96.
LOCKHART: Normal rhythm. No murmur.
( louder ): Excuse me. Where am I?
( unintelligible mumbling )
Ma'am, you're at County Hospital.
We're going to take care of you, okay?
County? Great.
LOCKHART: Can you squeeze my hand?
Yeah. Look, I don't know what that paramedic guy told you,
but honestly, I'm fine,
so you can just stop doing all this, okay?
Hemocue is 13.7.
Let me up and call me a cab, and I'll be on my way.
Now squeeze with your right.
What did you just do?
As hard as you can, squeeze.
I, uh...
Anything?
I...
Was that my arm?
Because I-I didn't feel it. I didn't feel anything.
LOCKHART: Absent DTRs on the right.
What's wrong with my arm?
What's wrong with my arm?!
LOCKHART: Positive Babinski.
Oh, God, where's my leg, my foot?!
Why can't I feel my f...?!
Okay, call Neuro, Whoa, whoa, whoa!
and let's get a head CT.
Wait, what are you...?
Those are my pants.
Miss, please...
Not my underwear!
I'm not... try to...
I'm not staying!
Just try to relax, okay?
Ma'am, I'm going to put
a catheter into your bladder.
There might be some discomfort as it passes, okay?
( yells )
You do this every day off?
Usually, it's a 10K.
Oh, so you're cutting me some slack, are you?
Just keeping it fun.
You need to stop?
Nah. I got another mile in me.
How about a water break?
( coughs )
Want some?
No, I'm good.
You know, it's been three months.
Oh, yeah? Since what?
( chuckles softly )
What do you want to do for dinner tonight?
I don't feel much like going out. You?
Not really.
Race you to the fountain. Winner cooks, loser cleans?
You're on.
Ready, set...
Hey. What?
Happy three-month anniversary.
Hey...!
JANE: Dr. Pratt, my MVC couple's
ready to go home, but the husband's got a broken foot,
the wife's eye is patched...
And the car's probably totaled.
Get 'em a taxi voucher.
Dr. Pratt, where do I turn in my PPD results?
Employee Health, second floor.
Dr. Pratt, I was wondering,
do you have any dating tips
for someone on a med student's budget?
( rueful chuckle ): Yeah, don't bother.
No, it's incredibly flattering.
That'd be great.
I'll let you know who'll be attending.
Okay, thank you very much.
Good news?
We're being honored
at the Trauma Foundation dinner.
Oh, nice.
Yeah, they're looking
for an outstanding senior resident to accept.
So, why tell me?
Pratt, don't fish for compliments.
It doesn't become you.
8:00 P.M. on the 16th,
seven-minute PowerPoint presentation
with slides and video.
Cozying up with management again?
Not in this lifetime.
Hey, a bunch of us are meeting up at Ike's later
to celebrate Weaver going on vacation.
If "third years" are buying, I'm in.
Well drinks only.
Figure it'll help shore up support
for my Chief Resident bid.
Neela, what do you say?
Well, beats going home.
Something wrong with home?
Come on. We laugh, we bond.
We do a little team-building with our ducklings here.
Sure.
All right! Woo-hoo! Party on!
What, the big kids aren't invited?
SHORE: It's like my lips are moving, but nothing's coming out.
I don't feel sick; I don't
No carotid bruits. feel anything.
Platelets are good. Well, I feel some things.
PT/PTT's normal.
What do you think it is? This is bad, isn't it?
Onset of symptoms is too quick for a tumor.
Aneurysm or AVM? I have three kids. I'm 35.
KOVAC: Could be a hypercoaguable state.
Might've thrown a clot. The kids. Oh, my God.
CT's backed up. Neuro's on the way.
KOVAC: Have a name on her yet?
Yeah. Ellie. Excuse me.
KOVAC: Ellie, I'm going to close your eyes
just for a second. Wait a minute.
I have to tell you something.
Somebody's got to pick up my kids.
You have to call my husband.
Orbicularis oculi deficit on the right.
LOCKHART: You thinking it's embolic?
Yeah, more than likely
to the proximal left MCA.
Please? I...
I think, uh, she wants to write something.
KOVAC: Go ahead and let her try.
LOCKHART: So, TPA could reverse it.
KOVAC: If there's no bleed,
and if we're within three hours,
but no one knows how long she's been down.
Ellie, can you hear me?
Yes, yes, yes, I can hear you.
His name is Dan.
We think you may have had a stroke.
The kind that makes it impossible
for you to express any language.
So, while you might be able to understand us...
TAGGART: Luka.
...we definitely won't be able to understand you.
That's not what I wrote.
What did you do with what I wrote?
Neuro says they're not coming without a CT.
That's not what I wrote.
Right now, we're trying to figure out
what type of stroke you had
so that we can treat it, okay?
I had a stroke?
See if you can track down any family members.
That's impossible.
Old people get strokes.
I mean, whatever this is,
it's just temporary.
It has to be.
Hey. Hi.
What's up?
Uh, I'm just down on a surgical consult.
Uh, did I, by any chance, leave a watch at your place?
Yeah. It's in my locker.
Abby, you still need
that cathed UA on Mrs. Russell?
No, clean catch. Negative dip.
Oh.
Uh, I-I brought in some lunch,
if maybe you'd want to meet up in the break room later on.
Well, actually, I was thinking
that maybe we shouldn't be quite so together... here.
Uh, I thought everybody already knows.
Well, I didn't tell anybody.
Um... ( chuckling )
Except maybe one person. Did you?
No.
So, good.
Your sofa getting much action these days?
Uh... what?
Living with Ray is, how can I put it--
loud, messy and a bit crowded.
You could take your time moving out.
Yeah, but it's not as though
it was any better at your place.
Who's next?
Six-year-old with wrist pain.
Is there a Clayton Davis?
Over here.
You Clayton?
I'm Tucker, his big brother.
He's got a bump on his head. Show her.
This hurts, too.
How'd all this happen, Clayton?
He fell off the kitchen counter.
And who are you?
She's our sister, Bridget.
Whole family's here, huh?
My dad went to get some coffee.
Well, I can take Clayton in for now,
but before he can be treated,
I'll need your father to sign some forms.
I'll go find him.
Okay.
So, young man,
what were you doing on top of a kitchen counter?
Reaching for a bowl.
We were hungry.
Let me find out where to go.
Hi. My neighbor was brought here earlier.
I have her kids with me.
Her name is Ellie Shore.
ELLIE: Okay, okay.
If by some chance this is a stroke, it's minor.
It has to be.
I can think, I can hear.
CT's ready for her. Feel, right?
Okay, put her on a portable monitor
and suction the secretions.
Am I drooling?
Yeah, I am. I'm drooling.
Ellie,
this'll make you more comfortable.
She's smiling, maybe that means it's not so bad.
But she's the nurse. Maybe she doesn't know.
Okay, Ellie, I'm going to look in your mouth.
All right?
She's a doctor. She's not smiling as much.
Maybe she's just more serious.
No gag reflex. Maybe not.
Her swallowing muscles are weak on the right side.
Now, this one, he is gorgeous.
Tube her just to be safe?
What is he? 6'4", 6'5"?
Yeah. Ellie, we're going to have
to put a tube in your throat
to protect your airway.
Can they come in?
Yeah, okay, just for a minute.
TAGGART: Ellie, your kids are here.
They are?
She can hear you better if you guys stand over there.
Why?
Because your mom is having a little trouble moving
the right side of her body, right now.
Hi, guys.
Don't be scared, okay?
Is that why her face looks funny?
Oh...
Is she dying?
No. No, honey.
No, Mommy's not dying. She's gonna be fine...
When did you see her last?
Um, right after school. She was fine.
( coughing violently )
Ma'am, I think you should take them outside.
Why is she doing that?
Well, we just need to give her
a little help breathing, okay?
She'll be fine.
Come on, kids.
Let the doctors take care of your mom, okay?
Mommy? Come on.
( coughing continues )
Push the etomidate and sux.
You're going to sleep now.
When you wake up, you'll be breathing
with the help of a ventilator.
( coughing )
ELLIE: Oh, God...
Am I dead? Is this it?
Is this death?
No, something's wrong.
I can't open my eyes.
I can't move.
Somebody help me.
Well, there's no evidence of hemorrhage,
so it's probably a clot.
It's too late for TPA?
Can cause brain bleed if it's done after three hours.
Her kids saw her a few hours ago,
add a rig ride,
ER assessment...
It's too close to take a chance.
What are her other options?
Hope that collateral flow can develop,
get her into physical therapy.
With a major stroke like this,
the chances of meaningful recovery aren't good.
Only other option
is the MERCI.
The what?
It's a catheter retrieval system.
Takes you into the brain through an artery,
allows you to corkscrew the clot out.
And it reverses the stroke completely?
It's not without risks
The family here? We'll need consent.
Oh, God, oh, God.
I'm blind. I can't breathe.
Help me!
Please, someone...
Please, someone... do something!
On my count.
Please... someone... can't anyone hear me?!
One, two three.
Help me! Please God, help me.
LOCKHART: No ICU beds.
We'll baby-sit her until neuroradiology can take her.
Hey, can I ask you a question?
Yeah.
You ever ask Luka about his kids?
One time.
I think, yeah. Why?
I don't know,
Sometimes I think...
Is she crying?
( alarm beeping )
Heart rate's up to 130. BP's 170/92.
We have to get her back to the ER.
What's going on?
When did we tube her?
About ten minutes ago.
Okay, listen, Ellie, it's all right.
We're going to help you.
I think the etomidate wore off before the suc.
She's conscious, but paralyzed.
MAN: Coming through.
Whoa, what's the story?
Nonviolent demonstration got violent.
Bunch of protesters went nuts downtown.
That thing with the kid the cop beat up last week.
This one got a tear gas canister to the face.
I was just picking up
my grandma's medicine at the pharmacy.
Uh-huh.
Crush injury, second-degree burns
and multiple minor lacs coming in right behind him.
Let me guess, mob torched some cars,
broke a lot of glass.
Good vitals after four of morphine.
Feel pretty bad.
You think maybe I could get some more?
Soon as we make sure
you're actually hurtin', dude.
Did he just withhold pain meds?
I think it's safe to remove him from our short list.
Too late, he's officially applied.
What about Nicholl?
Talks too much.
Pattengill?
I don't know. Skilled but aloof.
Well, then we're in serious trouble, because the pickin's
for next year's Chief Resident are slim.
We're going to have to look elsewhere.
What about Pratt?
Susan, he's the best we've got.
With some serious caveats.
Med students and interns
already go to him with their questions.
Doesn't make him a leader.
ELLIE: Oh, God, oh, God...
Need some help here!
She's tachycardic and hypertensive.
I think the sedative wore off before the paralytic.
Let's get her to Curtain Two.
She's panicking. What? What are they saying?
She needs fentanyl to settle her down.
Don't want to snow her too much.
Help me.
We need to follow serial neuro exams.
Help me! Why... Help me!
Why isn't anybody doing anything?!
I swear to God I'm losing it!
Fent's on board.
I swear to God I'm losing it!
Ellie? It's okay.
What you're feeling is a normal side effect.
We gave you a narcotic
called Fentanyl that will help ease your discomfort.
Oh...
It'll make you dizzy at first.
Wow. It'll help calm you.
What is that stuff called again?
When the intubation medication wears off,
you'll be able to open your eyes again, okay?
'Cause it is good... really good.
Dr. Lockhart?
A moment of your time?
It's okay. We've got this.
Neuro checks Q 10 minutes.
DUBENKO: Do you remember
our abdominal wound yesterday?
Guess what we found during surgery.
Liver lac?
Guess again. Spleen?
Condom full of cocaine lodged in the jejunum.
Knife nicked the bag,
releasing coke into the peritoneum.
That would explain the sympathetic overdrive.
Totally fantastic case,
and if you write it up today,
there's a chance to get into one of next month's issues.
You start with Trauma, if they don't bite,
Annals of Emergency Medicine will pick it up for sure.
You want me to write it up?
Us. I'll help you.
Should only take a couple hours.
But... I'm working.
I'll talk to your superior.
( beeper beeping )
They're prepping my thyroidectomy.
Got to go.
Okay, listen, I'm sorry...
Lockhart, what intern doesn't want to publish?
Of course I want to get published, but...
Then it'd be idiotic for you to pass up a slam dunk like this, right?
Right.
Okay. My office at 7:00.
Your distal radius and ulna are fine.
What's that mean?
I don't think his wrist is broken.
Oh...
You still hungry, Clayton?
We never ate.
We were making dinner when he fell.
So you were both helping out, were you?
How very grown-up.
Hey, this is my dad.
Hey. How's it going? How's he doing?
His neuro exam is normal, looks like a mild concussion.
He'll need observation at home over the next 24 hours.
The wrist is probably just sprained,
but we'll get an X ray just to be sure.
Whatever you need to do.
Have you been drinking, Mr. Davis?
I had a beer.
Well, I'll arrange for the children
to get food trays while we're waiting on radiology.
Thanks.
Dr. Pratt, I have a case
involving a six-year-old with sprained wrist,
but the father appears to have been...
Okay. Present to Morris.
I'd rather present to...
Look, I've got four interns and six med students
in my face every time I turn around.
I'm not the only third-year on the floor.
ELLIE: Left side still works...
sort of.
That's a good sign.
Try the right again.
Come on...
Move! Do it!
Come on, move...
twitch, jerk, anything.
Your heart rate's down.
Fentanyl must agree with you.
Damn it!
You okay in there?
Tube in my throat hurts.
Can't pee by myself, can't walk...
You've got
some gorgeous kids.
Is she talking to me?
I cannot believe you've had three.
You look great.
Okay, you've seen my stretch marks;
you're not talking to me.
They're in our family room right now.
They're hanging in there, okay?
Can't they wait here?
I mean, who's watching them?
Have they eaten?
Has their father come yet?
Dear God, what is that?
Yes, pretty stinky, huh?
Welcome to my world.
I'll be right back.
Hey, Mrs. Lacy, how you doing?
Okay. Let's put this up.
Watch your leg.
And... let's get you out of this thing, okay?
There you go.
Must've been 500 people there.
Add a little police presence, throw a bottle or two--
all of a sudden there's a whole lot of looting going on.
No, I mean, what are the odds
that I'd have gotten hit, you know?
Eyes are pretty irritated.
Can you follow my finger?
That tear gas is some nasty stuff.
You at least get a TV out of the deal?
I told you, I was just walking by, a'ight?
Extraocular movements intact.
Yep, running errands for granny during a riot.
No septal hematoma.
What, you don't believe me?
Put it this way, dude. We've heard it all before.
Right, Chuni?
Heart rate's down to 90 after a liter.
Keep him NPO, D five half at 125.
Let's get plastics down here.
We'll do a CAT scan to define the extent of your injury
and then we're going to send you to the OR for repair, okay, man?
Okay, thanks.
Guy's full of crap. Don't sweat it.
I couldn't spot the con artists till my second year.
ELLIE: * I think I love you
* So what am I so afraid of?
* I'm afraid that I'm not sure of... *
I don't know the rest.
Heart rate's still up.
Did you give her more fent yet?
Oh, yeah, more of that.
Not yet. 25 mikes? Yeah.
No wedding ring.
Husband on his way?
We can't do anything without his consent.
Sexy accent, too. Wonder where he's from.
TAGGART: Neighbor tracked him down.
He's on his way.
Feeling any better, Ellie?
What big, strong hands you have.
That's pathetic.
This guy touches me and my heart races.
What am I? 14?
BP: 127/77.
Actually, it's pounding now...
Okay, this isn't so good.
( alarm beeping ) Heart rate's 240.
What's... happening...
Looks like SVT. Get the crash cart.
She's hemodynamically stable.
Try meds first. Six of adenosine.
I'm getting dizzy.
It's hard to breathe...
Is this related to her stroke?
If her atrium doesn't beat properly,
there can be a pooling of blood.
She threw a clot. It went to her brain.
Yeah.
I can't...
...take this long.
TAGGART: Adenosine pushed at 18:57.
( Ellie gasping )
Ellie, this is going to slow your heart down.
You may feel discomfort
but only for a few seconds, okay?
Oh, God!
Oh... God!
What's happening?
Are you her husband? Yes.
Back in SVT.
KOVAC: Right now she's in an abnormal heart rhythm,
and we're trying to fix it.
We believe something similar
may have happened before.
It would have allowed a clot to form and move to her brain,
causing the stroke.
She had a stroke?
I need the rhythm strip.
LOCKHART: Double the dosage?
KOVAC: Uh, wait. It's atrial flutter.
LOCKHART: Two to one block.
Adenosine won't convert that.
TAGGART: 20 milligrams Diltiazem?
KOVAC: Slow IV push.
Can you tell me what's happening?
Ellie, I'm so sorry.
I know this was painful, but this drug allowed us
to figure out your heart problem.
Now we can give the you the proper medication,
and this one won't hurt, okay?
HUSBAND: Is she awake?
LOCKHART: We can't be sure,
but she has had spontaneous eye movement.
Sinus rhythm at 76.
It's okay. You can come closer.
Honey?
Ellie, can you hear me?
You're here.
KOVAC: Sir.
( sniffles )
No, don't cry.
No, no. Where'd you go?
KOVAC: There's a procedure
we want to try called clot extraction.
LOCKHART: A catheter is inserted
in the groin and then threaded up into the brain.
KOVAC: The clot's identified, then a retrieval system pulls it out.
How are you doing, Ellie?
KOVAC: If it works,
the stroke can be reversed.
HUSBAND: And if it doesn't?
LOCKHART: There are certain risks involved:
infection and other complications
that could lead to coma or death.
Your heart's back to normal. So she's not
in a coma now? KOVAC: No, no.
The stroke affected
the language center of her brain,
so she can see and hear, but she cannot communicate.
Do you want to go ahead with the procedure?
Say yes.
HUSBAND: What happens if we don't do it?
Well, her heart condition is treated,
but she won't improve neurologically.
But she won't die.
No, Dan, listen to what he's saying.
This other thing might fix me.
How long can she live like this?
I can't live this way.
Indefinitely.
I... I don't know what to do.
Yes, you do. Remember at the lake
when we were talking about your cousin,
the one who'd been in that wreck
and I said I'd rather die than live that way?
It's not like she's a vegetable, right?
This is worse, Dan! I'm aware.
I don't even get to be brain-dead.
We can't do this without your consent.
What about my consent?!
I consent, damn it! I consent! I consent!
Is that what's best?
Dan, have some balls.
If you love me, don't leave me like this.
DAN: I mean, if there's a chance that she can come out of it...
Please, this once, hear me...
Oh, my God.
Ellie?
Ellie?
Give consent... please.
Okay.
Mmm.
Mr. Davis? Sir?
Yeah?
Clayton's on his way back from X-ray.
You'll be glad to know there doesn't appear to be a fracture.
That's good.
What I'd like to do is splint Clayton's wrist
and have you bring him back here in a week to get rechecked.
Oh, all right.
Where are the children?
I had to take Bridget to the bathroom.
So, we about done here?
Yes, I've already written Clayton's discharge orders.
Did you drive?
Because you might want to bring the car around.
No, we took the "L."
Well, I can give you a taxi voucher if you'd like.
Yeah, a taxi!
Sure.
Excuse me. I'll be right back.
Morris.
What up?
Six-year-old, negative x-ray,
point tenderness at the scaphoid, splinted,
RICE, follow-up in a week.
Say no more.
There seems to be a strange family dynamic.
What? We talking physical or sexual abuse?
Neither. I mean, I'm not sure, actually.
What I do know is that the father has had a beer.
Uh, breaking news: having a brew isn't a crime.
We got a board full of real patients, Neela.
TAGGART: Ever been in neuroradiology before?
Nope.
Medford seems like a solid doc.
I hear he's the best.
I hear he's screwing a med student.
Um, excuse me, which suite for Dr. Medford?
Room A. Just down the hall on your right.
Thank you. Mm-hmm.
Ellie Shore.
Doctor's on his way.
Ellie, we have to go back downstairs now, okay?
Wait, you're leaving?
LOCKHART: Dr. Medford's team is gonna take good care of you.
I... I don't know these people. They're strangers.
Ellie? I'm Dr. Medford.
We're going to start by cleaning the top of your leg
at the site where the catheter will pass.
And I'm Martha. I'll be shaving part of your pubic hair.
Fantastic.
Hi.
Ah, there you are. Come on in.
Uh, I pulled the chart.
Good.
Um, do you like burgers?
I thought we could, uh, do this over food.
You mean now?
Yeah.
Yeah. Here, put this on. Well, um...
There's a good place down the street.
I'm not actually that hungry.
That looks good on you.
Okay? Shall we?
Okay.
WENDALL: We any closer?
CARTER: Uh...
I'd say...
Another couple hours? Yeah.
Well, we can start with the first course,
skip to the last course, finish with the main.
Or we could just order.
Chicago. The number for Tiny's Pizza?
Okay, now, that's spooky.
What do you think? Large pepperoni and mushroom?
I think I love you.
I... would like to place an order
for delivery, please.
( whispers ) Brat.
MORRIS: Any nerve damage?
Nope. Wound's been copiously irrigated, ancef on board,
plastics and OMF both consulted, waiting for an OR to open up.
Good deal.
This is Irene, Kevin's grandmother.
She's a diabetic. She needed her insulin this afternoon.
My grandson's a good boy.
Why you got to accuse him of stealing TVs?
Excuse me? What?
He's not a thief. He goes to college.
I was... I was kidding, Pratt.
No, man, you weren't kidding.
Whatever, dude. I'm sorry if you took offense.
Morris,
get in here.
Yeah?
What the hell was that all about?
He was part of a mob that was gassed by the cops
after breaking into a bunch of storefronts.
You accused that kid of looting?
It ain't a stretch, Pratt.
We get guys coming in here all the time
with stories about their sick grannies.
Half the time they're completely bogus.
You cannot go around making assumptions
about every black kid who comes in here.
This coming from you? Yes, this coming from me!
Now, I want you to go in there and apologize to those people
like you mean it. What?!
Just do it.
Well done.
( sighs ) Yeah, well...
guy's an idiot. Anyway...
Hey, Pratt. Carter and Kovac think you should apply
for the Chief Residency position.
What about you?
If I continue to see more of what I just saw,
I could be persuaded. Are you interested?
Thank you...
but no.
KOVAC: She had what's called
an embolic stroke.
It's something that can happen to anyone.
Even kids?
Usually not kids.
She's in neuroradiology now.
So, she, like, stays this way forever?
Maybe, but she could also recover, be just fine again.
Can you fix her or not?
We're going to try...
but for now, just,
just be here for each other.
Send her your love and good thoughts, okay?
I... called my mom a bitch today.
KOVAC: I'm sure she knows
you didn't mean that.
Is she all by herself?
No, no.
I'm going to actually go now and check on her, okay?
ELLIE: Lucas was eight pounds, four ounces...
Christopher, nine pounds, one ounce.
This is good. Stay focused.
Stay alert, and I'll stay connected.
There's going to be a little burning at the top of your leg.
Ow.
KOVAC: How's she doing?
Just putting the guide ports into the femoral artery.
Erin, nine pounds, 11 ounces...
19-gauge single- wall needle.
...Haven't been the same since.
Wonder if they can do a tummy tuck while they're at it.
Thought you might want to see a familiar face.
Hey.
LOCKHART: Okay, so... I was thinking I would start by, um,
maybe gathering some data on the prevalence of body...
Uh-huh. Two mineral waters, please,
and a couple burgers. Medium okay? Sure.
Yeah, two medium, and, um, we'll share a basket of fries.
You got it.
Thank you.
Um, are-are you from here originally?
Pardon me?
I-I don't know.
I detected a hint of Minnesotan in your accent.
Uh, yes, yeah. I mostly grew up in Saint Paul,
but I've lived all over the place.
Anyway, um... in terms of the paper...
Introduction, case summary, discussion.
That's all there is to it.
Do you, do-do you like foreign films?
Something's in me,
actually in my brain right now.
Feels funny, kind of hollow...
KOVAC: Ellie, we're going to take some pictures
of the arteries in your brain, okay?
...lonely.
Catheter is in the internal carotid.
Let's go for it.
Injecting the dye.
KOVAC: Should be a defect in the MCA.
God, I'm bored.
That the occlusion?
M-1.
Proximal middle cerebral artery.
Yeah. Completely blocked by the clot.
Maybe I'm tired.
KOVAC: Ellie, the clot's...
exactly where we thought it was
It's preventing blood flow to the part of your brain
that controls language and right-sided motor function.
...Maybe I'll just let go.
So what time to do you want to get up?
6:00.
How about 5:00, and we work in a run?
( sighs )
You're relentless.
Just committed.
Good night.
Good night.
Shut up. I'm serious.
Morris is applying for Chief Resident.
Morris is an unethical, talentless dolt,
who surrounds himself with sycophants.
Well, maybe he should forget resident and run for president.
Pratt should get the job.
We need any coffee?
Mr. Davis?
Where are your children? I didn't see them outside.
Mr. Davis, wait.
You're supposed to be with your kids.
Clayton's got a concussion.
He's to be monitored all night by an adult.
Hey, wait up, man.
You need to stay with Clayton tonight.
I ain't got no kids.
The oldest one gave me seven bucks and told me to pretend.
That's all. Pretend what?
That they was mine.
Memories...
blended...
...folding like... water.
Lake...
that smell...
sunblock?
Jasmine?
Happy, all of us.
Wet... kids...
noisy... messy...
love...
you.
There's only two available social workers tonight
for six hospitals.
Well, can you try a 911 page then?
Please. Neela Rasgotra, County Hospital ER.
Thank you.
Look, if the kid had the smarts enough
to hire someone to be his dad,
he's probably going to be pretty responsible
about monitoring the concussion.
Yeah, but why would he lie about his father?
Maybe his real folks aren't such prizes.
Maybe he didn't want them to know
about his brother's injury.
He filled out the forms.
Do you think the address is correct?
Duluth is a real street.
It's a crappy neighborhood to pretend to be from.
Phone's disconnected.
22 years old; multiple GSWs to the abdomen; BP: 90 palp.
Pulse ox 97 on ten liters.
What's open? Trauma One.
Dr. Lewis? Ask Pratt.
Dr. Pratt. Yeah?
Both attendings are unavailable and I need to leave.
It's an emergency.
Do I have your permission to go?
What kind of an emergency?
I had a patient earlier, well, an entire family actually,
and I'm very concerned about their well-being.
There are no available social workers,
and all I have is an address on Duluth.
We're pretty well caught up, so go.
But take Ray with you.
Duluth's a rough neighborhood.
( phone rings )
CARTER ( groggily ): Hello?
Oh. Hey.
What time is it there? Who is it?
I can barely hear you.
Um...
Oh, you just got that?
Yeah, I thought you could use some ceftriaxone.
Um...
not much. Just working.
Where are you going?
See you at work.
( sighs )
Hey, can I call you right back?
Look, I'm sorry.
Who was it?
It was stupid. It was rude, and I'm sorry.
Can we go back inside, please?
Is this a little diversion for you
till she comes back to the States?
It's freezing out here.
Go back inside, John.
Hey. Hey, I had a baby with her.
What am I supposed to do,
cut her out of my life completely
because I'm with you now?
Are you with me?
Can we just please go back inside?
Don't. Come on. Don't walk away.
Okay, so that's it--
one phone call, and you're gone, huh?
One phone call?
You were in bed with me, John. You could've mentioned that
somewhere between "How are you?" and "How's the weather?"
Look, we spend every night together.
We enjoy each other's company. We have fun.
All right, I know what you want me to say, and...
and I can't say it, okay?
I'm sorry.
Well, at least you're honest.
Look, it doesn't mean that we...
Yeah, it does.
( sighs )
Wendall.
Fluoro on.
MEDFORD: Torquing clockwise.
Injecting.
Cross your fingers.
One... two... three...
10cc's in. four...
Think you got it?
Pulling back.
MEDFORD: Got it.
Beautiful.
Fully recanalized,
no fragments in the distal branches.
Wide open.
Wake up, Ellie.
MARTHA: Good tidal volume.
Can we get her off the vent?
KOVAC: I'm not sure.
If we extubate, may be better to do it in the ER,
just to be safe.
NEELA: 442. That's it.
RAY: Yeah? Yeah.
All right.
( knocking )
TUCKER: Who is it?
Tucker, it's Dr. Rasgotra from the hospital.
Hey, buddy.
Your folks around?
TUCKER: Get up, you guys.
Get up.
Come on, get up.
They're gonna take us now.
What for?
Tucker. Wake up, Clayton!
Huh? Remember, I told you
they was going to split us up if they found out?
Get your coats on.
Tucker, where are your parents?
There's just my mom.
In there.
Hello?
Mrs. Davis?
( knocking )
Oh, God.
She got sick, a week ago.
Hey.
Hey!
Pull up a stool, guys.
How come no one's here yet?
I'm someone.
Come on, senior residents don't bite.
Not this one, anyway.
Barkeep, got some thirsty students here.
I'll have a beer.
Me, too. Lite.
GRIFFIN: Me, three.
Vodka, neat.
Mm. I like the way you think, Jane.
What, no interns?
Doctors Barnett and Rasgotra
had some patient follow-up thing.
Where's Abby?
Right here. Oh, hey.
Hi. Hey, hi. Sit down.
Where've you been?
I feel like I haven't seen you all shift.
Uh... around.
Morris, what's this all about?
Mm. In a word, mentoring.
Um, is Dr. Pratt coming?
Better be, he's splitting the bill.
( sighs )
( softly groans )
( turns on basketball game )
KOVAC: Ellie?
We need you to take a deep breath, okay?
Tidal volume's 1,200 with an excellent NIF.
You ready?
Yeah.
Okay, I'm going to pull this tube out now.
Deep breath in...
and out.
( exhales, coughing )
( groans )
Don't worry. That'll stop.
( coughs )
Okay.
Okay, let's sit her up.
( grunts )
You want to try and say something?
Thank you.
(laughs): Hey.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
