Previously on E.R:
...and yes, I believe the drug ruined her kidney.
What your alleging is potential slander
that could cost the hospital millions
in pharmaceutical support.
Abby, he's all yours today.
Who?
Hi.
Nothing's gonna happen.
Why is that?
You're my student.
Welcome, roomie.
God, I'm gonna regret this.
If we want to make our patients happier,
we need to teach our residents
to connect with them better.
Might want to start with Pratt.
I'm not an intern, okay?
So, stop acting like one.
WOMAN: Oh...
Mmm... ah...
Ah...
Mmm....
Whoo...
No more hot water.
Sorry about that, baby. I should have warned you.
This building needs a bigger water heater.
I'm freezing.
Let me see what I can do about that.
Come on in there.
( quiet moaning )
How about we call in sick?
I'm arguing a motion today.
It's my first time in front of this judge.
Okay, well, let's just try to hook up after my shift, then.
I can't. I'm going to a friend's
birthday dinner at Dandelion.
Dandelion... oh.
Pretty swank.
Yeah, we're splurging.
It's girls' night out.
She's turning 30.
Hmm, well, you know, after today,
I'm on nights for a week, so...
Yeah...
Don't worry.
I'll make it up to you.
Greg, I-I-I like you.
I really do.
But I just don't think there's a future.
What?
I-I'm looking for a guy who's a little further along in his life.
You're a student. You live like a student.
I'm not a student.
I'm a resident.
Listen, Greg, you're great,
but...
I'm looking for a guy I can get serious with.
An adult.
Hamster bite, itchy eyes...
For Abby-- twisted ankle.
Med students-- how do you know
when you want to order a film?
Uh, Ottawa rules?
Which are?
Point tenderness over the lateral or medial malleolus.
What else?
Interns, help them out.
Inability to walk on the scene.
RAY: Or take four steps in the ER.
Hey, man.
Vomiting diabetic for you.
Saved the best for you.
Vertigo times six hours.
'Morning.
CURTIS: This board's a mess.
Sam, the diabetic in Exam Three
needs a d-stick, chem 7 and an IV.
Ray, how you gonna learn to put in lines
if you always have someone do it for you?
Aren't IVs a nurses' thing?
If you're an R2 or below, you're doing your own.
I can get an IV into a scalp vein.
Good. Keep your skills up, then.
CARTER: The man has a point.
Today, everybody does their own lines.
I will take this.
I need the practice.
I'm moving on to surgery in a few days.
RAY: Why make up arbitrary rules
if it's just going to slow us down?
CURTIS: Because I can.
Somebody woke up on the wrong side
of the waterbed this morning.
Yeah, me.
You have a waterbed?
I can't make this schedule.
We don't have enough attendings.
We could hire a few part-timers.
We can barely afford to pay the doctors we already have.
Sam, call CT.
Vertigo guy's gonna need a head with contrast.
You're gonna need an attending to sign off on that.
What?
Residents can't order CTs.
Since when?
We have to cut down on unnecessary CTs
or we're going to have to buy another scanner.
Well, this is a necessary scan.
You were in there two seconds. Did you do
a neuro exam?
It could be a cerebellar mass.
Or an inner ear infection.
Do the exam, present to an attending,
and then we'll see about your CT.
Third-year resident...
I've been ordering my own scans since I've been here.
What's that about?
It's about me making the rules.
Come on, that's stupid.
Come on, man, back me up.
It's her E.R.
Sorry, Pratt.
It sucks to be you.
Mr. Turner, I'm Dr. Pratt.
How can I help you?
Where are my pain meds?
What seems to be the problem?
What do you think?
I am in pain.
I need pain meds... now.
Mr. Turner, I can't help you until you tell me...
Vicodin!
Morphine! Go!
Oh, Pratt, you got to help me.
I've been stuck for 30 minutes
with a homeless woman named Rocky who says she knows you.
Yeah, she's a frequent flier
with a positive review of systems.
Chief complaints: Headache times two years,
tingling feet, chronic cough, insomnia,
intractable emesis, pruritus ani...
Am I supposed to work this all up?
She's just lonely.
Knows exactly what to say
to guarantee she'll be here for hours.
I can't spend any more time in there.
Her breath is killing me.
Okay, call in social work.
Have them hold her hand.
Half an hour with Wendall, she'll be cured.
Half hour with Wendall, I'd be cured.
Oh, Pratt, I'm applying for a Robert Wood Johnson grant
to look at the effects of Prevnar on occult bacteremia.
Good luck with that.
Hey, do we have a hand-out for the local rehab programs?
We need to pull all the charts on kids
under two who have had a septic workup
and record the demographic data on these forms.
We?
Yeah, fill out my chart review,
I'll put your name on the paper.
I'm not into research and I don't care
about publishing.
You should. You're going to be out there
looking for a job in a couple of years,
staring at a big blank page
where your articles are supposed to be listed.
When they hire the guy from Harvard
who's got a five page C.V.
and published three books
during his residency,
you're gonna look back on this time
and wish you'd stepped up.
You know, actually, I'm writing something right now.
It's about the abuse of power by attendings
in the county hospital system.
I need these back in a week.
I use the ABCD mnemonic.
Airway... Bones... Cardiac... Diaphragm.
And then finally, you look at the lung fields.
Is the problem that I'm a student
or that I'm your student?
Looking for infiltrates,
opacities, vascularity, and pneumothorax.
I'm just trying to isolate the issue.
We've covered this.
I'm your supervisor.
Temporarily.
Your evaluation form is sitting in my box right now.
( chuckling )
Okay, 72-year-old female with nausea.
Are you gonna let some false sense of hierarchy
get in the way of this?
One more word and I'll flunk you.
Hi, Mrs. McDow.
Feeling a little queasy?
A little.
Chest bothering you?
I think I'm having heart pangs.
Ever had anything like this before?
Sometimes,
when I'm walking Ferdinand.
He's a mutt, but I love him.
Pulse is racing.
My husband brought him home from the pound
just a few months before he passed away.
Sorry to hear that.
What's your plan?
O2, aspirin, Nitropatch, morphine and Lopressor?
Okay, Mrs. McDow, we're going to get you some medication.
That should help with the pain
and then my student here is going to get you an EKG
and check out your heart.
You're the boss.
Yes, she is.
Okay, say "ahhh."
Ahhh.
He's only been at this school a month.
Already missed five days.
You can close now.
You have a sore throat?
How about a stuffy nose?
He's kind of quiet.
Just said he didn't feel well enough to go to school.
Okay. You want to open your ears for me, young man.
( cell phone rings )
How long has he had ear tubes?
WOMAN: I'm not sure.
He's my husband's kid.
Been living in Detroit with his mom until a month ago.
Mom's doing six months for selling meth.
He had nowhere else to go... work.
What's this?
How'd you do that?
Does it hurt?
No.
Strep culture you asked for.
Thanks. Thomas, how did you get that scratch?
Hey, it's okay.
You can tell me what happened.
I don't remember.
Oh, Jane...
I'm applying for a Pharmyxia educational grant.
Okay.
I need to give them
a current inventory of all textbooks and computers
and I thought it would be a perfect job for a medical student.
Really?
Yeah, take stock of all computers,
educational CDs, textbooks--
anything at all that can be used
for educational purposes--
and record them on these forms.
You poaching my student?
Attending scut comes before intern scut.
Sorry.
WOMAN: I missed so much work
I got fired.
So then I'm home sulking all the time and my boyfriend bailed.
Well, chronic pain can put a strain on relationships.
Have you two considered...
Counseling? Forget it.
We've already been down that road.
Ms. Slattery, here's your note for work.
I've signed your discharge.
You're all set.
I don't know why I bother.
There are pain clinics
and support groups you could try...
You know, you people
always give the same useless advice.
Therapy...
support groups... I've tried that.
I've tried everything. Nothing helps.
I told you I didn't need social work.
Hang in there.
We're all done here.
Good luck.
What was that about?
It's back pain. You heard her, nothing works.
So you called me out of the NICU
to see a patient who doesn't want my help?
She needed someone to complain to
and I needed to get some work done.
I'm not a baby-sitter.
Hey, Wendall, I need you to talk to the kid in Exam Three.
He has a gash on his chest,
won't even tell me how it got there.
See, Ray? A real social work consult.
OLBES: Lysander Martin,
37-year-old GSW to right chest.
You ready?
Get started without me.
We should go in together--
Tachy at 114, His name's Thomas.
B.P. 135/80, sats 92 on a high-flow mask.
Mr. Lysander, I'm Doctor Kovac.
Lysander's my first name. Lysander Martin.
Interesting name.
It's from Shakespeare.
My mom wanted to name me after a romantic hero.
Okay.
She got it wrong.
One-two-three!
Decreased breath sounds on the right.
I've always wanted to ride in an ambulance.
He'll need a chest tube.
DUBENKO: Got the trauma page.
Hi, I'm Dr. Dubenko, trauma surgeon.
So many doctors.
Are you all here for me?
37-year-old with a single GSW to chest.
Good airway.
Lysander Martin was shot.
Lysander Martin was gunned down.
I don't believe it!
This guy's a talker.
No kidding.
Wound looks...
...through and through. ...through and through.
I don't even feel the pain.
Is that, like,
the endorphins or something?
DUBENKO: Hello, doctors,
he's decreased on the right.
Needs a chest tube.
MAN: This Lysander Martin?
Yeah.
You need to put that mask back on.
What's that for?
He's being charged with assault.
WENDALL: Nobody is going to be mad at you.
Right?
Of course not.
All done.
So you can talk to us, you know.
It's okay.
You're safe here.
I... was climbing a fence at school.
I slipped on the top.
So you got this cut from a fence?
It's the wire kind.
With the sharp things sticking out.
I didn't want to say because I ripped my shirt.
It was Casey's.
Great, Thomas.
It's okay, I don't care.
You know, I'd like a couple of minutes
with Thomas alone, if that's alright.
It's just a scratch.
Is that absolutely necessary?
They're going to kill me at work if I don't show up soon.
You can't go until his rapid strep's back anyway.
( pager beeping ) Cardiac unit. Excuse me.
I'll be right back.
LOCKHART: She's got a right bundle branch.
That's pretty common.
I have that, too.
I also have an aberrant
re-entrant conductance pathway.
That explains a lot.
Yeah, my EKG's kind of wild.
I assume you want another 12 lead.
Yes. Thank you.
Um, there are a few findings on your EKG
that are consistent with ischemia,
which would mean that your heart muscle
isn't getting enough blood.
That can't be good.
Oh, well, we'll check another EKG
and see if they've progressed.
Thank you, dear.
And I'll be back.
Oh, Abby, I'm asking all the residents
to keep a running tally of time spent on paper charting.
Are you thinking about switching to an automated system?
Yeah, if we can get the money.
Just keep track of all start and stop times
on all your documentation.
And could you ask the rest of the house staff
to fill out these forms and then just collect
the surveys when you're done with them?
Thank you.
What's the time survey about?
I'm applying for an informatics grant from Genadon.
Genadon Pharmaceuticals.
Yes. Why?
I just felt that the residents should be treating patients,
not doing free research for drug companies.
Well, maybe they'd be able to if someone hadn't spilled their guts on television.
I was right.
You know, the makers of Zarictal give this hospital
over $50,000 in educational grants here.
That's money for computers, conferences, support staff.
I can't count on those funds now.
So you're just going to go to another drug company?
Can't we be a little bit more creative than that?
You know the county health system is bleeding out.
Unrestricted grants from pharmaceutical companies
help pay the bills.
There's no such thing
as "unrestricted" grants
from pharmaceutical companies.
The very fact that we rely on that money
is a serious conflict of interest.
Yeah, and I never thought I'd be kissing corporate ass
when I went to medical school. Welcome to adulthood.
We owe it our patients. To keep our doors open.
This compromises our independence.
Oh, you know what, most of us had to make compromises
just to get through med school and residency.
That's probably a foreign concept to someone
who's never had to worry about money a day in their life.
It must be nice.
PRATT: A little pressure here...
and I'm in.
Sat's at 98.
KOVAC: Nice, Pratt.
Morrison's looks good, no fluid.
So you still haven't told us
how you got shot, Mr. Martin.
Lysander, please. Call me Lysander.
Midsummer Night's Dream.
Spends the whole play being pushed around by Puck.
Puck is evil.
Oh-silk.
Why are you looking in the abdomen?
The injury's in the chest.
Bullet could have ricocheted.
Nipples to navel-- no man's land.
You know, I've always hated those ER truisms.
Entrance and exit wounds are aligned,
the bullet went straight through.
The man needs a chest tube. Leave it at that.
It's done. Good. Oxygen, pain control, ICU, next.
Do I need an operation?
KOVAC: It's not clear. No.
How can you be so sure without looking?
You want to scan the belly?
Yeah. Call down.
Why do you ER docs radiate the hell out of people
instead of trusting your own clinical judgment?
Hang up, Pratt.
I trust my clinical judgment and I want a CT.
CT that's a CAT scan, right?
Yeah. Scanner's down for repairs, could be a couple of hours.
Good.
If the bullet nicked the bowel
he doesn't have hours. He needs an X-lap.
Can we please let the surgeons decide who needs the surgery?
Are these guys fighting over me?
Come on, Kovac,
let it go.
He's my patient.
Oh. Okay.
Vitals Q hour,
chest tube to suction,
morphine PRN.
There. Now he's officially admitted
to the trauma service.
You're just boarding him till the bed's ready.
Okay? Now he's my patient.
You can go.
Two small coffees in large cups please.
I hate when they don't leave enough room for milk.
If we miss that intestinal injury,
guy's going to get septic and die.
Why does Dubenko think he can act
like that with the ER staff?
Hubris? I love that word.
And one more sugar please.
He doesn't get to you?
Doctor Hair?
I think he's kind of cute.
What?!
Surgery and ER have these battles in every hospital
I've ever worked in. It's not personal.
Surgeons have to believe
they're better and smarter than everyone else.
It's a defense mechanism to make up for their terrible lifestyle.
The guy needs an X-lap.
It's a pissing match, Luka. Let it go.
Come on, you're taller and sexier
and you already got the girl.
This isn't about ego.
It's not?
19 year-old male, arrow to the abdomen.
What's your name? Oh, God, it hurts!
It's Dan. His name's Dan.
Airway's fine, tachy to 130s, BP 98 over 50.
Could use a little help over here.
I need more of that stuff. Please.
Hang in there, Dan, we're going to fix you up, buddy.
Alright, what happened?
They made me balance an apple on my head
while they all took shots at it.
Who did?
DKE brothers. I'm a pledge.
It's a hazing stunt?
They said the arrow had a plastic tip, couldn't hurt me.
They were wrong.
We actually didn't think he'd let us do it.
God, I'm glad I'm not a guy.
Alright, little guy, here's a note for school.
Thank you.
Remember, no more climbing fences
till your double digits, okay?
Just keep the wound dry till it's all scabbed over.
Thank you, Doctor. Any time.
Wait a minute. Can you guys hold on one second?
Dr. Pratt... We really need to go.
Just one minute.
I wasn't done.
I asked you to find out
what happened and you did. Thank you.
If you're going to bother to call me to consult,
you should at least wait for my assessment before releasing him.
And your assessment was that the injury is consistent
with the story, so what's the problem?
I haven't completed my evaluation.
I can't sign off until I've interviewed him alone.
I don't need you to sign off.
Hey, I got
a 16-year-old girl with abdominal pain.
I was wondering if you'd do the sexual history.
I think she'd rather talk to a woman.
You know, I am sick and tired
of you all using Social Work as a crutch
whenever your patient's needy or smells bad
or you just don't want to spend time with them.
Actually, she smells kind of good.
Thanks.
You should have paged me before you discharged him.
So which is it--
are we calling you too often or not enough?
I'm sorry, but if I don't leave now
I may lose my job.
Don't worry about it. You're all set.
When are you guys going to take this thing out of me?
It's not safe doing it down here.
We're going to do it up in the OR.
Dubenko's on his way.
Damn it, this guy's got no veins.
I'm not having any luck either.
Anyone look on the feet?
Abby, set up for a central line,
Ray, get ready to tube him. Alright.
Sterile 6s to Jane.
Jake said you were cool like that.
Like what?
Letting med students do procedures.
Actually, that's how he sold me on the switch.
What switch?
Has anyone reached my mom? TAGGART: We're working on it.
He's swapping his remaining shifts with me
so he can do nights with Neela supervising.
Oh.
Okay, Dan, we're going to put
a breathing tube down your throat for the OR.
And when you wake up, this thing
will be out of you, and you'll be all fixed up.
Yay. 18 gauge in the dorsal arch.
20 etomidate, 100 of sux.
Said he wants to get a sense of how
the other interns do things. Mm-hmm.
Oh, systolic's down to 62.
Okay, Abby, why don't you go next door
and get the rapid infuser.
Yeah. Flush the line with saline--
I'll be right back.
Etomidate is in.
Okay, suction.
We hardly ever do DPLs anymore.
Yeah, because CT makes us lazy.
It's archaic.
DPL has a higher sensitivity
with occult intra-abdominal injury.
Dubenko doesn't want us near this guy.
It's safe, it's faster
and it's indicated in penetrating thoracic injury.
Lover thoracic injury.
Is there always this much debate?
Only with the really important stuff.
Cool.
I'm stealing your rapid infuser.
Send Jane in. She should see this.
Okay, we're going to put a small catheter into your belly.
We're going to run a liter of saline in and out.
If the fluid comes back clear, you're good.
If there's any blood, you're going to need the OR.
Makes sense to me.
He's not our patient. Dubenko's going to freak out.
Hey.
Hey.
The kid with the arrow in his belly
went up to the OR.
That's good.
I was never in a fraternity, boy, but...
What?
I said I was never in a...
Look, I'm sorry.
Maybe sometimes I'm not the best team player.
I was out of line.
I just have so many balls in the air.
I'm sorry I took it out on you.
It was a lot easier being a resident, wasn't it?
Attendings made all the tough calls,
protected us from all that administrative crap.
Didn't seem like that at the time.
Students want to be residents,
residents want to be attendings.
Yep, and attendings just want to be left alone.
I'm not doing any more consults down here today.
Why? Who's covering?
No one. The ER's blacklisted.
What?
They all brag about
the ER's multidisciplinary approach,
but in the end doctors only listen to other doctors.
What happened?
Have the residents call a candy-striper
if they need somebody to keep their patients company today, okay?
Okay, grasp the fascia with the towel clips and pull up.
Are you a student?
No, she is.
Now just pop the angiocath
through to the peritoneal cavity...
and aspirate as you go.
Want me to hold the clamps while you do that?
No. I've got it.
How long have you been a doctor?
Three years. I'm in.
Nothing back.
I've worked at the same place for the last 14.
Extend with the scalpel and thread in your tubing.
Dr. Kovac,
urosepsis guy's coding,
Morris is in there alone.
Okay, dump in a warm liter of saline
and let gravity pull it back out.
Takes about 20 minutes.
And if Dubenko sees this?
Call me.
You want me to go with him?
Yeah.
He seems like a cool boss.
He's just one of them. I have a bunch of bosses.
I've had the same one for the whole time.
Jack Meegly.
He's a year younger than I am
and he's made me call him Mr. Meegly.
Sounds like a jerk.
Last night I had my crew rearrange this display
so that the cell phones were separated from the CDs.
This morning he came by
and he made me change it all back.
Apparently I don't have the authority
to change the displays in my own damn department.
Sucks to be the middle man.
For the last 14 years I've been working holidays
and covering his ass, while he cheats on his wife
with the girls in cosmetics.
200 CCs in.
Today I had enough.
I went to the firearm section, I took a gun out of the case,
I grabbed some bullets,
I went into Meegly's office
and fired into the air.
You're kidding.
Uh-uh.
You know, I didn't want to hurt him.
I was just mad.
TAGGART: That explains the handcuffs
and your friend outside.
So what happened next?
He, uh, was calm.
He grabbed the gun out of my hands,
and then he, uh...
He shot you?
The story of my life.
Damn. Thought I had it bad.
Sorry for the delay, Mr. Martin,
ICU should have a bed in about...
Dr. Pratt, what are you doing?
A DPL.
Yeah, I see.
Well, why stop there?
Get sterile, Pratt.
We're going in.
What? Yeah. Scrub up, you're assisting.
He's not serious.
You guys are so sure he needs an ex-lap,
let's open him up right here.
Let's go.
I'm not really getting surgery, am I?
Oh, no, I was just making a point.
Where's Kovac?
Sam's out looking for him.
You know, quick, friendly tip of advice--
next time you're caught between a surgeon
and anyone else in the hospital, listen to the surgeon. How about this time?
He's got to finish what he started.
Gravity's going to pull the fluid
out of your belly into the bag.
If it comes out red then we know you're bleeding inside.
You ER docs convince yourselves
of the worst possible diagnosis,
then radiate, bleed and bludgeon
in order to prove that you're right.
That's not true. Dr. Kovac is always on us
to avoid unnecessary tests.
So obsessed with the dramatic save that you fail
to develop any finesse.
Finesse?
Sledgehammers and carpet bombing
where discretion and restraint are what's required.
He would not have pushed to do the procedure
if he didn't think we were going to find something.
Dr. Kovac has you doing
an invasive procedure on somebody else's patient.
You have something to say, say it to me, not my resident.
Maybe you and I should discuss this out in the hall.
No, we can discuss it right here.
Very well.
My patient is fully aware
that you and your resident ignored my instructions
and proceeded with this ridiculous test. It's okay. Really.
After years of taking care of the cases
that you guys blow off,
I've learned to develop some intuition.
Your intuitive approach is very sweet,
but I like to practice evidence-based medicine.
Okay? Let's look at the evidence, shall we?
It's pink, does that mean I'm bleeding?
No. May I?
Last vitals: 72,
18, 114/66...
Note: I am reading this through the fluid.
How does that correlate to cell count?
10,000 RBCs, tops.
Is that bad? No.
It's nothing. A tablespoon of blood.
Probably from Dr. Pratt's incision.
You don't know that for sure.
Should we get another doctor in here?
You know, like a tie breaker or something?
Maybe break the tie?
Look, if he was bleeding
we'd be looking at tomato juice,
not pink lemonade.
He could have a small tear that's intermittently oozing.
I'm getting very tired of this game.
And since I can't trust you to stay away from my patient
I'm going to go and find him a bed myself.
He's not mad at me, is he?
A blocked blood vessel deprived your heart of oxygen
which caused the abnormal rhythm.
That's why you passed out.
The cardiologist is going to thread a catheter
through your groin, into your heart
and unblock the vessel.
Will it hurt?
No, you'll be sedated.
Curtain B is open.
Is there any family you'd like us to call for you?
My son lives in Seattle.
There any friends who could come be with you?
No, it's just me and my dog now.
I'll tell you what, Gertie.
My shift is almost over and I love the cath lab.
I'm going to come hang out with you
while they do your procedure.
You want to stay here with me?
I'll be quiet, I'm not going to bug you or anything.
Privacy please, I need to do my assessment.
That was nice of you.
I wasn't lying, I really do like the cath lab.
Hey, listen, um...
you did a great job on your rotation this month.
I probably should have mention that sooner.
Thank you.
And I want you to know... just let me know
if you need any help down the line.
Sure.
And I think it's good that you switched
to have some shifts with Neela.
She's very smart
and i-it's good to have variety.
Abby, I was wondering about something.
Yeah?
Do you think Gertie's blockage
is in the circumflex or the LAD?
Hey, you know, the next time
you decide to start a turf war with Dubenko,
do me a favor, leave me out of it.
This isn't about power, it's about the patient.
Yeah, but he's seen hundreds of GSWs.
What makes you so sure you're right and he's wrong?
If you have a strong gut feeling about something,
you have to listen to it.
Come on, we were wrong.
We don't know that yet.
Made us look like fools.
Is that what you're worried about?
What?
Nothing will get a doctor into bigger trouble
than the fear of looking stupid.
Trust me.
So, um...
you're on nights for the rest of the rotation?
Yeah.
I guess this is it. I'm on days.
Too bad.
Okay. Bye. Bye.
Abby, I'm sure Neela's a good doctor
but that's not why I switched shifts.
No?
No, I switched shifts so that after today,
I would no longer be your student.
Oh.
So, tonight, I want you to fill out that evaluation,
seal the envelope, and turn it in.
Because tomorrow night...
you and me, we're going out.
No, we're not.
Yes, we are.
No, we're not.
No, we're not.
Did you ever think about surgery?
You kind of seem the type.
No, thanks. A month in the Death Star is enough for me.
Death Star? Surgical ICU.
Pratt, excessive yawning a sign of something?
Yeah, sleepiness.
Well, Lysander doesn't seem sleepy.
He seems kind of wired.
He's yawning?
Yeah, a lot.
Detective Burowski's been waiting two hours.
Can we go in now?
Not yet. Call Dubenko.
Are you the mom?
Teacher's aide. He's in after-school day care.
We found him like this on the playground.
How many rounds of epi?
Three. No pulse in the field.
Dr. Carter, full arrest on a school yard.
Blunt injuries to the head, chest and abdomen.
Okay, Trauma Two. Somebody page Wendall.
Why? She and Pratt saw this kid today.
What?!
What are you doing, Pratt?
Just give me a minute, you'll see.
You okay like that?
I'm sliding a little bit.
Maybe this will help.
Can I make a call? Sure.
What's the number?
555-0198. Thanks.
What is this, medieval torture day in the ER?
Observant nurse noticed frequent yawning
in an alert patient.
You got 30 seconds, Pratt.
Which could be a sign of diaphragmatic injury.
You're kidding me, right?
It's a theory. Hard to prove.
But wouldn't necessarily show up on the DPL. Exactly.
It's the machine.
I got a bed for him in the ICU upstairs, okay?
Hi, Sally?
It's Lysander from Electronics.
Methylene blue in the abdomen
should seep through the diaphragmatic tear.
And come out the chest tube.
I've been shot and I'm hanging upside down
with a tube in my belly and a vacuum cleaner in my chest.
And in case I don't make it...
You're going to make it.
I just wanted to let you know that your husband cheats on you.
And...
...that I love you.
Meegly's wife...
she works in Appliances.
I met her when she was just a trainee.
Okay, I want my patient upstairs, now.
Blue.
Sam, Chuny's at the bloodbank, we need a nurse in here.
Coming.
( alarms )
Hold compressions.
What can I do?
You can work on access.
Oh, my God, it's Thomas.
The kid with the chest lac.
Still PEA, rate 66.
Alright, resume.
Hematoma right parietal area, ecchymosis and swelling
to the right mandible and bilateral maxillae.
What in the hell?
Can't get a pressure.
Who did this?
They found him down on the schoolyard.
Is his mother here? Brother?
BARNETT: Bruising and edema to bilateral thighs.
How did this happen?
Isn't it funny how you can be
so completely sure of a diagnosis
then find out you were totally wrong?
You should write up the case, Dr. Pratt.
So do you think you'll be able
to do the surgery laparoscopically
or are you going to have to go open?
Don't know yet, we'll have to run the bowel.
So you think that the bullet
may have been bouncing around the abdomen after all?
Know what? It's possible.
And Dr. Kovac was right?
Goodnight, Dr. Pratt. Thank you.
I think this has been the best day of my life.
( chuckles )
Hey, Chuny, what's going on in there?
Abused kid. You don't want to know.
You guys need an extra set of hands?
It's Thomas. Oh, man.
Hanging the first unit.
Switch out. You look tired.
I just started. Switch out.
I should have finished my interview.
PEA at the scene.
There was a sock shoved down his throat.
How many rounds of meds did you give him? Too many.
How much volume? Third liter's going in.
I blew it. Wendall...
We should pace him.
He's oozing from his IV sites.
DIC. Call for cryo and FFP.
No, Pratt.
Anybody got an ETA on the family?
Another epi, another atropine,
and let's treat the DIC.
He's a kid.
We're not stopping yet.
SAM: Atropine's in.
Pratt, you want me to switch in?
We need central access.
That won't change anything.
Ray, throw in a femoral.
He's got two large-bore IVs with good flow.
What's the time?
It's 43 minutes.
Family's here.
Why don't you go see if they're ready to come in?
How is he?
This is Thomas's dad.
His injuries are very severe.
Do you want to see him?
Sometimes it helps to see how hard the doctors are working.
Casey, go back and sit down.
I don't think he needs to see this.
GARY: I want to be with him.
I saw them.
Who?
I saw them pull Thomas behind the swings after school today.
Who did you see?
They had a thing about his clothes.
I gave him my shirt yesterday,
but they still wouldn't leave him alone.
Did they cut him?
I tried to get Thomas to tell you,
but they said they'd kill him if he said anything.
He was scared. Everyone's scared of them.
Casey, tell me who they are.
I promise you'll be safe.
I still have to be in school with them every day.
Who?
There's four of them.
They're sixth-graders.
PH is 6.8.
Amp of bicarb.
Hold compressions.
Okay, that's it.
6:25.
Please.
He's still got a rhythm.
A non-perfusing rhythm
at the rate of 28.
We haven't even tried transcutaneous pacing.
48 minutes of cerebral hypoxia.
How much fluid did you give him?
Three liters of NS,
four of O-neg.
Ten rounds of epi and atropine.
Pratt.
Greg.
GARY: Oh, no!
He's fixed and dilated
with a pH that's not compatible with life.
( sobbing )
Mr. Bryson, Mrs. Bryson, I'm very sorry.
( sobbing uncontrollably )
( sobbing continues )
( sobbing continues )
Hi. Hi.
I was just about to put this in your box,
med student evaluations.
How's it going with him?
He's very thorough,
he's got a good fund of knowledge...
That's not what I meant.
And I'm sorry I didn't get to those time surveys today.
We're so screwed at this point,
another day doesn't matter.
What's going on?
Was Carter's press conference really that big a deal?
If Keating-Ward pulls funding, others will follow suit.
Drug companies don't want to be associated
with a department that overreacts
during a post-marketing surveillance.
Well, Admin somehow always finds the money to keep us open.
I could lose my job.
Why?
You didn't personally run county health
into the ground.
No. But my tenure's up for review and I'm way short.
They made you department head.
I think you've proved your worth.
The committee's only concern is how much money I bring in.
That sucks.
I have to bring in $100,000 a year
to even be in the ballpark.
There's a quota? Oh, yeah.
We're being pimped out by the University.
You don't bring in the cash, you're out.
Pharmaceutical grants
are an easy way to raise a bunch of money fast.
I can't lose my job.
I have Chuck and Cosmo now.
Just talked to the OR.
Lysander had a three-centimeter diaphragmatic laceration.
Okay.
You saved his life.
We all miss things, Pratt.
The social worker saw this kid, too.
I pulled rank on her.
Attending trumps resident, resident trumps intern,
we all trump the social worker.
It's a great system.
Most of the time it works.
How do you stand it?
What?
The responsibility.
Busy shift?
The usual. What about you?
What'd you do today?
Tried to sleep, couldn't,
watched bad TV, ate cereal.
I hate working nights.
Okay, bring it on.
Torticollis in Two
waiting for the Benadryl to kick in,
and Tinea Capitis has a scrip for Griseo,
but he needs to see an attending.
That's it?
Yep, I'm outta here.
Hey, anyone wanna go to Ike Ryan's?
Luka's working, Alex is at a sleepover.
I need a drink.
No, thanks, I'm exhausted.
Ooh, I'm in.
Dr. Lewis, the inventory of teaching materials you asked for.
Thank you, Jane.
You're the only person who actually did what I asked.
Uh, textbooks and journals are in the front section,
and computer stuff's is in the back.
Alright. Come on out with us, I'll buy you a drink.
I can't.
There is something you could do for me, though.
Shoot.
Write me a recommendation.
Okay.
Way to work it, Jane.
Ray, you coming out with us?
Oh, I never drink with attendings.
Gets too weird.
Ray, the plumber came and the shower's fixed.
Oh, hallelujah, I love you.
You owe me 80 bucks.
Ready to sign out?
Please don't give me the speech
about how we win some and how we lose some.
I wasn't going to.
I didn't complete my assessment.
I didn't do my job.
Well, what do you think would have happened?
Please don't.
Don't what?
Try and cheer me up.
( sobbing ): I should have saved that kid!
Can I help you, sir?
Uh, no. Actually, I'm looking for someone.
What's the name of the party?
Really. I'm good. Thanks.
Oh, my God!
Oh, that's awful.
Hi.
I'm sorry, ladies.
I didn't mean to interrupt.
This will only take a minute.
Greg?
I went to work this morning thinking about what you said.
What are you doing here?
And I just need
to tell you something.
The work that I do?
It's as real and as serious as it gets.
I don't know how you define an "adult,"
but I assure you, I'm all grown up.
Look, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to offend you.
I don't know what you're looking for,
but I hope you find it.
Good luck.
Abby.
What are you doing here?
Big problem.
What?
You never signed off on my ABG or IV placement.
So you staked out my apartment so I could sign your book?
All student-teacher relations
have to be wrapped up by tomorrow.
That is very important.
I see.
Sign it.
How do you know where I live?
Residency office.
They just, uh, gave out my address just like that?
You could have been anybody.
It's disturbing, really.
They even gave me your phone number, too.
Well, I guess they thought you look like a nice boy.
I'm not that nice.
Maybe I should change my number.
Good idea.
Okay, well, congratulations, Jake.
Your ER rotation is officially over.
