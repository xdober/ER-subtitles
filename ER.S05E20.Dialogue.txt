PREVIOUSLY ON E.R.:
WELL, THAT MUST BE TOUGH. WHAT?
COMPETING WITH YOUR BOYFRIEND.
NOT BOYFRIEND; JUST COMPETING.
ANY INDECISION YOU'RE FEELING ABOUT YOUR FUTURE
DR. BENTON, I CAN HELP.
JUST SAY THE WORD AND I WILL TAKE
THE CARDIOTHORACIC FELLOWSHIP OFF THE TABLE.
BY ALL MEANS, FEEL FREE TO APPLY FOR THE TRAUMA FELLOWSHIP.
YOU'RE A LITTLE CLOSED OFF FOR MY TASTES.
CLOSED OFF? EMOTIONALLY WITHDRAWN.
ROXANNE CALLED. TWICE.
( clears throat )
SO... SO...
YOU PLANNING ON GOING THROUGH WITH THE PREGNANCY?
I WAS HOPING TO.
WHAT DOES DOUG THINK?
DO WE EVEN PRETEND
TO BE LIVING IN A DEMOCRACY ANYMORE?
YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST A MEDIEVAL POWER PLAY
BETWEEN CAREER REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS
IF THERE WERE STILL GUILLOTINES AND BURNING AT THE STAKE
I SWEAR, THEY'D BE DOING THAT TO EACH OTHER.
UH-HUH.
HEY, THIS IS WHERE I DO TWO REPS OF TEN.
YOU WANT TO GO FIRST?
I DIDN'T KNOW ANYBODY ACTUALLY STOPPED AT THESE.
OH, YEAH.
END OF YOUR FIRST TRIMESTER
YOU GET THIS SUDDEN BURST OF ENERGY.
JUST HAVE TO KEEP MY HEART RATE UNDER 140.
SO, DID YOU READ IT?
YEAH.
WHAT'D YOU THINK?
THAT IT'S A GOOD LETTER.
YOU'RE VERY CLEAR ABOUT WHAT YOU WANT AND DON'T WANT FROM HIM.
YEAH, I HAD TO WRITE IT ALL OUT, YOU KNOW?
WHOO!
BUT YOU'RE GOING TO TALK TO HIM.
OH, SURE. SURE.
I JUST, UH, YOU KNOW...
AFTER HE READS IT.
I KNOW DOUG'S GOING TO GO ON HIS GUT REACTION
AND I DON'T WANT HIM COMING RUNNING BACK HERE.
YOU DON'T?
WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO SEND THE LETTER?
I'M GOING TO FAX IT.
I GOT HIS FAX NUMBER A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO.
WHAT DO YOU THINK HE'LL DO?
HONESTLY?
HE'LL BE ON THE FIRST PLANE.
Roxanne: OH, LUCY... LUCY... OH...
I'M LATE. I'M SORRY.
THAT'S OKAY.
THANKS FOR MEETING ME.
I DIDN'T MEAN TO SOUND SO MYSTERIOUS.
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT YOU DRINK.
OH, NO. I GAVE UP CAFFEINE FOR LENT.
LET ME GET TO THE POINT. WE'RE BOTH BUSY PEOPLE.
OKAY.
IT'S ABOUT JOHN.
CARTER. YEAH.
I'VE TRIED TO BRING THIS UP WITH HIM
AND I GOT NOWHERE FAST
SO LET ME HAVE A RUN AT YOU.
IF YOU TWO ARE INVOLVED
YOU KNOW, HARMLESS WORKPLACE FLIRTATION
OR OUT-AND-OUT TWICE-A-DAY SEX IN THE LAB
SOMEONE NEEDS TO LET ME KNOW
AND I'LL FOLD UP MY TENT AND GET OUT OF THE WAY.
UH, THERE'S NOTHING GOING ON
BETWEEN ME AND CARTER.
OKAY, MAYBE AT ONE POINT
I THOUGHT THERE MIGHT BE, BUT NO.
I MEAN, WE HAVEN'T REALLY SPOKEN TO EACH OTHER
IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS.
WELL...
SO MUCH FOR THAT THEORY.
HONESTLY, ROXANNE, HE WORKS SO HARD
I DOUBT HE HAS TIME TO CHEAT ON YOU.
YOU MEAN OUR RELATIONSHIP
HAS JUST STALLED OUT ON ITS OWN?
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT.
WELL, IT HAS. I MEAN, IT HAS.
WE HAVE BEEN AT THE LOTTA-LAUGHS PHASE
FOR TWO MONTHS TOO LONG.
YOU WERE MY LAST RESORT FOR AN OBSTACLE I COULD TACKLE.
I WISH I HAD BETTER NEWS FOR YOU.
YOU KNOW, I DON'T ENVY YOU.
HE'S ONE MIXED-UP GUY.
MMM.
HE IS.
SWEET... BUT MIXED UP.
A DEADLY COMBINATION.
MM-HMM.
( kissing sounds )
Man ( whispering ): I THINK ABOUT YOUR BREASTS ALL DAY.
THEY THINK ABOUT YOU.
Man: I'LL COME TO WORK WITH YOU.
Woman: DO. I WANT YOU TO.
OH... I'M SORRY.
Man: HEY!
OH, HERE WE GO AGAIN.
I LOST POWER TWICE LAST NIGHT.
WE DIDN'T.
( giggling )
Older woman: IT'S THE WEATHER.
IT'S THE HUMIDITY.
IT'S ARCING AT THE SUBSTATION.
CAN'T BE LATE.
I LOVE YOU.
I LOVE YOU.
IT'S SPRING.
NO, REALLY, I, UM... ADMIRE YOU.
I LIKE EMERGENCY MEDICINE.
STILL, IT TAKES GUTS.
WHAT TAKES GUTS?
FOR LUCY TO DO ANOTHER E.R. ROTATION.
IT TAKES GUTS TO TACKLE SOMETHING
THAT GOT THE BETTER OF YOU THE FIRST TIME AROUND.
I'M GLAD YOU FEEL THAT WAY, BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO GET
A SECOND CHANCE TO SUPERVISE HER.
CARTER, WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO WITH THIS?
UH... I CALLED U.P.S FOR A PICKUP.
IF THEY'RE NOT HERE BY THIS AFTERNOON, LET ME KNOW?
THE ORIENTAL? MM-HMM.
GOT TO BE IN BANGKOK BY SUNDAY.
GOOD BOY, CARTER. MOTHER'S DAY.
OH, NO.
IS THAT THIS WEEK?
YOU FORGOT YOUR MOTHERS?
AH, I BETTER CALL THE BOWLING ALLEY.
THAT'S WHAT SHE LIKES.
SO WHAT ARE YOUR KIDS DOING FOR YOU
OR IS IT A SURPRISE?
OH, BIG SURPRISE EVERY YEAR.
RUNNY EGGS AND BURNT TOAST IN BED
TWO HOURS BEFORE I WANT TO WAKE UP.
I CAN'T WAIT.
I NEVER LET MOTHER KNOW WHAT'S IN STORE.
LAST YEAR IT WAS A HELICOPTER RIDE AND A CONCERT IN GRANT PARK
AND THIS YEAR, I'VE HIRED A LIMO
AND I'M GOING TO TAKE HER TO ALL THE PLACES
SHE LIKED TO TAKE ME AS A KID:
THE ZOO, THE ADLER, THIS LITTLE TEA ROOM
BACK IN OUR OLD NEIGHBORHOOD...
WHAT?
DIDN'T THINK I HAD A MOTHER, DID YOU?
JUST TRYING TO PICTURE HER.
SO, WHAT DO WE GOT HERE TODAY?
WE?
YEAH, DIDN'T KERRY TELL YOU?
I'M SPENDING THE DAY DOWN HERE.
KERRY JUST ASKED FOR THE DAY OFF.
WELL, AS ACTING CHIEF POO-BAH
I DECIDED I WANT TO GET A BETTER UNDERSTANDING
OF WHAT THE HELL GOES ON DOWN HERE.
YOU WANT TO START WITH OOZING PUSTULES OR PROJECTILE VOMITING?
I DON'T WANT TO SEE PATIENTS.
I JUST WANT TO WATCH AND MARVEL.
AFTER YOU.
SO, TOGETHER AGAIN?
HEY, BET YOU WERE ABOUT TO CALL.
WE GOT A LATE START THIS MORNING.
OH, HEY, REESE.
IS CARLA'S VAN IN THE SHOP AGAIN?
UH, NO. SHE JUST HAD A BIG DAY TODAY.
NEXT TIME SHE GETS STUCK, TELL HER TO CALL.
WE WEREN'T STUCK.
I LOVE BEING WITH REESE.
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GET HIM IN HERE.
I'LL PICK HIM UP AT 3:00, RIGHT?
NO, I'LL BRING HIM HOME
AFTER HIS SPEECH THERAPY.
OH, HE'S STILL IN THAT?
I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING THE SIGNING ROUTE.
I'M NOT GOING ANY ROUTE.
I'M DOING WHAT'S BEST FOR MY SON.
YOU'RE RIGHT. BE GOOD, SON.
NEXT?
76-YEAR-OLD MALE CAME IN HYPOTENSIVE
FEBRILE WITH PURULENT SPUTUM.
Romano: SEPTIC.
YEAH, WE HAD TO TUBE HIM.
BROUGHT HIS PRESSURE UP WITH DOPAMINE
AND GAVE HIM SOME CEFOTAXIME.
SO WHAT'S HE DOING HERE?
WHY DON'T YOU GET HIM UP THE I.C.U.?
WE'RE WAITING FOR BEDS UPSTAIRS, AREN'T WE?
CAROL, CAN YOU TELL US WHAT YOU HAVE?
74-YEAR-OLD WOMAN TOOK A SPILL.
TEMP'S A LITTLE ELEVATED AT 99.9.
( loudly ): SHE FELL OUT OF HER WHEELCHAIR DOWN THE BACK STOOP.
I WAS RINGING THE DOORBELL UP FRONT AND I HEARD THE BANG
AND MY HEART SANK.
YOU SEE, I'M THE ARMSTRONGS' NEIGHBOR.
INSISTED ON DRIVING THEM IN.
B.P.'s 160/90.
MR. ARMSTRONG REPORTS SYMPTOMS OF DISORIENTATION.
ALZHEIMER'S.
BUT... THEY DON'T WANT TO CALL IT THAT.
HE FRETS ABOUT HIS HEALTH PLAN.
GLADYS DOESN'T HAVE HER HEARING AID IN.
Gladys: I DO THE BEST I CAN LOOKING IN ON THEM.
I MEAN, SHE'S SUCH A DEAR.
ARMY'S NOT MUCH OF A COOK.
OKAY! I GET THE PICTURE!
Greene: HAVE CARTER OR LUCY TAKE A LOOK.
Gladys: ARE THEY DONE? IS SHE OKAY?
AND THAT IS WHY I PREFER MY PATIENTS ANESTHETIZED.
HEY, IS, UH, SHE PUTTING ON A LITTLE WEIGHT?
THAT NURSE WHAT'S-HER-NAME?
CAROL HATHAWAY?
IS SHE PORKING OUT A LITTLE BIT?
HATE TO SEE THAT HAPPEN.
I'VE HAD SOME DECENT FANTASIES ABOUT THAT ONE.
OKAY, IN EXAM FOUR, WE HAVE A 36-YEAR-OLD WITH CALF PAIN...
RECURRENT D.V.T. ON A HEPARIN DRIP.
EVER DREAM ABOUT LIZZIE CORDAY?
WHAT?
IT'D BE UNDERSTANDABLE.
IT'D BE ONE MOTIVE I COULD FOLLOW
FOR THE E.R. TRYING TO POACH HER AWAY FROM SURGERY.
UH, TRAUMA FELLOWSHIP IS NOT ABOUT POACHING, ROBERT.
HOW LONG HAS IT BEEN, MARK?
SINCE YOU HAD A TRAUMA COME IN, I MEAN.
WHAT? TODAY?
YEAH.
OKAY, SO, IF YOU ACTUALLY HAD A TRAUMA FELLOW
FOR THE LAST FIVE OR SIX HOURS
THAT HIGHLY SKILLED SURGICAL RESIDENT
WOULD'VE BEEN SITTING ON HER PRETTY LITTLE HANDS
OR MAYBE BABY-SITTING GORKS, WAITING FOR I.C.U. BEDS.
MARK, WE GOT A PARTIAL SCALPING ON THE WAY IN.
WOMAN FELL DOWN AN ESCALATOR AT O'HARE.
NOT A MOMENT TOO SOON.
WELL, TIMING IS EVERYTHING.
"PHER CATCH." THAT'S WHAT I NEED.
GO FOR IT.
THAT ONE HAS NO PERFUME ENHANCEMENT
JUST PURE, SYNTHETIC PHEROMONES
FOR THOSE WHO WANT TO MAXIMIZE THEIR BIOLOGIC SIGNALS.
OOH, I'D LIKE TO TRY THIS ON AL.
NO, YOU'RE ALREADY IN A COMMITTED RELATIONSHIP.
"FULL PHER" IS FOR YOU.
IT HAS A SANDALWOOD FRAGRANCE
BUT WITH A DOPAMINE-LIKE BOOST.
MMM, NICE.
AND I'M NOT ONE FOR PERFUMES.
THIS ISN'T PERFUME.
IT'S BIOCHEMICAL AWARENESS THERAPY.
THEY SAY PHEROMONES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR
AND WHY WOMEN FRIENDS GET THEIR PERIODS IN SYNC.
EXACTLY! MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS ALWAYS UNDERSTAND.
( women laughing )
OH, UH, THIS IS PHYLLIS FARR AND, UM...
SHE EXPERIENCED SOME SHORTNESS OF BREATH
THIS MORNING.
SHE HAS A HISTORY OF A-FIB
AND HAD AN EMBOLIC C.B.A.
TWO YEARS AGO, AND SHE'S NOW ON
COUMADIN AND DIG.
ONE TEENY, TINY LITTLE STROKE
AND I WAS SMOKING LIKE A CHIMNEY THEN.
SOME MEN ARE INHERENTLY LESS RECEPTIVE.
HMM?
UH, I THINK IT WAS JUST ANXIETY THIS MORNING.
I HAD THIS MEGA-MEETING WITH MARSHALL FIELD'S...
I'M SORRY.
MS. FARR IS THINKING THAT SHE DOESN'T NEED TO STAY
BUT I'D LIKE HER ADMITTED
TO TELEMETRY.
HER DYSPNEA WAS RELIEVED BY NITRO
AND IT COULD BE ANGINA.
DARLING, I'M ENTIRELY TOO YOUNG FOR THAT.
I DON'T THINK WE NEED TO ADMIT YOU QUITE YET.
BUT WE SHOULD GET YOU ON AN E.K.G.
ALSO CHECK A TRIPONIN WITH A C.P.K.
YOU'RE SAYING TO CANCEL WITH MARSHALL FIELD'S?
OH, THEY WANT YOU ALL THE MORE WHEN THEY KNOW YOU'RE BUSY.
CAROL...
DID YOU SEND IT?
I AM. TODAY.
I'M RAVENOUS.
IT'S TRUE. YOU REALLY DO GET CRAVINGS.
CAN YOU STEAL AWAY TO THE CAFETERIA?
DO YOU KNOW IF THEY HAVE A SURF AND TURF?
'CAUSE THAT'S WHAT I FEEL LIKE--
A BIG, BUTTERY LOBSTER AND A THICK, RAW STEAK.
MORTON'S, AFTER THE SHIFT, MY TREAT.
NO, I WANT IT NOW.
YOU HAVE A PATIENT FOR ME?
BUT WATCH OUT FOR THE HUSBAND; HE'S A GROUCH.
DO KNOW WHERE THE RULE-OUT THORACIC ANEURYSM IS?
MAGGIE'S PATIENT?
I DON'T KNOW-- PETER TOLD ME TO TAKE THE CONSULT.
I THINK SHE DIED. CHECK IN SUTURES.
THORACIC ANEURYSM. IS THAT THE PATIENT?
UH, NO, SHE'S BACK FROM X RAY.
WHERE DO THEY WANT HER?
OH, UH, SORRY. CHECK AT THE DESK.
LIZZIE.
BUT YOU'LL PROBABLY WANT TO SEE IT.
IT TAKES MORE THAN A TEN-CENTIMETER
SCALP AVULSION TO GET MY HEART PUMPING
BUT I'M NOT A TRAUMA WONK.
I HAD STUFF IN BOTH HANDS
AND SOMEBODY SHOVED ME FROM BEHIND.
I HATE ESCALATORS.
HOW ABOUT HERE?
YEAH. THAT HURTS.
ELIZABETH, NICE TO SEE YOU.
SCALP INJURY?
UH, MS. PRICE TRIED TO GET
TO BAGGAGE CLAIM HEAD-FIRST.
AM I BLEEDING A LOT?
MM-HMM. THE SCALP LIKES TO GUSH.
OKAY. WOULD YOU LIKE TO HELP ME TIE IT OFF?
OH, I'D BE DELIGHTED.
WHOA! ( gasping )
OKAY.
CURVED KELLY. 3.0 VICRYL.
THEY HAD OUR PLANE CIRCLING FOR TWO HOURS
BECAUSE OF THE WIND.
IT'S ABOUT TO STORM.
THERE IT IS.
NOW, CAN YOU GET A CLAMP ON IT?
MM-HMM. WITH YOUR HELP.
MM-HMM.
HOLDING STEADY.
THERE YOU GO.
THAT'S IT. MM-HMM.
GOOD. GOT IT.
NOW... SHOW ME YOUR TIP.
YOU TWO WANT ME TO LEAVE?
OH, UM, ACTUALLY, IT'S SURGEON TALK.
HE ELEVATES HIS CLAMP
SO THAT I CAN SLIDE MY SUTURE...
MMM. ACTUALLY, THAT SOUNDS EVEN WORSE, DOESN'T IT?
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY...
UH-OH. POWER'S OUT.
OKAY, FOLKS, IN A FEW SECONDS
THE AUXILIARY GENERATOR WILL SWITCH ON.
CONNIE, WHO'S CHARGE NURSE FOR INTERNAL?
WE HAVE A POWER FAILURE.
MAKE SURE ALL VENTS AND INFUSION PUMPS
ARE PLUGGED INTO THE RED OUTLETS.
OKAY, LIKE I SAID...
FALSE ALARM, POWER'S BEEN RESTORED.
I NEVER HEARD NO BACKUP GENERATOR KICK IN.
IT TAKES A FEW SECONDS FOR THEM TO SWITCH OVER.
ALL OF YOUR FAMILY MEMBERS WOULD'VE BEEN TAKEN CARE OF.
YOU BETTER HOPE. MY UNCLE'S CONNECTED.
ALL THE MACHINES ARE ON A BATTERY BACKUP.
I WASN'T TALKING ABOUT MACHINES.
LITTLE EXCITEMENT, HUH?
DID ROXANNE FIND YOU?
SHE WANTED TO HAVE LUNCH.
IT'S A LITTLE BUSY TODAY.
SHE WAS IN CHAIRS.
CARTER, CAN YOU HELP ME REBOOT
MS. FARR'S E.K.G. MONITOR?
I THINK IT SHUT OFF WHEN WE LOST POWER.
YEAH, I'LL TRY.
Farr: BUT WE HAVEN'T GONE PUBLIC YET.
ALL THE MORE REASON TO ACT NOW.
Roxanne: SOME COMPANIES WON'T CONSIDER CLIENTS
WITH HIGH-RISK PROFILES, ESPECIALLY THOSE
WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. ROXANNE?
OH, DR. CARTER.
I SEEM TO BE POWERLESS.
YES, I KNOW. I'LL TAKE CARE OF THAT IN A MINUTE.
ROXANNE?
YEAH. BYE.
I HAD A FREE HOUR AND I THOUGHT THAT MAYBE, UM...
WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN THERE? YOU HAWKING MY PATIENT?
THAT WOMAN MIGHT HAVE SUFFERED AN M.I.
OH, COME ON. LYDIA SAID HER E.K.G. WAS GOOD.
ARE YOU SELLING HER INSURANCE?
NO, ACTUALLY, IT WAS A COUNTER-MOVE.
SHE WAS TRYING TO SELL ME 100 SHARES OF PHEROMONE ENHANCEMENTS, OR...
ROXANNE, IT IS UNETHICAL TO PREY ON PEOPLE WHILE THEY'RE VULNERABLE.
PREY ON PEOPLE?
JOHN, I... I SOLD INSURANCE BEFORE I MET YOU.
I SOLD YOU INSURANCE BEFORE WE EVEN WENT ON A DATE.
WHY ARE YOU TRYING TO PICK A FIGHT?
I'M NOT TRYING TO PICK A FIGHT. YEAH, YOU ARE.
WHY WOULD I WANT TO PICK A FIGHT? I DON'T KNOW.
BUT MAYBE... MAYBE YOU WANT TO BREAK UP
AND IT WOULD BE MUCH EASIER FOR YOU TO DO SO
OVER SOME FAILURE OF MINE.
WRONG.
IF YOU WANT TO BREAK UP
I THINK YOU SHOULD JUST SAY SO.
OKAY, I WANT TO BREAK UP.
TO PUSH INSURANCE ON PEOPLE WHEN THEY'RE PATIENTS.
WHO THE HELL LEFT THIS PATIENT OUT HERE IN THE HALL?
I SAW AN X-RAY TECH. DID HE JUST LEAVE HER?
WELL, THERE'S NO CHART.
OH, GOD.
WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED?
SHE'S NOT BREATHING.
LET'S GET HER TO TRAUMA.
WE NEED A HAND HERE!
FEMALE PATIENT. NO I.D. RESPIRATORY ARREST.
I THINK SHE'S BEEN BEATEN.
INTUBATION KIT! NOW!
Romano: PUT HER ON A MONITOR.
WE NEED SOME HELP IN HERE!
Greene: WHAT IS GOING ON?
YOUNG WOMAN FOUND IN THE HALL.
MAY BE ASPHYXIATED.
LOOKS LIKE SHE'S BEEN BEATEN UP.
AND SEXUALLY ASSAULTED.
I'M IN. BAG HER.
OKAY, I NEED POST-INTUBATION FILM.
IS PETER STILL NEXT DOOR?
HE TOOK MISS PRICE TO RADIOLOGY.
B.P.'s 110/80.
PULSE OX IS 97.
ORDER A HEAD AND BELLY C.T.
FEELS LIKE FRACTURED RIBS.
WHERE'D YOU FIND HER?
SHE WAS OUTSIDE EXAM FOUR ON A GURNEY.
I'D SEEN HER EARLIER.
A TECH BROUGHT HER DOWN FROM X RAY.
AN X-RAY TECH OR SOMEONE FROM TRANSPO?
I DON'T KNOW.
FROM MEDICINE?
SULLA ANDREWS.
I'M MARK GREENE.
WHEN WAS SHE FOUND?
A COUPLE OF HOURS AGO.
WHEN DID YOU LAST SEE HER? 10:00 THIS MORNING.
WE'VE BEEN FRANTIC.
IT DIDN'T MAKE SENSE THAT SHE DISAPPEARED.
NO WONDER THE COPS ARE EVERYWHERE.
I HOPE DR. CORDAY GOT A GOOD LOOK AT THE BASTARD.
PRETTY SCARY. I'M LOOKING OVER MY SHOULDER.
THE POLICE AGREE THAT WE SHOULD ALERT ALL STAFF
TO THE POSSIBILITY OF A TECH WHO MAY BE DANGEROUS.
BUT LET'S TRY TO AVOID A GENERAL PANIC.
YOU MEAN, NOT TELL THE PATIENTS?
AT THIS POINT, IT DOESN'T SEEM NECESSARY.
STILL, DON'T LEAVE ANY PATIENTS UNATTENDED
FOR ANY PERIOD OF TIME
AND DON'T RELINQUISH PATIENTS
INTO THE HANDS OF ANYONE YOU DON'T RECOGNIZE
OR WHO DOESN'T HAVE PROPER HOSPITAL I.D.
WHAT IF YOU'RE NOT SURE?
THERE'S A POLICEMAN STATIONED IN EVERY HALLWAY.
CALL THEM.
ALL RIGHT?
OH! OH, THAT SMARTS.
I KNOW, MRS. ARMSTRONG.
WE'RE TRYING TO BE GENTLE.
DID YOU CHANGE THESE DRESSINGS?
NO. I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT WANT TO X-RAY HER FIRST.
( yawning ) ARE YOU OKAY?
YEAH. I JUST SUDDENLY GOT TIRED.
OH, GREAT. I NEED THE RIGHT HIP.
DID SHE BREAK ANYTHING, DOCTOR?
THAT'S WHAT THIS X RAY WILL TELL US.
I KNEW AS SOON AS I HEARD THAT BANG.
I KNEW SHE'D FALLEN.
UH, THIS IS A WASTE OF TIME.
YOU KNOW, UM, I THINK IT WOULD PROBABLY BE BEST
IF WE, UH, WE COULD JUST COME OVER HERE
AWAY FROM THE X RAY, OKAY?
THANKS.
IT WON'T-WON'T MATTER.
GLADYS, GET YOUR CAR.
MR. ARMSTRONG, HAVE YOU HAD ANYTHING TO EAT?
YOU'VE BEEN HERE FOR HOURS.
X-ray tech: SHOOTING!
I'M NOT HUNGRY.
GET THE CAR!
I'M NOT HUNGRY.
ARMY NEVER EATS.
LOOK AT HIM-- LIKE A SCARECROW.
I-I'M TAKING HER HOME.
N-NO ONE CAN HELP.
HOW'S EVERYTHING GOING IN HERE?
WELL, THERE CERTAINLY ARE
PLENTY OF DOCTORS ON HAND.
I'M DR. CARTER.
NO ONE CAN HELP.
PUT HER ON I.V. ANTIBIOTICS?
UH, MRS. ARMSTRONG HAD A BLEEDING SACRAL DECUBITUS
WITH SURROUNDING CELLULITIS.
SHE HAS WHAT?
BEDSORES.
AND SHE'S IN PAIN AFTER A FALL.
I'M GUESSING IT'S A FRACTURED HIP.
HER LEG IS INTERNALLY ROTATED.
I'M GLADYS, THEIR NEIGHBOR.
I BROUGHT HER IN.
GOOD WORK, GLADYS.
OKAY, EVERYTHING LOOKS UNDER CONTROL IN HERE.
DO YOU, UH, NEED ANY HELP WITH THE HUSBAND?
HE SEEMS LIKE A HANDFUL.
I WAS THINKING ABOUT CALLING PSYCH.
HE SEEMS DEPRESSED.
SEE, THE WIFE'S YOUR PATIENT.
YOU MIGHT WANT TO STAY FOCUSED.
BUT HE'S HER PRIMARY CAREGIVER
AND HER SITUATION IS NOT GOING TO IMPROVE
UNLESS HE'S ABLE TO HELP HER.
YOU REALLY THINK HE'S GOING TO TALK TO PSYCH?
ALSO... CAROL NEEDS A BREAK.
HER NAME IS LAURIE HELLER.
WARD NURSE SAID HER BED WAS EMPTY AFTER ROUNDS.
YEAH. SHE'S TALKING TO THE DETECTIVE NOW.
UNFORTUNATELY, NO ONE UP IN MEDICINE
SAW ANYONE RESEMBLING THE MAN I SAW.
SHE STILL HASN'T REGAINED CONSCIOUSNESS.
I DON'T THINK SHE WILL.
SHE'S BEEN ADMITTED SINCE A TRAFFIC ACCIDENT
TEN DAYS AGO.
IN A VEGETATIVE STATE.
OH, GOD.
HER FAMILY HAS JUST BEEN PERSUADED
TO EXTUBATE HER
AND TRANSFER HER TO LONG-TERM NURSING CARE.
THEY'VE BEEN HOPING FOR A MIRACLE.
IT'S BARBARIC.
HERE I AM, THE WORST EYEWITNESS IN HISTORY.
I COULD HARDLY TELL THEM ANYTHING.
I DIDN'T PAY ATTENTION TO THE GUY.
WELL, I'M SURE YOU HELPED.
AVERAGE HEIGHT... I THINK.
WHITE, BUT WITH A DARK COMPLEXION--
MAYBE LATINO, MAYBE MIDDLE EASTERN
BUT HE DIDN'T HAVE AN ACCENT AS FAR AS I REMEMBER
AND... I DON'T KNOW.
I'M JUST AFRAID THAT WHAT I DO REMEMBER
I JUST DON'T WANT TO BE OF NO HELP TO THEM.
WELL, MAYBE TALKING TO HIM SCARED HIM OFF.
C.T. CONFIRMED A SMALL SPLENIC LACERATION.
ROMANO WANTS TO DO AN EX-LAP.
HE'S GOING TO OPERATE?
NOT THAT AN OPERATION IS GOING TO MEAN
MUCH TO MISS HELLER
BUT ACCORDING TO ROBERT
SHE'S A LIABILITY NIGHTMARE.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
I THINK IT'S BETTER THAN DOING NOTHING.
POOR WOMAN GOT PUSHED DOWN AN ESCALATOR.
IT WASN'T INTENTIONAL.
NOW YOU WANT HER TO SIT HERE
WHILE I GO GET MY STINKING BADGE?
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO WEAR YOUR I.D. AT ALL TIMES.
SINCE WHEN DOES THE CHICAGO P.D. CARE?
OFFICER, I CAN VOUCH FOR HIM.
THANK YOU. WHAT'S THE DEAL?
YOU'D THINK I WAS A FELON.
IS THIS MARK GREENE'S SCALP LAC? THAT'S ME.
C.T. GAVE THE GREEN LIGHT TO STITCH AWAY.
PUT HER IN THE SUTURE ROOM
AND WEAR YOUR I.D. HOW COME?
CARTER, I HEARD A TERRIBLE RUMOR.
OH, YEAH. APPARENTLY, A PATIENT GOT ASSAULTED...
YEAH. YEAH. THAT IS TRUE
BUT I WAS ASKING ABOUT ROXANNE.
DID YOU BREAK UP WITH HER?
WHO TOLD YOU THAT? SHE DID.
OH. YEAH, IT'S TRUE.
SO, SHE WON'T BE COMING AROUND ANYMORE.
MAN, CAN'T YOU THINK OF THE REST OF US?
OH, YOU LIKED HER?
WHAT'S NOT TO LIKE?
HEY, CARTER, CAN YOU COME?
MISS FARR IS A LITTLE ALTERED.
LUCY WANTS TO SEND HER FOR A HEAD C.T.
DOESN'T LUCY HAVE HER OWN PATIENT?
WHAT'S THIS ONE CALLED?
OH, SHOOT.
WHAT IS THAT?
IT'S RIGHT ON THE TIP OF MY TONGUE.
HEY, LUCY...
DID YOU GET THAT HIP X RAY RESULTS BACK
ON MRS. ARMSTRONG?
NO. IT'S NOT DONE YET
AND PSYCH IS ON THEIR WAY DOWN.
GOOD.
I AM A LITTLE WORRIED.
MISS FARR SEEMS A LITTLE BIT CONFUSED.
I'LL CHECK IT OUT.
WITH HER HISTORY, SHE SHOULD HAVE A HEAD C.T.
I'LL HANDLE IT.
I'LL SEE YOU LATER, MISS FARR.
SEX.
WHAT?
THAT'S THE NAME OF THE SCENT--
"PHER SEX."
SO YOUR HEAD HURTS?
IT MIGHT BE STUFFY IN HERE.
MAYBE WE SHOULD PUT YOUR PERFUMES AWAY.
SOME OF THEM ARE A LITTLE... STRONG.
YOU HAVE A VERY SLENDER NOSE.
DO I?
IT MAKES COMMON SENSE--
THE SIZE OF THE V.N.O. WOULD CORRESPOND
TO THE SIZE OF THE NASAL CAVITY.
V.N.O.? VOMERONASAL ORGAN--
THE STRUCTURE THAT PICKS UP SUBTLE MESSAGES
FROM OTHER PEOPLE'S GLANDS.
DO YOU FIND YOURSELF AFFECTED
BY THE OPPOSITE SEX?
OH, I'D SAY, I, UH...
I NOTICE THEM.
WHAT ABOUT YOUR ABILITY TO BOND?
FOLLOW MY FINGER.
MMM.
ARE YOU EXPERIENCING ANY WEAKNESS
OR NUMBNESS, MISS FARR?
SEE, PEOPLE WITH DEFICIENT V.N.O.s
OFTEN HAVE, UH, TROUBLE
SORT OF APPRECIATING OXYTOCIN
WHICH IS THE HORMONE
THAT PROVOKES DEEP INIMACY...
INTA... INTIM... INTIMACY.
LYDIA, I THINK WE SHOULD SET MISS FARR UP
WITH A HEAD C.T.
DR. CARTER? MM-HMM.
WERE YOU BREAST-FED?
SO, I HEARD I MISSED ANOTHER TRAUMA.
TRAGIC CASE, ACTUALLY.
IS ROMANO DOING THE EX-LAP?
IT'S PERFECTLY ROUTINE.
YOU NEEDN'T JOIN US IF YOU'RE BUSY.
YEAH, WELL, HE'LL NEED AN ASSIST.
WE BOTH KNOW I CAN HANDLE THAT.
ELIZABETH, YOU'RE AN INTERN.
STOP SEEING EVERY MOVE I MAKE
AS A COMPETITION, OKAY?
RIGHT.
THE WAY I SEE IT, IT LOOKS AS THOUGH
YOU'RE GOING FOR THE TRAUMA FELLOWSHIP FULL BORE.
I HAVEN'T MADE UP MY MIND YET.
MY, MY, HOW MANY SURGICAL HEAVYWEIGHTS DOES IT TAKE
TO SCREW IN A LIGHT BULB?
IT DEPENDS ON WHAT'S AT STAKE, I GUESS.
AH, THERE YOU ARE.
I HEARD YOU WERE ZONKED OUT
I CLOSED MY EYES FOR TWO MINUTES.
I WAS ON A BREAK. OKAY.
I'M ENTITLED TO A BREAK--
15 MINUTES, EVERY FOUR HOURS.
I KNOW. I'VE JUST NEVER SEEN YOU TAKE ONE.
WELL, I'M GOING TO START.
I NEED TO FAX THIS.
BE MY GUEST.
OR YOU WANT ME TO, UH...
OH, UH, NO, THANKS. IT'S KIND OF PERSONAL.
I'LL DO IT MYSELF, IF THAT'S OKAY.
DO I LOOK LIKE KERRY WEAVER?
( thunder crashing )
AAH. IT LOOKS LIKE WE'RE OUT AGAIN.
UH-OH.
Romano: DAMN. I WISH I HADN'T JUST MADE THAT INCISION.
Corday: IT'S OKAY. I CAN SEE ENOUGH TO SUCTION.
THE AUXILIARY POWER WILL KICK IN.
( thunder crashing )
DON'T WORRY, MISS FARR.
WE KEEP FLASHLIGHTS BY ALL THE...
WHOA!
AAH!
UH-OH.
WHAT DID I SPILL?
DAMN IT.
AUXILIARY POWER
IS ONLINE.
COME ON... DAMN IT.
DAMN IT.
CAROL, I NEED YOU ON TASK.
HIT EVERY ROOM.
MAKE SURE ALL VENTS AND PUMPS
ARE IN REDUNDANT PLUGS.
YEP. I KNOW. I'M COMING.
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?
DO YOU HAVE ANY BATTERIES?
LEAVE IT FOR THE COPS TO BE PREPARED.
IS THIS ALL THE LIGHT WE'RE GOING TO GET?
LIGHTING IS NOT PRIORITY USE. CAROL?!
JERRY, COULD YOU GET MY LETTER OUT?
I'LL DO MY BEST.
OKAY. WE'RE GOING TO FOLLOW THE PLAN.
CRITICAL EQUIPMENT FIRST, PATIENT CONCERNS SECOND.
I WISH IT WEREN'T GETTING DARK.
WHAT ABOUT THE RAPIST?
STILL MISSING. OH, NO.
LOOK, EVERYONE PLEASE CALM DOWN.
EVERYTHING IS UNDER CONTROL.
Hathaway: DON'T WORRY, MR. HASKINS.
BUT OUR BACKUP GENERATORS WILL SUPPLY POWER TO THE VENTILATOR
AS WELL AS TO THE PUMPS THAT DELIVERS YOUR MEDS, OKAY?
Armstrong: WE NEED SOME LIGHT OVER HERE!
I THINK LUCY'S GETTING A FLASHLIGHT.
THERE WE GO!
THE RED PLUGS ARE FOR PRIORITY MEDICAL USE.
WHY?
WE NEED TO CONSERVE OUR AUXILIARY POWER.
CAROL, DR. GREENE'S LOOKING FOR YOU.
THE I.C.U. WANTS TO SEND DOWN SIX CRITICALS.
APPARENTLY, THEY HAVE THIS NEW BACKUP GENERATOR
THAT NEVER CAME ON.
OH, BOY. HERE.
UM, MR. ARMSTRONG...
THIS IS DR. MYERS FROM PSYCH
AND HE JUST WANTED TO TALK TO YOU IN ANOTHER ROOM
FOR A FEW MINUTES
IF THAT'S OKAY.
EVERYONE IS WELCOME TO STAY
BUT UNTIL CITY POWER IS RESTORED
WE WON'T BE STARTING ANY NONCRITICAL CASES.
WHAT? OH, COME ON!
TRY 670. I'M TELLING YOU.
Man on radio: ...four mile radius south of the loop.
C.T.A. is reporting interruption of rapid transit.
OUTSIDE LINES DON'T WORK.
IT'S HARDWIRED TO THE I.C.U., ISN'T IT?
WE CAN'T POSSIBLY TAKE SIX MORE CRITICALS.
THAT'S WHY I'M TRYING TO OFFER THE I.C.U.
FOUR OF OUR LIFE PAKS INSTEAD.
THAT'LL ONLY GIVE US TWO LIFE PAKS.
OFFICER, CAN YOU GET RADIO CONTACT
WITH THE I.C.U. ON THE SEVENTH FLOOR?
I CAN. BEAT THREE TO 740. ( alarm sounding )
WHAT'S THAT NOISE? SOUNDS LIKE A LOW BATTERY.
I'LL FIND OUT. THANK YOU.
WHOA, CARTER, CARTER...
SORRY, CAROL. SLOW DOWN.
SORRY. WHAT'S THAT SMELL?
Corday: NO RETROPERITONEAL BLEEDING.
THE LIVER, DUODENUM AND PANCREAS LOOK OKAY.
THIS ISN'T SO BAD.
MAKES YOU HOPEFUL ABOUT Y2K.
DR. BENTON, IT'S OUT EVERYWHERE IN THE BUILDING.
DID YOU TRY CALLING?
COULDN'T GET THROUGH.
GO CHECK ON THE LITTLE NIPPER, PETER.
IT'S REESE, YOU KNOW.
HE HAS THIS THING ABOUT THE DARK.
IT IS JUST A SPLEEN.
SHIRLEY, DO YOU HAVE AN EXTRA FLASHLIGHT?
WE'LL FIX YOU UP.
THIS IS BULL.
BELIEVE ME, WE WOULD LOVE TO LET YOU OUT, OKAY.
I GOT THE CODE HERE.
THAT IT?
NADA.
I DON'T THINK THE KEYPAD'S GETTING ANY JUICE.
FINE. I'LL SMOKE IN HERE.
JERRY, WALK THAT GUY OUT THE EMPLOYEE ENTRANCE
AND CALL ENGINEERING AND GET THEM DOWN HERE.
YOU NEED AN HOUR TO GET A PROTIME?
I-I CAN'T WAIT THAT LONG.
WHAT? DID AN ANIMAL DIE AROUND HERE?
ANYONE SEE WHERE PSYCH TOOK MR. ARMSTRONG?
LOOK, C.T. IS DOWN.
THIS WOMAN HAS A HISTORY OF EMBOLIC C.V.A.s
AND NOW SHE'S ALTERED.
MISS FARR IS WORSE?
WHO IS MISS FARR?
I KNEW SHE NEEDED A C.T.
UH-OH.
AREN'T WE CLOSED TO INTERNAL DISASTER?
MAYBE THEY DIDN'T GET THE NEWS.
JUST GET IT DONE.
HEY, WHAT'S WITH THE DOORS?
I THINK THE GENERATOR'S ON A MAGNETIC LOCK
AND THE KEYPAD WHICH RELEASES THE DOOR
IS ON NONESSENTIAL POWER.
Knight: WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
Greene: MEANS WE'RE SCREWED.
YEAH. WE'RE TRYING TO. DO YOU HAVE
ANYTHING ON THE TRUCK TO PRY OPEN THE DOORS?
I'LL CHECK.
WE'VE GOT A 33-YEAR-OLD CHICAGO ED REPAIRMAN DOWN.
CAN YOU HEAR ME?
YEAH, YEAH. GO ON.
A POSSIBLE ELECTROCUTION
IN A 15-FOOT FALL.
HE WAS FOUND UNCONSCIOUS
BY HIS COWORKERS AT THE FOOT
OF A POWER POLE.
FREQUENT P.V.C.s IN THE FIELD.
NORMAL SINUS NOW.
HERE, LET ME TRY.
HE MAY HAVE BEEN
STRUCK BY LIGHTNING.
HIS COWORKER SAID IT HIT PRETTY CLOSE.
OKAY, PEOPLE.
THROUGH THE WINDOW. THROUGH THE WHAT?!
THROUGH THE WINDOW.
WE'RE GOING TO NEED YOU TO GET UP
AND MOVE TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HALL.
LET'S GET ALL THESE CHAIRS OUT OF HERE.
EVERYTHING'S GOT TO GO.
ERIC, GIVE ME A HAND.
CAN WE GET THIS WINDOW OFF?
LET'S TRY LIFTING IT.
CAN'T WE JUST SMASH IT?
IT COMES OUT. THERE WE GO.
THE WHOLE THING?
NO. JUST THE BACKBOARD.
WE NEED A GURNEY IN HERE.
BRING IT IN LENGTHWISE.
HEAVE HO!
EVERYBODY, GRAB A HOLD.
Carter: EASY, EASY.
OKAY, YOU GUYS LET GO.
HOW YOU DOING THERE?
( groans )
YEP. WELCOME TO COUNTY GENERAL.
MORALES...
GET ON THE RADIO TO DISPATCH
AND TELL THEM THAT WE ARE OFFICIALLY CLOSED TO TRAUMA.
GOT IT.
CARTER, SHE'S CRASHING. MISS FARR.
OH, NO!
GET ON IT, BOTH OF YOU!
JERRY, PAGE BENTON.
REESE.
REESE.
REESE, WHERE ARE YOU?
HEY, IT'S DADDY.
( child whimpers )
HEY.
HEY, MAN.
( whimpers again )
WHAT YOU DOING?
HUH?
WHAT YOU DOING?
( moans )
WHAT IS THAT?
YOU LOOKING AT THE STARS?
IS THIS FUN?
( pager beeping )
PENNY FOR YOUR THOUGHTS.
I HESITATE TO SAY.
WE'RE READY TO CLOSE.
4-0 VICRYL, PLEASE.
I WAS JUST THINKING.
MISS HELLER'S BODY'S BEEN THROUGH QUITE ENOUGH.
AN ACCIDENT, A COMA, A BRUTAL ATTACK...
THE KINDEST THING MIGHT BE TO LET HER GO IN PEACE.
OF COURSE WE CAN'T.
CAREFUL WHAT YOU ASK FOR.
SHE'S BRADYING DOWN.
OH, DON'T TELL ME THAT.
Hathaway: E.K.G. LOOKS GOOD.
LOOKS LIKE A LIGHTNING STRIKE.
I DON'T KNOW. I WAS UP THE POLE.
THAT'S ALL I REMEMBER.
YEAH. FLASHOVER EFFECT.
I WANT TO KEEP THAT SHIRT.
IT'S ALL YOURS.
FULL THICKNESS BURNS TO THE LEGS.
ALL RIGHT, WHAT DO WE GOT?
Hathaway: WHAT HAVE YOU GOT?
HI, REESE.
MR. JOINER TOOK A HIT OF LIGHTNING.
FELL 15 FEET.
NO GUARDING OR TENDERNESS.
LET'S PREP FOR A LAVAGE. LET'S MOVE.
THANK YOU. HANG ON, MAN.
WHY ARE YOU DOING A NASO TRACH?
WE WON'T HAVE TO PARALYZE HER.
ALL RIGHT.
I'M IN. GO AHEAD.
BAG HER.
GOOD JOB.
WITHOUT A C.T.
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT TO DO NEXT.
WELL, DON'T YOU THINK SHE THREW A CLOT?
MAYBE, IF SHE'S INADEQUATELY ANTICOAGULATED.
SO, SHE NEEDS HEPARIN TO THIN HER BLOOD
AND TO PREVENT FURTHER CLOTTING?
UNLESS SHE'S OVER-ANTICOAGULATED
AND BLEEDING IN HER BRAIN.
THEN SHE NEEDS VITAMIN K AND F.F.P.
HEPARIN WOULD KILL HER.
OKAY, GOOD BREATH SOUNDS.
THAT'S WHY YOU NEEDED A PROTIME.
BINGO.
IS AN A.C. OF 14 OKAY ON THE VENT?
OH, NEVER MIND. WE'RE DEAD.
GOT IT. I'LL BAG HER.
WHAT THE HELL?!
OH, WE'VE JUST LOST BACKUP.
THIS IS STILL ON FROM BATTERY.
OH, GOD. ALL THE PATIENTS ON VENTS
WILL TO HAVE TO BE BAGGED.
GO. GET THEM STARTED.
I LOST MY MONITORS FOR A 62 YEAR-OLD.
HISTORY OF C.V.A. AND HEART DISEASE.
AUXILIARY POWER HAS CUT OUT.
WHERE'S THE LIFE PAKS?
WE GAVE THE EXTRAS TO I.C.U.
GO. I'LL TAKE CARE OF THIS.
PETER, WHAT DO YOU THINK?
THIS GUY'S STABLE. SHE CAN TAKE THAT ONE.
THANK YOU, GENTLEMEN.
SO WHAT HAPPENED
I THOUGHT IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE FOOLPROOF.
APPARENTLY NOT. CONNIE, TAKE REESE.
SURE. JERRY CAN LOOK AFTER HIM.
MARK, CARTER NEEDS YOU.
OKAY, GO, MARK.
I GOT THIS ONE.
GO. GO.
OKAY.
Corday: ANOTHER UNIT IN.
STILL NO PRESSURE.
DAMN IT. DAMN IT.
I CAN'T THINK WITHOUT THE ALARMS BLARING.
TRY PHENYLEPHEDRINE?
WAIT.
THE NECK VEINS ARE DISTENDED.
NO PULSE IN THE AORTA.
TAMPONADE? EXACTLY.
60cc SYRINGE, 18-GAUGE NEEDLE.
GOING IN BLIND?
YEAH.
OKAY. RETRACT THE LEFT LOBE OF THE LIVER.
GOT IT.
THIS IS LIVING, HUH?
PERICARDIOCENTESIS WITHOUT ELECTRONIC MONITOR.
CAREFUL YOU DON'T PUNCTURE THE VENTRICLE.
THANKS, ROBERT. GOT IT.
GIVE ME A MINUTE TO CHECK THE PRESSURE.
I THINK IT'S COMING UP.
HO HUM.
ALL IN A DAY'S WORK.
SO BASICALLY, WE'RE BONED.
THE WRONG TREATMENT COULD KILL HER.
MISS FARR, DON'T WORRY.
WE'RE HERE WITH YOU.
OUR HANDS ARE TIED WITHOUT THE C.T.
WATCH HER CHEST EXPANSION.
I AM.
WHOLE BLOOD CLOTTING TIME.
WHAT?
SOMETHING FROM THE DARK AGES.
LYDIA, YOU DON'T HAVE AN EXTRA RED TOP ON YOU?
OF HER BLOOD? YEAH.
I ALWAYS HOLD ONE.
HOW LONG AGO DID YOU DRAW IT?
UH, ABOUT 45 MINUTES AGO.
OKAY.
YEAH. NO SIGNS OF CLOTTING.
I'M GOING TO SAY SHE'S OVER-ANTICOAGULATED.
SO WE JUST TREAT HER?
NO. WE DO AN L.P. FIRST.
MISS KNIGHT?
DO YOU HAVE A MINUTE?
YEAH.
I'LL TAKE OVER.
GOOD NEWS. LAVAGE IS NEGATIVE.
HE COULD HAVE RUPTURED HIS BLADDER OR KIDNEYS.
NO C.T. YOU WANT TO DO AN EX-LAP?
WHAT, AND CARRY HIM UP?
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GET A SPECIMEN CUP
AND SET UP A MICROSCOPE.
UH-OH. I'VE LOST HIS PULSE.
WHAT?
HE'S IN V-TACH.
OH, DAMN. MOVE.
LET'S GET THE DEFIBRILLATOR BACK!
CAROL, WHERE'S HALEH'S PATIENT?
OH, EXAM ONE.
YOU OKAY IN HERE?
FINE.
GET AWAY FROM HER.
WHAT THE HELL...?
STEP BACK. SECURITY!
HEY, RELAX!
WHO ARE YOU?
I'M TOM FRAWLEY. I'M AN R.N. AT MERCY
BUT I LIVE DOWN THE BLOCK.
YEAH. I CAME IN TO HELP WITH THE POWER OUTAGE.
THEY TOLD ME TO IRRIGATE HER SCALP LAC.
HE'S DOING A REAL NICE JOB.
OKAY, I'M... I'M SORRY.
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU.
IT'S OKAY.
Myers: IT WAS A GOOD PICK-UP ON MR. ARMSTRONG.
I'VE GOT HIM ON ATIVAN.
HE SEEMED PRETTY DEPRESSED.
WORSE THAN THAT.
HE'S HAVING SUICIDAL IDEATION.
REALLY?
HAPPENS MORE THAN PEOPLE KNOW.
A LOT OF THOUGHTS OF PULLING THE TRIGGER.
HE'S DEFINITELY A DANGER TO HIMSELF.
WHAT ABOUT OTHERS?
Haleh: I NEED THAT!
I'LL BRING IT BACK AS SOON AS I CAN.
STILL NO PULSE!
I'LL HOOK UP THE LEADS.
DON'T BOTHER.
I'LL TAKE A QUICK LOOK.
AH, HE'S IN FIB!
LET'S SHOCK HIM AT 200.
SET! CLEAR!
DAMN IT! 300!
CLEAR!
375! CLEAR! IT'S NOT CHARGED.
Benton: WE'LL BE LUCKY IF THERE'S A CHARGE LEFT.
COME ON, COME ON.
SET!
CLEAR!
PUSH LIDOCAINE TO 100; KEEP AN EYE ON HIM.
WHERE'S THE MICROSCOPE?
HOW AM I DOING HERE?
Knight: GREAT.
MAYBE I'LL TAKE THE M-CATS.
SUCH A LONG WAY DOWN...
I KNOW, DOTTIE.
YOU SAID YOU HEARD A BANG WHEN YOU WALKED UP TO THE DOOR?
AND YOU COULD HEAR DOTTIE FALL DOWN THE BACK STOOP
EVEN WITHOUT YOUR HEARING AID?
WELL, I HEARD A BANG.
CAN YOU SEE OKAY?
YES.
THAT BEDSORE'S A BAD ONE, ISN'T IT?
IT'S NOT A BEDSORE.
Hathaway: KERRY?
YEP. ANYONE WANT FRIED CHICKEN?
OH, MY GOD, YOU READ MY MIND.
HEY, WHO FIXED THE DOORS?
THEY POPPED OPEN WHEN WE LOST THE GENERATORS.
YOU LOST A GENERATOR?
THAT'S SCARY. HEY, REESE.
YEAH, IT IS SCARY.
OUR BATTERY PACKS ARE ONLY GUARANTEED FOR 45.
YEAH, EVERYTHING IN MY FREEZER WAS GOING TO MUSH.
IT WAS COOK IT OR LOSE IT.
YOU MADE THIS?
YEP, ALWAYS COOK WITH GAS.
SO, WHAT CAN I DO?
WELL, I'VE ALREADY CHECKED ALL THE EXAM BEDS.
SEE IF BENTON NEEDS HELP IN TRAUMA ONE.
KERRY, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
YOU'RE WELCOME.
SO GOOD. MM-HMM.
Greene: PREPPED WITH THE VITAMIN K?
Carter: AND MANNITOL IN CASE SHE HERNIATES.
DON'T WORRY, CARTER, I'M USING A 22-GAUGE NEEDLE.
YOU HOLDING UP, LYDIA?
OH, YEAH, STRONG HANDS.
Greene: DON'T BE AFRAID TO LET CARTER KNOW
IF YOU NEED TO BE SPELLED.
GOOD.
LET'S GET THE F.F.P.
GIVE VITAMIN K, TEN MILLIGRAMS--
SLOW I.V. PUSH.
HOW ARE THE PUPILS, CARTER?
EQUAL AND REACTIVE.
THANKS FOR THE BACKUP.
AND HE ZAPS THE GUY BACK WITH ONE SHOT TO SPARE.
THEN HE'S STICKING A SLIDE OF URINE
UNDER THE MICROSCOPE.
AND IT'S BRIGHT RED.
HE'S TELLING US IT'S NOT BLOOD.
RHABDOMYOLYSIS, HUH?
THE GUY WAS BREAKING DOWN MUSCLE
PROBABLY FROM THE LIGHTNING AND TRAUMA.
JUST NEEDED TO GET FLUIDS ON BOARD.
SOUNDS LIKE YOU DIDN'T NEED ME AT ALL.
DIDN'T YOU SAY SOMETHING ABOUT SOME CHICKEN?
WELL-DONE, DR. CORDAY.
THANK YOU.
I'D BE REMISS IF I DIDN'T SAY THIS
ESPECIALLY AFTER TODAY.
YOU ARE AN EXCEPTIONAL SURGEON.
IT WOULD BE TRAGIC FOR YOU
TO WASTE YOUR TIME ON SOME TRAUMA FELLOWSHIP.
LET ME FINISH.
NOW...
I'M AWARE THAT YOU DON'T RELISH WORKING WITH ME.
I'M IN YOUR FACE-- I CAN'T RESIST.
BUT, KNOW THIS...
I WOULD DO ANYTHING IN MY POWER TO HAVE YOU STAY IN SURGERY.
INCLUDING MAKING MYSELF AS SCARCE AS POSSIBLE.
I APPRECIATE THAT.
THINK ABOUT IT.
I'LL TAKE OVER.
THE COPS WANT TO SEE YOU.
THE FACILITY ENGINEERS
FOUND HIM IN THE SWITCH ROOM.
HE HUNG HIMSELF.
IS THAT THE GUY?
YEAH, THAT'S HIM.
( all cheer )
LET'S GET EVERYBODY BACK ON VENT.
AND REBOOT ALL MONITORS. YOU GOT IT.
THIS PLACE IS A MESS.
C.T.'s HOLDING A TABLE
IF YOU CAN GET HER THERE IN TWO MINUTES.
HOW ARE YOU DOING, MRS. FARR?
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THAT OUT WHEN YOU COME BACK.
DON'T WORRY, I WAS VERY CAREFUL WITH YOUR V.N.O.
SO, CARTER, I NEED TO ASK YOU--
WHAT WAS GOING IN THERE?
I WAS WORRIED THAT SHE'D HERNIATE.
NO, NO, I MEAN BETWEEN YOU AND ME.
I WAS GETTING THIS WEIRD ENERGY.
I MEAN, IT WAS ALMOST LIKE YOU WERE--
YOU WERE BEING TERRITORIAL...
OR ADMIRING ME...
I DON'T WANT TO SAY THAT YOU WERE FLIRTING
'CAUSE OBVIOUSLY YOU WEREN'T FLIRTING WITH ME.
OH, MAN, YOU KNOW, I SPILLED THOSE PHEROMONES ON ME.
LIKE, A WHOLE BOTTLE.
IS THAT WHAT I SMELL?
MAYBE THAT'S WHAT YOU WERE PICKING UP ON--
WOW, THAT'S PRETTY FAR-FETCHED.
I MEAN, I ADMIRED YOU
WHEN YOU WENT FOR THE L.P.
BUT, YOU KNOW, THAT WAS IT.
I BETTER GET THESE TO THE LAB.
GET HIM?
GOT HIM.
( chuckles )
TEN MONTHS AFTER I RETIRE, THEY WERE BOUGHT OUT.
OUR HEALTH PLAN'S KAPUT.
SHE CAN'T GET OUT OF BED.
I WROTE MY PENSION WRONG.
IF I GO FIRST, SHE GETS NOTHING.
I HAD TO TAKE CARE OF HER.
I KNOW.
BUT WHAT I DON'T KNOW ABOUT IS THE BULLET--
WHAT KIND IT WAS
AND WHETHER YOU WERE FIRING FROM ABOVE.
AND IN THAT CASE
IT MIGHT HAVE HIT HER BLADDER.
OR IF YOU WERE AIMING
DIRECTLY AT HER SPINE.
W-WELL...
IT-IT WAS A WALTHER AUTOMATIC.
I TOOK IT OFF A GERMAN OFFICER.
UH, THE...
TH-THE ARMY GAVE ME PAPERS FOR IT.
AT THE END OF THE WAR, PISTOLS WERE THE ONLY THING
THEY'D LET US G.I.'s KEEP.
I SEE.
GOD, WHAT A DAY. YEAH.
COM ED SAYS THERE WAS ARCING AT THE SUBSTATION.
ACCORDING TO FACILITIES
OUR BACK-UP GENERATOR SHUT DOWN
BECAUSE OF A FAILED BEARING IN THE FAN MOTOR
THAT COOLS THE SYSTEM.
OH, THAT MAKES IT ALL CLEAR.
I'LL ADMIT IT.
I'M NOT 100% COMFORTABLE IN THE DARK.
OH, I GUESS A CANDLELIT DINNER
WOULD NOT BE AN ENTICING OFFER?
I'M AFRAID NOT.
I'M HEADING HOME.
SOME ADVICE: I WOULDN'T DO THAT.
YEAH, RULE NUMBER ONE OF TRAUMA.
AFTER A DAY LIKE TODAY, YOU SHOULD SHIFT GEARS
NOT TAKE IT HOME WITH YOU.
SO WHAT DO YOU SUGGEST?
OKAY, JERRY, WE'RE OUT OF HERE.
OKAY. I HOPE YOU HAVE POWER AT HOME.
WE'LL BE FINE.
YOU LOOKING FOR THIS?
YEAH, THE TRANSMISSION DIDN'T GO THROUGH
AND I DIDN'T HAVE A NUMBER TO SEND IT AGAIN.
THAT'S OKAY, I'LL FAX IT LATER.
DID YOU READ IT?
NO, YOU SAID IT WAS PERSONAL.
Carter: SO THE NEIGHBOR INTERRUPTED A SUICIDE PACT?
NO, I WOULDN'T EXACTLY CALL IT THAT.
THE WIFE WASN'T IN ON IT.
MYERS SAID IT'S NOT UNHEARD OF--
DEPRESSION OVER AGING, LOSS OF CONTROL
A DOWNWARD SPIRAL.
HOW LONG WERE THEY MARRIED?
54 YEARS.
IT MAKES YOU WONDER IF SOMETHING WAS MISSING.
HMM?
OH, I'M NOT THE ONE TO ASK
WHAT MAKES A LASTING RELATIONSHIP.
OH?
NEVER HAD A LASTING RELATIONSHIP.
NOT THAT I DON'T WANT TO
FIND THAT SOMEONE.
YOUR PARENTS STAYED TOGETHER BUT THEY COMPLETELY SHUT YOU OUT
AND LIVED LIKE CHILDLESS JET-SETTERS
AND THEY MADE MARRIAGE
A COMPLETE MYSTERY TO YOU.
( chuckling ): NO.
MY PROBLEM, ON THE OTHER HAND, IS THAT
I WAS RAISED BY SUCH A CAPABLE, SELF-SUFFICIENT SINGLE MOM
IT'S HARD FOR ME TO SEE THE NEED FOR A PARTNER AT ALL.
HOW LONG WAS THAT PSYCH ROTATION?
( loud techno-rock playing )
GO, GO, GO, GO.
( screaming )
GOOD, GOOD.
GO, GO; HANG IN THERE.
THAT'S THE HARD PART.
YOU JUST GOT TO WATCH OUT.
YOU SHOULD HAVE A GO.
AFTER A FALL LIKE THAT...
I'D BE IN TRACTION FOR THE REST OF THE SEASON.
NO, NO, YOU GOT TO GET
BACK UP ON YOUR SKIS, ON THE SLOPES.
OKAY, I CAN DO THIS.
YOU CAN DO ANYTHING.
Computer voice: Three, two, one.
OKAY, AND GO.
GOD BLESS ELECTRICITY.
GO, GO, GO.
( all groaning )
Corday: WHY DID I BRING THAT UP?
Greene: JUST GIVE IT A MINUTE.
