PREVIOUSLY ON E.R.:
CARTER!
I THINK I DISLOCATED MY SHOULDER.
HOW DO YOU THINK YOU CAN IMPROVE OUR DEPARTMENT?
RIGHT AWAY, YOU COULD BENEFIT
FROM AN EIGHT-BED OBSERVATION UNIT.
IF SHE'S AS IMPRESSIVE IN THE ROOM
SHE MIGHT BE OUR NEXT CHIEF.
DR. CORDAY, YOU GAVE HIM 50%.
MY GOD, YOU'RE RIGHT!
I'VE GIVEN HIM A LETHAL DOSE!
HE'S BRADYING DOWN. HURRY!
THE COCHLEAR IMPLANT IS NOTHING SHORT OF A MIRACLE.
YOU BRING IN YOUR SON
AND WE'LL SEE IF HE'S A CANDIDATE.
ELIZABETH, DON'T FEEL A NEED
TO SOLICIT MEDICAL ADVICE ON MY BEHALF, ALL RIGHT?
I'VE WORKED WITH KOTLOWITZ BEFORE.
THAT'S WHY I BROUGHT IT UP.
IF YOU'D RATHER I HADN'T...
I'D RATHER YOU HADN'T.
( slurred ): * 100 BOTTLES OF BEER ON THE WALL *
* 100 BOTTLES OF BEER
* TAKE ONE DOWN, PASS IT AROUND *
I'VE NEVER HEARD ANYONE GO ON THIS LONG.
SEEMS LIKE FOREVER.
HE CAN'T EVEN COUNT.
HE NEVER DROPS TO 99 OR 98
JUST BACK TO 100.
YOU DON'T MIND THAT HE'S LOUD AND SMELLS BAD--
JUST THAT HE CAN'T SING RIGHT.
* ...TAKE ONE DOWN, PASS IT AROUND... *
( Lydia singing along )
IT'S CATCHY.
WHO'S ON?
GENERAL LEE, BUT SHE'S IN A MEETING WITH ANSPAUGH.
I HOPE YOU'RE NOT CALLING HER THAT TO HER FACE.
OUR NEW CHIEF OF EMERGENCY SERVICES?
WOULD I DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT?
NEED TO POP THIS GUY SOME ATIVAN TO PUT HIM OUT OF OUR MISERY.
I BELIEVE THERE'S SOMEONE ASLEEP IN THE ON-CALL ROOM.
WAKE HIM UP! WAKE HIM UP!
I CAN'T LEAVE THE DESK.
THEN FIND SOMEBODY WHO CAN WAKE HIM UP.
WE GOT WORK TO DO.
* ...100 BOTTLES OF BEER ON THE WALL... *
MARK? TIME TO GET UP.
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.
MARK, LET'S GO. IT'S 7:00.
I'M UP. I'M UP.
HEY, MARK, I DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO THROW COLD WATER ON YOU.
OH, DOUG, IS THAT YOU?
( air horn blasting )
( groaning )
* ...100 BOTTLES OF BEER ON THE WALL *
* 100 BOTTLES...
99, YOU IDIOT.
TWO MIGS OF ATIVAN
AND THIS GUY'S OUT COLDER THAN THE TOP OF K2.
SORRY WE HAD TO WAKE YOU.
OH, I'M NOT.
TEN MORE MINUTES, AND MY SHIFT IS OVER.
I WOULD'VE SLEPT RIGHT THROUGH GETTING OFF DUTY.
SWEET DREAMS, BOTTLE MAN.
* ...100 BOTTLES OF BEER ON THE WALL... *
HEY. YOU ABOUT READY?
I'M ABOUT DEAF.
WASN'T REALLY NECESSARY, DOUG.
WELL, I KNOW, BUT I DO IT TO CAROL EVERY MORNING.
THERE'S FRESH COFFEE ON THE STOVE
TOAST ON THE COUNTER.
THANKS FOR LETTING ME STAY AN EXTRA NIGHT.
WELL, WE'RE GOING TO MISS YOU EVENTUALLY.
WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT ASBESTOS
WOULD TAKE SO LONG TO GET OUT OF AN APARTMENT BUILDING?
PROBABLY THE ASBESTOS GUYS
BUT, YOU KNOW, WHO'S COUNTING?
UH, LISTEN, IT'S JUST GOING TO BE, UH, YOU KNOW, A FEW DAYS
UH, EARLY NEXT WEEK-- SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
DO WE HAVE ANY HALF AND HALF?
YEAH, TOP SHELF TO THE LEFT.
HE DIDN'T MENTION ANYTHING ABOUT HIS DATE LAST NIGHT.
WELL, DOUG, THAT'S BECAUSE IT'S NONE OF OUR BUSINESS.
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO ASK?
NO. AND NEITHER ARE YOU, RIGHT?
HEY, NO.
RIGHT?
( groggily ): * ...100 BOTTLES OF BEER ON THE WALL *
* 100 BOTTLES OF...
THIS BOY'S A REAL ANNOYANCE.
HE'S A MENACE.
HE'S A MACHINE.
AND WITH FOUR MORE MIGS OF ATIVAN
HE IS OFFICIALLY CHICAGO IN JANUARY.
I'M OUT OF HERE.
NEED ANYTHING MORE, CALL SOMEBODY ELSE.
CALL SOMEONE ELSE. CALL SOMEONE ELSE.
Weaver: CARTER? I AM NOT
YOUR MOTHER.
NOW, FOR THE LAST TIME, GET UP.
( groaning )
WHY DOES SHE HAVE TO DO THAT?
YOU SET THE ALARM, DIDN'T YOU?
ROXANNE?
Weaver: CARTER!
UH, YEAH, I'M UP.
THANK YOU.
DATE? IT WASN'T A DATE.
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
YOU WENT OUT WITH HER, RIGHT?
WE HAD DINNER.
SHE STARTED TWO DAYS AGO.
I WAS JUST, YOU KNOW, BEING NICE.
THIS WAS LIKE A MERCY DATE?
OF COURSE NOT.
IT WAS LIKE AN INTRODUCTION, THAT'S ALL.
ORIENTATION.
EXACTLY. THANK YOU, CAROL.
DATE.
IT'S JUST THAT WE DIDN'T GO TO BED TOGETHER.
I KNOW, I KNOW, BUT I WAS UP LATE
HELPING KERRY WITH HER PORTFOLIO.
I'M SORRY. HEY, OW!
I JUST WOULD PREFER IF YOU WOULD WAKE ME UP.
YOU REALLY WANT TO GET UP EARLY TO CHECK THE NIKKEI?
SORRY. MY BATTERY'S DEAD.
NO, I'M SORRY.
MY CAR IS DEAD.
WE COULD JUST HOOF IT TO THE EL.
WHAT WOULD YOU THINK
OF DECREASING MY POSITION IN SMALL CAPS BY SEVEN PERCENT
AND PUTTING IT INTO VALUE?
GREAT, BUT I STILL THINK
YOU NEED TO PULL BACK YOUR INTERNATIONAL EQUITIES.
I DON'T WANT EMERGING MARKETS.
NO, BUT I THINK YOU WANT SOME IN BONDS
AND SOME IN AN ABSOLUTE RETURN FUND
WITH A LOW CORRELATION TO THE EQUITY MARKET.
Lee: I GOT A CALL.
YOU NEED SOME HELP?
NO BOTHER. FALSE ALARM.
WE FIXED HIM UP.
JERRY HELPED, TOO.
OH, JERRY, THE...
DESK CLERK.
I THINK I'M SLOWLY GETTING EVERYONE'S NAME DOWN.
IT'S GREAT HOW THE NURSES HERE SOLVE PROBLEMS ON THEIR OWN.
NOW, HOW ARE YOU GETTING ALONG?
FEELING SETTLED IN?
YES, THANKS. EVERYONE'S BEEN REALLY HELPFUL.
OH, BY THE WAY, GOOD JOB ON THAT DRUNK.
( softly and slurred ): * ...100 BOTTLES OF BEER *
* TAKE ONE DOWN AND PASS IT AROUND... *
MARK? KERRY? DO YOU HAVE A MINUTE?
UH, SURE. OF COURSE.
FEELS LIKE SNOW TODAY, DOESN'T IT?
MAYBE.
MARK, THANKS AGAIN FOR DINNER LAST NIGHT.
YOU'RE WELCOME.
FILLING HER IN.
LAY OF THE LAND KIND OF THING.
JOHN, DO YOU HAVE A MINUTE?
SURE.
DON ANSPAUGH MENTIONED
IT'S THE 100th ANNIVERSARY OF THE HOSPITAL THIS WEEK.
YEAH, THERE'S SOME KIND OF BIG GALA DINNER SATURDAY NIGHT, RIGHT?
YES, AND A LITTLE PUBLICITY FOR A MRS. RUTH JOHNSON
BORN IN THIS HOSPITAL 100 YEARS AGO TODAY.
WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH THE E.R.?
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING
EXCEPT THAT MRS. JOHNSON AND HER FAMILY
ARE UPSTAIRS RIGHT NOW.
SOME MIX-UP ON THE TIME.
AND THE TRIB'S PHOTOGRAPHER
CAN'T GET HERE TILL THIS AFTERNOON.
DR. ANSPAUGH WOULD LIKE A SUITABLE TOUR GUIDE
TO KEEP THEM BUSY.
THEY SHOULD CALL WILLARD SCOTT.
I SUGGESTED YOU.
WHAT?
YEP. YOU'RE THE GUY.
YOU'RE FRIENDLY, YOU'RE KNOWLEDGEABLE
YOU KNOW YOUR WAY AROUND.
OH, I HAVE AN EXCELLENT MED STUDENT
MISS LUCY KNIGHT...
YES, BUT SHE'S WORKING WITH DR. ROSS TODAY.
NO, I CAN'T THINK OF A BETTER CHOICE.
I THINK MY COLLEAGUES HERE WOULD AGREE.
DR. GREENE, THEY NEED YOU IN RADIOLOGY.
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.
YOU COULD USE A LIGHT DAY, CARTER.
YEAH. YOU'RE NOT QUITE UP TO SPEED YET WITH YOUR SHOULDER, RIGHT?
I GUESS I'LL JUST FINISH THIS PAPERWORK.
THANKS. I APPRECIATE IT.
SHE'S GOT A BIG WIND-UP
THEN SHE JUST NAILS IT RIGHT OVER THE PLATE.
I CAN DEAL WITH THAT.
JIMMY'S GOT AN EARACHE
AND ERLENE'S GOT THIS FUNNY-LOOKING SORE
IN THE MIDDLE OF HER LIP.
WE'LL CHECK THEM OUT, MRS. LA BAHTRAY.
LUCY, WHY DON'T YOU START WITH JIMMY?
HEY, DOUG? WE'VE GOT AN EIGHT-YEAR-OLD COMING IN--
AUTO VERSUS BICYCLE.
OKAY, I'M WITH YOU.
LUCY, YOU GOT THIS UNDER CONTROL?
YEAH, NO PROBLEM.
GET AWAY FROM ME.
I DON'T LIKE THAT.
JIMMY, YOU STOP THAT NOW.
I'M NOT GOING TO HURT YOU, OKAY?
I DON'T WANT HER DOING THAT.
DO YOU WANT ME TO HOLD HIM DOWN?
THAT'S WHAT I USUALLY DO.
OH, NO, A NURSE WILL COME IN.
GET OFF ME, MA!
OKAY, WE'RE READY FOR YOU.
MA, GET OFF ME!
WILSON GEARY, EIGHT YEARS OLD.
HIT BY A CAR.
HE WAS CHASING US.
I DIDN'T SEE THE CAR.
WE'LL TAKE CARE OF YOU.
EVERYTHING'S GOING TO BE JUST FINE.
GOOD VITALS, NO L.O.C., COMPLAINS OF BELLY PAIN
POSSIBLE FRACTURE ON THE LEFT HAND.
GOT THAT BUCKLE?
ON MY COUNT.
ONE, TWO, THREE.
I DIDN'T SEE WHAT HAPPENED TO ANDY.
I JUST TRIED TO GET AWAY.
HE KEEPS TALKING ABOUT SOME GUY CHASING HIM AND HIS FRIEND.
B.P. 120/72, PULSE 94.
WE'RE GOING TO CUT YOUR CLOTHES
SO WE CAN SEE WHERE YOU'RE HURT, ALL RIGHT?
OKAY.
COPS ARE LOOKING FOR SOME OTHER KID
AND THEY'LL BE IN AFTER THAT.
Ross: THANK YOU, DORIS.
YOU REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED?
I WAS RIDING ACROSS THE PARK.
I GOT INTO THE STREET, AND THERE WAS A CAR.
I KNOW I'M SUPPOSED
TO LOOK BOTH WAYS, BUT I WAS TRYING TO GET AWAY.
GET AWAY FROM WHO?
THIS MAN. HE WAS CHASING ME AND ANDY.
GOOD BREATH SOUNDS.
TRACHEA MIDLINE.
PULSE OX IS 98.
TELL ME IF IT HURTS HERE.
NO.
HOW ABOUT HERE?
YES. THAT HURTS A LOT.
RIGHT UPPER QUADRANT TENDERNESS.
LET'S GET AN ABDOMINAL C.T. WITH CONTRAST.
HEMOGLOBIN IS 13.8.
OUCH!
WAS I TUGGING TOO HARD?
Jarvik: DOUG, GOT ANOTHER KID COMING IN.
EIGHT-YEAR-OLD, G.S.W.
TO THE ABDOMEN.
WHAT DID SHE SAY? IS THAT ANDY?
WHY DON'T YOU JUST HOLD STILL?
LET'S WORRY ABOUT YOU FIRST, OKAY?
NOW, DON'T MOVE YOUR HEAD.
YOU JUST HANG IN THERE.
YOU'RE DOING GREAT.
HEY.
HI.
UH, PRE-OP LABS ARE BACK
ON THE GALLBLADDER.
THE LAP CHOLE'S SCHEDULED FOR THIS AFTERNOON.
WE'RE STILL WAITING ON THE FILMS FOR THE ISCHEMIC BOWEL
AND THE AORTOBIFEMORAL BYPASS WENT SOUTH WITH PNEUMONIA
TEN DAYS POST-OP.
YEAH, I KNOW.
I SPOKE TO THE FAMILY.
UH...
WHAT'S THIS?

YEAH. PATIENT'S HEART RATE, BLOOD PRESSURE, PULSE OX
TIME OF MAGNESIUM INJECTION
CENTRAL LINE PLACED, PACEMAKER CAPTURED.
AFTER WITNESSING
YOUR M&M ON DR. SWANSON LAST YEAR
I THOUGHT IT BEST TO BE WELL-PREPARED.
YEAH, WELL, I DON'T THINK IT'S GOING TO GO LIKE THAT.
NEITHER DO I, BUT...
Woman: DR. BENTON.
DR. KOTLOWITZ WAS LOOKING FOR YOU.
THE SHIMAHARAS ARE HERE.
OH, DAMN.
OKAY, UM, I'LL BE RIGHT THERE, SHIRLEY.
KOTLOWITZ IS PUTTING A COCHLEAR IMPLANT
INTO A THREE-YEAR-OLD.
I GOT TO GO AND OBSERVE.
I'VE NEVER SEEN ONE.
YEAH, WELL, NEITHER HAVE I.
LISTEN, IF YOU NEED SOMEBODY
TO BOUNCE THAT STUFF OFF OF, I...
OH, PETER, PETER, GO.
I'M BUSY, AND YOU'VE GOT WORK TO DO AS WELL.
I'LL BE THERE, ELIZABETH.
I KNOW YOU WILL.
THANKS.
Weaver: ONE, TWO, THREE.
Olbes: SINGLE GUNSHOT WOUND TO THE ABDOMEN.
FOUND HIM PULSELESS AND APNEIC.
ASYSTOLE ON THE MONITOR.
TWO ROUNDS OF EPI AND ATROPINE GIVEN.
A LITER OF SALINE IN.
WHAT'S THE DOWN TIME?
ABOUT 30 MINUTES.
I TOLD THE COPS TO WAIT OUTSIDE.
THORACOTOMY TRAY.
O-NEG ON THE RAPID INFUSER.
I'LL DO A CUTDOWN.
LAST EPI?
FIVE MINUTES AGO.
GO WITH HIGH DOSE THREE MILLIGRAMS.
Olbes: DO YOU NEED ANYTHING ELSE?
NO, WE'VE GOT IT. COME ON.
HEY, PAM, DID YOU GET A NAME?
UNCONSCIOUS FROM THE GET-GO.
OKAY, THANKS.
EXCUSE ME, NURSE.
IS THAT THE KID HIT BY THE CAR-- WILSON GEARY?
I NEED TO TALK TO HIM.
WE'RE STILL WORKING ON HIM.
WHAT HAPPENED?
THE KID ON THE BIKE WAS PRETTY SHAKEN.
PARAMEDICS NO SOONER GOT HIM IN THE RIG
WHEN WE FOUND THE OTHER ONE IN THE PARK.
DID YOU GET A NAME?
YEAH. WE GOT THIS.
WE'VE CONTACTED HIS PARENTS.
AND WHAT ABOUT WILSON'S FAMILY?
WORKING ON IT.
THANKS.
SURE.
ANDY! ANDY!
HEY, LISTEN, YOU GOT
TO LOOK AT ME RIGHT NOW, OKAY?
WE GOT TO FIX YOU UP FIRST.
ALL RIGHT? OKAY.
DOING A THORACOTOMY.
ASYSTOLE? 30 MINUTES.
YOU GOT THIS?
YEP.
BE BACK IN A BIT, ALL RIGHT?
OKAY.
OKAY.
WHAT ARE THEY DOING?
THEY'RE TRYING TO HELP HIM.
ARE THEY CUTTING HIS CLOTHES OFF LIKE YOU DID TO ME?
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.
YOU READY TO GO FOR A RIDE?
WE'RE GOING TO ROLL YOU DOWN THE HALL
AND TAKE A PICTURE OF YOUR BELLY.
OKAY.
DR. ANSPAUGH'S NOT HERE.
SHIRLEY, THAT'S A LIE
'CAUSE I JUST CHECKED THE SCHEDULE.
HE DOESN'T WANT TO SEE YOU.
I JUST NEED A MINUTE.
IN THE MIDDLE OF A WHIPPLE?
HAVE YOU LOST YOUR MIND?
CARTER, BE A GOOD SOLDIER.
THEY'RE THATAWAY.
HI. I'M LOOKING FOR RUTH JOHNSON?
OH, UH, SAY, ARE YOU THE DOC?
I'VE GOT A MOLE RIGHT HERE BACK OF MY NECK...
EDGAR, STOP YOUR MOLE TALK!
I'M RUTH JOHNSON.
GILDA HERE HAD TO USE
THE BATHROOM
AND YOU KNOW HOW THE YOUNG ONES
LIKE SOMEONE TO TAKE THEM.
NANA, PLEASE.
HI. I'M GILDA BERNUCCI.
MARRIED AN ITALIAN.
I GUESS WE ALL KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS.
( laughing )
ARE YOU THE AMBASSADOR?
I GUESS SO.
AS YOU SEE, I DON'T NEED THAT THING
BUT, UH, IT SEEMS TO MAKE EVERYONE ELSE HAPPY.
OH. FEELS GOOD ANYWAY.
ARE YOU IN?
YEAH. JUST A MINUTE.
OKAY, THEN, LET'S TAKE A TOUR.
HEY, JERRY, CAN YOU PAGE DR. ROSS
WHEN THE FILMS GET BACK ON WILSON GEARY?
YOU GOT IT. THANKS.
EXCUSE ME AGAIN.
GUNSHOT KID-- ANDY STILES--
HIS PARENTS ARE HERE.
OKAY. I'M GOING TO GO GET DR. WEAVER.
ACTUALLY, IT'S HIS MOM AND HER BOYFRIEND.
PARENTS ARE DIVORCED.
WHAT ABOUT WILSON'S FAMILY?
IN DALLAS ON A BUSINESS TRIP.
I'M TRYING TO TRACK THEM DOWN.
HE WAS STAYING AT ANDY'S HOUSE.
THANKS FOR YOUR HELP.
SURE.
HEY, KERRY?
ANDY'S MOTHER IS WAITING IN CHAIRS.
OKAY. I'LL GO TALK TO HER IN A MINUTE.
MALIK? SHE MIGHT WANT TO COME BACK.
I'LL CLEAN HIM UP.
HOW'S THE OTHER BOY DOING?
I DON'T KNOW.
HE'S JUST BACK FROM C.T.
HAS ANYONE TALKED TO HIM YET?
THE FAMILY'S OUT OF TOWN.
WELL, IF DOUG'S BUSY, LET ME KNOW.
ALL RIGHT. THANKS.
HEY, WILSON.
HOW YOU DOING?
OKAY.
HEY, ANDY CAN HAVE THAT BED THERE.
UH-HUH.
HOW DID YOU LIKE THE C.T.?
IT WAS NO BIG DEAL.
I HAVE A LITTLE EXTRA TIME.
I THOUGHT MAYBE YOU AND I COULD TALK.
OKAY.
( laughing )
DON'T ASK.
I WON'T, BUT IT'S THE HIGHLIGHT OF MY DAY.
PERHAPS I SHOULD WAIT FOR ANOTHER ELEVATOR.
GOOD IDEA.
Man: LIZZIE...
I'M GLAD TO SEE YOU'RE IN SUCH GOOD SPIRITS ON THIS
YOUR DAY OF RECKONING.
OH, I'M SURE IT'LL BE FINE.
YOU KNOW YOU'LL HAVE ME ON YOUR SIDE.
I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS A MATTER OF SIDES--
SIMPLY AN EXAMINATION OF THE EVENT.
THAT'S JUST THE ATTITUDE TO GO IN WITH.
IN CASE WE DON'T SEE EACH OTHER BEFORE THE CONFERENCE, UH...
WELL...
BEST OF LUCK.
Ross: FRACTURE OF THE FOURTH
MID PHALANX.
I'LL PUT A FINGER SPLINT ON IT.
ANY WORD FROM THE PARENTS?
THEY'RE ON THEIR WAY FROM DALLAS.
I JUST DON'T KNOW WHEN.
BROKEN FINGER AND SOME ROAD RASH.
ALL THINGS CONSIDERED, THE KID'S LUCKY.
NOT REALLY.
Man: THAT'S PRETTY FUNNY, ISN'T IT?
KIND OF AMAZING REALLY.
HI. I'M CAROL HATHAWAY.
HI. DETECTIVE WILSON, CHICAGO P.D.
YOUNG WILSON HERE AND I WERE JUST LAUGHING ABOUT HOW
WE BOTH HAVE THE SAME NAME.
OH, THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN OFTEN.
IT'S NOT THE SAME; IT'S MY FIRST NAME.
RIGHT. LOOK, I NEED TO ASK YOU A FEW QUESTIONS, WILSON.
SHE DOESN'T HAVE TO LEAVE, DOES SHE?
NOPE. I'LL STAY RIGHT HERE.
I WOULD LIKE YOU TO TELL ME
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED IN THE PARK.
SOMEONE HURT YOUR FRIEND, ANDY, RIGHT?
SHE SAID ANDY WAS DEAD.
YEAH, WILSON, HE IS DEAD.
AND YOU SAW THE MAN
WHO WAS CHASING HIM?
CHASING YOU?
CAN YOU TELL ME IF HE WAS, UH, WHITE OR BLACK, LATINO
OR MAYBE, ASIAN?
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THOSE MEAN?
YEAH.
SO WHICH ONE WAS HE?
WILSON, DID YOU KNOW THIS MAN?
DID YOU RECOGNIZE HIM?
MAYBE YOU'VE SEEN HIM IN THE PARK BEFORE?
THE POLICE JUST WANT TO FIND THE MAN WHO DID THIS, OKAY?
SO ANYTHING YOU TELL THEM CAN HELP.
I DON'T KNOW.
WELL, WAS HE A TALL GUY OR A SHORT GUY?
KIND OF TALL, MAYBE.
MM-HMM.
DID HE COME UP ON YOU
ALL OF A SUDDEN
OR MAYBE YOU NOTICED HIM EARLIER?
HE JUST CAME UP ALL OF A SUDDEN.
WHEN ARE MY MOM AND DAD GETTING HERE?
YOU SAID THEY WERE COMING.
THEY'RE ON THEIR WAY.
THEY'RE GOING TO GET HERE
AS SOON AS THEY CAN.
( sighing )
YOU HAVEN'T GOTTEN OFF THE SURGICAL FLOOR YET?
WE'RE BACK ON THE SURGICAL FLOOR.
IT'S THEIR FAVORITE.
THEY'D LIKE TO OBSERVE AN OPERATION
IF THAT'S AT ALL POSSIBLE
SOMETHING IN THE OPEN-HEART VARIETY.
SETTLE DOWN, NOW, CARTER, THIS WON'T KILL YOU.
IS, UH, SHE, YOU KNOW, UH...
PRETTY WELL OUT OF IT?
NO, NOT AT ALL.
SHE JUST HAS A TENDENCY TO DOZE OFF... UNANNOUNCED.
RIGHT. WELL, CARRY ON.
I'M AWAKE.
JUST PLAYING POSSUM.
I'M SICK OF MEETING PEOPLE.
CAN WE GET OUT OF HERE?
I DON'T KNOW WHERE WE'D ALL FIT.
OH, NOT THEM, US.
ONCE THE IMPLANT'S IN PLACE
WE'LL REPAIR THE PERICRANIUM.
WE'LL SUTURE THE FLAP.
AFTER PATRICK'S HAIR GROWS BACK
YOU'LL NEVER KNOW WE WERE IN THERE.
EXCEPT HE'LL BE ABLE TO HEAR.
YEAH. WE'LL ACTIVATE THE DEVICE IN A FEW MONTHS.
SO, UH, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME A MINUTE.
UH... HE SEEMS EXCELLENT.
OH, YEAH, YEAH, HE'S TERRIFIC.
HE'S VERY AGGRESSIVE.
AGGRESSIVE?
WELL, I MEAN, UM...
AS IN ACCOMPLISHED.
SO, UM
I GUESS YOU TRIED EVERY OTHER OPTION FOR PATRICK, HUH?
WE'VE DONE THE HEARING AIDS
INTENSIVE ORAL TRAINING
SPEECH TRAINING
LOOKED INTO SPECIAL TEACHERS
SPECIAL SCHOOLS.
WE KNOW THIS ISN'T A CURE.
NO, NO. BUT... MAN
HE'LL BE ABLE TO HEAR A RANGE OF SOUNDS.
MR. AND MRS. SHIMAHARA?
HI. HERE YOU GO.
WE'LL TAKE HIM DOWN TO PRE-OP IN A BIT
BUT I THOUGHT IN THE MEANTIME...
ALL RIGHT. I'LL SEE YOU.
THERE'S MY BOY.
HEY, PATRICK, HEY, BIG GUY.
IS THIS OKAY?
YOU'RE NOT TOO COLD?
NOT TOO COLD.
THIS IS A BIT BETTER VIEW, I THINK.
AT MY AGE, ANYTHING VERTICAL WILL DO JUST FINE.
SO HOW DOES IT FEEL TO HAVE 100 BIRTHDAYS?
DOWNRIGHT APPALLING.
I'M SO OLD, I CAN PRACTICALLY REMEMBER
WHEN THIS RIVER RAN THE OTHER DIRECTION.
THAT'S RIGHT. THAT'S RIGHT, THEY CHANGED IT.
MY HUSBAND, EVERETT, USED TO LOVE THIS RIVER.
STARING DOWN AT IT
FROM 20 STORIES HIGH.
HE WORKED IN ONE OF THESE BUILDINGS HERE?
BUILT THEM.
CONSTRUCTION SPREE AFTER THE FIRST WAR.
EVEN WORKED ON THE CHICAGO BOARD OF TRADE BUILDING.
WE DID REAL WELL.
SENT EVERY CHILD TO COLLEGE
WHETHER THEY WANTED TO GO OR NOT.
WELL, THEY MUST HAVE APPRECIATED IT.
THEY SEEM PRETTY DEVOTED.
FAMILY SHOULD BE.
SOME ARE MORE THAN OTHERS.
MY MOM AND DAD, THEY, UH...
THEY TEND TO TRAVEL QUITE A BIT.
OH, DON'T TELL ME YOUR SAD TALE.
I HEAR ENOUGH OF THAT
AT HAPPY VALLEY.
"MY KIDS HATE ME."
"I HATE MY KIDS."
"MY SON NEVER VISITS ME."
ON AND ON.
GIVEN THAT YOU NEVER KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO GET
EVERETT AND I WERE DARN LUCKY IN WHAT WE BEGOT.
WELL, I SUPPOSE WE SHOULD BE HEADING BACK.
THEY'RE ALL TERRIFIED I'M GOING TO DIE
BEFORE THEY GET THIS PICTURE TAKEN.
( laughing ): OKAY.
DOUG.
MMM.
ANDY STILE'S MOM AND HER BOYFRIEND...
ARE YOU THE ONES WHO HELPED WILSON?
YEAH.
I'M JUDY STILES, ANDY'S MOTHER.
THIS IS CARL DAYTON.
WE'RE VERY SORRY.
WE DIDN'T THINK IT WOULD TAKE THIS LONG
TO MAKE ALL THE ARRANGEMENTS.
WE WANT TO SEE WILSON.
HE COULD PROBABLY USE A FAMILIAR FACE.
I THINK HE MIGHT BE SLEEPING.
I WANT TO SEE HOW HE'S DOING.
WE WANT TO TALK TO HIM.
WELL, HE HASN'T SAID VERY MUCH.
THE POLICE WERE HERE EARLIER.
WHAT'D HE TELL THEM?
HE SAID HE COULDN'T REMEMBER ANYTHING.
PLEASE...
HE WAS THE LAST PERSON TO SEE MY SON.
ALL RIGHT.
OKAY. FOR A FEW MINUTES.
ALL RIGHT.
HEY, WILSON.
WILSON, SOME PEOPLE WHO KNOW YOU
WANT TO SEE YOU.
WHAT?
HI, WILSON.
HOW YOU DOING?
I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED.
THAT'S OKAY, SWEETIE.
YOU BOYS SKIP SCHOOL AGAIN?
CARL...
IF THEY DIDN'T GET INTO SO MUCH TROUBLE...
HOW MANY TIMES DID I HAVE TO WARN...
YOU'LL NEVER HAVE TO DO IT AGAIN!
SORRY.
WE SHOULDN'T HAVE SKIPPED.
I'M REALLY SORRY.
I THINK WE NEED TO GO.
ALL RIGHT.
YOUR MOM AND YOUR DAD ARE GOING TO BE HERE
REAL SOON.
I KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO BE JUST FINE.
HEY, IT'S OKAY, WILSON.
IT'S OKAY.
SHH.
PATIENTS ALWAYS POSTPONE BEFORE HOLIDAYS.
NOTHING LIKE SURGERY
TO MAKE FRUITCAKES A GOOD IDEA, HUH?
RIGHT.
SO I CAN FIT IN REESE NEXT TUESDAY.
AREN'T YOU CONCERNED ABOUT HIS AGE?
HE DOESN'T FIT THE F.D.A. REQUIREMENTS.
IT'S BEEN LOWERED TO 18 MONTHS.
BUT HIS RESIDUAL HEARING IS STILL HIGH.
HE'S RIGHT ON THE BUBBLE, BUT WE CAN PUSH THAT.
LOOK, HERE'S THE THING.
WE KNOW IT WON'T IMPROVE
SO THE SOONER HE CAN ORIENT HIMSELF TO A HEARING WORLD
THE BETTER, RIGHT?
OH, YEAH. YEAH, RIGHT.
SO LET'S PUT REESE BENTON ON MY SCHEDULE
FOR A COCHLEAR IMPLANT NEXT TUESDAY A.M.
GOOD. GOOD, GOOD.
HOW WE DOING?
PETER, YOU KNOW ALEX BABCOCK?
YEAH, ANESTHESIOLOGIST.
Kotlowitz: HOW'D WE DO?
KID SAILED THROUGH PRE-OP.
FENTANYL ORALET, A LITTLE VERSED
PARALYZED AND INTUBATED IN A SNAP.
Kotlowitz: HOW'D THE PARENTS DO?
Babcock: THEY COULD HAVE USED A COUPLE OF LOLLIPOPS THEMSELVES.
Kotlowitz: OKAY, PETER...
SO I'M GOING TO IMPLANT
THE ELECTRODE DIRECTLY OUT OF THE LINEA TEMPORALIS
AND THEN, I'LL PUT THE MICROPHONE HOLDER
RIGHT BEHIND THE EAR.
I'M GOING TO INJECT LIDOCAINE
AND I'M GOING
TO MAKE A FLAP TWO CENTIMETERS FROM WHERE I INSERT THE DEVICE.
I'M GOING TO CUT THROUGH THE MUSCLE AND PERICRANIUM
SO THE FLAP WILL COME RIGHT OFF THE SKULL.
ALEX, YOU GOING BACK TO ASPEN FOR CHRISTMAS?
NO. TOO MANY SNOWBOARDERS.
FELT LIKE I WAS PART
OF AN OBSTACLE COURSE.
PETER, CAN YOU SEE ALL RIGHT?
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
I DON'T WANT YOU TO MISS ANYTHING HERE.
HERE WE GO.
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING OUT OF BED?
LOOKING FOR THE BATHROOM.
OH, I'LL TAKE YOU TO IT.
NO, I FOUND IT.
ALL RIGHT, THEN.
I'LL TAKE YOU TO YOUR BED.
YOU'RE LOOKING BETTER.
ARE YOU FEELING BETTER?
WILSON, WHAT IS IT?
IS SOMETHING WRONG?
I SHOULD HAVE TOLD THE POLICEMAN.
THEY'RE GOING TO KEEP ASKING ME, AREN'T THEY?
WELL, THEY WANT TO FIND OUT
WHO DID THIS.
IF YOU REMEMBERED ANYTHING
I CAN GO AND GET THE DETECTIVE.
NO.
WILSON, WHEN YOU CAME IN HERE
YOU SAID THERE WAS A MAN CHASING YOU.
HE WAS WHITE.
HE SEEMED TALL, BUT I GOT ON MY BIKE RIGHT AWAY.
DID YOU KNOW THIS MAN?
HAD YOU SEEN HIM BEFORE?
WE'D SEEN HIM THERE EARLIER
AND WE'D SEEN HIM BEFORE IN THE PARK
WHEN WE'D GONE THERE TO PLAY.
AND IF YOU SAW THIS MAN AGAIN, WOULD YOU RECOGNIZE HIM?
I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE.
DO I HAVE TO TALK TO THE POLICEMAN AGAIN?
WHEN ARE MY MOM AND DAD COMING?
DON'T WORRY, THEY'LL BE HERE.
Jeanie: HEY, CAROL?
COPS HAD TO LEAVE.
THEY'LL BE BACK IN A LITTLE BIT.
THEY'VE GOT YOUR BIKE AT THE STATION.
THANKS, JEANIE.
Greene: YOU SURE IT'S THIS ROOM?
NO, BUT I WAS IN HERE EARLIER.
ANYWAY, I WAS SAYING, IT'S A RANDOMIZED
DOUBLE-BLIND MULTI-CENTER STUDY
FUNDED BY ONE OF THOSE HOO-HA BIOTECH COMPANIES.
THE DRUG IS FOR THE TREATMENT OF FRACTURE PAIN?
MM-HMM. COMPARING IT AGAINST ACETAMINOPHEN WITH CODEINE.
HOPEFULLY, IT WILL COME UP MORE EFFECTIVE
WITH FEWER SIDE EFFECTS.
A COLLEAGUE OF MINE
IS COORDINATING IT FROM ATLANTA.
YOU WANT ME TO CONDUCT A STUDY AT COUNTY GENERAL.
I KNOW KERRY'S DOING THE STERNAL SAW STUDY.
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT WANT TO OVERSEE THIS ONE...
IF YOU'RE GAME.
I'M GAME. WHY NOT?
Morales: HEY, DOC...
NEED SOME HELP?
HEY, DAVE, I WAS JUST HELPING DR. LEE.
TRYING TO FIND HER EARRING.
THAT'S OKAY.
I'M GOING TO CHECK THE DESK.
THANKS, MARK.
ISN'T THAT A NURSE'S JOB?
THEY WERE BUSY REPLENISHING ALBUTEROL
AND MIXING IPRATROPHIUM.
I WAS TRYING TO HELP IN AN EMERGENT SITUATION.
WHO ACTUALLY INJECTED THE MAGNESIUM?
I DID.
DID YOU VERIFY DOSAGE WITH NURSING?
NO.
WHEN DID YOU REALIZE YOUR MISTAKE?
THE PATIENT WENT INTO RESPIRATORY ARREST AT 1534--
14 MINUTES INTO
THE MAGNESIUM INJECTION.
Anspaugh: CONTINUE, DR. CORDAY.
ENDOTRACHEAL INTUBATION WAS PERFORMED.
HEART RATE DROPPED TO 30.
THE PATIENT RECEIVED I.V. CALCIUM AND ATROPINE.
A TRANSVENOUS PACING WIRE WAS PLACE, CAPTURED AT 1556 HOURS.
WHO WAS YOUR SUPERVISING RESIDENT?
DR. BENTON.
WHO LEFT YOU UNSUPERVISED.
WITHIN MINUTES, SHE HAD THE PATIENT INTUBATED
AND ON A TRANSVENOUS PACEMAKER.
BECAUSE OF HER QUICK RESPONSE
THE PATIENT RECOVERED FULLY WITH NO CARDIAC, RESPIRATORY
OR NEUROLOGICAL SEQUELAE.
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT
THAT WE LOOK AT THE OUTCOME HERE.
Corday: THANK YOU, DR. BENTON
BUT I'M NOT LOOKING TO YOU FOR DEFENSE OF MY ACTIONS.
IN FACT, I FEEL THAT M & M HAS BECOME A FORUM TO PLACE BLAME
COVER UP MISTAKES
OR BE GRATEFUL THAT THERE'S NOT A LAWSUIT.
I WOULD ARGUE THAT, ACTUALLY
WE SHOULD EMBRACE OUR MISTAKES
AND LEARN FROM THEM TO IMPROVE THE SYSTEM.
I BELIEVE I MADE THIS MISTAKE
NOT BECAUSE I WAS UNTRAINED OR INCOMPETENT
BUT BECAUSE I WAS EXHAUSTED, HAVING BEEN UP FOR 36 HOURS.
IF WE REALLY WANT TO CUT DOWN ON OUR ERRORS
WHY DON'T WE, FOR EXAMPLE, ALLOW ON-CALL HOUSE OFFICERS
TO LEAVE BY 12:00 NOON ON THE POST-OP DAY?
WHY DON'T WE ESTABLISH A NIGHT FLOAT SYSTEM?
AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS WORK WITH AIRPLANES
FOUR TO SIX HOURS A DAY--
NO MORE THAN TWO HOURS WITHOUT A BREAK.
NOW, WHY?
BECAUSE HUMAN LIFE IS AT STAKE.
YET WE ALLOW SURGICAL INTERNS
TO WORK 36 HOURS WITHOUT SLEEP. WHY?
BECAUSE WE'VE ALL HAD TO DO IT?
BECAUSE THE SURGEONS BEFORE US HAVE HAD TO DO IT?
WELL, OLD SCHOOL TRADITION MAY BE WONDERFULLY NOSTALGIC
BUT IT IS CLEARLY
NOT IN THE BEST INTEREST OF OUR PATIENTS.
NOW, IF YOU DISAGREE WITH ME
WHY DON'T YOU ASK YOURSELF NEXT TIME YOU FLY...
DO YOU REALLY WANT THAT MAN IN THE CONTROL ROOM
TO BE ON HIS 36th HOUR?
SHE'S FULL OF PISS AND VINEGAR, ISN'T SHE?
MM-HMM.
FOR AN OLD LADY.
BECAUSE SHE'S AN OLD LADY.
EVERYBODY LOOK AT THE CAMERA LENS.
IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE CAMERA LENS
YOU'RE IN THE PICTURE.
OKAY, AND SMILE.
Photographer: OKAY, I JUST NEED MRS. JOHNSON'S CHILDREN
INSIDE FOR A QUICK PICTURE.
SHE'S DONE IT AGAIN.
MRS. JOHNSON?
MRS. JOHNSON, YOU PLAYING POSSUM AGAIN?
COME ON, RUTH.
TIME TO WAKE UP NOW.
RUTH?
MRS. JOHNSON?
OH, GOD. KATE, GO GET A GURNEY AND A CRASH CART NOW.
I DON'T WANT TO BOTHER YOU
BUT THE BOYS' CLOTHES ARE ALL MIXED UP.
ANDY'S-- HIS BOOTS ARE MISSING.
AND I'VE GOT WILSON'S SNEAKERS.
OH, I AM SO SORRY.
IF YOU'LL JUST HAVE A SEAT
I'LL CHECK FOR YOU, OKAY?
CONNIE, HAVE YOU SEEN WILSON'S BELONGINGS BAG?
MAYBE CHECK UNDER THE TRAUMA GURNEY.
HEY, CONNIE, I NEED TO TALK TO WILSON.
COULD YOU GIVE US A MINUTE?
SURE.
THANKS.
WILSON, WAKE UP.
HEY, WILSON.
MY PARENTS HERE?
NOPE, NOT YET.
BUT I GOT TO THINKING AND...
ANDY WAS PROBABLY YOUR BEST FRIEND, RIGHT?
SOMETIMES.
WHENEVER YOUR PARENTS WOULD GO OUT OF TOWN ON BUSINESS
YOU'D STAY OVER THERE?
IT'S CLOSER TO SCHOOL.
WE COULD RIDE OUR BIKES.
SO YOU PROBABLY SHARED EACH OTHER'S TOYS?
MAYBE EVEN COATS, GLOVES, BOOTS?
ANDY WOULD NEVER LET ME WEAR HIS BOOTS.
KIND OF TOO SMALL, ANYWAY.
REMEMBER WHEN YOU WERE TRYING TO TAKE THEM OFF?
RIGHT.
SO, IF HE NEVER LET YOU WEAR HIS BOOTS
THEN HOW COME YOU WERE WEARING THEM
WHEN THE PARAMEDICS BROUGHT YOU IN HERE?
'CAUSE WE HAD A BET AND I WON.
A BET?
TO SEE WHO COULD RIDE FASTER
FROM HIS HOUSE TO THE PARK
AND I WON.
AND WHOEVER WON GOT TO WEAR THE BOOTS, RIGHT?
YEAH, BUT HE WOULDN'T GIVE THEM TO ME.
I RODE FASTER AND HE KNEW IT.
HE WASN'T BEING FAIR.
ARE THESE YOURS OR ANDY'S?
NEITHER.
THEY'RE MY DAD'S.
WILSON, DID YOU PUT THESE INTO A GUN?
NO. THOSE ARE EXTRAS.
I ALREADY HAD SOME IN THE GUN.
AND WHEN ANDY DIDN'T GIVE YOU THE BOOTS...
YOU POINTED THE GUN AT HIM?
AND YOU SHOT HIM?
NOT TO HURT HIM OR ANYTHING.
JUST TO SCARE HIM.
WE HAD A BET
AND I WON-- IT WAS FAIR AND SQUARE.
YOU DO KNOW THAT YOU HURT HIM, RIGHT?
LOOK, ALL I MEANT WAS TO GET THE BOOTS.
YOU CAN'T GO BACK ON A BET, THAT'S NOT RIGHT.
ANDY KNOWS THAT.
WHAT DID YOU DO WITH THE GUN, WILSON?
I DROPPED IT DOWN A DRAINPIPE WHEN I GOT ON MY BIKE.
SEE, THE THING IS, NONE OF THIS WOULD HAVE HAPPENED
IF THAT CAR HADN'T HIT ME.
YOU'LL LET ME KNOW WHEN MY PARENTS GET HERE, RIGHT?
YEAH, WILSON, I'LL LET YOU KNOW.
OH, NURSE HATHAWAY?
CAN YOU PLEASE NOT TELL MY DAD I THREW HIS GUN AWAY.
HE'LL GET REALLY MAD.
YOU'RE TELLING ME HE COULD GO HOME TODAY.
WE DON'T HAVE PRISONS FOR EIGHT-YEAR-OLDS.
I'M TALKING JUVENILE HALL, DETENTION CENTER.
NOT FOR KIDS UNDER TEN.
CAN AN EIGHT-YEAR-OLD EVEN UNDERSTAND HIS RIGHTS?
OR CONSEQUENCES OF HIS ACTIONS?
WELL, OF COURSE HE CAN.
HE SHOT ANDY SO HE COULD GET THE BOOTS, RIGHT?
HIS INTENT MIGHT HAVE BEEN JUST THAT, NOT TO KILL.
BUT HE DID KILL HIM!
DOESN'T THAT COUNT FOR SOMETHING?
YEAH, BUT WHAT?
MURDER TWO, MANSLAUGHTER?
THE KID IS EIGHT YEARS OLD.
ISN'T IT UP TO THE STATE ATTORNEY?
YES, BUT HE'S GOT TO BE ASSESSED
HE HAS TO HAVE A PSYCH EVALUATION.
AND SOCIAL SERVICES HAS TO DETERMINE
WHETHER HE CAN DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN RIGHT AND WRONG.
OF COURSE HE CAN.
WHY WOULD HE MAKE UP A STORY ABOUT THE MAN CHASING THEM?
DOES HE HAVE ANY AWARENESS OF WHAT HE'S DONE?
HAS HE SHOWN ANY REMORSE?
HE'S SORRY HE TOSSED THE GUN.
AFRAID HIS FATHER'S GOING TO GET MAD.
DOES THAT COUNT?
YOU ARE TELLING ME THE POLICE, THE COURTS, PSYCH
SOCIAL SERVICES-- NOBODY KNOWS WHAT TO DO WITH WILSON GEARY?
PRETTY MUCH.
WHAT A MESS.
ANYTHING ELSE YOU WANT ME TO DO?
NOT RIGHT NOW.
I'LL PUT HER THINGS IN HERE.
THANKS, CHUNY.
I'LL GO TALK TO THE FAMILY.
APPARENTLY, SHE WAS SUCKING ON A HARD CANDY
AND IT LODGED IN HER WINDPIPE.
WE WERE ABLE TO EXTRACT IT AND HER B.P. IS NOW 128/90.
HEART RATE'S 70. VITAL SIGNS ALL APPEAR NORMAL.
YOU MEAN SHE'S NOT DEAD? NO, NO.
SHE'S NOT DEAD.
SHE'S ASLEEP
BUT DEFINITELY NOT DEAD.
CAN WE SEE HER?
LIKE I SAID, SHE'S ASLEEP, SO...
DR. LEE? I'M REALLY SORRY.
WE LOOKED EVERYWHERE
AND WE COULDN'T FIND YOUR EARRING.
OH. WELL, THANK YOU ANYWAY FOR LOOKING.
DID YOU LOSE AN EARRING?
YES. NOT EXPENSIVE OR ANYTHING
BUT SENTIMENTAL VALUE.
OH?
YES, I WAS ENGAGED ONCE.
OH.
TO A REALLY LOVELY MAN, AND HE WAS KILLED
IN A FREAK HORSEBACK RIDING ACCIDENT.
ACTUALLY, WE WERE ON A BRIDGE
AND THE HORSE SPOOKED AND...
OH.
ANYWAY, HE GAVE THEM TO ME.
I'M SO SORRY.
IT WAS A LONG TIME AGO.
( chart clatters )
( sighs )
YEAH. DAVID KOTLOWITZ, PLEASE.
PETER BENTON.
HEY, DAVID. HEY.
UH, LISTEN, I, UM...
I WANTED TO POSTPONE REESE'S OPERATION.
WELL, I MEAN, YOU KNOW, HE'S BARELY WITHIN THE AGE RANGE
AND HE'S GOT A FAIR AMOUNT OF RESIDUAL HEARING
AND THE TECHNOLOGY'S CHANGING ALL THE TIME.
I JUST, YOU KNOW...
NO, YEAH. I JUST SAW HIM.
HE'S DOING FINE.
MM-HMM.
YEAH, WELL, UH... YOU, TOO.
HAVE A GREAT HOLIDAY, ALL RIGHT?
MY PARENTS CALLED ON THE WAY FROM THE AIRPORT.
MY DAD HAS A PHONE IN HIS CAR.
( sighs ): YOU'RE MAD AT ME ABOUT SOMETHING, AREN'T YOU?
NO.
WHEN MY MOM GETS MAD
SHE JUST STANDS AT THE KITCHEN SINK AND DOES DISHES
AND SHE DOESN'T SAY ANYTHING.
I'M NOT MAD, WILSON.
I'M SAD ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TO ANDY.
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SO COOL
IF HE WAS IN ONE OF THESE OTHER BEDS.
DO YOU KNOW WHAT IT MEANS TO BE SAD?
WILSON, DO YOU KNOW WHAT IT MEANS
TO HAVE DONE SOMETHING WRONG?
CAROL... HIS PARENTS ARE HERE.
THANKS, CONNIE.
( no audio )
( footsteps approaching )
WHAT, YOU WAITING ON A BUS?
( light laughter )
I WISH I WAS ON A BUS GOING ANYWHERE.
OH. HOW'D IT GO WITH ANSPAUGH?
WELL, NO CRIME, NO PUNISHMENT.
SEEMS WHAT I DID WASN'T TERRIBLY WRONG
THEREFORE NO NEED TO PENALIZE ME
THEREFORE NO NEED TO EXAMINE A SYSTEM
THAT HAS SERVED SO MANY SO WELL FOR SO LONG.
YEAH, THEY SEEMED PRETTY SHOCKED
( chuckles ): THAT YOU ACTUALLY SUGGESTED IT.
AS WERE YOU.
YEAH, WELL... IT WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN MY CHOICE.
WELL, YOU AND I NEVER MAKE THE SAME CHOICES, DO WE?
NO.
WELL, PETER, WE COULD NOW.
COME ON, PETER.
THIS SHOULD BE OVER.
SOME WOULD ARGUE THAT IT ALREADY IS.
WE HAVEN'T BEEN ALONE TOGETHER
FOR WEEKS.
I NEED TO FOCUS ON MY SON RIGHT NOW.
WE COULD BOTH DRAW UP A LIST OF REASONS WHY
BUT WHY DON'T WE JUST PUT IT DOWN TO FAULTY CONSTRUCTION?
A CASUAL RELATIONSHIP
HAS TO GROW INTO SOMETHING OR IT DIES.
IT'S NOT LIKE I HAVEN'T WANTED TO SEE IT GROW.
IT'S JUST THAT I...
I DON'T HAVE IT TO GIVE RIGHT NOW.
YEAH.
I UNDERSTAND THAT
WHICH IS WHY I THINK
MAYBE, UM...
WE'LL BE BETTER OFF AS FRIENDS.
I'LL SEE YOU AROUND, OKAY?
NOW, YOU PROBABLY DIDN'T KNOW IT
BUT WE'VE BEEN OFF WORK FOR 20 MINUTES.
WANT TO GET SOMETHING TO EAT--
MAYBE ROSEBUD OR MORTON'S, JOHNNY D's?
HOME, BATHTUB, BED.
THAT'S MY GIRL.
( chuckles )
I MET THEM TODAY, YOU KNOW.
SEEM LIKE PERFECTLY NORMAL PEOPLE.
FATHER'S A SALES REP-- OFFICE SUPPLIES.
MOTHER WENT TO DALLAS WITH HIM
'CAUSE SHE WANTED TO VISIT HER FAVORITE AUNT.
WILSON'S PARENTS?
I THOUGHT THEY'D HAVE TO BE MONSTERS
TO RAISE A KID WHO COULD DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
WELL, THAT WOULD EXPLAIN EVERYTHING, WOULDN'T IT?
PARENTS BEAT THE KID OR THEY YELL AT HIM
OR STARVE HIM SO HE ENDS UP KILLING HIS BEST FRIEND.
THEN WHY DID HE DO IT?
STUFF HAPPENS.
AN EIGHT-YEAR-OLD SHOOTS ANOTHER EIGHT-YEAR-OLD
AND YOU SAY, "STUFF HAPPENS"?
YOU GOT A BETTER ANSWER?
NO. NO, I DON'T... I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE HIS GENES ARE SCREWY OR...
HIS PARENTS SEEM NICE, BUT THEY IGNORE HIM.
MAYBE HE PLAYS TOO MANY VIDEO GAMES
LIKE EVERY KID IN AMERICA.
IT'S...
DOESN'T IT BOTHER YOU THAT THERE ISN'T ANY REASON?
NO, IT BOTHERS ME THAT YOU CARED ABOUT HIM
AND YOU BELIEVED IN HIM AND NOW YOU FEEL BETRAYED.
I DON'T FEEL BETRAYED.
I FEEL... SCARED.
I MEAN, IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT CAUSES IT
HOW DO YOU KEEP IT FROM HAPPENING?
ARE WE ANY DIFFERENT FROM THAT COUPLE?
THEY DIDN'T SEE IT COMING.
WOULD WE SEE IT COMING?
YEAH, YOU BRING A CHILD INTO THIS WORLD
AND YOU THINK THAT THEY'RE HELPLESS
BUT ACTUALLY, I THINK IT'S US.
I THINK WE'RE THE ONES THAT ARE HELPLESS.
WE PROBABLY ARE, BUT...
THAT'S WHY YOU LOVE THEM AS MUCH AS YOU CAN
AND YOU TEACH THEM AS BEST YOU CAN
AND THEN YOU WISH THEM GOOD LUCK.
WHAT DO YOU SAY?
HOME, BATH, BED?
HMM?
YEAH.
YEAH.
IF YOU DON'T HAVE ANY PLANS...
IF YOU'RE NOT BUSY.
HAVING A DRINK SOUNDS GREAT. CAN WE ALSO EAT SOMETHING?
DINNER. ABSOLUTELY.
I HAVE A MEETING WITH ANSPAUGH FOR ABOUT 20
THEN I'LL BE BACK.
BUDDY, WE'RE GOING HOME. WHAT'S YOUR STORY?
CATCHING UP ON PAPERWORK.
WELL, CURFEW'S AT 11:00.
HA, HA, HA. VERY FUNNY.
( phone ringing )
E.R.
HOW ABOUT THIS SNOW?
YEAH, IT'S PRETTY GREAT, HUH?
HAVE A GOOD SHIFT.
ALWAYS.
WHOA, YOU GOT TO HELP ME. MY WIFE'S HAVING A BABY!
WHAT?
( woman groaning )
HANG ON, HANG ON.
SHE'S NOT DUE FOR TWO MORE WEEKS.
( moaning )
SOMEBODY LIED.
OH, GOD, LOUIS, HELP ME. HELP ME!
WE'RE GOING TO HELP YOU.
GET MARK AND A GURNEY.
DO SOMETHING, PLEASE.
MA'AM, MA'AM, I'M A DOCTOR.
( grunting )
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, I GOT IT.
BRING HER UP.
GOOD. YOU KNOW HOW TO BREATHE.
THIS IS OUR FOURTH.
THEN I GUESS IT'S COMING.
WHEN DID IT START SNOWING?
HE'S CROWNING.
WE'RE NOT DUE FOR TWO WEEKS.
MUST BE ALL THE EXCITEMENT.
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
I'M LOUIS, LOUIS BERNUCCI.
MY WIFE GILDA.
NICE TO MEET YOU. YOU READY TO PUSH?
ON THE NEXT ONE, I WANT YOU TO PUSH, OKAY?
READY, AND-- ONE, TWO, THREE. PUSH!
GOD!
IF IT'S A GIRL
I WANT TO NAME IT AFTER NANA.
RUTH?
RUTH JOHNSON.
RUTH JOHNSON BERNUCCI.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
OH, IT SOUNDS GOOD TO ME.
YEAH? YEAH.
YEAH? OKAY, GILDA, I LIKE THAT.
HANG IN THERE. YOU'RE DOING GREAT. GOOD. THIS ONE.
PUSH. THIS IS IT.
PUSH! PUSH, PUSH, PUSH.
GOD!
OKAY, HEAD'S CLEAR...
SHOULDERS...
THERE WE GO.
A BEAUTIFUL BABY GIRL.
OKAY, GOOD, LET'S WRAP HER.
SUCTION.
OKAY, THERE'S YOUR MAMA.
( laughing )
( all laughing )
THERE'S YOUR MOM.
THERE'S YOUR MAMA.
OKAY, CLAMP.
WANT ME TO JUST PULL IT UP?
( baby crying )
OKAY, GOT IT?
EXCELLENT. OKAY.
OKAY, MOM, WE'RE JUST GOING TO TAKE HER OVER HERE
FOR JUST A MINUTE, JUST A MINUTE.
COMING RIGHT BACK TO MOM.
OKAY, LITTLE ONE.
OH, YOU DID IT.
GOOD JOB.
HERE WE GO.
( baby whimpering )
SHH, SHH, SHH, SHH.
I KNOW IT.
I KNOW.
YOU ARE SO BEAUTIFUL.
GOOD LUCK, RUTH JOHNSON.
HMM.
